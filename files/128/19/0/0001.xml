Meeting of 1.  The Prime Minister said that a difficult situation had arisenCommoaweattn over the representation of Pakistan at the Meeting of Common-Prime , wealth Prime Ministers, which was to open on 4th January. AtMinisters. the last minute the Prime Minister of Pakistan had said that he(Previous would not attend the Meeting unless the question of KashmirReference: could be added to the agenda. The agenda for such meetingsCM. (50) 76th had always been determined by common agreement between allConclusions, attending; and it was known that the Prime Minister of IndiaMinute 4.)        would not be willing that the Kashmir question should be added.In any event, a dangerous precedent would be created if a disputeof this kind between two Commonwealth countries were set down for formal discussion at a meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters. These considerations had been put to the Prime Ministerof Pakistan. It had also been explained to him that it was our intention that there should be informal conversations aboutKashmir, during the period of the Meeting, and that arrangements would if possible be made to associate two or three of the other commonwealth Prime Ministers with those conversations. ThePrime Minister of Pakistan had, however, asked for an assurance that, even if the discussions were informal, all the other PrimeMinisters would join in them. No such assurance could be given:partly because the Prime Minister of India would be unwilling toagree that this question should be discussed, even informally, by representatives of all members of the Commonwealth, and partly because it was likely that the representatives of some Common-wealth countries would be unwilling to participate in such discussions.The prospect must therefore be faced that the Prime Minister of pakistan might hot attend the Meeting.The Cabinet agreed that a most unfortunate impression wouldbe created if the Prime Minister of Pakistan absented himself fromthe Meeting, and that every effort should be made to persuade him to come. Would he not be satisfied with an assurance that thePrime Ministers of the United Kingdom, Canada and australia would join with him and the Prime Minister of India in informal discussion of the Kashmir question? It was pointed out that nofirm assurance could be given to that effect until the assent of thePrime Minister of India had been given, and that this could not now be obtained until he arrived in London. On the other hand,it was thought that the representatives of South Africa and Ceylonwere unlikely to be willing to participate in such discussions; andthere would be advantage in informing the Prime Minister of pakistan at once that this consideration alone made it impossibleto give him the assurance for which he was asking.The Cabinet-Took note of the position, and invited the Prime Ministerto send a further message to the Prime Minister of pakistan in the hope of persuading him to attend the forth-coming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 84thConclusions,Minute .2.)40027-12. The Foreign Secretary said that, after the efforts of theCease-Fire Committee had ended in failure, no further progress hadbeen made in United Nations discussions on Korea. The forth-coming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers would provide an opportunity to formulate an agreed Commonwealth view onthe next step to be taken, and to influence future United Statesaction in the United Nations. He had no doubt that the disputemust eventually be settled through negotiation with the Chinese,and the chances of reaching a settlement would be prejudiced ifthe United States Government now insisted on introducing aresolution in the Assembly naming China as an aggressor nation.But the military situation must be stabilised before it would bepossible to negotiate with the Chinese with any prospect of success,and it now seemed less likely that the United. Nations forces inb2
4. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theForeign Secretary (CP. (50) 322 and 323) on the general scopeof the Japanese Peace Treaty and on claims for compensation by individuals, and a further memorandum by the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence.. (CP, (50) 318) on the security aspectsof the Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that it was still uncertain. whenthe negotiation of the Peace Treaty would begin, and whether itwould be in general terms or would contain detailed provisions;In either event a decision was required on the points enumerated in paragraph 7 of CP. (50) 323, and he invited his colleagues to approve the recommendations in the succeeding paragraph ofthat paper.In discussion the following points were made: (a) It would be undesirable to negotiate a Peace Treaty for japan without inviting the People&apos;s Government of China to take part. The Cabinet agreed that the need for extending such an invitation should be taken into account in the light of future politicaldevelopments.(b) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat the Australian and New Zealand Governments were stillinclined to favour the inclusion in the Treaty of economic controlsto prevent future Japanese aggression, but further discussion might lead them to a general acceptance of our own view.(c) It was pointed out-that the measures against politicalsocieties and the release of war criminals (paragraph 8 (b) (viii) and(x)) could not be enforced in practice. It was also doubtful whether?the United States Government could be persuaded to accept theproposal for restricting Japanese ship-building capacity (para-graph 8 (/)). It was, however, agreed that an attempt shouldbe made to secure the inclusion of these provisions in the Treaty,\    The Cabinet- &apos; &apos;, \(1) Approved the recommendations in CP. (50) 323.3. the Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 14th December, he had held further consultations with the UnitedStates and French Governments regarding the terms of the replyto be sent to the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers. The other two Governments had been unwilling to accept his suggestion that the preliminary meeting of officials ofthe Four Powers should be restricted merely to the preparationof an agenda for the Ministerial meeting; and he had been obliged-to accept a compromise proposal that the officials should examinethe problems&apos; mentioned in the reply to the Soviet Governmentwith a view to finding an acceptable basis for a meeting of foreign ministers and recommending an agenda. The three governments had then despatched identical notes to the Soviet Government;and the Soviet reply had now been received. This, though it waslong and reiterated many of the arguments in the original. note,accepted the proposal for a preliminary meeting of officials thoughif was now the turn of the Soviet Government to suggest that their task should be limited to drawing up the agenda for the ministerial meeting. The Soviet Government were also unwilling that the officials should meet in New York. An alternative meeting place would have to be suggested; and the Foreign Secretary said that hewas disposed to suggest Vienna. He was taking steps to ascertain the views of the United States and French Governments; and,when he had obtained these, he would inform the Cabinet of thelines of the further reply which was to be sent to the SovietGovernment.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
heSecurityaspects.\Individual The Foreign Secretary said that in CP. (50) 322 he hadclaims. recommended that we should not press for the inclusion in theTreaty of an obligation on Japan to pay individual claims for damage to property outside Japan or for personal injury or ill-treatment wherever suffered. The value of the Japanese assets which we held amounted to only  1$ million, and there was no?respect of obtaining satisfaction of these claims from Japan. Themited States Government, who had been in possession of a much;-V:-&quot; greater -amount of Japanese assets, had distributed these among; r&apos; sufferers from Japanese action, and this would to some extentv ^strengthen opposition here, particularly among exrprisoners-of-war,.to our abandoning the claims. The United States Government,however, who had borne the heaviest burden in supporting theJapanese economy, would be most unlikely to agree to the inclusionof these claims in the Peace Treaty, and an attempt to include them would in addition open the way to further large claims from theChinese and other nations.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed that these claims should not be pressed. We had already made paymentstotalling about  30 millions for damage done by the Japanese in burma and Malaya. The Japanese assets in our control shouldbe set against the payments we had already made: we could not afford to make further payments from the Exchequer.In discussion there was generai agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s recommendation. It was, however, suggested that therewould be some dissatisfaction at the abandonment of the claims,and that the terms of a public statement would have to be con-sidered carefully, particularly since some ex gratia payments hadbeen made to Army officers and men in respect of property lost in the Japanese campaign. The Colonies had also submitted largeclaims for damage by the Japanese.The Cabinet-(2) Endorsed the recommendations made by the foreign secretary in CP. (50) 322.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of defence and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to prepare and submit to the Cabinet for approval a draft of a public; statement, embodying the decision not to pursue theclaims.The Foreign Secretary said that the report by the Chiefs ofStaff annexed to CP. (50) 318 recommended that japanese rearmament should start after the Peace Treaty had been signed.It now appeared, however, from a recent statement by general macarthur (about which we had not been consulted) that theUnited States Government might be prepared to allow some degreeof rearmament in advance of the conclusion of the Treaty. he proposed to seek clarification from the United States Government,and to discuss the problem with them in the light of the views expressed by the Chiefs of Staff.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the conclusionsof the Chiefs of Staff were based on the view that we could not afford to lock up military strength in Japan for an indefinite period after the Treaty had been signed. In isolation Japan did not representa military threat. Her aggression in the late war had been made possible because she had had access to resources on the Asiaticmainland, and had possessed a first-class navy.In discussion the possibility was raised that the Communistsmight secure control in Japan, with the result that her rearmamentwould be to our direct disadvantage.  The Foreign Secretary said
Legalof KoreasConflict(previous reference:CM. (50) 60thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. On 18th September, 1950, the Cabinet had asked thatthe practical aspects of the international status of the Koreanconflict should be further examined by the Departments concerned.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 307) reporting that, as a result of this inter-departmental examination, it was thought that the balance of practicaladvantage lay on the side of treating such a conflict as an inter-national police operation rather than as a war. This would,however, involve certain difficulties in our domestic law whichwould have to be further examined.The Attorney-General said that this question had become more complicated and more urgent as a result of Chinese intervention in Korea. The position of persons in this country who tradedwith China presented many legal difficulties. Further investigation of the domestic implications of a decision to regard such conflictsas police operations might reveal the need for legislation empowering the King to declare, by Order-in-Council, that some or all of theconsequences of being at war should follow the undertaking ofpolice operations under the auspices of the United Nations.In discussion there was general agreement that the questionwhether such conflicts should be regarded as police operations or as wars would depend on Where the balance of advantage lay.This could not be finally determined until the implications in domestic law of regarding such conflicts as police operationshad been further explored. The amending legislation whichwould be required might give rise to difficulties in Parliament,The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (50) 307.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for officials ofthe Departments concerned, to examine the implicationsin domestic law of a decision to regard the Koreanconflict as a police operation: and asked that a report should be submitted to the Cabinet on the nature ofthe legislation which would be required.industrial disputes.KemsleyNewspapersand TownClerks.6. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda: CP. (50) 313: by the Minister of Labour, explaining thatcertain chapels of the National Union of Journalists had applied to the High Court for an order of mandamusdirecting him to refer to the National Arbitration Tribunala dispute between them and Kemsley Newspapers, Ltd.CP. (50) 316: by the Minister of Labour, explaining that theSociety of Town Clerks had reported to his Ministrydisputes with twenty-five local authorities about the salaryarid conditions of service of their Clerk, with a view tothese disputes being referred to the Tribunal;;CP. (50) 321: by the Attorney-General on the legal aspects ofthe claim by the Society of Town Clerks that the disputesthat he was advised that the strength of Communism in Japan was unlikely to increase, but he undertook to investigate the pointfurther. .-     The Cabinet-;  (4) Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 318.(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain from the UnitedStates Government a clarification of their views on the timing of Japanese rearmament.
with local authorities should be handled under theprovisions of the National Arbitration and Conditions ofEmployment Order, 1940 (No. 1305).The Minister of Labour said that the revised salary scales,which certain local authorities were refusing to accept., had beensuggested by the Joint Negotiating Committee for Town clerks and District Council Clerks, which was not a Whitley Counciland was not in a position to make recommendations binding onthe local authorities. It would be unfortunate if a position wasreached in which suggestions put forward by the Joint negotiating committee were imposed on local authorities by the national arbitration Tribunal. While he would feel bound in the ordinary way to refer to the Tribunal a trade dispute between employersand a union, when efforts at negotiation had broken down, he felt justified in refusing to refer to the Tribunal the disputes between certain Town Clerks and their local authorities.The Attorney-General said that, until the High Court had given a decision on the Kemsley Newspapers case which was now pending,the Minister of Labour should not refer either that dispute or thecases of the Town Clerks to the Tribunal. If the Court decidedthat the Minister of Labour ought to have referred the KemsleyNewspapers case to the Tribunal, he thought that the minister would be Obliged to refer the cases of the Town Clerks as well.The Minister of Heath said that the negotiations between theTown Clerks and local authorities, which had led to the recommenda-tions put forward by the Joint Negotiating Committee, had not been of a satisfactory character; nor, in his view, had the findings of theJoint Negotiating Committee been of a nature which justified a reference to arbitration. The Government would have to considerwhether the machinery set up under the National Arbitration andConditions of Employment Order was to be used to coerce localauthorities. It was arguable that an elected local authority shouldnot be compelled to accept arbitration machinery against its will.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Minister ofLabour ought not at this stage to refer either the Kemsley Newspaperscase or the cases of the Town Clerks to the National arbitration tribunal, and that the position should be further reviewed in thelight of the decision of the High Court on the application for anorder of mandamus. &apos;the Cabinet-Took note of CP (50) 313, 316 and 321.Production ofGroundnuts in. East Africa.(previous reference: ! &apos;CM. (50) 83rd.Conclusions, &apos;7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (50) 324) and by the Minister of Food(CP. (50) 326) on the futuis of the East African Groundnut scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion on 7th December, the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, the Minister of Food and he had considered thefinancial^aspects, of this problem, in consultation with the governor of Tanganyika and the Chairman of the Overseas Food Corporation.They had decided to recommend that farming should continue,as planned, on the land already felled in Kongwa and Uramboand that 60,000 acres should be developed in the Southern Province.The main arguments in favour of the-development of a further60,000 acres were that this would cost little more than the completeabandonment of the scheme and that the development could be expanded to 105,000 acres after two or three years if it were foundthat the scheme was likely to be a financial success. If the cabinet approved the proposals in his memorandum he would send to the
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,- 2nd January, 1951.Minister of Food certain amendments to the draft White Paperappended to CP. (50) 326, which would have the effect of setting out the facts and financial implications more clearly.There was genera! agreement that the balance of advantage lay in continuing the scheme on the lines proposed in CP. (50) 324.Complete abandonment would have serious consequences In Tanganyika and would harm the prestige of this country in allthe African Colonies.    -&apos;    The Cabinet- *       -(1) Approved the proposals for proceeding with the 60,000acres scheme, on the fines and subject to the conditionsproposed in CP. (50) 324. $(2) Agreed that the Minister of Food should present a white paper in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (50) 326,subject to amendments to be notified to him by theChancellor of the Exchequer,(3) Agreed that the Minister of Food should assume direct responsibility for the activities of the Queensland-British Food Corporation.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Food should arrange for the&quot;.- drafting of the necessary legislation to amend the overseas Resources Development Act.
