Coal. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister(Previous of Fuel and Power (CP. (51) 3) on the attitude which the government reference: should adopt towards the questions of wages, pay for SaturdayCM. (50) 83rd working, additional paid holidays and supplementary pensions,Conclusions, which would arise in negotiations between the National Coal BoardMinute 7.) and the National Union of Mineworkers which were to begin on10th January, 1951.Negotiations The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the immediate problem with the over the next three or four months was to secure such additionalNational output of coal as would prevent large-scale unemployment inUnion of industry.   There remained the longer-term problem of reversingMineworkers. the trends which were threatening to bring the output of coal wellbelow estimated demand in the next few years. The most obviousmeans of increasing output in the near future was further Saturdayworking,and he thought that the Government should be favourably disposed towards suggestions which had been made for increasingthe incentive to Saturday working, provided that they did not prejudice full working on other days of the week. The Portalaward had been discouraging to men on day rates and he accordingly proposed that, probably at the end of any short period duringwhich special payments were made for Saturday work, the lower-paid day rate men should receive an increase of about 5s. Od. aweek, which would cost about Ad. a ton of coal. He stronglyrecommended the approval of the supplementary pensions scheme,put forward by the Board, which would help to retain men in theindustry. The highest rate of pension and gratuity could not beearned for a long time and the full effects, therefore, lay in thefuture. As workers in a large sector of private industry had two weeks&apos; paid holiday, the case for making a similar concession tothe miners was strong. Since, however, the concession would inevitably involve some loss of coal production it was desirableto postpone it until the present difficulties regarding output had been overcome. The National Union of Mineworkers would probablyview with considerable disfavour the suggestion that the second week&apos;s holiday with pay should not be given until output had reached a figure of 215 million tons.The Cabinet first considered the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards the forthcoming negotiations between theNational Coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers.There was general agreement that no effort should be made tosecure a postponement of these negotiations. The Governmentshould not purport to instruct the National Coal Board how itshould conduct the negotiations, but, in view of the imperative need to increase coal output and the Government&apos;s responsibilities in parts of the field, it was necessary to give clear guidance to theBoard. Thus, by arrangement, the National Coal Board consulted the Minister of Fuel and Power before making an increase in coal prices, and it was desirable that the Board should know the orderof magnitude of the concessions which the Minister was preparedto see reflected in increased prices. Moreover, by statute, anysupplementary pensions scheme had to be approved by the Minister.There was general agreement that the concessions to be, negotiated by the National Coal Board should not, in the aggregate,cost appreciably more than Is. Od. per ton of coal, and that in noevent should the concessions cost more than Is. 3d. per ton. this information should be conveyed by the Minister to the Chairmanof the Board confidentially, for his guidance, but should not becommunicated to the National Union of Mineworkers.Several Ministers felt than an effort should be made to secure a reasonably enduring settlement with the National Union of Mine-workers. A series of concessions to the miners had an unsettlingeffect on other workers. In this connection, importance was attachedto the suggestion in paragraph 11 of CP. (51) 3 that the National
Lower-paid workers.SaturdayWorking.Paid Holidays.supplementary pensions.Union of Mineworkers should regard the claims to be negotiatedas the only substantial ones to be made in 1951.)As regards the lower-paid workers on day rates, the general view of Ministers was that an increase in pay, not exceeding 55. Od.a week, should be made at once and should not be deferred untilthe end of the winter. The Portal award had had the effect ofgiving much smaller increases in pay to the lower-paid men thanappeared to be reasonable, and the National Union of Mineworkershad recognised this by giving first priority, in their claims, to anincrease of 2s. Od. a shift in the wages of lower-paid workers. Theefforts which were being made to increase output in the next fewmonths would, by increasing the earnings of men on piece rates,still further widen the gap in earnings between the men on dayrates and those on piece rates. It was undesirable that the day-ratemen should leave the industry because of poor pay, since theyformed the pool from which face-workers were recruited. Whilethe difficulties of securing a wages structure which gave the present day rate man a greater incentive were not under-estimated, therewas general agreement that the National Coal Board should make an effort to revise the present wages structure in a manner whichwould relate the pay of the day-rate worker to the output of the pitat which he was working.Considerable doubt was felt about the desirability of a claim,fostered by the National Union of Mineworkers, that double time should be paid to men who had already done five shifts and workedon Saturdays. Few men had the stamina to be able to work sixshifts a week for a prolonged period. The implication that Saturdayworking should be paid at double time might have serious reper-cussions in the rest of industry. The measures to be taken to increaseSaturday working during the present fuel crisis were, however,primarily matters for the Board to consider.The National Reference Tribunal had recently rejected theminers&apos; claim for a second week&apos;s annual holiday with pay, becauseof the serious loss of coal and the increase in the price of coal whichwould result. While it was true that about 60 per cent, of industrial workers enjoyed two weeks&apos; holiday with pay, many of these industries worked a five-and-a-half day week. The fact that aconsiderable loss of output might be involved would make it relativelyeasy for the National Coal Board at this juncture to defer negotiations on &quot;the subject. The claim should be put back for further discussion at some more appropriate time, rather than rejected outright.Meanwhile, the National Coal Board could be considering whether,when the national economy of the coal industry could afford this concession, the extra week&apos;s holiday could be made dependenton a minimum number of attendances by the miner.The Cabinet then discussed the scheme of supplementary pensions outlined in the Annex to CP. (51) 3.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in company withthe Minister of Agriculture, the Minister of Fuel and Power and theMinister of National Insurance, he had recently met representativesof the Trades Union Congress on the questions of supplementary pensions for miners, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 7th December. The representatives of the Trades Union Congresshad said that it was no part of the functions of the T.U.C. to expressviews on the merits of supplementary pensions schemes for particular industries, and that they did not wish in any way to discourage theGovernment from giving favourable consideration to proposals put forward by the National Union of Mineworkers. At the sametime, they could give no assurance that, in the event of a supple-mentary pensions scheme for miners being introduced, there wouldnot be strong pressure for pensions schemes from the Unions inother socialised industries.   The attitude of the Unions did not, of
course, finally dispose of the question of discrimination in favourof the miners, since it would be open to the responsible Ministerto refuse to approve a scheme relating to an industry other thancoalmining, if that were adopted as Government policy. he believed that this policy was practicable if any scheme for minerswas confined to underground workers. Even if the scheme were confined to underground workers he saw objection, for reasonselaborated in the report of a working party of officials (S.I.(M) (51) 1)which would be considered shortly by the Socialisation of industries committee, to a number of the proposals outlined in the annex to CP. (51) 3. Thus, the lump sum payments appeared to be too high: it was very doubtful whether provisions should be madefor widows&apos; pensions (bearing in mind that these related to naturaldeaths and not to industrial accidents): and a scheme of pensionspayable on retirement due to ill-health would almost certainly lead to serious abuses. It was possible, at this stage, to indicatesome of the conditions on which the Minister would feel obligedto insist as a condition of his approval of any scheme, and the matter could be examined in detail by the Socialisation of industries committee. All that was necessary at this stage was for the national coal Board to indicate to the Union that they were ready to negotiate a supplementary pensions scheme for underground workers.In subsequent discussion on supplementary pensions, thefollowing points were made: (a) While a scheme confined to coalminers working under-ground did not present serious difficulties, any scheme coveringall manual workers in the mining industry would almost certainlyspread to many other industries. Workers in industries which did not have supplementary pensions schemes would then demand that the rates of benefit under the national scheme should beincreased and, if this were granted, it would lead to protests fromthose who were contributing to supplementary pensions schemesthat they could not afford the high rates of contribution which theywere now expected to pay to the national and supplementaryschemes. The ultimate result might be the disruption of thenational scheme.(b) At the same time doubt was expressed whether it wouldbe practicable to confine any scheme to underground workers inthe coalmining industry. Difficult problems would arise in regardto underground workers who were injured and had to take surfacework, and about the period of service which was to count in thecase of surface workers who at some later stage in their careerbecame underground workers. The proposal to confine thescheme to underground workers would lead to much disagreementamong miners and would both delay the introduction of the schemeand lead to its advantages being obscured by controversy.(c) It was very desirable that the Committee which was toexamine the implications of supplementary pensions schemesgenerally should be set up without delay. It was understood thatthe Trades Union Congress had now withdrawn their objection tothis enquiry, and the findings of the enquiry were urgently required before further commitments were undertaken in this field.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the National coal board should indicate willingness to enter into negotiations withthe National Union of Mineworkers with a view to working out ascheme confined to underground workers. Meanwhile, the socialisation of Industries Committee would examine, in the lightof the report of the working party annexed to S.I.(M) (51) 1, theprinciples which should guide the Minister to be communicatedto the National Coal Board in deciding whether to approve any scheme for underground workers put forward by the national coal Board after agreement with the Union.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should not oppose the openingof negotiations on wages and conditions of employmentbetween the National Coal Board and the NationalUnion of Mineworkers.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should informthe Chairman of the National Coal Board, in confidence,that from the point of view of the national economy theGovernment would not wish the Board to grantconcessions which, in the aggregate, substantiallyexceeded a cost of Is. Od. per ton of coal.(3) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should not offer any opposition to the grant of an immediate increase in the pay of the lower-paid workers on day wage rates, not exceeding 5s.&apos; Od. a week, and should encourage the National Coal Board to explore thepossibility of working out a wages structure whichwould give workers at present on day wage rates agreater interest in increased output.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should invitethe National Coal Board to suggest to the NationalUnion of Mineworkers that the claim for a second week of paid annual holiday should be deferred for the timebeing.(5) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power might indicate to the National Coal Board that he would not raise objection to the opening of negotiations between theNational Coal Board and the National Union of mineworkers for a supplementary pensions scheme,provided that it was restricted to underground workers and conformed to principles, to be communicatedlater to the Board, which the Minister would wish tosee observed in any scheme submitted for his approval.(6) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the socialisation of Industries Committee to settle the principles referredto in (5) above, and to arrange for their communication to the National Coal Board, through the Minister of fuel and Power.(7) Agreed that the National Coal Board should be expectedto secure the acceptance of the immediate introductionof trained Italian coalminers as part of the settlementnow to be negotiated.(8) Invited the Lord President to ascertain that the PrimeMinister was in agreement with the above conclusions.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,Sth January, 1951.Italian There was general agreement that the National Coal BoardWorkers. should be asked to ensure that the admission, without delay, of skilled Italian coalminers should be a condition of the completionof negotiations for some increase in the pay of the lower-paid workers and the initiation of negotiations for a supplementary pensions scheme for underground workers.Management. Attention was drawn to the extent to which coal outputdepended, not wholly on improved conditions for miners, but ongreater efficiency of management. Reference was made in thisconnection to experiments, recently described in the Press, whichhad been made at Bolsover Colliery, under which, after a dis-appointing start, substantial improvements in coal output appearedto have been achieved.
