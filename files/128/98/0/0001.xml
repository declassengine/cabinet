CC(90) 7th Conclusions



ECONOMIC

STRATEGY



The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the

Exchequer on economic strategy (C(90)2).



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that over the last two or

three years there had been both an investment boom and a fall in

the savings ratio.   Both had been unusual in their magnitude,

and for the two to occur together was probably without

precedent.   Ihey had contributed to a faster than expected rise

in demand, and a deterioration in the current account. There

were now however convincing signs that the economy was slowing

down.   In the last three months the volume of retail sales had

been only 1.5 per cent higher than a year earlier.   Progress was

also being made in reducing the current account deficit, with a

rise in non-oil exports of 15 per cent over the last year. For

1990, he expected domestic demand to fall slightly, by about 1

per cent.   Gross Domestic Product might rise by rather less than

1 per cent.   Recession over the year as a whole should be

avoided, but the uncertainties were such that it was not

possible to rule out a fall in output over short periods. High

wage settlements increased the risk of recession and of rising

unemployment.   Rising food prices, the latest increase in

mortgage rates and the higher than expected level of the

community charge had all contributed to worsen the outlook for

inflation.   He expected that the Retail Price Index (RPI) would

rise for a time, and it was unlikely to came down very far for

some months.   There was a clear risk that his forecast of a 6.5

per cent rise in the RPI between the last quarters of 1989 and

1990 could be exceeded.   For 1990, therefore, the prospect was

for an unattractive combination of low growth and high

inflation.   The following year should however be the mirror

image of 1990, with growth rising and inflation falling. The

current account position already looked more favourable than it

did a few months ago, and the improvement in it should be at

least as great as he had forecast in the Autumn Statement and

perhaps greater.   He now expected the Public Sector Debt

Repayment (PSDR) in 1989-90 to be a good deal lower than the

 12.5 billion forecast in the Autumn Statement, for a number of

reasons including continued overspending by local authorities,

lower Corporation Tax payments as a result of higher company

expenditure on investment and the success of the Government&apos;s

policy on personal pensions.   The PSDR might decline a little

further in 1990-91, because of the introduction of independent

taxation, the full effect of the reform of National Insurance

Contributions, and the slowing down of the economy.   The budget

was moving more quickly than had earlier been expected frcm

surplus to balance, even without discretionary tax reductions.

Continuing, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was

wrong to draw a pessimistic conclusion frcm the unattractive

prospects for 1990.   If the Government persevered in reducing

inflation, the longer-term prospects for the economy were very

good, as it benefited frcm the supply side improvements of the

last few years, and the Government would be able to resume its

policy of tax reductions.   But it was essential that there

should be no change of policy new and in particular that the

Budget should be cautious.   It was right to get the difficult

remedial action over as quickly as possible, so as to open the

way for the subsequent recovery.



In discussion the following were the main points raised:



a. There was an overwhelming case for a cautious Budget.

It was widely expected and necessary for maintaining

confidence.   In particular, the Government must

demonstrate its determination to control inflation, a task

which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was right to make his

first priority.



b. There was also a strong case for a tight fiscal stance.

It could be argued that the aim should be that the budget

should still be in surplus by the end of the following

year, rather than in balance.   The Budget should be

considered frcm the point of view of its effect on interest

rates, which could come under pressure if German rates rose

as a consequence of monetary unification.   One advantage of

the tight financial policies followed so far was that they

had more effect in restraining demand in the overheated

South East than in parts of the country where there was

still surplus capacity.   Hcwever, a further rise in

interest rates would be extremely damaging, especially

since the United Kingdom had to borrow abroad to finance

its current account deficit.   The United Kingdom&apos;s

vulnerability while it remained a borrower for this purpose

shewed the importance of cutting the deficit.   The worst

case of all would be to cut interest rates now, only to

have to raise them again a little while later. The

greatest risk to the Government was a loss of political and

economic confidence, which would have a devastating effect

on investment.



c. An increase in excise duties would raise the RPI and

this might in turn intensify wage pressures. Nevertheless,

the case for revalorisation at least was very strong, to

maintain the proper balance between direct and indirect

taxes.   The case was especially strong if the alternative

would be a decision not to index personal tax allowances,

to the disadvantage in particular of the lower paid. The

effect on the RPI would be unwound in 1991.   The excise

duties should however be considered separately. Same

changes in relativities could be desirable.   For example,



2

there was a case for an extra increase in the duty on high

strength lager, consumption of which contributed to the

problem of hooliganism.   It was anomalous too that this

lager, which was mainly imported, was taxed at a lower rate

than spirits, which were mainly produced in this country.

On environmental grounds there was a case for an increase

in petrol duty and the possibility of a switch from Vehicle

Excise Duty to higher duty on petrol might be re-examined.



d. It would be desirable, within a tight fiscal stance, to

target any concessions on groups which were being

particularly hard hit by other changes.   The prime example

was those who were specially affected by the introduction

of the community charge, such as one earner couples and

pensioner couples.   There was indeed a large group of the

Government&apos;s supporters, affected by high community charges

and high mortgage interest, whose allegiance must not be

lost permanently, although increasing tax relief on

mortgage interest would not be the right response. There

was a strong case for targeting seme help on the lower

paid, partly so as to exert a moderating influence on wage

demands.



e. Similarly, again within a tight fiscal stance, there

would be considerable advantage in modest concessions to

promote the Government&apos;s general policy objectives. There

was a case, for example, for providing more incentives for

savings.   The decline in the savings ratio had been one of

the most unfortunate developments in recent years. There

was also a case for more incentives for investment and

venture capital, to sustain the investment bocm which now

seemed to be coming to an end, and also for tax reliefs to

encourage training and the acquisition of qualifications.

Another concession that could be highly desirable would be

to remove employees&apos; liability to tax on child care

facilities provided by an employer.   However, it was

desirable that the Government&apos;s policy on child care

should be considered as part of its approach to supporting

the family as a whole.



f.   Experience in 1989 had borne out earlier warnings that

policy would be undermined by the growth of credit. The

greater difficulty of controlling the growth of credit,

compared with the time at which the medium term financial

strategy had first been launched ten years ago, was one

argument in favour of joining the European Exchange Rate

Mechanism when conditions were right.   lenders, including

overseas lenders, were still trying to encourage borrowing,

and the United Kingdom was new faced simultaneously with a

credit bocm and very high interest rates.   Direct controls

on lending, like those applied in Germany and Japan, should

be considered.   On the other hand, more recent statistics

showed that credit was already being satisfactorily

restrained.



g.   In seeking a tight fiscal stance, the importance of

mintaining discipline on the expenditure as well as the

revenue side of the account must not be overlooked.



THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that the

pessimism about immediate economic prospects must not be

exaggerated.   Ihe numbers in employment, and the standard of

living, were higher than ever before,   !here should be seme

growth in the economy in 1990 and it should accelerate in 1991.

These facts should be fully reflected in public presentation.

The Cabinet endorsed the approach to economic strategy set out

by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C(90)2.   In particular,

they reaffirmed the economic strategy and the central objective

of bringing down inflation, and agreed that economic policy

should remain prudent and cautious.



The Cabinet -



1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion.



2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take

account of the discussion in preparing his Budget.
