MINUTE 2        confidential Annex(12th November, 19^8 - 10.0 a. m. )The Cabinet discussed the issues raised inCs P5 (k-8) 25k regarding India&apos;s future relations with the^vious        Commonwealth.Jerence:5,(1+8) 67th At their meeting on 28th October they hadillusions,    invited the Lord Chancellor,  in consultation with theite 3) Attorney-G-eneral and the Solicitor-General, to considerwhether the constitutional proposals which had &quot;been dis-cussed with the Prime Minister of India during his recent visit in this country would (i) constitute an adequatelegal basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Common-wealth;    and (ii) provide an adequate basis for resistingclaims by Commonwealth countries under the most-favoured-I nation provisions of existing treaties.      They now had before them a note by the Prime Minister (CP. (i+8) 25k)covering a summary of these proposals in the form in which&apos;they had finally been put forward by the Prime Minister ofIndia, together with an Opinion which the Lord chancellor had prepared,  in consultation with the Law Officers, on thetwo questions remitted to him.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had reached theconclusion that, if the Indian Constituent Assembly adopted a constitution establishing India as a &quot;sovereign demo-cratic republic&quot; on the lines at present contemplated, theeffect would be to extinguish His Majesty&apos;s sovereignty inIndia, which would no longer be a part of His Majesty&apos;sdominions either under Indian law or under United Kingdomlaw.      If it were thereafter desired to continue to treatIndia for all purposes as a member of the Commonwealth,claims by foreign countries under the most-favoured-nationclauses of existing commercial treaties could only be resisted before an international court with any hope ofsuccess if it was possible to point to a continuous and substantial tie between members of the Commonwealth after,as well as before, the repudiation of allegiance to TheKing.      In his view, the only matters of substance capableof creating such a tie were a de facto general acceptance by all civilised nations of the existence of the Common-wealth as a unit composed of nations bound together by afactual association of long standing, based up till now onthe common sovereignty of the Crown   and still continuing;and declarations by Commonwealt ^Governments that they wished to be regarded thus as &quot;gfe^ bound in a specialform of association&quot;.     These ties would not, however, besufficient in themselves unless they were reinforced by a true common citizenship throughout the Commonwealth;    and,on examination of the actual position,  it was clear thatthis condition was not satisfied.     He therefore thoughtthat, on a strictly legal view, it would not be safe to saymore than that, if preferential treatment were continued toIndia after the enactment of a constitution on the lines atpresent contemplated, more or less plausible arguments couldbe put forward in opposition to a, claim by some foreign country that it was entitled to the same treatment under amost-favoured-nation clause.      The Attorney-General was ingeneral agreement with this Opinion, though he was moredoubtful whether even a plausible case could be put forward.It v/as, however, difficult to estimate what view v/ould betaken by an international court in considering a wholly new&quot;set of constitutional issues.
In discussion, emphasis was laid on thefundamental difference between the attitude of Indiaand Eire respectively towards their future relationship with the Commonwealth. &apos;   Eire Ministers were determined to put Eire&apos;s secession from the Commonwealth beyondauestion;    the Government of India, on the other hand,were anxious to devise means, compatible with the formof her constitution, by which India could continue tobe a member of the Commonwealth, and paragraph 10 of annex A of CP. (1+8) 25k gave hope that in time a closerform of association could be achieved.      The problem was how to secure the recognition, under international law,of a Commonwealth group which might include States nolonger subject to The King&apos;s sovereignty.      The diffi-culty arose from the fact that,  at present,  inter-national law recognised only &quot;His Majesty&apos;s dominions&quot;or &quot;foreign countries&quot;, and the question therefore was whether the International Court could be brought to admit the existence of a third form of associationintermediate between these.      If the Indian constitu-tion was enacted in its present form, it would no longer be possible to support the case for India&apos;s continued membership of the&quot;Commonwealth by reference to TheKing&apos;s sovereignty;    a solution would have to be sought by creating and establishing a conception of customaryassociation which would recognisibly distinguish her from a foreign State.      The Commonwealth was nota clearly defined international entity;    and it might bepossible in this way to persuade the international court to accept the idea of its changed constitutionalstructure.    As a practical issue, the United KingdomGovernment would be faced in due course- with thenecessity of deciding whether to take the risk of continuing to treat India as a member of the Common-wealth;    some time would no doubt elapse before any foreign country pressed a claim for most-favoured-nation treatment before the International Court, andthere would be time to elaborate the conception of anew form of constitutional relationship.The point was made that, before any final decisions were reached on this question, it would benecessary to consider carefully their possible reper-cussions within the Commonwealth.      A decision to con-tinue to treat India as a Commonwealth country, afterher repudiation of allegiance to the Crown, would nodoubt be strongly criticised both here and in other commonwealth countries, and there was some risk that india&apos;s example might be followed elsewhere in theCommonwealth.      Before any decision was taken, there-fore, it would be necessary to consult other Common-wealth Governments and to discuss the whole question with.the Opposition.      The immediate question was whether anything further ought to be said to the PrimeMinister of India at this stage.      While no advantage would be gained by legal controversy with Indianlawyers on this issue, the wording of paragraph 10 of annex A of CP. (h8) 25k suggested that Pandit Nehrushould in fairness be informed of the legal advice which the United Kingdom Government had received inthis matter.  .   It was agreed, therefore, that the LordChancellor&apos;s Opinion should be sent to the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in India, who should be instructed to convey its substance personally to pandit nehru.
