NO CIRCULATION RECORDCM. (US) 78th Conclusions(6th December, 1%8  -   at 11.0 a. m,)LYNSKEY TRIBUNAL;   EVIDENCE BY MINISTERS(Previous Reference:   C.M*(48) 67th Conclusions, Minute 2)The Prime Minister said that Mr. Stanley -would shortlyhe giving his evidence before the Tribunal under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Lynskey -which was enquiring into certain allegationsagainst Ministers and officials of the Board of Trade and otherDepartments. . It was likely that in his evidence Mr. Stanley wouldmention a number of Ministers, apart from those who, like Mr. Belcherand Mr. Key, had substantial evidence to give to the Tribunal.Was it necessary that every Minister whom Mr. Stanley might seektor involve in these matters should give evidence before theTribunal to rebut any insinuations which Mr. Stanley might make?An unfortunate impression might be created if numbers of Ministersappeared as witnesses before the Tribunal.    On the other hand, itwas most undesirable that any impression should be created that ministers whose names were mentioned in the course of the evidencewere reluctant to come forward to clear themselves of anyimputation which might have been brought against them.The Lord Chancellor said that he had considered thispoint and had already suggested to the Attorney-General that itmight be handled in the following way.    In his closing speech to -HieTribunal, when the hearing of evidence had been completed, the attorney-General should say that, in addition to the Ministers whohad attended to give evidence, various other Ministers had been mentioned incidentally in -Qie course of the evidence.   All of these
17 NJ)Ministers were perfectly ready to come before the Tribunal and answerany questions which might be put to them;   but the Tribunal mi$itfeel that it was unnecessary to trouble them tc do so.    the seministers placed themselves at the disposal of the Tribunal:   and itwas for the Tribunal to decide.    The Chairman might then say, inreply, that there was nothing in the evidence which called forany denial by these Ministers and that it was unnecessary for theTribunal to trouble ihem to appear in person.The Cabinet agreed that this aspect of the matter should be handled on the lines proposed by the Lord Chancellor.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.
