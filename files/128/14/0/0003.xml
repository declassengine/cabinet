(i+8) 59thlonclusions,finnte 4)The Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Prime Minister (C.P. (k-8) 2hk) on the natureof the constitutional relation between the various countries of the Commonwealth and the probablecourse of future constitutional changes in India andEire.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been clear for some time that the new Indian constitutionmight emerge from the Constituent Assembly in a form not fully consonant with the preamble to theStatute of Westminster, which described, themembers of the Commonwealth as &quot;united by a commonallegiance to the Crown&quot;.      He had therefore setup a small Committee of Ministers to re-examine thenature of the Commonwealth relationship and toconsider on what constitutional basis India mightremain within the Commonwealth,  if in the event she were unable to accept, the Grown as &quot;a symbol of free association&quot; in the Commonwealth.      Certainpapers which had been considered by this Committeewere annexed to CP. (1+8) 2i4.Ii..      The ministerial committee had approved the draft statement ofgeneral principles set out in the Appendix to annex III,  as a basis for the informal conversation which he had proposed to hold with other commonwealth Prime Ministers while they were inLondon for the recent conference.      In the meantime,two major developments had taken place:    first, the eire Government had announced their intention to repeal the^Executive Authority (External Relations)Act, 1936,  and discussions had shown that they were unwilling to put in its place any other constitutionallink involving any recognition of the Crown.Secondly, it had become clear that the new indian constitution would provide for the establishment ofIndia as a &quot;sovereign independent republic&quot;, andthat India would not be willing to accept The King&apos;sjurisdiction, even for the purpose of her external relations.      In his discussions he had been muchassisted by the helpful attitude adopted by therepresentatives of Canada, Australia and NewZealand, who had shown themselves greatly concerned to secure that India should remain within theCommonwealth.     Any proposals for a new form of constitutional link must be considered in relation,not only to its acceptability to the country concerned, but also to its effect on other membersof the Commonwealth;    and, in any further discussions, it would be essential to maintain the closest touch with the Governments of Canada,Australia and New Zealand.-1-
jndi a -   Bioouaoion turned first on the &quot;futurerclDtionohip of India -to the Commonw-oolth.j The Cabinet were informed that the PrimeMinister of India had made it clear, during recent discussions in London, that he was anxious to keepIndia within the Commonwealth,  if a constitutional&quot;basis could he found which would &quot;be acceptable to theConstituent Assembly;    and, as was shown by a reportfrom India published in the &quot;Times&quot; that morning,public opinion in India on this issue hod radically-changed in recent months.       During discussions which ministers had hod with Pandit Nehru, various suggestionshad been mode which, taken together, might constitute an adequate basis for India&apos;s continued membership ofthe Commonwealth in a form acceptable to Indian opiniongenerally.      The precise form of these suggestions was now being further studied by Pandit Nehru, but their general effect was as follows^      The King&apos;s sovereignty in India should be regarded as dormant, but notextinguished;    no United Kingdom legislation should boenacted to terminate The King&apos;s sovereignty over India,and this could therefore be revived by a unilateral acton the part of India at any time.      In statements to thuParliaments of the United Kingdom and India, an identical formula would be used to the effect that,under the new Indian constitution, His Majesty would not exercise any of the functions of sovereignty.      an historical link with the Crown would be preserved by the enactment, as Indian lav;, of Sections 1,  2 and 7 of theUnited Kingdom Indian Independence Act, 19U-7*      india would adopt the provisions of the British nationality act, 191+8, in so far as they related to India.      TheKing would conclude with the new President of India anagreement by which he would act as the President&apos;representative for the protection of Indian citizensin the United Kingdom, and the President would act asThe King&apos;s representative for the protection in india of Commonwealth citizens other than citizens of India.In countries where India maintained no separate diplomatic representation, the diplomatic protection of Indiancitizens would be undertaken by the diplomatic representatives of other Commonwealth countries.      TheKing would be regarded as the fountain of Honour for theCommonwealth,  and a new Commonwealth Order might be instituted, for which citizens of all commonwealth countries, including India, would be equally eligible.In all future legislation in India, care would be takento treat Commonwealth countries as a class apart fromall foreign countries.After further consideration, Pandit Nehru would inform the Prime Minister of the exact proposals onthese lines which he was prepared to put to his Government.Although there would be no desire to approach thisquestion in a purely legalistic spirit,  it was clearly desirable that,  as a first step, Ministers should be advised whether these proposals would togetherconstitute an adequate legal basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth and, in particular,I whether they would afford a basis which would enableI foreign Governments to claim most-favoured-nation treatment in respect of any privileges granted to Indiancitizens in other parts of the Commonwealth.
The Cabinet -Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultationwith the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, to consider whether theconstitutional proposals discussed with thePrime Minister of India would -(i)    constitute an adequate legal basis for India&apos;s continued membership of the Commonwealth;(ii)    provide on adequate basis forresisting claims by foreign countries under the most-favoured-notionprovisions of ex   :ting treaties.
