(48) 72 whichare not included in the open Minute(l) There had recently &quot;been signs that Soviet pressure wouldhe directed more towards Northern Italy and Spain and less towardsGreece and Turkey.      The Norwegian Government were also apprehensive of Soviet pressure.(2) The antagonism between clericalism and freemasonry in countries such as prance made it difficult to secure united support for a policy of democratic socialism in Europe.(3) In working out the new policy proposed by the foreign secretary,, account should be taken of the importance of Germany inthe European economy.(4) We should use United States aid to gain time, but ourultimate aim should be to attain a position in which the countries of western Europe could be independent both of the United States andof the Soviet Union.(5) It should be possible to recruit fairly rapidlyexperienced staff for service in an organisation on the lines ofthe war-time Political Warfare Executive,.(6) The campaign against Communist penetration of the tradeunions should continue.      The means of carrying on this campaignrequired careful consideration, since the Communists did not Y.rorkopenly and direct attack on them might do more harm than good,(7) The Home Secretary received periodical reports onCommunist and Fascist activities and his impression was that atpresent more danger was to be apprehended from Communists than
from Fascists.(8) It was suggested that some of the B. B. C.  staff hadCominunist sympathies and that this resulted in the distortion of news.
