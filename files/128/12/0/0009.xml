65CM. S (4SJ41Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (48) 8thConclusions,Minute 4-)1. At their meeting on 29th January the Cabinet had contem-plated that, before the debate on the Second Reading of the parliament Bill was resumed in the House of Lords, there shouldbe an exchange of letters between the Lord Privy Seal and theMarquess of Salisbury defining the conditions &quot;on which the Govern-ment were prepared to accept the proposal for discussions between representatives of the political Parties which would cover thequestion of House of Lords reform. It had subsequently beensuggested that it would be more convenient if these conditions werepublicly stated in the debate on the Parliament Bill; and theCabinet now had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (48) 37) covering the draft of a statement to be made by theLord Privy Seal when the debate was resumed.Some Ministers again expressed doubts about the expediency of opening any discussions on the controversial question of House ofLords reform. On this point, however, it was the general viewof the Cabinet that the Government would appear to be adoptingan unreasonable attitude, and would be likely to forfeit public sympathy, if. they refused to enter into any discussions on thissubject even for the limited purpose of seeing whether there was abasis for agreement between the Parties.The Cabinet then discussed the terms of the draft statement annexed to CP. (48) 37. The first of the conditions proposed inthis statement was that any discussion of powers should be ** limitedto ensuring reasonable time for the consideration of measures bythe Lords and for the discussion of differences between the two houses.&quot; The Cabinet were informed that, from informal consulta-tions which had taken place, it was known that the Marquess of salisbury would be reluctant to accept a condition in these terms.He would wish to contend that the House of Lords should be ableto delay Government legislation for a period long enough to enablethe forces of public opinion outside Parliament to be fully deployed,so that in the last resort the House of Lords could force a GeneralElection. The Government, on the other hand, were not preparedto extend the total period of one year and one month provided forthe passage of Government legislation in the Parliament Bill as atpresent drafted, and the only question which they were ready todiscuss was the allocation between the Commons and the Lords ofthe Parliamentary time available within that total period. So longas it was clear that the Government were not prepared to go beyond that point, in their discussions on the Bill, there was no specialadvantage in insisting on the formula set out in paragraph &quot;1 ofthe draft annexed to CP. (48) 37. The Prime Minister had suggested the alternative formula that the discussion on powers&quot; should be limited to discussion of the period for consideration of measures by the House of Lords&quot;; and that formula could beaccepted on behalf of the Government, if it were preferred by theOpposition leaders.It was, however, suggested that, from the point of view ofParliamentary tactics, it would be preferable not to reach a final agreement with the Opposition leaders, before the debate in theHouse of Lords was resumed, on the conditions on which the Govern-ment would be ready to enter into these discussions. It would bebetter that the Government should make their offer in public debate,even though they knew that one of their proposed conditions was not likely to be acceptable to the Opposition leaders. The debate could then be again adjourned, so that further consultations might takeplace with a view to reaching agreement on the one outstanding pointof difference. In those consultations agreement might be found onthe basis of the alternative formula which the Prime Minister had suggested; But, if agreement could not thus be reached, the Govern-ment would have strengthened their position by having made apublic offer to enter into discussions on conditions which would be generally regarded as reasonable. The Cabinet endorsed thissuggestion.34933-2B9
In further discussion it was pointed out that those participa-ting in the proposed discussions should refer for examination by theMembers of their respective Parties, not only proposals for the reform of the House of Lords, but any suggestions for the amend-ment of the Parliament Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement annexed to CP. (48) 37,subject to the addition of a paragraph to the following effect: &quot; 4. The different Parties should also examinewith their own Members any suggestions emergingfrom the discussions relating to the Parliament Billcontemplated under paragraph 1 above.&quot;(2) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in theterms of the draft, as so amended, in the adjourneddebate on the Second Eeading of the Parliament Bill inthe House of Lords that afternoon.(3) Took note that, if the Opposition Parties were unwilling toenter into discussions on the conditions set out in that statement, the debate might be adjourned in order that further consultations might be held with a view to reaching agreement on the proposed conditions; and authorised the Lord Privy Seal in that event to accept,in lieu of paragraph 1 of the draft statement annexed to CP. (48) 37, a paragraph in the following terms: &quot;1. So far as discussions of the powers of theSecond Chamber are concerned, they should belimited to discussion of the period for considerationof measures by the House of Lords.&quot;Heaifia-Ig/eEesHHce:IMiJmmfe 3.)2. On 29th January the Cabinet had agreed in principle thatit would be advantageous if an early debate could be held in theHouse of Commons on the attitude of the medical profession towardsparticipation in the National Health Service. The Cabinet were now informed that the earliest date on which this debate could conveniently be held was Monday, 9th February. It was proposedthat the debate should take place on a Government motion in thefollowing terms : &quot; That this House takes note that the appointed day forthe National Health Service has been fixed for 5th July;&quot; Welcomes the coming into force on that date of this measure, which offers to all sections of the community compre-hensive medical care and treatment and lays for the first time a sound foundation for the health of the people;&quot; And is satisfied that the conditions under which all the professions concerned are invited to participate are generousand fully in accord with their traditional freedom anddignity.&quot;In discussion it was asked whether Parliaments endorsement of the third paragraph of this motion might be held to prevent theGovernment from making any changes, between the date of the debate and the coming into operation of the Act on 5th July, in theconditions applicable to doctors entering the National health service. The Minister of Health said that he did not, in facf,contemplate making any further concessions to the doctors: but itwas the view of the Cabinet that the passage of a motion in these terms would not preclude the Government from making changes inthe scheme, if they thought fit, before 5th July.The Minister of Health said that the Government spokesmen,at the beginning and end of the debate, would be himself and theSecretary of State for Scotland.  He would, however, be glad if the
Prime Minister would also speak in the debate. The Prime ministers aid that he would hold himself in readiness to speak and would decide, according to the course of the debate, whether it was desirable that he should intervene.The Cabinet Agreed that a debate on the attitude of the medical pro-fession towards participation in the National health service should be held on 9th February on a government motion in the terms set out above.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(CP. (48) 38) covering a revised draft of the proposed government statement on the economic and other considerations to be taken intoaccount in wage negotiations.The question was first raised whether the Cabinet ought to reconsider their decision to issue a statement on these lines. TheMinister of Health asked whether any useful purpose was likely tobe served by the publication of a statement which contained nothing more than general priniciples and revealed the narrow limits withinwhich the Government intended to take positive action. Wouldsuch a statement be effective in counteracting the movement forincreased wages 1 Unless the Government were prepared to give a lead to private industry by adopting a policy of more active inter-vention in the sector of public employment, for which they had adirect responsibility, it might be preferable to avoid any announee-ment on the subject.Against this, it was pointed out that it had not so far beenpossible to devise an effective means of controlling inflationarymovements of wages and profits by direct Government intervention;and the Cabinet had not been willing to adopt the earlier suggestion for the appointment of a Central Appeal Tribunal to considerappeals from the decisions of the existing arbitral tribunals. Butthe situation was too grave for the Government to maintain a purelypassive role. Wage rates had risen steadily in recent months, andthere seemed to be no prospect of future stability. If the Govern-ment failed to give firm guidance at this stage, there was a grave risk that a state of uncontrolled inflation would develop. In thesecircumstances Ministers saw no grounds for modifying the decision taken at their previous meeting.The Cabinet next discussed the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (48) 38.In discussion, the following points were made: (a) The revised draft had gone too far in avoiding specificreferences to wages.(b) Some anxiety was expressed lest the statement should be interpreted as discouraging piece-work. It was pointed out,however, that the statement implied no criticism of higher earningsaccompanied by increased output.(c) It was agreed that the reference in paragraph 5 to the rateof interest paid upon the securities issued for the purchase of the nationalised industries should be omitted.id) The first sentence of paragraph 11 (a) appeared to be inconsistent with paragraph 13. Some doubt was also expressed about the advisability of including the second and third sentences of paragraph 11 (a). It was pointed out, however, that thesesentences were designed to dispose of an important misapprehension.(e) Attention was drawn to the practical difficulties involvedin applying the warning that increased wages would not in future be taken into account in settling controlled prices, etc., requiringGovernment action.The Cabinet next discussed the procedure for publication ofthe statement.   At their previous meeting they had agreed that it
should be made bv the Prime Minister in the House of Commons atan early date.  The Minister of Labour said that, on reflection, newas disposed to think that it might be preferable if the statement were first submitted, as an exposition of the Governments views,to the National Joint Advisory Council and published thereafter.This procedure would avoid the need for prior consultation withthe Trades Union Congress, the Federation of British industries and the British Employers&apos; Confederation on a question on which those bodies would clearly be unable, under the procedure suggested,to formulate their views in time to receive serious consideration by government.   Ministers considered, however, that this questionought not to be treated in a way which would suggest that it was amatter of concern only to industry. It was a document of.the widestsignificance, and no effort ought to be spared to make its presenta-tion authoritative and impressive.    Some doubt was expressedwhether the full statement was suitable, by reason of its length and complexity, for a Parliamentary statement.    Might it not besufficient to read a shorter version, or even merely to announce its publication as a White Paper?  It was not, however, thought thatthe length of the statement could be reduced without destroying thebalance of the argument; and it was felt that a brief reference tothe publication of a White Paper would fail to secure adequateattention for the statement in Parliament and in the country generally. It was therefore agreed that the statement should be readin full by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons onWednesday, 4th February: and that the Minister of Labour should communicate it to the National Joint Advisor Council on the same afternoon. Advance notice might be given to the HoUse of Commons,in answer to an arranged Question, of the Prime Ministers inten-tion to make the statement, and an indication given that it would necessarily be lengtlry.The point was made that Ministers should thereafter givesupport in their speeches to the principles set out in the statement the E economic Information Unit would provide additional material for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision that the Prime Minister shouldmake an early statement in Parliament on the questionof personal incomes, costs and prices in the general termsof the draft annexed to CP. (48) 38.(2) Invited the Prime Minister, in consultation with the lord president and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to settle the final terms of the statement.Steel Scrap.(previous reference:C.M.(47)95thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Supply on the steel scrap position and outlook (CP. (48) 25) andon the possibility of increasing the output of scrap from ship-breaking (CP. (48) 33).The Minister of Supply said that recently there had been aslight rise in stocks of scrap, and the Iron and Steel Board and theleaders of the steel industry were reasonabty confident that in theimmediate future steel production would not be limited by shortageof scrap. Deliveries of scrap to steel works in the last seven weeks of 1947 had been on average 6,300 tons a week higher than in thecorresponding period of 1946, and in 1948 he hoped to increase theoutput of scrap from ship breaking to some extent over the present rate of 180,000 tons a year, though he did not propose to attemptto reach as high a figure as 350,000 tons. As regards Germany, hewould try to increase from 35,000 to 50,000 tons a week the rateof import of booty scrap and further efforts would be made to obtaincommercial scrap. So far, however, it had been impossible to getGerman merchants to offer to execute the order for the delivery of100,000 tons of commercial scrap in the first quarter of 1948, though this had been agreed in principle by the German authorities, and he feared that it would be difficult to obtain offers until reasonable
69 CM. 9 (48y &quot;confideiice in the mark had been established. The United StatesGovernment were also interested in obtaining scrap from Germany,and he hoped that in concert with them we might be more successful than we had been hitherto.In discussion it was suggested that the optimistic attitude ofthe steel industry was unjustified. Stocks of scrap were stilldangerously low and the recent increase in deliveries from UnitedKingdom sources could be no more than a temporary alleviation ofthe difficulties. Moreover, in view of the changed world situation there could be no guarantee that we should in future be able to import scrap on a sufficiently large scale to meet the needs of an expanded steel industry, and it was urgently necessary to consider what steps should be taken to expand the production of pig iron inthe United Kingdom.Particular points made in discussion were : (a) Quadripartite talks on financial reform in Germany had recently started, but no guarantee could be given of any early settlement.(b) Further efforts should be made to obtain scrap from overseassources other than Germany, and the possibility of securing scrapfrom surplus military stores in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastareas should be fully explored.(c) The Admiralty were doing what they could to obtain themaximum amount of scrap from Malta.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange, inconsultation with the Minister of Supply, for a working party of officials to prepare a report on the problem ofsecuring adequate supplies of scrap and pig iron forthe United Kingdom iron and steel industry, both in1948 and in subsequent years.(2) Agreed that the proposed working party should consider towhat extent the Royal Dockyards should be used forshipbreaking.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd February, 1948.
