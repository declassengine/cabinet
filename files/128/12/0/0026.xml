181CM. 26 (43)   118Mr. Mackenzie 1. The Prime Minister said that by the end of the currentKing. month Mr. Mackenzie King would have held office as Prime Ministerof Canada for an aggregate period of nearly twenty-one years.Hitherto, the longest period of service of any British Prime minister had been that of Sir Robert Walpole, from 1721 to 1742.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers suggestion that heshould send on their behalf a&quot; telegram of congratulation toMr. Mackenzie King.Man-Power. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofEmployment Labour (CP. (48) 100) on the conditions of work of a number ofof Poles by Poles employed under Polish management in the printing of aPublishers of   newspaper called the Polish Daily.Polish Daily. The printing unions had complained that these Poles, whoincluded some still on the Reserve of the Polish Resettlement Corps,were employed under conditions which did not conform to thoseapproved in the industry for the printing of daily newspapers. Thepublisher maintained that he could not afford to observe the approvedconditions; and, in spite of protracted negotiations held on theinitiative of the Ministry of Labour, no agreement could be reached between the Unions and the publisher. A serious situation had now arisen, as the Unions were complaining that, by allowing these mento continue in this employment, the Government were breaking theirpledge that Poles would not be placed in employment in this country on conditions less favourable than those which would be offered toBritish workers, and were demanding that the Poles should be with-drawn from their employment with the Polish Daily. Unless this situation were remedied there was risk of unrest in those industries where Poles had been successfully placed, and greater difficulty in placing in employment Poles who were still in the Polish Resettle-ment Corps. It was therefore recommended that those of the Polesemployed by the publisher of the Polish Daily who were still onthe Reserve of the Polish Resettlement Corps should be recalled tothe Corps- even though this might have the result that the PolishDaily would cease to be published and that the Foreign Office andother Departments concerned would be deprived of a useful meansof circulating information to Poles in this country.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the War office had taken the view that their power to recall to the Polish Resettle-ment Corps a man who was still on its Reserve ought not to be used as a means of composing an industrial dispute. They had also considered that the recall of these men from the Polish Daily wouldstultify their impending appeal to the remaining members of the corps to accept civil employment in this country.As against this, it was pointed out that the power to recall tothe Corps would be invoked on the basis that it was necessary, not for the purpose of composing an industrial dispute, but of giving effect to the Government^ own pledge that Poles would not be placedin employment on conditions less favourable than those which wouldbe offered to British workers. And this action need not affect theforthcoming appeal, since it was not proposed to ask Poles to acceptemployment on conditions less favourable than those available toBritish workers.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the publisher of thePolish Daily could not be allowed to continue to contravene theagreements ruling in the printing industry regarding the conditionsapplicable to the printing of daily newspapers; and that, unless hewas prepared to conform to these agreements, the Polish labour which had been supplied to him should be withdrawn. It was,however, suggested that these agreements bore hardly on the publishers of small newspapers; and, with this in mind, the Cabinetasked to be informed of the consequences of requiring the publisherof the Polish Daily to conform to those agreements. -35230-2 B 2
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Poles supplied by the Ministry of labour for employment by the publisher of the Polish Dailyshould be &quot;withdrawn from that employment.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Secretary of State for War.to report to the Cabinet what steps would have to betaken to secure the continued publication of the PolishDaily, in view of the action authorised under Conclusion(1) above.The Budget.(previous reference erence:CM.(47)86thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.France:Balance ofPayments withSterlingArea.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 101) covering a report bythe Overseas Negotiations Committee on the prospective deficit inthe French balance of payments with the sterling area.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in consequence ofthe economic and financial policies adopted by the French Govern-ment, the balance of payments between the franc area and the sterling area for the calendar year 1948 was likely to show a French deficit of something between  65 and  85 million. France&apos;s sterling balances, which at the beginning of the year had stood at just over 50 million, were likely to be exhausted by June. The French had suggested that we should give them a credit to cover this deficit;but it was clear that we alone could not afford to carry this burden.He had discussed the position with the Foreign Secretary, and theyboth agreed that the right course was to persuade the FrenchGovernment to join us in invoking Article VII of the Treaty ofBrussels so that the situation might be discussed by the new Con-consultative Council in a wider context. It was contemplated that theCouncil should remit the problem to a special meeting of the finance ministers of the five Powers.The Foreign Sec7*etary supported the Chancellors proposals.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals, put forward in CP. (48) 101, forsecuring that the problem of the Anglo-French balance ofpayments should be remitted to the Consultative Councilestablished Under the Treaty of Brussels.EuropeanEconomicCo-operation.(previous reference erence:C.M.(48)20thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet took note that President Truman had on theprevious day signed the Foreign Assistance Act authorising theEuropean Recovery Programme and the grant of financial aid to greece, Turkey and China.The Prime Minister said that this marked a decisive stage inthe long series of negotiations which had followed the original offer made by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Marshall, in Juneof last year. It was an appropriate moment at which to congratulatethe Foreign Secretary on his initiative in responding toMr. Marshall&apos;s original offer, and his patience in the protractedinternational discussions which had ensued.
Employment 7.   The Cabinets attention was drawn to the memorandumif Disabled (P.C. (48.) 42) which the Minister of Labour had circulated to thePersons. Production Committee on the working of the Disabled Persons(Employment) Act, 1944. Some concern was expressed at the slow progress made in placing disabled persons in employment.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thismemorandum to be considered at an early meeting of theProduction Committee.Cabinet Offi.ce, S.W. 1,5th April, 1948.Itrike of 6.   The Cabinet were informed of the course of the negotiationstehlole preceding the current strike of vehicle builders and wood-cuttingiuildera.        machinists.Negotiations had been proceeding for many months on a claim for increased wages; and when these finally broke down the Ministryof Labour, after exhausting other possibilities of reaching a settle-ment, decided to refer the matter to the National arbitration tribunal. After the question had been referred to the Tribunal,the joint committee of the two Unions decided that the strike shouldcontinue. This meant that an official strike had been called, in contravention of the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order the first occasion on which this had happenedsince the Order was made in 1940.Ministers were concerned at this situation, and at the conse-quences to which it might lead. They considered that no efforts should be spared to find a way out of this difficulty. The employersmight be willing to make some concession, even though the matter had been referred to the Arbitration Tribunal.The Minister of Labour undertook to consider, in the light ofthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion, what further measures might be taken to terminate this dispute.
