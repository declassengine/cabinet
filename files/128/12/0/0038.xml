v.* X&apos;1 j*.Wages Policy.Claims forWageIncreases byEmployeesof LocalAuthoritiesand socialised industries.(PreviousHef erence  :C.M.(48)28thConclusions,Minute 4.)The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (48) 135) and the Minister of Labour (CP. (48) 140and 141) on certain problems arising from applications for wage increases by employees of local authorities and socialised industries.The Cabinet first discussed what procedure ought to be followedby the Minister of Labour when one party to wage negotiations,within either the public or the private sector, had reported to him that the negotiations had broken down, or had applied for arbitration.The Minister of Labour explained that parties to negotiationsoften asked the Ministry to use their conciliation machinery inorder to bring about a settlement. In such cases the Ministry&apos;saim was to help the parties to reach agreement by negotiation, and.the Ministry did not seek to suggest what should be the terms ofthe settlement. It was true that the Ministry sometimes found it possible and desirable to exercise informal influence on one or bothof the parties, but in doing this they had regard to the principles set out in the White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices.Applications for arbitration could normally be granted only if both sides agreed. A dispute could, however, be referred to theNational Arbitration Tribunal at the request of one party, providedthat the Ministry had first confirmed from the other that a disputeexisted. There had been a misunderstanding about the procedurefollowed in the recent negotiations on the claims made by manual workers employed by local authorities (E.P.C. (48) 17th Meeting,Minute 2). A deadlock in the negotiations had in fact been reportedto the Ministry of Labour, but negotiations had been resumed not,as Ministers had been informed, at the suggestion of the Ministry,but at the request of the employers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in present circum-stances no action ought to be taken by the Ministry of Labour whichmight be interpreted by the employers concerned as an invitation bythe Government to make concessions on a disputed wages claim whichwould be at variance with the principles set out in the White Parjer.In order to enable the Ministry to follow a consistent policy he had suggested in CP. (48) 135 that they should, for their own guidance,try to formulate their ideas on what would be reasonable minimum wage levels. This would help them to decide when to exercise their influence in favour of improved rates.There was general agreement that the Ministry of Labour should refrain from taking any action that might encourage employers to suppose that the Government wished them to grant wage claims which would not be justified by the White Paper principles.Ministers were, however, doubtful whether it would be practicable for the Ministry to formulate any general rules about the limitswithin which increased wages might be permitted or encouraged,and it was pointed out that the officials concerned must be given a substantial measure of discretion in applying the governments general policy to particular cases. It was accordingly suggestedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of labour should discuss with the senior officials of the Ministry of Labourconcerned with the handling of trades disputes the best means ofgiving effect to the Governments policy.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that it was the policy of the Minister of labour to refrain from taking any action on any wage dispute,within either the public or the private sector of employ-ment, which might encourage the employers concerned to suppose that the Government expected them to grantan increase of wages, unless the increase could be justified as being in accordance with the principles set. out in theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices; and agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Labour should discuss with officials of theMinistry of Labour the best means of giving effect to thispolicy.
The Cabinet next considered the proposals made by the Ministerof Labour in CP. (48) 140 for obtaining information about prospective-tive or actual wage claims made by the employees of socialised industries or local authorities.It was explained that, with the agreement of the Departmentsconcerned, the Minister of Labour had made arrangements direct with the boards of the Socialised industries for the provision ofsuch information at as early a stage as possible, and that he was satisfied that the boards would co-operate willingly in this matter.There should be no difficulty in obtaining similar information aboutclaims made by the employees of local authorities, since their scales of remuneration and conditions of employment were settled on anational basis, and the Departments concerned were fully informed of developments in this field.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the arrangements made for obtaining information about wage claims made by the employees of socialised industries or local authorities.The Cabinet then considered the difficulties caused by localauthorities who paid higher wages or observed better conditions ofwork than those agreed on by the appropriate Joint industrial councils, and so encouraged general claims for higher wages orbetter conditions of work.It was pointed out that, in the past, the payment by localauthorities of wages above the general level had sometimes beenthe means of raising wage rates in under-paid industries or servicesand that there were long-established differences between the wage rates paid by different authorities, which they had been unwilling to abandon when the Joint Industrial Councils had been established.Moreover, in certain types of employment, such as building and civil engineering, it could be argued that local authorities were payinghigher wages in order to obtain higher output. These considerationsillustrated the difficulties in the way of any direct approach to individual local authorities who paid higher wages or observedbetter conditions.On the other hand, the Cabinet were reminded that individuallocal authorities had, on occasions, given their employees quiteunjustifiable wage increases. Such increases were often a source of serious embarrassment to other local authorities and to the tradeunions concerned, and they could not be reconciled with para-graph 7. (b) of the White Paper.. It was also pointed out that thepresent financial relationship between the central Government andlocal authorities sometimes tended to weaken their sense ofresponsibility in dealing with applications for wage increases.Where the increase was given to workers in a grant-aided service itwould be possible to require the local authorities to meet the costfrom the rates. It would, however, be more difficult to deal withunjustifiable increases which attracted Exchequer equalisationgrant, since any reduction made in this grant had to be reportedto Parliament.In further discussion it was suggested that the health ministers, together with the other Ministers concerned, should discuss the difficulties that had arisen with the associations of localauthorities and, on a separate occasion, with representatives of theappropriate trade unions.Other points in discussion were: (a) There was general agreement with the suggestion made inparagraph 3 of CP. (48) 135 that it would be impossible to resort to a different form of machinery for determining claims for wage increases by public employees.(6) It was pointed out that the pressure for wage increases hadslackened considerably in recent months.(c) Rates of police pay compared unfavourably with the ratespaid to women clerical workers in local authority service, who wereremunerated according to their age and without regard to their

This had. led toawkward demands for wage increases from the police, and it mightbe worth raising the matter at the proposed discussions with the associations of local authorities and the trade unions.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Health Ministers, together with the HomeSecretary and the Ministers of Labour, Education andTransport, to discuss with the associations of localauthorities and with representatives of the trade unions concerned the difficulties which arose when localauthorities paid higher wages or observed better condi-tions of work than those agreed on by the appropriateJoint Industrial Councils.
