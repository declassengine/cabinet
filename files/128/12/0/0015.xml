Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.civil Aviation.(previous reference:CM. (48) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)2. In the Cabinefs discussion of the Parliamentary business for the following week reference was made to the increasing public concern about British civil aviation. This had been reflected innumerous Questions in the House of Commons on the previous day.The interest aroused by the interim report of the Committee ofenquiry into the Tudor aircraft had been sharpened by the loss ofa Tudor IV in the South Atlantic and the dismissal of the chief executive of the British South American Airways Corporation.These events had prompted the question whether this corporation had been operating its aircraft with an insufficient margin of safety.These and other matters were likely to be raised in the forthcoming debate on Civil Aviation in the House of Commons on 26th February.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to consider, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, whether there were any points of policy in connection with civil aviation whichshould be discussed by the Cabinet, the Civil aviation committee or the Socialisation of Industries committee before, the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons.Food Prices.(previous reference:CM. (47) 94thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that arrangements had been made to spread over the early months of the year the increases in food prices approved by the Cabinet on 11th December,1947, and the increases not already made were due to be introduced on 29th February, 21st March and 25th April. As, however, theGovernment were now seeking to persuade industry to reduce prices in pursuance of the policy announced in the White Paper on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321) he had agreed withthe Minister of Food that it would be wise to postpone the remainingincreases in food prices until it was known how the principles ofthe White Paper would work out in practice. These increases wouldbe postponed for a period of two months, and this would enable him to review the whole question of food subsidies again before theBudget.This postponement was not intended to prejudice the general principle of stabilising the total cost of subsidies at about their current level. The postponement would cost about  2 million in thecurrent financial year, and  7 million if it were continued through-out the coming financial year.The Cabinet Agreed that the introduction of the price increases forcheese, butter, meat and tea, which they had approved on11th December, 1947, should be postponed for the timebeing.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 11thConclusions,Minute 4.)Balance ofPayments.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 50) covering the sixth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : During the four weeks ended 7th February the net drain onour reserves of gold and dollars had amounted to  66 million, whichexceeded by  12 million the average rate for the last quarter of1947. Most of this increase was due to the lack of gold receipts from South Africa and the action of the Egyptian Government indrawing at once their full allocation of convertible sterling for the35039-3b 2
whole of 1948. But, even when allowance was made for thesetemporary factors, there were few signs of any improvement in ourposition. Gold payments to Belgium were continuing at a high level;and the continuing rise in the sterling balances of the hard currencycountries up to the end of 1947 represented an increasing danger of dollar payments or import reductions in the future.Production. In the Appendix to CP. (48) 50 particulars were given of anew interim index of industrial production which had been preparedby the Central Statistical Office. This showed that, despite the fuel crisis, production in the first eleven months of 1947 had exceededby about 7 per cent, that for the corresponding period of 1946. Asimilar result had been obtained in unofficial calculations, recently published, by the London and Cambridge Economic Service. It wasencouraging to have this statistical evidence of a substantial increasein production during 1947.There had been an increase in voluntary absenteeism in the coal-mining industry; but, in spite of this, output was continuing at separately equivalent to 217 million tons a year. The recent decrease inthe weekly output of deep-mined coal, as compared with the figuresreached in the final weeks of 1947, was not more than the seasonaldecrease which normally occurred at this period.The weekly production of steel ingots and castings in Januarywas 281,000 tons, which exceeded the previous record of 275,000 tonsin October 1947. Supplies of pig-iron and scrap were not sufficientto match this level of output and the decline in stocks was continuing.The Iron and Steel Board were disturbed by the Cabinefs decision that a special working party should be appointed to enquire intothe problem of securing adequate supplies of scrap and pig-ironfor the steel industry (CM. (48) 9th Conclusions, Minute 4) as they regarded this as one of the matters for which they were responsible to the Government. The Minister of Supply had arranged to discussthe position with the Board.Production of cotton yarn in January was 9 per cent, higherthan in January 1947, and in the first week of February had reachedthe figure of 15-36 million lbs. -the highest output since the endof the war. Spinning was no longer the limiting factor in theproduction of cotton goods, and pressure for increased production could now be applied throughout the industry.The publicity campaign for increased production in the cottonindustry was due to begin on 12th March. As part of this campaignit was proposed that representatives of both sides of the industry should meet the Prime Minister and other Ministers at 10 downing street for consultation on means of increasing output.Government efforts to expand the production of textiles were at the moment being concentrated on the cotton industry and inten-sive efforts were being made to provide increased amenities in thecotton factories in Lancashire. Was there not a risk that this might lead to trouble in Yorkshire ? The Cabinet were informed that theLabour (Textile Industries) Committee had been invited to turntheir attention first to the problems of the cotton industry, as theproduction of cotton had reached only about 70 per cent, of its pre-war level whereas production in the woollen industry was nowat about 90 per cent, of its pre-war level. The Committee would,however, be considering shortly what corresponding facilities couldbe provided with a view to securing a still greater expansion ofproduction in the woollen industry.Exports. Exports in January had totalled  119 - 5 million a record totaland  12-6 million above the average monthly figure for the last quarter of 1947. January was a long month&apos;; but, even when thefigures were calculated on the basis of an average working monthof twenty-six days, they still represented the highest monthly totalsince the war and an increase of 28 per cent, above the average figure for 1938. On the other hand, imports in January had alsorisen to a record figure of  161 - 8 million.Conversations had been held in Geneva about the continuingexport of United States coal to Europe; and the United States
representative had agreed to recommend to his Government that theprogramme of United States coal exports for the coming quartershould be reduced from 13 million tons to 9 million tons. This shouldease our immediate difficulties in finding markets for our coal exports. In the longer run the greatest threat to our exports wasthe provision of free coal by the United States Government underthe European Recovery Programme.The cuts in the investment programme were beginning toproduce unemployment in the building industry. While the unskilled workers should be transferred to other industries, special effortsmust be made to find other building work for the skilled workers,especially the older men who might otherwise pass out of industry-altogether. Permission might be given for an increased volume ofmaintenance work, subject to safeguards designed to prevent the absorption in maintenance work of scarce materials required for new building. The Minister of Health also suggested that considera-tion might be given to the possibility of expanding the housing programme up to a total of 180,000 or 200,000 houses in 1949.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (48) 50 and of the points raised in thediscussion.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on wages policy by the Minister of Labour (CP. (48) 52 and 54), the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (48) 58), and the Minister of Agriculture(CP. (48) 59).In CP. (48) 52 it was stated that the Ministry of Labour would continue to pass on to Production Departments any available information about wage claims of national significance which were put forward, and would keep Departments informed of the progressof negotiations on claims, and the details of the final settlements.The Ministry would also, so far as possible, inform Departments ofany indications that there might be that wage claims in particular industries were about to be put forward.In discussion it was pointed out that it had often happened in the past that Ministers had not received information about wage claims until it was too late for them to give any advice or guidance to the parties. Once a claim had been formally presented and nego-tiations had been started, it was very difficult for Ministers to intervene; but if information about prospective claims could beobtained at an early stage. Ministers could sometimes exercise arestraining influence through unofficial contacts with the parties.It was also suggested that arrangements should be made forthe Government to obtain as a matter of course from all public bodies, such as local authorities and boards of socialised industries,immediate reports on any claims made, or about to be made, bytheir employees. These reports should cover all claims by organisedbodies of employees, whether remunerated by wages or by salaries.The Foreign Secretary said that in any informal approaches totrade union leaders on the subject of wage claims, great care mustbe taken to avoid undermining the authority of the leaders in theirunions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to make every effort to obtainadvance information of impending claims for higherremuneration before formal negotiations had started and to furnish this information, together with any information about negotiations actually in progress, to ministers in charge of Production Departments.
(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to concert with the other ministers concerned arrangements for obtaining from public bodies., such as local authorities and boards ofsocialised industries, immediate reports on all prospectiveor actual claims for higher remuneration made by their employees;(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate periodical reports to the Production Committee summarising theinformation obtained in pursuance of Conclusions (1)and (2) above.(48) 54 it was explained that the Ministry of Labourepartments were likely to be asked by employers or byInterpretation In CP.of para- and other Depggraph 10 of tie emplovers and trade unions jointly whether,^ if particular wage&quot;White Paper increases were ^ranted, the Government would take the additionalon Personal cost into account in settling controlled prices or charges or anyIncomes, Costs other financial matters requiring Government action.

On the other hand, the President of the Board of Tradesuggested in CP. (48) 58 that it would be difficult for the Govern-ment to evade responsibility for indicating whether a particularwage claim would in their view be justified as being in accordancewith the principles laid down in the White Paper and pointedout that, in the absence of such guidance, it might become a commonpractice to make agreements to increase wages conditional on theGovernments agreeing to increased prices. In CP. (48) 59 it wasalso suggested that in applying the rules proposed in paragraph 4of CP. (48) 54 allowance must be made for the undertaking givenby the Government in November 1946, that, in adjusting agricultural prices after special reviews occurring between the annual Februaryreviews of prices, the objective would be to effect a change in theaggregate gross income of the agricultural industry corresponding to the change in costs which had occasioned the special review.In discussion there was general agreement that Departmentsmust adopt a consistent line in dealing with any enquiries about theinterpretation of paragraph 10 of the White Paper, and that ingeneral the rules suggested by the Minister of Labour in para-graph 4 of CP. (48) 54 should be applied.The main points made in discussion were: (a) The Ministry of Labour should not be precluded from givingadvice when consulted about particular undermanned industries inaccordance with the suggestion made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in the House of Commons debate on 12th February.(&amp;) Everything possible should be done to discourage anytendency for negotiators to make wage increases conditional on theGovernments agreeing to increased prices.(c) The general presumption should be against making any allowance for wage increases, and the Government should in every case consider whether the additional cost could not be met out of increased productivity or by a reduction in profits.(d) No attempt should be made by the Government to secure any alteration in the revised scales *of wages proposed bv theLicensed Hotels and Restaurants Wages Board, though the adoptionof these proposals would mean that the Government would be pressed to agree to higher prices for meals.(e) Where the grant of a wage claim would impose a directcharge on the Exchequer (e.g.. because it was made by civil servantsor by employees whose remuneration attracted Exchequer grants)
Claim oflondod RoadTransportWorkers.(previous reference:CM. (48) 8thConclusions,Minute 80the Minister concerned should not regard himself as precluded fromexpressing Ms views on the claim. This could be justified by thelast sentence of paragraph 9 of the White Paper.(f) The Chancellor of the Exchequer had arranged for a group of senior officials to meet together to co-ordinate Departmental actionon questions arising from the White Paper.The Cabinet (4) Subject to the points made in the discussion, agreed that, indealing with enquiries about the operation of para-graph 10 of the White Paper, Departments should follow the lines indicated in paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 54.The Cabinet were informed that the offer of increased wage rates which had been made by the London Transport Executive tothe Transport and General Workers&quot; Union on 28th January, hadnot been finally rejected by the Union and had been repeated by theExecutive at a meeting on 10th Eebruary under the chairmanship ofthe Chief Industrial Commissioner of the Ministry of Labour,further meeting was to be held later in the day andthat the representatives of the Union would now accept the otter.A member of the London Transport Executive had suggested unoffi-elaJly to the Secretary of the Union that, in the light of the white paper and the speech made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer inthe debate on 12th February, the Union should agree that, thoughthe proposal for time-and-a-half payment for Sunday duty should beaccepted in principle, the date of its operation should be deferred snrcril economic conditions were more favourable: but theSecretary of the Union had said that he could not contemplateentering into any agreement based on a modification of the offeralready made. Unless, therefore, the Minister of Transport speei-fieally directed that the offer should be withdrawn, it was probablethat the Executive and the Union would now reach agreement on it,with the result that London road transport workers would ieceive anaverage wage increase equivalent to 10-?. 3d. a week. The london transport Executive had already been informed that the Govern-ment would fee reluctant to approve any increase in fares to eom-compensate for the proposed wage increases, but if these increases werenot met either by operational economies or by an increase in fares the resulting deficit would, in the last resort, fall upon the Exchequer.j-cabinet (5) Took note of the position and agreed that the Minister ofTransport should take no action to secure the withdrawalof the offer made by the London Transport Executive.CommercialWork inRoyalDockyards.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (CP. (48) 28) on the use of the royal dockyards.The Cabinet had already agreed on 2nd February, 1948, thatthe possible means of the Royal Dockyards for ship breaking (which formed the subject of the second part of this memorandum) shouldbe considered by the working party of officials which was to enquire into the problem of securing adequate supplies of scrap and pigiron for the steel industry.The remainder of the memorandum was concerned with the use for commercial purposes of engineering capacity in the Dockyardswhich was mot required for naval work. It was suggested in dis-cussiom that this part of the memorandum raised several questionswhich reqoired further discussion in detail.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theProduction Committee to examine the questions raised bvparagraphs 2-9 of CP. (48) 26.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,19t&amp; February, 1948&apos;.
