This would have left400,000 tons to go to the highest bidder and most would have gone to United States buyers. The United States authorities had now,however, agreed that for the immediate future 300,000 tons ofcommercial scrap should be sold to United Kingdom buyers and200,000 tons to United States buyers, leaving 100,000 tons to bemade available to European buyers. The British and United states authorities in Germany were also agreed in recommending thatthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation should setup as soon as possible machinery for the allocation of any further supplies of commercial scrap.The Minister of Supply said that provided that effective alloca-tion machinery could be established the new agreement was satis-factory so far as it went, but the problem of persuading Germanmerchants to part with their scrap still remained. He had sentan officer to Germany to see what more could be done to get over this difficulty. Meanwhile, equipment to enable deliveries of booty scrap from Germany to be increased was coming forward satis-factorily.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements made by the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Supply.35399-11. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Uommons in the following week.On 14th May Parliament would be adjourned for theWhitsuntide Recess until 25th May.
France.Balance ofPayments withWesternEuropeanCountries.(previous reference:CM. (48) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that satisfactory-results had been achieved at the meeting of Finance Ministers ofthe signatory Powers of the Treaty of Brussels held m Brusselson 28th and 29th April. If the conclusions reached were ratified by the new Belgian Government, they would afford a basis forfacilitating the expansion of trade between the five Powers. Ithad been agreed that the United Kingdom and Belgium should make available credits of  10 million and  5 million respectively to helpFrance out of her immediate balance of payments difficulties. Tomeet the medium-term problem it had been agreed that one-thirdof the local currency income received by each of the five powers from the sale of goods supplied under the European recovery programme should be made available as credits to facilitate trade between the five Powers. The long-term problem had been remittedfor consideration by the Organisation for European economic co-operation.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.economic affairs.(previous reference:C.M.(48)28thConclusions,Minute 3.)Production.Building.external trade.Balance ofPayments.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 116) covering the tenth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion: Although the output of open-cast coal continued to be satis-factory, production of deep-mined coal had fallen short of the target figure in each week of April. The seasonal increase in output whichwas expected in this period had not been achieved. The increasein the industry&apos;s labour force had been substantially less in the first quarter of 1948 than in the corresponding period of 1947, due to ahigher rate of wastage and a lower rate of recruitment. Progressin reducing the rate of absenteeism had also been less satisfactory.Ministers agreed that the position was disquieting and should be carefully watched. In particular, further thought should be givento the problem of absenteeism.It was now evident that the workers in the cotton industry would not agree to a regular system of overtime-working. This was due, however, to the practical inconveniences of overtime-working in an industry employing large numbers of married women; andthere were indications that the workers were prepared to increase output by other means. The Chairman of the Cotton Board believedthat by the end of the year the industry might reach a rate of outputequivalent to that of l938.Good progress had been made in the house-building programme in March; and in England and Wales the programme was now in balance. In Scotland, however, the position remain unsatisfactory :owing to the excessive numbers of houses started, the average timefor completing a house was still about 2  years.The volume of exports for the first quarter of 1948 had been126 per cent, of the 1938 figure, as compared with the target of 125 per cent, for the first half-year.The net drain on our gold and dollar reserves in April hadbeen only  20 million, as compared with a monthly average of 49 million in the first quarter of the year. This was not inconsis-tent with a high rate of import. We had, for example, been buyingmuch more of our imports from the sterling area and soft currencycountries. We were, however, still meeting South Africa&apos;s currentrequirements of dollars; negotiations with South Africa onreimbursement and the interpretation of the agreement were inprogress. In general there had been a substantial improvement inthe balance of payments position of the rest of the sterling area.There was evidence that the large-scale movement of capital to south Africa continued.
Coal to Oil 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorConversion 0f the Exchequer (CP. (48) 119) submitting the recommendationsScheme. 0f tBe Production Committee on the future of the programme of(Previous       conversion from coal-firing to oil-firing.reference: This programme had been launched in the spring of 1946,CM. (47) 96th when coal stocks were shrinking and the shortage of fuel oil had conclusions, not been foreseen. By June 1947, however, the world shortage of minute 6.) oil had begun to develop and it was announced that no furtherconversion schemes would be authorised. In December 1947 itwas announced that work on conversion schemes not then completedmust be suspended. No further announcement had been made, andit had now become necessary that some guidance should be givento firms whose conversion schemes had been suspended. these schemes, if completed, would account for about 2^ million tons of fuel oil in a full year; and the Production Committee were satisfiedthat, in view of the acute shortage of oil, the majority of these firms should continue to burn coal. The Committee therefore recommended(i) that the railway conversion scheme should be abandoned entirely;(ii) that certain outstanding industrial schemes of exceptionaleconomic value, on which considerable expenditure had already been incurred, should be allowed to come gradually into operation; and(iii) that a public warning should be given that, in view of theworld shortage of oil, other conversion schemes might have to remainin suspense for a considerable time. This warning might give riseto claims for compensation, but it was proposed that any suchclaims by industrial firms should be resisted. The expenditure incurred on the railway conversion scheme should, however, be borneby the Exchequer, as the railway companies had been instructedto proceed with this scheme by the Ministry of Transport in 1946at a time when that Ministry exercised full control over the railways.In discussion it was pointed out that, as oil became lessplentiful and more expensive, some firms would in any event havebeen compelled by economic considerations to abandon their plans for switching over to oil-firing. It was not possible, however, forthe Government to refrain from making any further announcementand to leave these economic factors to produce their result. Forthe Government had led industry to believe that supplies of oilwould be forthcoming, and industry must be told that the necessarysupplies could not now be made available for some considerable time. The Government would be criticised for this reversal ofpolicy; but Ministers agreed that claims for compensation mustbe firmly resisted. It would be preferable that the plant alreadysupplied for the railway conversion scheme should not be dispersedbut should be held by the Government on a care and maintenance&apos;basis.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations of the Production Com-mittee, as set out in paragraph 8 of CP. (48) 119 and summarised above.Trade The Foreign Secretary asked what attitude was being adoptedNegotiations. regarding less essential imports in the current trade negotiationswith Spain. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it wasnot his intention that Spain should be treated any differently fromother countries in this matter. The Overseas Negotiations Com- ;mittee would continue to keep in touch with the course of thenegotiations.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (48) 116 and of the points raised in discussion.
National 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of insurance Fuel and Power (CP. (48) 117) covering a memorandum which he(Industrial had circulated to the Socialisation of Industries Committee on aInjuries) Act.   proposed scheme of supplementary injuries benefits for miners.Supplementary        ^he Minister- of Ftiel and Power said that it had always beenInjuriescontemplated that a supplementary scheme for miners underBenefits for Section 83 of the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, 1946,Miners- should come into operation on 5th July, 1948.  The National Union(Previous 0f Mineworkers had put forward a scheme which would costReference:  6 million a year and had proposed that the whole cost, equivalentCM.(45)52nd to 7-2d. per ton of coal, should be borne by the National CoalConclusions, Board. The Socialisation of Industries Committee had, however,Minute 5.) taken the view that something like half of the cost of any supple-mentary scheme ought to be met by contributions from the miners,and the Board had accordingly proposed an alternative scheme with more limited benefits, half the cost of which would be met by a weekly contribution of 10^. from each worker, leaving a sumequivalent to 1-M. a ton of coal to be paid by the Board. TheUnion had rejected this and the Board had now asked whether a third scheme, which would be financed by a weekly contribution of3d., or possibly 2d. from each worker, representing about 10 per cent,of the total cost, and a contribution equivalent to 3-8*1 a ton of coal from the Board, contained any element that the Governmentwould not approve. A meeting between the Board and the union was being held on the following day, and the question for the cabinet&apos;s decision was whether the Board should be told that theGovernment regarded a substantial contribution from the workers as essential or that there were no elements in the revised schemeto which the Government would take exception. If the Board were told that the Government insisted on a substantial contribution from the workers, they would have to communicate this to the Union,and the Cabinet should realise that it would be fatal to their ownauthority and that of the Board if, having taken this line, theysubsequently yielded.to pressure from the Union. The miners&apos;case was that, as the whole cost of workmen&apos;s compensation had hitherto fallen on the employers, who from 5th July would be relieved of a charge equivalent to Is. Od. a ton of coal, it wasnot unreasonable that the Board should bear the whole cost ofthe supplementary scheme, which would entail a charge of only7-2d. per ton. They would also argue that a supplementary schemewas necessary because in some respects injured miners would be worse off under the industrial injuries scheme than under workmen&apos;compensation; and that in an industry with such a high accidentrate as coalmining the workers could not be expected to bear 50 percent, of the cost of the scheme. . The Union would press their case with determination and the issue was one on which public sympathy was likely to be with them. On the whole, therefore,he recommended that the Board should be informed that the Govern-ment saw no objection to their latest proposals.The Lord President recalled that in the past the miners hadargued that owing to the system of wages ascertainment the costof workmen&apos;s compensation had in fact been a deduction from their earnings, and this had been one of the considerations leading tothe adoption of the main industrial injuries scheme under whichindustry as a whole carried the greater part of the cost of providingcompensation for miners. This being so, it was illogical to argue that the Board could afford to pay the whole cost of a supplementary scheme because of their savings on compensation from 5th Julv,for the cost would in fact be borne by the consumer in the shape of higher coal prices. Moreover, if the scheme were financedentirely by the Board, there would be every incentive to the union to press for higher benefits. He therefore urged the Cabinet to adhere to the principle of a 50 per cent, contribution from theworkers. He also suggested that there would be advantage indeferring a decision until after 5th July, when the effect of the
higher contributions under the national insurance schemes couldbe seen.In further discussion it was pointed out that*the acceptanceof a supplementary scheme for miners without a substantial con-tribution from the workers would undermine the principles of thegeneral schemes of national insurance and would make it impossibleto resist claims for improvements in war pension rates costing asmuch as  20 million a year. Indeed, in the view of the Ministerof Pensions, even if a supplementary scheme were based on substan-tial contributions from the workers it would be difficult to holdwar pensions at their present level. On the other hand, there seemed to be no prospect of getting the Union to accept a schemeproviding for a 50 per cent, contribution by the worker. It wastherefore agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should ask the Board to explore the possibility of devising a scheme underwhich they would contribute up to 4d. a ton, with possibly a higher rate of contribution for any tonnage over the existing level of output, making it clear that the Government would not regard any scheme as acceptable unless it provided for a substantial contribution from the workers. This contribution need not be by way of a flat rate but might vary according to the worker&apos;s wages, e.g. Id. perpound of wages. The assistance of the Ministry of national insurance should be made available to the Board and the Ministrymight also consider whether the benefits under any such scheme could be so arranged as to supplement the general industrial injuriesscheme in those cases where it was less favourable to the injuredman than the existing workmen&apos;s compensation scheme.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to communicate with the National Coal Board on the lines approved inthe Cabinefs discussion.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations(OP. (48) 120) on the British Nationality Bill.This Bill provided that all persons who were citizens of anyof the countries of the Commonwealth except Eire should, by virtueof their respective citizenships, be British subjects; and that citizens of Eire, though not British subjects, should in the United Kingdomand the Colonies be in a position equivalent to that of Britishsubjects. The Government of India had asked that in place ofthe term &quot; British subject,&quot; which was in their view open tomisunderstanding, there should be substituted some such term as&quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; or &quot;citizen of the Commonwealth&quot;;and the suggestion that &apos;&apos; Commonwealth citizen&apos;&apos; should beincluded in the Bill as an alternative to &quot;British subject&quot; hadbeen put to the other Commonwealth Governments. The Govern-ment of Australia saw difficulty in this suggestion, since in australia the term &quot; Commonwealth citizen &quot; was already used as meaninga citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia; and it was not certainthat, if alternatives were inserted in the United Kingdom Bill,all the other Commonwealth countries would follow this lead in theirlegislation. On the other hand, the advantages of modifying theBill so as to make it acceptable to countries such as India and pakistan would outweigh any disadvantages arising from lack ofuniformity in the legislation passed by the various commonwealth governments; and there was reason to believe that in the Houseof Lords, at all events, the Opposition would not make difficulties over the proposed amendment. There was no time for further consultation with Commonwealth Governments if the Bill was topass in the current Session, and if it were postponed to a laterSession there was a risk that the United Kingdom would lose
the initiative which they had secured as a result of the Common-wealth Conference on Nationality and Citizenship.The Cabinets- -Agreed that in moving the Second Reading of the british nationality Bill in the House of Lords the government spokesman should explain that the Government were considering, in consultation with other commonwealth governments, a proposal to amend Clause 1 so as to recog-nise the designation &quot; Commonwealth citizen&quot; as analternative to &quot;British subject.&quot;Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th May, 1948.
