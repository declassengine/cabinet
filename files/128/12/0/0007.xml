Food.PotatoSupplies.(previous reference:CM. (47) 84thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (48) 29) proposing that the target acreage for potatoesin 1948 should be raised from 1,423,000 to 1,500,000 acres, and thatthe price paid to farmers for potatoes should be raised by  1 a ton.These proposals were designed to ensure that potato rationing wouldnot have to be continued after the present crop year. They involved an addition of only one-ninth of a penny a pound to the price paidby the consumer, and any surplus that might arise through anabnormally high yield per acre in 1948 could &apos;&quot;animal feeding.Discussion showed that Ministers were reluctant to contemplateincreasing the financial incentive for the growing of potatoes by farmers. Assuming a reasonable yield per acre, the prospectivedeficit was not likely to exceed 400,000 tons; and Ministers thoughtit should be possible to meet much of this by increased production from allotments, gardens and plots of land not otherwise under cultivation.etidily be used forThe Minister of A aviculture said that the assumptions made in cp. (48) 29 were on the conservative side. Thus, the Minister ofFood had postulated an increase of 200,000 tons in the requirements for human consumption and had made no allowance for possibleimports, for production from allotments, or for the increased supplies which could be made available by using a 1-^-inch, insteadof a 2-inch, riddle. Great efforts had been made to induce farmers to plant 1,423,000 acres of potatoes in 1948, and he was reasonablyconfident that this acreage would be achieved. If the season werenormal, there should be no need to continue potato rationing; and,having regard to the prices fixed for other agricultural products, he did not himself wish to press for an increase in the price of potatoes,though some farmers would undoubtedly be producing potatoes at a loss in 1948.A Press notice stressing the need for a greater output of potatoes from allotments and gardens had been issued in December.This had been followed up by an appeal to local authorities to makeland available for allotments and by a series of conferences organisedthrough the National Allotments Society. It would hardly bepossible to regain the level of output reached in the war, since muchof the land then available was now required for building and enthusiasm for the cultivation of allotments had declined. It was,however, hoped to increase the total output from allotments andgardens from the 1947 figure of 350,000 tons to at least 430,000 tons.It was the view of the Cabinet that this campaign should be intensified. Vigorous action should be taken to bring home to thepublic the need for growing potatoes on any land available for thepurpose. Further steps should be taken to encourage the growingof potatoes on land held by the Services, and the agriculture ministers might explore with the Minister of Labour the suggestionthat local authorities might employ on the growing of potatoesworkers whom they would otherwise have to discharge as a result ofthe reduction in the programme of road works.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the target figure for the 1948 potato acreageshould not be increased beyond 1,423,000 and that no increase should be made in the price paid to farmers forpotatoes.(2) Invited the Agriculture Ministers, in consultation with theLord President and the Minister of Food, to intensify the campaign for the production of potatoes in allotmentsand gardens and to report to the Cabinet early in Marchon the progress made by this campaign.34849-4 b 2
export programme.Export Tar-gets, TextileExports andClothingEation.(PreviousBei erences:CM. (47) 75thConclusions,Minute 5, and cm. (48) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 24) reporting the conclusions of theProduction Committee on the revision of the export programme, theexpansion of textile exports and the supply of textiles for the home market.Shortage of steel and overseas import restrictions had made itnecessary to re-examine the export programme approved by theCabinet on 9th September. It was clear that it would not now bepossible to achieve the targets then set for 1948 and it was proposedthat revised figures should be published in the Economic Survey.This reduction could be partly offset by the expansion of textileexports, if the labour force of those industries could be increased and more effectively employed. A Committee of Junior ministers had been appointed, on the recommendation oi^ the production committee, to concert and progress measures for that, purpose. Inaddition, an official Committee had been set up to consider means for meeting the requirements of the industry for niachinery. It wasalso, necessary to consider whether increased textile exports shouldbe secured by further diversions from the home market. There wouldbe no advantage in reducing the ration for the next period assufficient supplies to meet demand on the basis of the existing rationhad already gone into the shops. But it was proposed that planning should proceed on the assumption that the ration would be reducedto 3-J coupons a month in the following period, and that the public should be warned that such a reduction would be essential unless there was in the meantime a marked increase in production.In discussion, the following points were made :- -(a) It was impossible to estimate what would be the effects ofthe French Governments plan for devaluing the franc. In thecircumstances, any reassessment of export targets was necessarilyspeculative at this stage.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Supply themanner in which the revised export programme should be presented in the Economic Survey.(c) There were difficulties in conducting effective consultationwith the cotton industry. A drive for increased production would only be effective if contact was made with each district. This shouldbe reinforced by a publicity campaign on a local rather than anational basis.The Cabinet-Endorsed the proposals put forward in CP. (4.94Devaluation 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet ofof the French the outcome of the discussions on the method of devaluing the FrenchFranc. franc.   In spite of representations made to them on behalf of His(Previous       Majesty&apos;s Government, eliminating in his personal mission to ParisBeference:      at the end of the previous week, the French Government had per-C.M.(48)6th    sisted in their determination that part of the convertible currenciesConclusions,     coming into France should be allowed to find its level through the minute 5.)      operation of a free market.   They had now introduced, with effect from 26th January, their scheme by which the fixed rate for the francwas put at 864 to the pound and 214-392 to the dollar, but at thesame time over part of the field a free market was recognised for united States dollars and Portuguese escudes. The Chancellor read to the Cabinet the text of a statement on this matter which ne pro-posed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.    Thissummarised the discussions which had taken place between HisMajesty&apos;s  Government and the French  Government,  and  the references made to the International Monetary Fund, and indicated the objections urged by His Majesty&apos;s Government and by the fund to this dual method of devaluation.  It made it clear, however, thatthe French Government envisaged this dual system as a transitory
51 CM. 7 (48)       32measure and that their objective was to stabilise the franc on a fixeduniform rate. It would now be the policy of His Majesty&apos;&quot;s Govern-ment, without modifying their objections to the method of devalua-tion adopted by the French Government., to give the French allpossible help in reaching that objective at the earliest possible date,and to take such measures as might prove necessary in the interval to limit the repercussions on sterling and on the other currencies inwhich we were closely interested. The statement added that theFrench intended to take all possible action to prevent their plansfrom having any direct effect on the relation of sterling to other currencies; and that His Majesty&apos;s Government did not contemplatealtering the rate of sterling in relation to other currencies. Thestatement concluded by emphasising that the differences of view between the two Governments on the method adopted for devaluingthe franc would not affect the intention of the two Governments to collaborate to the fullest possible extent in economic as well as political matters.The following were among the main points raised in theCabinet&quot;s discussion : (a) It was unf ortunate that the French Government should havepersisted in this plan in face of the opposition of the international monetary Fund. This action would seriously weaken the influence of the Fund.(&amp;) There was some risk that other European countries might follow the French example and take unilateral action to depreciatetheir currency by methods which would not be acceptable to theInternational Monetary Fund.(c) If the French Government had been willing to put a limit of three months on the duration of the plan, its objects would havebeen more effectively secured and its potential danger to sterling would have been less.(d) The unofficial rate of exchange for the franc in terms of dollars might rise substantially; and in that event French tradersmight be tempted to buy sterling goods and sell them for dollars.If such transactions assumed substantial proportions, we shouldbe forced to restrict French purchases from sterling sources.The Cabinet-Took note of the position; and approved the terms of thestatement which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was pro-posing to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.War Memoirs.Mr. GhurehiU&apos;s&quot; second world War.&quot;(previous reference:G.M.(46)85thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had agreed in principle, on 10th October, 1946, that Mr. Churchill should be at liberty to include in his forthcoming book on the Second World Warmemoranda and minutes which he had written when in office, andtelegrams from himself to President Roosevelt and other heads of governments, on the understanding that the text of the book wouldbe submitted, before publication, for final revision on behalf of theGovernment. In accordance with this arrangement Mr. churchill had now submitted the first volume of his book in which he proposedto reproduce, in addition to other original documents, a number of papers which he had circulated to the War Cabinet when First Lordof the Admiralty. The Prime Minister said that he had satisfiedhimself that the publication of these papers was consistent with thegeneral principles which the Cabinet had approved on 23rd May,1946 (CM. (46) 51st Conclusions, Minute 5); and he had decidedthat Mr. Churchill might property be given permission to publishthese documents in his book.The suggestion had been made in Parliament (Hansard, 14thFebruary, 1946, Columns 521-522) that former Ministers should pay to the Exchequer some part of their earnings from the publicationof books based on official documents collected during their term of office; and it was possible that this suggestion might be repeated inrelation to Mr. churchill&apos;s book.  The Prime Minister was satisfied,
however, that there were no sufficient grounds for suggesting toMr. Churchill that he should pay over to the Exchequer any partof his receipts from bis book by reason of the fact that it was basedlargely on information which he had acquired as a Minister and included a number of official documents in respect of which Crowncopyright could be claimed.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers state-ments.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26tk January, 1948.
