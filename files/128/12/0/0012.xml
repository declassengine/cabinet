Palestine.(previous reference:CM. (48) 8thConclusions,Minute 6.)Arrival ofUnitedNationsCommissionPalestine.inEvacuationof Tel Aviv1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretaiy of State for the Colonies (CP. (48) 42)seeking guidance on the attitude to be adopted by the UnitedKingdom Delegation when the report of the United Nations Corn-mission on Palestine was discussed by the Security Council, and proposing that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should go to new York to lead the Delegation. They also had before themmemoranda by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (48) 40and 41) describing the present situation in Palestine and sum-marising the statements made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment on their attitude towards the implementation of the united nations Plan.The Cabinet were informed that the United Nations Corn-mission had asked that His Majesty&apos;s Government should reconsider their refusal to permit them to enter Palestine more than two weeks before the termination of the Mandate on loth May. If no conces-sion were made on this point, we should be open to criticism forfailing to give the Commission the minimum co-operation necessaryto enable them to discharge their task. On the other hand, theCommission&apos;^ arrival in Palestine would so gravely affect thesecurity situation as to render impossible the task of maintainingcivil administration over the whole country for more than a very limited period; and a longer period of overlap would increase therisk of open conflict with the Arabs, since it would be difficult forus to avoid appearing to collaborate in the enforcement of the partition plan. The High Commissioner for Palestine, after con-suiting the General Officer Commanding, had stated on 4th Februarythat the earlier arrival of the Commission would greatly increase the risk of a breakdown of the withdrawal plans.Ministers took the view that the first task of the UnitedKingdom Delegation should be to explain and defend the policywhich His Majesty&apos;s Government had pursued in recent months, andto rebut any criticism of their attitude towards the United Nations.It was, however, important to convince the Commission of our readiness-ness to give them all possible help within the limits of the policywhich had been clearly laid down during the meeting of the general assembly, and any desire on the part of the Commission to come toLondon for further discussions should be encouraged. The Corn-mission might also be informed that facilities would be given fora nucleus of their staff to proceed to Palestine well in advance of1st May. &quot;WMle the Cabinet did not wish at this stage to decidefinally whether the period of overlap might be extended, they thought that the United Kingdom Delegation might indicate thatthis was a matter which could be discussed when the Commissioncame to London. It would be preferable that any indication of our willingness to help the Commission on these lines should be givento them in private rather than announced at a meeting of theSecurity Council.The Cabinet were reminded that the United Nations plan of partition provided that the Mandatory Power should use its best endeavours to ensure that an area situated in the territory of theJewish State, including a seaport and hinterland adequate toprovide facilities for a substantial immigration, should be evacuatednot later than 1st February. The Commission had been informedthat His Majesty&apos;s Government were not prepared to comply withthis requirement. This decision had been taken on the ground thatto evacuate Tel Aviv would not only cause a grave deterioration inthe internal security situation, but would also render it impossiblefor the Arab States to maintain their existing policy of restraint.It was urged that our refusal seriously prejudiced the Jewsby depriving them of freedom to import arms; and the suggestion was made that it was unfair to enforce a rigid control over theimportation of arms for use by the Jews in view of the ease withwhich the Palestinian Arabs could obtain arms from neighbouring countries. The general view of the Cabinet was, however, that norelaxation of the control over the importation of arms would be justifiable.34933-5 b 2
ProgressiveTransfer of power toUnitedNationsCommission.enforcement of Partitionby anInternationalEorce.The Cabinet were reminded that the United Nations plan of partition provided for the gradual transfer of power to theCommission by the progressive withdrawal of the civil administra-tion. The Commission had been informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were unable to agree to this and that it was their intention to maintain the civil administration over the whole ofPalestine until 15th May, when the Mandate would be terminatedand the civil administration would cease to exist. Good progress had already been made with the devolution of power withinPalestine to local authorities in predominantly Arab and Jewishareas and this process would continue during the remaining periodof the British administration. It would thus be possible to layfoundations on which the successor authorities could ultimatelybuild.There was general agreement that it would not be possible to accede to any proposal for the progressive transfer of power before15th May. * It was pointed out, however, that the terminationof the Mandate for the whole of Palestine on one day might createserious legal.and administrative problems. It would, for instance,be necessarv to make provision either for continuing the existing law of Palestine after 15th May or for replacing it by another legalsvstem. Accordingly, when the Commission came to London, we ought not to refuse to discuss with them any reasonable proposalsfor facilitating the transfer of responsibility on the termination ofthe Mandate.The Jewish Agency had represented to the Security council that they should send an international force to Palestine to enforcepartition, and the United Nations Commission were expected tomake a similar request. Any international force would almost inevitably have to include a contingent from the Soviet Union or one of its satellites, and the establishment of such a force would greatly increase the likelihood of open intervention by the arab states in Palestine. Moreover, the force could hardly be assembledand sent to Palestine in time to take effective action. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had already made it clear that they would not partici-pate in enforcing partition, and it was accordingly proposed thatin any discussion about the establishment of an international force by the Security Council the United Kingdom Delegation should express no opinion and should abstain from voting. They shouldnot, however, exercise a veto.In criticism of this proposal it was urged that failure to givethe Security Council our advice when the matter was discussed orto make a fair contribution towards any international force thatmight be set up would be inconsistent with our professed supportof the United Nations. It was also argued that, if, when the matter was raised, the United Kingdom Delegation abstained from anyexpression of opinion, the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s government might be misconstrued.In reply it was pointed out that the participation by a UnitedKingdom contingent in an international force might well lead to our having to carry the major part of the burden of enforcement andwould, in view of our previous declarations, expose us to the chargeof bad faith. Moreover, there were good reasons for the view that,if any international force were established, it should not contain a united Kingdom contingent on the ground that we had been toodeeply involved in the past history of the Palestine problem. Therewere also serious objections to the expression of any opinion by theUnited Kingdom Delegation on whether an international force should be established. If we supported the proposal, we shouldhave difficulty in refusing to allow a United Kingdom contingent to participate and would probably find it impossible to resist ademand for the retention of United Kingdom forces in Palestineuntil the international force was in a position to take over from them. On the other hand, any advice that we might give against theproposal would be construed as an attempt to obstruct the imple-mentation of the United Nations plan.
The Jewish Agency had sent a memorandum to the united nations Commission calling for the use of sanctions againstmembers of the Arab League on the ground that they were conspiringto overthrow the decision of the General Assembly. It was recom-mended that, should a resolution condemning the Arab States beplaced upon the agenda of the Security Council, the United King-dom Delegation should ensure that these States were given a fairhearing in accordance with Article 31 of the Charter. It was also proposed that the Delegation should seek any necessary furtherguidance when the terms of any such resolution were known.The Cabinet were informed that at their meeting on 4thFebruary the Legislation Committee had approved the draft of aBill to provide for the termination of His Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction inPalestine on loth May. The proceedings on this Bill would provide an opportunity for a general discussion of the Government&apos;s policy,and strong criticism of various aspects of the evacuation plan mightbe expected.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposal that the Secretary of State for theColonies should go to New York to lead the UnitedKingdom Delegation, and agreed that the general atti-tude to be adopted in the discussions in the security council should be as proposed in paragraph 2 of cp. (48) 42.(2) Agreed that the united Kingdom Delegation should informthe United Nations Commission on Palestine (i) that His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome anopportunity for discussions with them in London,(ii) that all reasonable facilities would be given for a nucleus of their staff to visit Palestine in advanceof 1st May.(iii) that the question whether the Commission should proceed to Palestine before 1st May should be leftover for discussion in London.(3) Agreed that Tel Aviv should not be evacuated in advanceof 15th May.(4) Agreed that it would be impossible to contemplate the progressive transfer of power to the United nations commission in advance of 15th May, but that reasonableproposals for facilitating the transfer of responsibility on the termination of the Mandate might be discussed with the Commission in London.(5) Agreed that when the question of the establishment of aninternational force was discussed by the security council the Lfnited Kingdom Delegation should (i) make it clear that it was for the Council to deter-mine what support should be given to the united nations Commission;(ii) reaffirm the statements made by the United King-dom Delegation to the General Assembly and by government spokesmen in the debate on palestine in the House of Commons on 11th and 12thDecember about the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to withdraw their forces from palestine by 1st August, 1948, and theirunwillingness to undertake, either individuallyor collectively in association with others, toimpose the United Nations decision by force; and(iii) abstain from voting but not exercise a veto.(6) Approved the proposal made in paragraph 5 of CP. (48) 42with regard to the attitude to be adopted by the UnitedKingdom Delegation to any resolution calling for theuse of sanctions against members of the Arab League.
(7) Invited the Lord President to discuss with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies and the Chief Whip the possi-bility of deferring the introduction of the Palestine bill until the completion of the Security Councils discus-sions on Palestine.Fntnre ofItalianColonies.(previous reference:G.M.(46)63rdCon elusions,Minute 2.)2, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 43) outlining certain proposals which it was intended to put forward in informal discussions with the UnitedStates and French Governments on the future of the former italian colonies in Africa.The Foreign Secretary said that the Four-Power Commissioncharged by the Deputies of the Council of Foreign Ministers withinvestigating and reporting on conditions in the former italian colonies were due to arrive in Tripolitania at the beginning ofMarch and it was urgently necessary to give His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Rome some guidance on the attitude which he should adopt in his discussions with the representatives of the UnitedStates and France. There were very strong arguments for claimingfor the United Kingdom the trusteeship of Cyrenaica, and theDepartments concerned were agreed that the right course would beto ask for the trusteeship of Libya as a whole. At the same timeeverything possible should be done to safeguard the interests of theItalians in Tripolitania on the lines proposed in paragraph 5 of cp. (48) 43. It would also be desirable to compensate Italy bysupporting her claim to the trusteeship of the whole of italian somaliland and a considerable part of Eritrea, on the understandingthat Ethiopia should be given as much as possible of the Coptichighlands behind Asmara, and the Danakil Coast with the port ofAssab. Italy should, in addition, be associated with schemes for african development and, if she received a territory or territories in East Africa under trusteeship, arrangements should be made forher participation in the technical conferences and the measures ofeconomic co-operation which we were promoting in association withthe French and Belgian Governments.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported the pro-posals made in CP. (48) 43. He pointed out, however, that, whileItalian interests in Tripolitania should be safeguarded on the lines proposed, the Italian settlements must become an integral part of libya and subject to the general law of that country.(b) The Cabinet were informed that, though the South african government were understood to favour a United Kingdom trustee-ship for Cyrenaica, it was believed that they would support an italian trusteeship for Tripolitania and would prefer a jointUnited States-Italian trusteeship for Eritrea. As regards italian somaliland, their view was that an outlet should be provided forEthiopia at Mogadishu and that the remainder of the country should be amalgamated with British Somaliland. The Common-wealth Relations Office were anxious that His Majesty&apos;.&quot;? Govern-ment should not commit, themselves to any policy until there had been an opportunity of ascertaining officially the views of the Govern-ments of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand, all of whom were much concerned about the disposal of the former italian colonies. It was therefore suggested that any discussions with theUnited States or the French Governments should be postponed for at least a fortnight.The Foreign Secretary said that it would be difficult to post-pone the opening of discussions for so long a period, but that thoseconducting the discussions on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcould be instructed to avoid any final commitment pending consulta-tions with Dominion Governments.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff wouldhave preferred to see the original scheme for a Greater Somalia
carried out, but they would not be opposed to our supporting theItalian claim to the trusteeship of Italian Somiland and Eritrea, ifthis were the only way of securing agreement to a United Kingdomtrusteeship for Libya.The Cabinet (1) Approved the policy outlined in CP. (48) 43 as a basis forinformal discussion with the United States and french governments on the question of the future of the formerItalian Colonies in Africa.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for the views ofDominion Governments on this matter to be ascertainedas soon as possible: and took note that the foreign secretary would ensure that, pending the receipt of these views, those conducting the discussions on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government would avoid entering into any firm commitment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th February, 1948.
