55cm. 8 (48)LocalAuthorityMeetings,Voting byMembers ofCo-operative societies.(previous reference:CM. (47)94thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Minister of Health said that, in accordance with, the cabinet&apos;s decision of 11th December, a new Clause had been pre-pared for insertion in the Local Government Bill which wouldenable members of co-operative societies and shareholders with a comparable interest in limited liability companies to take part,after disclosing their interest, in proceedings of a local council which affected the interests of their society or company. ThisClause would have the effect of removing the existing disability ifthe total nominal value of a councillors shareholding, whether ina co-operative society or in a company or other body, did not exceed 200 or one-hundredth of the total nominal value of the issuedshare capital., whichever was the less. Copies of the new Clausewere handed to the Cabinet.The Lord President said that it might be argued in debate that,as the market value of shares was often far greater than theirnominal value, a Clause on these lines would remove the disabilityfrom persons whose shareholding in a company was worth substan-tially more than  200. A Clause in this form might not, therefore,be acceptable to some Govenmient supporters; and it was forconsideration whether it might not be preferable to revert to theoriginal proposal of removing the existing disability only from themembers of co-operative societies.In discussion it was pointed out that under the proposed new clause the disability would still apply if the councillors share-holding was more than one-hundredth of the total nominal valueof the issued share capital of the company. This second require-ment would exclude from participation in a eounciPs proceedingspersons who had a substantial measure of interest or control in anycompany affected by those proceedings, whatever the market valueof their shareholding.The Cabinet-Agreed that if a new Clause in the terms of the draftbefore them were moved by a Private Member as an amend-ment to the Local Government Bill, it might be acceptedon behalf of the Government.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.3. The Minister of Health said that it would be convenient if an early debate could be held in the House of Commons on theattitude of the British Medical Association towards the national health Service Act. He would welcome an opportunity of explain-ing the Government&apos;s case in the House of Commons. He doubted whether the Opposition leaders would suggest that a debate shouldbe held; but, if such a suggestion were made from any quarter inconnection with the Statement on Business in the House of commons that afternoon, he hoped that the Lord President would give a sympathetic reply.In discussion Ministers expressed some concern at the situationwhich might arise if in the forthcoming plebiscite a very large majority of the doctors voted against collaboration in the scheme.Many doctors were political supporters of the Government, and ithad also been understood that a majority of the younger doctorswere in favour of a national medical service; but these sections ofthe medical profession showed no signs of speaking or voting infavour of the Act. It was pointed out that at this stage the british medical Association were maintaining the maximum opposition in34933-1 ti 9NationalHealthService.(previous reference:CM. (48) 6thConclusions,Minute 1.)
the hope of extracting further concessions from the Government;and this made it specially important that the Government should show no signs of weakening in their resolve to bring the Act intooperation on 5th July. As that date approached, however, anddoctors had to decide as individuals whether they would come intothe national service, the British Medical Association were likelyto modify their attitude. Ministers agreed that this made it allthe more important that the Government should ensure that the truefacts of the Governments scheme were brought home to the doctors,as individuals, by a sustained campaign of informative publicity.This campaign should be opened at the earliest possible moment;and from that point of view it would be advantageous if an earlydebate could be held in the House of Commons.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to consider how soon, and by what means, a debate might be heldin the House of Commons on the attitude of the medical profession towards participation in the National health service;(2) Reaffirmed their decision of 22nd January that the Govern-ment should undertake an intensive publicity campaign to ensure that full information about the position of doctors under this scheme was made available to thegeneral public and to the medical profession.Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (48) 5thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet were informed that, after the adjournment of. the Second Reading debate on the Parliament Bill in the Houseof Lords, the Opposition leaders had proposed to the Lord privy seal that, in return for an assurance from them that within thecurrent Session they would either allow the Bill to pass throug hall its stages or definitely reject it, the Government should agree toenter into discussions both on the possibility of reforming theconstitution of the House of Lords and on the suggestion made inthe debate that the Bill should be amended so as to give the Houseof Lords adequate time to consider Bills which reached that Houselate in the Session. The Marquess of Salisbury had indicated thatthe Opposition would not seek to raise in these discussions anyquestion relating to the powers of the House of Lords apart fromthis proposed amendment of the Bill. He had also said that theywould not be prepared to give the Bill a Second Reading before thediscussions began. Thus, if the Government agreed to his proposal,the Second Reading debate would be adjourned and the date of itsresumption would depend on the course of the discussions. On theother hand, if his proposal were rejected, it would be open to theOpposition either to reject the Bill on Second Reading or to carry a motion for the adjournment of the debate. Viscount Samuel had supported the suggestion that discussions should take place, but it seemed likely that the Liberal Party would not oppose the SecondReading if they were satisfied that the Bill would be amended onthe lines proposed in the House of Lords debate.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould not agree to any amendment of the Bill which would substantially derogate from its primary object of enabling a Govern-ment to secure the passage of important measures introduced in thelast two years of a Parliament; and it was agreed that the lord president should consider further, in consultation with the chief whip, whether any amendment could be accepted, consistently withthat object, which would give more time for the consideration of bills by the Lords under the Parliament Act procedure. The lord president was asked, in particular, to consider whether an amend-ment could be accepted which gave the House of Lords a minimumnumber of Parliamentary days for consideration of any legislationunder the provisions of the Parliament Act.
On the question whether the Government should agree to enterinto discussions on the basis suggested by the Marquess of Salisbury,some Ministers thought there would be disadvantages in holdingdiscussions which would divert public attention from the narrowissue raised in the Bill to the wider question of the constitution ofthe House of Lords. On the latter issue there was probably somedivergence of view among Government supporters. Moreover, itreopened the question of powers, for it could not be assumed that are formed House of Lords ought to be allowed to retain the powers(e.g., in relation to subordinate legislation) which could safely beleft to the existing House of Lords.The predominant view was, however, that the Governmentwould find it difficult to defend a decision to reject the invitation to enter into discussions. As regards the conditions on which theGovernment should do so, it was urged that from the point of viewof Government supporters it would be preferable if the opposition would agree to give the Bill a Second Reading forthwith, and it waspointed out that it would be open to them to do this without finallycommitting themselves to passing it. The Marquess of Salisburyhad, however, made it clear to the Lord Privy Seal that the Opposi-tion would not agree to this; and their offer either to pass the bill or to reject it definitely in the current Session could fairly beregarded as a concession for, although they could not prevent itsbecoming law by the end of 1949, they were aware that they might,by adjourning the debate whenever it came forward for Second-Reading, create considerable embarrassment for the Government.It was therefore felt that the Government should not insist thatthe Bill should be given a Second Reading before the proposed discussions began.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in return for an assurance from theOpposition that the Parliament Bill would either be passed into law or be definitely rejected before the endof the current Session, the Government should under-take to enter into discussions with representatives ofthe Opposition Parties on (i) the possibility of soamending the Parliament Bill as to give the House ofLords a minimum number of Parliamentary days forconsideration of Bills sent up from the Commons underthe Parliament Act procedure and (ii) the possibility ofsecuring a substantial measure of agreement between theParties on proposals for reforming the constitution ofthe House of Lords;(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal and the LordChancellor, would prepare a draft letter defining thescope of the proposed discussions and the conditions on which the Government were prepared to enter intothem and would circulate the draft for consideration bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 2nd February.The Antarctic. 5.   The Cabinet had decided on 8th January that, in order to(Previous avoid any incident with the Argentines who had established them-reference: selves on Deception Island, the Governor of the Falkland IslandsCM. (48) 2nd should be instructed not to visit that island during his forthcomingConclusions,    tour of inspection of the Dependencies.Minute l.) The Cabinet were now informed that the Governor, on receivingthese instructions, had replied that the Argentine parties in the dependencies were not unfriendly and that there was no risk thathe would become involved in armed conflict with them if he visitedDeception Island. He thought, that, if he refrained from visitingthe island, this might be interpreted by the Argentine Government34933-1 b 3
as a sign of weakness on our part; and he had therefore asked thatthe embargo on his visit should be withdrawn.The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies to with-draw the instruction which he had given to the governor of the Falkland Islands, in pursuance of their decision of8th January, that he should not visit Deception Islandduring his forthcoming tour of inspection of the dependencies.Palestine. 6.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister(Previous (C.P. (48) 31) covering memoranda by the Chancellor of theBeferenee: Exchequer on certain financial and economic questions arising fromC.M.(47)93rd  the British withdrawal from Palestine.Conclusions, The first of these memoranda (E.P.C. (48) 7) contained reeoni-Minute 1.) mendations regarding the line to be taken in negotiating with theUnited Nations Commission for Palestine the handling, after the surrender of the Mandate, of certain financial and economic questions involving British interests, including the&quot; safeguarding ofBritish oil interests and commercial interests and the settlement ofthe assets and liabilities of the Palestine Government.The second memorandum (E.P.C. (48) 8) recommended that palestine and Transjordan should be removed from the sterling area,that the greater part of the sterling balances held by palestine should be blocked, but that the Palestine Currency Board should becontinued for the time being until new arrangements were concludedfor the management of the Palestine currency.The recommendations made in both these memoranda had been endorsed by the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinefs discussion turned on the recommendation that palestine and Transjordan should be excluded from the sterling area. The Cabinet were informed that it was inevitable thatTransjordan as well as Palestine should be removed from the sterling area as both countries now used the same currency. It was hoped, however, that at a later stage Transjordan might be able torejoin the sterling area, and this would be explained to the Trans-jordan GovernmentThe decision to exclude Palestine from the sterling area wouldbe unpopular in Zionist circles in the United States; and the state department should be informed in advance of the public announce-ment, so that they might do anything they could to mitigate public criticism. Dominion Governments should similarly be informed inadvance. Special care must, however, be taken to avoid any premature disclosure of the decision; and the communication to theState Department and to Dominion Governments should be treatedas highly confidential.In further discussion stress was laid on the importance of doing everything possible to safeguard British oil interests in Palestine.Reference was also made to the need for providing our permanent representative at the United Nations with expert assistance inhis discussions with the United Nations Commission for Palestineon these financial and economic questions.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations in the two memorandaannexed to CP. (48) 31 on (i) the exclusion of palestine and Transjordan from the sterling area, and (ii) other financial and economic questions resulting from theforthcoming termination of the British Mandate forPalestine.(2) Invited the Minister of State and the Lord Privy Seal toarrange, respectively, for the United States Governmentand the Dominion Governments to be informed in confidence, in advance of any public announcement, of the
decision to exclude Palestine and Transjordan from the sterling area.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theTreasury to discuss with the Foreign Office how expertassistance could best be made available to our permanent representative at the United Nations in his forthcoming negotiations with the United Nations Commission forPalestine on these financial and economic questions.Wages Policy. 7.   The Cabinet had before them two memoranda (CP. (48) 27(Previous and 28) submitted by the Minister of Labour in pursuance of their reference: decisions of I3th November, rendering a factual report on the cm. (47)87th general trend of wages from 1939 to the end of 1947. and examiningConclusions, tne suggestion that the Government should adopt a more positiveMinute 5.)      wages policy.The report annexed to CP. (48) 27 showed that, with theexception of the period from mid-1946 to mid-1947, during whichwidespread reductions had been made in normal working hours,there had been a continuous rise in wage rates since 1939. Therewas no evidence of pressure for a further reduction in working hours: but the upward tendency in wage rates had been resumed in mid-1947 and there seemed at present to be no prospect of attainingstability. Indeed, the socialised industries seemed likely to give a lead to other industries by granting further wage increases. Withinthe general rise in wage rates, there had been a marked tendency towards equalisation of rates and earnings as between differentgrades in each industry and between men and women, but there were signs of pressure to restore the former relativity in favour of skilled workers.In CP. (48) 28 it was suggested that the Interim Report of theTrades Union Congress on the economic situation and the foreign secretary&apos;s speech in the House of Commons on 22nd -January had confirmed the arguments put forward in CP. (47) 304 and in the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 13th November against the establishment ofmachinery for controlling wages. The Minister saw no sufficient reason why the employees of public boards and local authoritiesshould in this respect be treated differently from those of private firms. It was important, however, that all persons concerned withwage negotiations should be fully conversant with the economic back-ground against which decisions should be taken, and it was therefore proposed that the Government should issue a full explanatory state-ment on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (48) 28. This was based on the draft which had previouslv been submitted to theCabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (47) 303): butthe reference to a Central Appeal Tribunal had been omitted, and additional paragraphs had been inserted to emphasise theimportance of strict adherence to the terms of wage agreements, andto give a warning that the Government would not automaticallyincrease grants or subsidies, or concur in increased prices, in orderto compensate for additional costs resulting from increases in wages.Before&quot; the statement was made public, the Trades Lnion Congressshould be fully consulted.The Cabinet were concerned to note from CP. (48) 27 the extentto which wage rates had risen since mid-1947 and the absence ofany prospect of future stability. It was clear that neither employersnor trade unions had appreciated the implications of full employ-ment on the settlement of wage disputes, and in the present economicsituation of the country it appeared to be incumbent on both theGovernment and the Trades Union Congress to make a more deter-mined effort to educate public opinion and to afford guidance tothose immediately concerned with determining wage rates.Ministers were therefore in agreement with the proposal that theGovernment should issue an authoritative statement on the general economic factors which ought to be taken into accounnt in wage
negotiations. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had prepared a revised draft of such a statement, copies of which were handed tothe Cabinet; and it was agreed that the Lord President, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour should examine this in detail and submit an agreed draft for considerationby the Cabinet at their next meeting.Ministers considered that special steps should be taken toemphasise the significance of the proposed statement. It should bemade by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons and shouldsubsequently be supported and amplified by the fullest publicity campaign. It should be inserted as an appendix to the economic survey. It should be brought specially to the notice of all concernedwith wage negotiations. It was very desirable that the Governmentshould have the full support of the Trades Union Congress in thismatter, and every effort should be made to secure in advance their agreement to the general lines of the statement. The National joint advisory Council might be given advance information of theGovernments intentions.In discussion the following further points were made : (a) It had been the general practice of the Board of Trade totake into account only 80 per cent, of any wage increases in revisingcontrolled prices. This practice would, however, need to be reviewed in the light of the principles set out in the proposed statement.(b) It was suggested that two official secretaries, representingthe Ministry of Labour and the Production Department concerned,should be appointed to each Court of Enquiry set up to investigatea trade dispute. This would ensure that the Court was kept fully informed of the Governments point of view.. (c) It was suggested that the proposed statement should include some indication of the industries regarded by the Government asundermanned. This would have to be done, however, in such a way as to avoid encouraging demands for increased wages in such industries.(d) The Minister of Defence said that, if the general level ofwages continued to increase, he might be compelled to propose a review of Service rates of pay.(e) Better arrangements seemed to be required to ensure that ministers had notice of impending wage claims in time to give theman opportunity for effective intervention.The Minister of Labour undertook to review the machinery in his Department in order to ensure that the Ministers in chargeof the Production Departments were kept informed from time totime of any developments in trade union discussions which might lead to important wage negotiations. Particular cases could then,if necessary, be referred to the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should make an early statement in Parliament on the economic and other con-siderations to be taken into account in wage negotiations.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour, toprepare a revised draft of the proposed statement forconsideration by the Cabinet on 2nd February.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to keep the Ministers incharge of Production Departments fully informed of wagediscussions likely to lead to important negotiations.
Wages.Claim of EoadTransportWorkers.8. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inthe claim for increased wages put forward on behalf of road transport workers serving passenger vehicles. This claim had beenconsidered on 27th January by the Economic Policy Committee, whohad agreed that it would be advantageous if it could be referredto a Court of Enquiry. Meanwhile, the London Transport executive had offered their workers an increase of the weekly rates and ofthe rate for Sunday overtime, which represented an average increaseof 10s. 3d. in the weekly wage. This offer had been rejected by theworkers, and a statement would now be submitted to the Ministryof Labour reporting that the negotiations had broken down. Thisopened the way for the appointment of a Court of Enquiry, so faras concerned the London workers; and the Minister of Labour saidthat he would seek to arrange with those concerned in the claimsmade on behalf of workers outside London that a single Court ofEnquiry should be opened to cover all the workers affected.The Cabinet-Took note of the position.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2$th January, 1948.
