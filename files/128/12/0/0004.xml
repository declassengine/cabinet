27cm. 4 (u8)       17Foreign Travel 1. At their meeting on 8th January the Cabinet had agreedAllowances that, before approving any relaxation of the restrictions on the use and Basic of foreign exchange for tourist travel, they should first consider whatPetrol Ration, prospects there were of restoring a basic petrol ration in the course(Previous of 1948. They now had before them, in addition to the memorandumEeferenees: (CP. (48) 11) on foreign travel which had previously been sub-C.M.(48)2nd mitted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a memorandumConclusions, (CP. (48) 16) by the Minister of Fuel and Power on the basicMinute 2, and petrol ration.CM. (47)74th The Cabinet first discussed the question of restoring a basicConclusions, petrol ration. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, for bothMinute 2.&quot;* political and administrative reasons, he would wish to restore a basicration as soon as practicable. Three conditions must, however,first be satisfied. We must be able to afford the dollar expenditure involved; and our total economies in petrol consumption, of which about four-fifths were due to the abolition of the basic ration, had now reached an annual rate of 880.000 tons, representing at present prices over  10 million in dollars. Secondly, we must be satisfiedthat we should be able to maintain supplies of oil sufficient to meet all our requirements; and the shortage of tankers, which was atpresent the main difficulty under this head, was not likely to be relieved until the second half of 1948. Thirdly, means must be found of limiting the consumption of petrol by commercial users and bythe recipients of &apos;&apos; essential &apos;&apos; and &apos;&apos; supplementary &apos;&apos; allowances and of checking the black market in petrol. Special enquiries werebeing set on foot into these two related problems. It would be inexpedient for the Government to foreshadow the restoration ofany basic ration until it was clear that these preliminary conditionscould be satisfied; and the prospects were at present so uncertainthat it would be unwise to raise hopes which might be disappointed.The main points raised in this part of the Cabinefs discussion were as follows : (a) British oil companies were selling to foreign countries moresterling oil than would be required to restore the basic petrol rationhere, and much of this oil was sold to non-dollar countries. It was true that those sales were taken into account in the bilateral trade negotiations with the countries concerned and that every effort wasmade to secure trading advantages to this country to compensate forthe sales of oil. There were also political reasons for maintaining our exports of oil to certain countries, even when they were notrequited by a corresponding amount of essential imports. A policyof reducing our oil exports to European countries to an extent whichcompelled them either to reduce their industrial production or to claim more dollar oil would be inconsistent with the- principles ofthe European Recovery Programme, which assumed the maximumdegree of economic collaboration between European claimants forMarshall Aid. On the other hand, it was admitted that government control over the sales of sterling oil was not complete. Not all thecompanies were wholly British : their exports were largely deter-mined by long-standing contracts with which the Government hadnot so far thought fit to interfere : and the destination of their exports was influenced to some extent by supply considerations,e.g., supplies to France were delivered in French tankers andprobably could not be diverted elsewhere.These complexities illustrated the difficulty of convincing thepublic that the restrictions on petrol consumption at home resultedin a net saving of dollar expenditure.(V) Attention was drawn to the effect of the petrol restrictionson the dollar-earning capacity of hotels in this country. The ban on private motoring had substantially reduced their normal volume ofbusiness with the result that some were likely tp close downaltogether, others would be unable to afford to re-equip their premisesto standards acceptable to American tourists, and all were losingstaff who might be unwilling or unable to return in the summer months. Unusually large numbers of American tourists would be visiting this country, this- summer, because of the Olympic Games,a4849-l B 2
and it had been estimated that they might spend as much as$30 million here, exclusive of fares in British ships and aircraft.If the conditions in British hotels were such that they curtailedtheir stay, we should lose some of this dollar income in 1948 and,even more important, should seriously prejudice our prospects of earning dollar income from the tourist trade in subsequent years.(c) The restrictions on private motoring were giving rise to serious inconvenience, and even hardship, particularly in rural areas.The administrative difficulties of adjusting supplementary allow-ances of petrol to meet individual needs were very great; and therewas no doubt that the most practical means of reducing presentdiscontents would be to restore a small basic ration. The mosthopeful line of approach to this problem was to try to discover meansof saving, on commercial use and use by the recipients of &apos;&apos; essential&apos;&apos;and &quot; supplementary.&quot; allowances, an amount sufficient to warrant the restoration of a small basic ration.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there was not at present any certain prospect that it would become practicable to relax during the summer of 1948 the existing restrictions on petrol con-sumption in this country; and that in those circum-stances it would be inexpedient for the Government toraise hopes of such relaxation which might in the event be disappointed.(2) Took note with approval of the steps which the Ministerof Fuel and Power was taking to find means of reducingthe consumption of petrol by commercial users and by the recipients of &quot;essential&quot; and &quot;supplementary&quot;allowances as a preliminary to the restoration of a basicpetrol ration.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider whether the restrictionson foreign travel might be relaxed in the summer, even though no corresponding concession could be made in respect of privatemotoring.Ministers were disturbed at the probable public reaction to sucha relaxation. The Government had had to make great efforts tobring home to the public the dangers of the economic situation andthe need for greater effort and for the acceptance of lower standards of consumption. Foreign travel was widely regarded as a luxury;and, if it were now resumed, the public would tend to assume thatthe crisis in our economic position was over and that effort could nowbe relaxed. There was the further difficulty that, owing to theprominence given in 1947 to the prosecution of wealthy individualsfor currency offences, it would be represented that this concession would benefit mainly the least deserving sections of the community.It would be specially embarrassing if, when private motoring was still prohibited in this country, people were allowed to take carsabroad and use there the sterling oil which British companies wereselling to soft-currency countries. There would also be difficulty injustifying to Dominion Governments any general relaxation of these restrictions. Thus, we had pressed all Dominion Governments toreduce their hard-currency expenditure; and it would be difficult for Australians to understand, for example, why they should dowithout Swiss watches when people from the United Kingdom were allowed to spend holidays in Switzerland. Again, in recent tradediscussions we had urged the Eire Government to restrict the supplyof foreign exchange for the purpose of foreign travel from Eire;and it would be embarrassing if we now announced the removal ofour restrictions at the moment when theirs were about to come intooperation. Other difficulties would arise with South Africa. If,therefore, we were to remove these restrictions, it was important thatour reasons for doing so should be fully explained to DominionGovernments in advance; and it would be preferable that the banon travel to Switzerland should be maintained. Would it not bepossible, in any public announcement, to imply that facilities wouldbe given only for travel to the &quot; nearer &quot; European countries?
On the other hand, the Cabinet recognised that the policy for promoting the closer political and economic integration of western europe, which they had approved on 8th January (C.M. (48) 2ndConclusions, Minute 5), would be stultified by the continuance of restrictions which hampered free intercourse between the peoples of western Europe. Foreign travel was not, in fact, the prerogativeof the wealthier classes of the community; and it was important that persons of all classes should be encouraged to travel freelythroughout^ western Europe. The activities of bodies like theWorkers&apos;&quot; travel Association should be encouraged. Foreign travelwas also desirable from the educational angle; and, while special facilities could be granted to persons wishing to go abroad forspecifically educational purposes, it was only by a general relaxation of the ban that the educational benefits of general tourist travelcould be secured. On the economic side, it was a specific conditionof the proposals in CP. (48) 11 that tourist traffic should not be resumed with any country unless we could extract definite advantages in return and could be assured that we should not be involved inthe loss of gold or dollars. No general relaxation of the restrictionswas contemplated; and it should be possible to make it clear to thepublic that limited concessions made on a bilateral basis would not increase our adverse balance of payments. Persons travelling abroad in pursuance of such arrangements should not be allowed to takecars with them. Our intentions could be explained in advance to dominion Governments. It would not, however, be expedient to phrase an announcement in such a way as to imply from the outset that we should in no circumstances be willing to contemplateallowing travel to Switzerland. We might in the event decline tomake such a concession in respect of Switzerland because we could secure no sufficient countervailing advantage; but to refuse inadvance to discuss this question with the Swiss Government, wouldstultify the trade negotiations with the Swiss which were now about to open.Some Ministers still feared that any relaxation of the restric-tions on foreign travel would be misunderstood by the public andwould seriously hamper the Government in enlisting popularsupport for their programme of economic recovery. The genera!view of the Cabinet was, however, that the restoration of somefacilities for foreign travel was essential to the success of theGovernment&apos;^ policy for promoting the political and economic integration of western Europe; and that on this ground a start mustbe made, on the lines suggested in CP. (48) 11, towards the restora-tion of free intercourse between the peoples of western Europe. the presentation of this decision to the public would need careful handling, and the best course would be to relate it primarily to thepolicy of promoting closer understanding between the peoples of western Europe. For this reason it should first be announced inthe course of the Foreign Secretary &apos;s speech in the forthcoming-debate in the House of Commons on Foreign Affairs.The Cabinet-(3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to investigate,on the basis indicated in CP. (48) 11, the possibilities ofproviding foreign exchange for tourist travel to a limited number of countries under bilateral agreements ensuring that this country would receive some countervailingadvantage and would not be involved in loss of gold or dollars.(4) Agreed that the foreign exchange allowances for travel tosuch countries should not exceed the annual rate of 35 for an adult and  25 for a child under 16; and thatno such facilities should be accorded before 1st May,1948.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thisdecision to be notified, and explained, to DominionGovernments in advance of any public announcement.
(6) Agreed that the Govermenfs decision to explore the possi-bility of concluding such agreements should- be announced by the Foreign Secretary in the course of his speech inthe forthcoming debate in the House of Commons onForeign Affairs; and invited the Minister of State andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare and submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a suitable passage onthis question for inclusion in that speech.Civil Aviation. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord(Previous       President (C.P. (48) 17) covering a draft statement of the Govern-Eeferenee:      menfs views on the immediate issues raised by the Interim Report ofC.M,(47)95th   the Committee of Enquiry into the Tudor Aircraft.   This had been conclusions,     prepared in consultation with the Ministers concerned.  The BritishMinute 5.)      Overseas Airways Corporation had also been consulted and para-graph 4 of the draft took account of the fact that, although theCorporation had not yet agreed to use Tudor aircraft on the north atlantic route, they had undertaken to use these aircraft on Empireroutes if the final trials showed that the specifications originallylaid down had been met and a certificate of air worthiness was granted.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The statement did not commit the Government on thequestion of the procedure for the ordering of aircraft for the air-ways corporations. This was to be discussed at a meeting of theCommittee on the Socialisation of Industries on the following day.The conclusions -reached by the Committee would be reported to theCabinet and, meanwhile, the Minister of Civil Aviation did not expect to have any difficulty in dealing on general lines, with any questions about the procedure for ordering aircraft which might beraised in the House of Lords debate on 21st January.(&amp;) It was hoped that the British Overseas Airways Corpora-tion would agree to use Tudor I aircraft, at least for a short time,on the North Atlantic route as a demonstration that the aircraft was suitable for the Atlantic crossing. This was most desirable inview of the orders for delivery of Tudor aircraft to the Argentine.The Cabinet- ;Approved the publication of the Interim Report of theCommittee of Enquiry into the Tudor Aircraft, togetherwith a draft statement on the lines of the Annex to cp. (48) 17, and agreed that a copy of the Report shouldbe given to A. V. Roe, Ltd., two days before publication.Political 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorActivities of    0f the Exchequer (CP. (48) 15) recommending that there should beCivil Servants,  an independent enquiry into the restrictions imposed on the political activities of civil servants.The Cabinet were reminded that a Ministerial Committee hadbeen appointed in 1945 to consider whether any relaxation of theexisting restrictions might be permitted. This Committee ha.dreached the provisional conclusion that there were grounds for making some relaxation, but it had proved difficult for Ministers tofind time for adequate investigation of all the complex issues involved. Moreover, it seemed probable that the findings of anindependent enquiry would be more likely to commend themselves to public opinion. In these circumstances the members of the ministerial Committee were agreed that the best course would be toset up an outside Committee to examine the existing limitations andto recommend any changes that might be desirable in the publicinterest. It was advisable that this Committee should be appointed as soon as possible, as the Staff side of.the Civil Service national whitley Council, and in particular the Post Office staffs, were pressing for some alteration in the present rules.
In discussion, it was pointed out that some Departments hadspecial difficulties in this matter because of the nature of their work,and a general doctrine supported by the authority of an independent committee might prove embarrassing on this account. It was theview of the Cabinet that the Committee should be required to takefully into account the varying circumstances of different Depart-ments. It would, however, be necessary to exercise great care in selecting the members of the Committee, and the Cabinet should havean opportunity of reviewing the question in the light of the member-ship proposed.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the composition of the Com-mittee proposed in CP. (48) 15, and in the light of that discussion would submit the matter for further considera-tion by the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15^ January, 1948.
