Defence.-v.;;,,.Estimates.   ;(previous reference:C.M.(47)13thConclusions,Minute 1.)  -1.  The Cabinet had,before them a note by the Minister ep.V Defence (CP. (48) 2) covering a memorandum on the Defence Estirimates for 1948-49.The Minister of Defence recalled that on 2nd October (CM. (47)78th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinet had approved proposals for reducing the strength of the Armed Forces to 937,000 by 31st March,1948, and to 713,000 by 3lst March, 1949. These man-power figures,subject to the addition of 5,000 boys to the strength of the Army,formed the basis for the Estimates for 1948-49. By making thelargest possible estimating cuts in the figures pat forward by the; Service Departments and the Ministry of Supply, it had beenpossible to reduce . their Estimates from  723-2 million to 692 million, to which there fell to be added   - 6 million on accountof the Ministry of Defence. The recommendations now submitted tothe Cabinet had been approved by the Defence Committee.The Minister added that the Services were still far from free of the liabilities which had fallen upon them as a direct outcome ofthe war and the process of reconversion to peace, and that it mightnot prove possible to reduce the overseas commitments of the armed forces in accordance with the time-table proposed in the autumn of1947. He might therefore be compelled to seek authority for supplementary Estimates.The following points were made in discussion :-(a) The figure of  692-6 million excluded an estimated expenditure of  12 million on civil aviation research and develop-ment. The corresponding expenditure in 1947-48 had been includedin the Defence Estimates for that year.(b) Appendix I to the memorandum annexed to CP. (48) 2 gave a figure of 375,000 for the number of civilian workers engaged on production, research and development, and works for the Services.This was an average figure calculated from a financial estimate and took no account of fluctuations due to changes in production pro-!grammes. Since the end of the war the Services had relied veryargely on accumulated stocks, but, pending the development of new methods of warfare, some production of existing types of weapons and equipment was essential.(c) The sum included in the Estimates for research and develop-ment was as much as could usefully be spent in view of the limita-tions imposed by the shortage of skilled staff.(d) With a view to maintaining morale in the Services and encouraging recruitment, it might be desirable to plan a series of ministerial speeches dealing with the functions of the Armed Forcesonce decisions had been reached on their peace-time shape and size.(e) Figures should be worked out showing the estimated average annual cost of each effective member of the Forces and howfar the increased cost was attributable to improvements in pay andconditions of service made since 1938. ,.The Cabinet- ,(i(1) Approved, for the purpose of the Service Estimates for&apos;&quot;      &apos;   .   1948-49, a total expenditure of  692-6 million divided between the Departments concerned as proposed in para-graph 20 of the memorandum annexed to CP.

(48) 1) covering the third of his periodical reports on the economic situation. .- -,The following points were raised in discussion:- &apos;   ..The Control of Engagement Order was working satisfactorily.Little use had been made of the powers of compulsory direction, butthe knowledge that those powers were available had had a salutaryelect, both in increasing the intake into the undermanned industries and in stabilising employment in industries which had formerlyhad a large turn-over of labour. There were 91,000 foreign workersin employment at the end of the year, including some 53,000 Polesand 30,000 European Volunteer Workers., -The Amalgamated Engineering Union had so far refused toagree to the employment of Poles in the engineering industries. TheCabinet felt that the Union should not be allowed to persist in actionwhich prejudiced our economic recovery. Steps should be taken toensure that full publicity was given to the union&apos;s attitude. Themembers of the union would be unlikely to support their Executiveonce they understood that the latter were now alone in resisting theemployment of Poles.Reference was made to difficulties in finding employment for officers of the Polish Resettlement Corps. It was doubtful whether,in view of the assurances given to them, these Poles could be directedinto employment and there was at present a substantial residue whohad declined the offers of work made to them. The Cabinet agreedthat the possibility of winding up the Corps should be examined bythe Labour Committee.In spite of some improvement in recent months, the numbers employed in the textile industries were still one-fifth less than beforethe war. Since these industries were not affected by shortages of plant or raw materials, might not greater attention be devoted toways and means of strengthening the labour force and increasing itsproductive efficiency? It might be advantageous if representativesof both sides of the industry could be invited to London for dis-cussions with the Prime Minister. The Cabinet were informed thatthe President of the Board of Trade proposed to circulate shortly to the Production Committee a report by an official working party on the possibilities of increasing textile production, and it wasagreed that this question should be further considered in the lightof the Committee&apos;s conclusions.Stocks of pig-iron and steel scrap were still dangerously low,though there had been some improvement in the collection of scrap,as a result of the satisfactory response to the special appeal recently made to industrial firms. There had so far been no undue drain on coal stocks during the winter.The drain on our reserves of gold and dollars continued at aserious rate. The outcome of the bilateral negotiations had so far been to intensify our dollar problem in 1948, since we had been compelled to concede dollar allocations substantially in excess ofexpectations. Unless we obtained assistance under Marshall Aidwe should be forced to impose further drastic cuts on imports offood and raw materials.The Cabinet--(1) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to arrange for appropriate publicity.      to be given to the attitude of the amalgamated engineering Union towards the employment of Poles inthe engineering industries.,  (2) Invited the Labour Committee to consider what steps couldbe taken to enable the Polish Resettlement Corps to bewound up at an early date.(3) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade pro-posed shortly to circulate to the Production Committeea report by an official working, party on the possibilities
of increased textile production, and agreed to consider this question further in the light of the conclusions reached by the Production Committee.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (47) 338) covering amemorandum which had been considered by the Production Com-mittee on the subject of restrictions on mid-week sport in 1948.The Production Committee had recommended that the restrictions imposed in 1947 should be maintained in 1948 and that no specialtrains should be run in 1948 in connection with sporting events.The Home Secretary said that the main question for decision was whether legislation should be introduced to extend the operationof the Dog Racecourse Betting (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1947,after 30th June, 1948. Nearly all greyhound tracks now belonged toone or other of two organisations and it would be possible this yearto secure an agreement with them by which each track would holdone meeting on Saturday and one on another week-day after 7 p.m.If an arrangement on these lines was not regarded as satisfactory and a Bill had to be introduced to extend the xlct of 1947 theGovernment spokesman would have to be able to show that even ifmid-week meetings were held only after 7 p.m. production wouldbe affected adversely. The restrictions on football and on horseracing which had been agreed in 1947 with the Football associations and the Stewards of the Jockey Club and the National Hunt Clubhad worked satisfactorily, and he proposed to seek agreement on similar restrictions for the 1948-49 football reason and the 1948horse-racing season. This would mean that the main hoise-racingevents and all but a few of the football matches drawing largecrowds would be held on Saturdays. There had been some complaintabout the interference with production caused by the holding of theLincolnshire Handicap on a week-day in 1947, and it might bedesirable to ask that it also should be held on a Saturday. As in1947, there would be no attempt to impose restrictions on mid-weekcricket matches.In discussion there was general agreement that the restrictions imposed in 1947 should be retained. While it was difficult to obtainconclusive information from all areas, all the reports which theMinistry of Labour had been able to collect suggested that the relaxation of these restrictions would interfere with production, andthe fact that late shifts were being worked in mining areas made it impossible to contemplate any arrangement under which mid-weekgreyhound races might be allowed after 7 p.m. The possibility of imposing restrictions on greyhound racing after 30th June, 1948, bythe use of the powers contained in the Supplies and Services(Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, should, however, be explored.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to seek agreement with the Football Associa-tions and the Stewards of the Jockey Club and theNational Hunt Club on the imposition of restrictions onmid-week football and horse-racing corresponding tothose imposed in 1947, on the understanding that theHome Secretary would propose to the Stewards of theJockey Club that the Lincolnshire Handicap should beheld on a Saturday.(2) Agreed that mid-week greyhound racing should be pro-hibited in 1948 and invited the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland to consider and reportto the Legislation Committee whether it would not bersible to enforce the prohibition after 30th June, 1948.. the use of the powers conferred by the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945, as extended by34848-1     .

. the Supplies and Services (Extended Purposes) Act,1947.(3) Agreed that if it should prove necessary to introduce a Billto extend the provisions of the Dog Racecourse Betting(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1947, the Minister ofLabour and the Production Ministers should assist theHome Secretary in the proceedings on the Bill inParliament.Samme? 4.  The Cabinet considered the proposals of the Home SecretaryTime. arid the Secretary of State for Scotland, submitted in CP. (47) 338,(Previous regarding the duration of summer time in 1948.Reference: The Cabinet were reminded that they had already decided, onC.M.(47)52nd 5th June, 1947, that double summer time should not be introducedConclusions, in 1948. It was now proposed that the total period of single summerMinute 3.) time should be seven and a half months, as in 1947; and that itshould extend from 14th March to 31st October.The Minister of A griculture said that he raised no objection tothis proposal. The inconvenience to farmers would be offset to someextent by the advantages to persons cultivating allotments.The Cabinet Agreed that summer time in 1948 should extend from 14thMarch to 31st October.Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:C.M.(47)87thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CP. (47) 337) on the reform of the constitution of the Houseof Lords.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Opposition Parties in theHouse of Lords must shortly decide whether or not they shouldobstruct the passage of the Parliament Bill; and it was possiblethat they would seize this opportunity for seeking agreement to somereform of the constitution of the House of Lords. He wished todiscuss with his colleagues in advance how he should handle suchan approach, if it were made. The Labour Party were not com-mitted to Single-Chamber Government: and, if that were ruled out,there seemed to be three possible courses: (i) to leave things asthey were; (ii) to seek a basis of agreement with the other Partiesfor satisfactory reform of the existing House of Lords; or (iii) toestablish a Second Chamber on some form of elected basis. The firstcourse must be unsatisfactory to any Labour Government; and thethird opened up a range of constitutional problems which were socomplex and controversial that it offered little prospect of practicalprogress, He therefore favoured the second course, and he suggestedthat the Cabinet should now define the conditions on which theywould be prepared to enter into discussions with a view to seeing whether agreement could be reached between the Parties on proposalsfor reforming the constitution of the existing House of Lords. Inparagraph 4 of his memorandum he had set down five conditionswhich seemed to him to be essential from the Governments pointof view: (i) The powers of the Second Chamber should not exceed thosewhich would be left to the House of Lords after thepassage of the current Parliament Bill (with any amend-ments accepted by the Government);(ii) There should be power to create Life Peers;(iii) The hereditary right to attend and vote in the House ofLords should be abolished;(iv) Members of the Second Chamber should receive a reasonablesalary; and(v) The constitution of the Second Chamber should not be suchas to ensure a permanent majority for any political party.
CM. 1 (48); In Appendix 1 of his memorandum he had outlined a possible&apos;scheme for reconstituting the House of Lords in conformity withthose conditions. This reflected the fact that the effective work ofthe House of Lords was carried out almost entirely by men who hadbeen made Peers during their own life-time. It was, however, putforward at this stage only as an illustration of the type of reformwhich would satisfy the primary conditions set out in paragraph 4of the memorandum. The first need was for the Cabinet to cleartheir minds about the governing conditions on which they wereErepared to enter into discussions on the reform of the House ofords; and thereafter to ascertain, by confidential discussion at a party meeting, whether those conditions would be acceptable to their supporters.Discussion first turned on the question whether the Governmentshould consider promoting during the life-time of the present parliament legislation reforming the constitution of the House ofLords. Opinion was divided on this question. On the one hand itwas argued that the issue could not be avoided, for some proposalsfor reforming the constitution of the House of Lords were likelyto be put forward by the Opposition Parties in connection with theproceedings on the Parliament Bill; and, as some of the opposition leaders in the House of Lords were anxious to avoid a conflict over that Bill, circumstances were favourable for securing agreement to proposals for reforming the House of Lords which were acceptable to the Government. If this opportunity were not taken, a Conserva-tive Government might at a later stage force through reforms far less acceptable to the Labour Party than those which might be securednow. Members of the present Government had doubtless made inthe past statements critical of the powers of the Second Chamber;but tew of those statements were inconsistent with the retention ofa House of Lords whose functions were limited to those of a revisingChamber. The scheme outlined by the Lord Privy Seal accordedwith the British tradition of securing constitutional, changes byadapting existing institutions; and its main features the creationof Life Peers and the abolition of the hereditary right to attend and vote in the House of Lords were likely to appeal to a majority ofGovernment supporters. It would, however, be wise, before entering into any discussions with representatives of the other Parties, toinform both the Parliamentary Labour Party and the national executive of the Labour Party that the Government were disposed to enter into such discussions and to ascertain their attitude towardsthe governing conditions set out in paragraph 4 of CP. (47) 337.On the other side it was argued that it was unnecessary for theGovernment to make any political concessions for the purpose of ensuring the passage of the Parliament Bill. Public interest in thisquestion had subsided, and it was possible that the House of Lordsmight pass the Bill during the present Session: even if they didnot, it could be passed under the provisions of the Parliament Actbefore the end of the present Parliament, at the cost of some incon-venience in the arrangement of the remaining Sessions.&quot; On the otherhand, there would be great political disadvantages in raising thegeneral issue of House of Lords reform. There was no settled bodyof opinion on this question in the Labour Party-, and, once thequestion was thrown open for discussion, many difficult and contro-versial issues would be raised on which there might well prove to bewide differences of opinion within the Party. It was true that thescheme suggested by the Lord Privy Seal proposed no very drastic changes; but, once the issue was raised, discussion could not be confined to the merits of that scheme it must extend to the wider questions whether any Second Chamber was necessary at all and,if so, what the ideal form of Second Chamber would be. There wasno practical or political necessity for deciding these difficult issuesat the present time; and the Government would be open to serious criticism if they allowed Parliament to occupy itself with thesematters at the cost of postponing urgent measures of social andeconomic reform.
Some Ministers also felt that, if a Labour Governmentaddressed themselves at all to the problem of securing a reformedSecond Chamber, they could not be content with patching up theexisting House of Lords on the lines of the scheme suggested in(CP, (47) 337. They should approach the problem from a logical,;not an historical angle, by defining the proper functions of a second chamber and designing a &quot;body constituted to discharge thosefunctions with the maximum efficiency. All&apos;the suggestions for alternative forms of Second Chamber, including the idea of an industrial or economic Assembly, would have to be seriously considered. &quot; &quot;. The point was also made that neither the Government nor theLabour Party were at present under any obligation to defend the many anomalies and historical survivals in the existing constitutionof the House of Lords. If, however, the Government associated themselves with any plan for reforming the House of Lords, theywould have to defend whatever anomalies or survivals that planfailed to remove.It was also argued that if, the constitution of the House ofLords were reformed, its exercise of its existing powers would bemade more effective. Some Ministers who had been content that theexisting House of Lords should retain the powers with which itwould be left by the current Parliament Bill felt that the positionwould no longer be satisfactory if those powers were exercised bya more effective Chamber. They considered, in particular, thatit would be wrong to entrust to a reformed Second Chamber anunfettered power to frustrate subordinate legislation enacted byOrder in Council.Finally, it was suggested that, if the Labour Party were con-suited on the question of House of Lords reform, it might well befound that they favoured proposals substantially more drastic thanthose outlined in CP. (47) 337. And if, as a result, the Governmentwere compelled to put forward some proposals more far-reachingthan these, would not the other Parties argue that the Governmenthad no mandate from the electorate to deal with this issue?In discussion the following particular points were also made : (a) Several Ministers stressed the practical advantages of the opportunities for amending Government legislation during its passage through the House of Lords. If these opportunities of amendment were lost, through alterations in the procedure of the two houses, the speed at which Government legislation could be passed through the House of Commons would be substantially lessened andthe volume of Government legislation would, in consequence, bereduced.(b). The scheme of reform outlined in CP. (47) 337 contem-plated that five Bishops representing the Established Church shouldcontinue to sit in the House of Lords. Some Ministers felt that itwould be preferable to make no change in the existing representationof the Established Church. Other Ministers felt, however, that ifthe Government were associating themselves at all with any schemefor reforming the constitution of the House of Lords, they would find it embarrassing to reject the strong claims to representationwhich were certain to be made by the Nonconformist Churches and: perhaps by other religious communities. This illustrated the kindof controversy which would be provoked by any proposals forreforming the House of Lords, and was among the reasons advanced by some Ministers for refraining altogether from opening this issue.(c) The scheme outlined in CP. (47) 337 contemplated that all existing Peers of the first creation should automatically be entitledto sit and vote in the reformed Chamber. Some Ministers thoughtit would be difficult to defend so large a breach in the principle of abolishing the hereditary right to attend and vote. They consideredthat, if any such scheme were to go forward, Peers of the firstcreation should not become active members of the reformed Chamberunless they were otherwise qualified for membership.\
/r,; , (rf) The fifth of the governing conditions suggested in para-Waph 4 of CP. (47) 337 was that the constitution of the reformedSecond Chamber should not be such as to ensure a permanentmajority for any political Party. How was this to be secured?The Lord Privy Seal said that, under the kind of scheme which he contemplated, there could, of course, be no guarantee that theGovernment of the day would always be able to command an effectivemajority in the House of Lords. All that he had in mind was thatthe Government should not agree to any method of constituting theHouse of Lords which would perpetuate the existing situation inwhich the Conservative Party had an overwhelming majority in thetotal number of Peers entitled to attend and vote.T (e) One of the advantages of the course proposed in cp. (47) 337 was that it would give power to create Life Peers andto pay them a reasonable salary. This would help to overcome thedifficulty of finding Labour supporters who were willing and ableto serve in the House of Lords. It should not be overlooked thatthis difficulty was a serious handicap in working the existing Parlia-mentary system when- a Labour Government was in office.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, stressed thepractical and political difficulties of seeking to establish an idealform of Second Chamber. In matters of constitutional reform therewere great dangers in trying to be too logical. It was more inaccordance with British traditions to build on the past by adaptingexisting institutions, however illogical that course might be. TheHouse of Lords was founded on the hereditary principle; but itwould be quite in accordance with British constitutional develop-ment to retain the House of Lords while abolishing reditaryprinciple. It was for these reasons that he had been attracted bythe scheme outlined in the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum. Thediscussion had, however, shown that a scheme for reforming theHouse of Lords on these lines might not command the general support of the Cabinet; and further that, if any consultations onthis question were now held with the Parliamentary Labour Party,the Government might be pressed to advocate more drastic measureswhich could not be put forward without arousing keen controversy.There was the further point that nothing should be said at this stagewhich might encourage the Opposition Parties in the House of lords to delay the passage of the Parliament Bill in the hope of extractingother concessions from the Government. In all the circumstances he was inclined to think that the better course would be to keep tothe line, approved by the Cabinet on 13th November, that the parliament Bill must first be passed into law before any discussions were opened for the reform of the House of Lords, that the Govern-ment were not themselves prepared to take any initiative in seekingan agreed basis for such reform, but that, after the Parliament bill had received the Royal assent, they would be ready to consider any proposals for reform which might be put forward by representativesof the other political Parties. This was the line taken in his speech in the House of Commons on 11th November (Hansard, Column 316)and in the reply given by the Lord Privy Seal to a Question-byLord Samuel m the House of Lords on 18th November (Hansard,Column 702).The Lord President asked whether the Lord Privy Seal mightnot at least be authorised to inform the Leader of the conservative party in the House of Lords that, when the Parliament Bill had been passed into law, the Government would be ready to enter intobona fide discussions with representatives of the other political parties on the question of modifying the existing composition of theHouse of Lords. In reply it was pointed out that such a promisewould bind the Government to entering upon discussions on a basis which would prevent them, for example, from proposing the abolitionof the House of Lords, and would commit them to the principle of framing a revised Second Chamber by modifying the existing Houseof Lords. The fact was that the Government could not undertaketo enter into discussions on such a basis without first consulting the
i- i Parliamentary Labour Party; and prior consultation, with the&apos;,    it Party might have the result that the Government would have to enteris.-; i? into discussions with some limitations on their discretion in negotia-tion. For this latter reason it was still important to preserve the-ir, condition, on which the.Cabinet had hitherto insisted, that the;:   ^Government should take no initiative in this matter but should waitvm. ;&apos; for proposals to be submitted to them by the Opposition Parties.i-iji-Consultation with the Parliamentary Labour Party could then takeplace on the basis of those proposals.!&quot;f /       The Cabinet-    , J &apos;^   - &apos;J&apos; ]&apos;&apos;[ -\;      - ,,J,.
