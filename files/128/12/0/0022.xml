The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (48) 83) covering the draft of a Five-Power Treaty which hadbeen provisionally agreed by the diplomatic representatives of thefive Governments in Brussels on 12th March.The Minister of State explained the provisions of the draft. no special difficulty had been found in negotiating it, and the treaty was likely to be ready for signature by 17th March in substantially the form in which it had been submitted to the Cabinet.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chiefs of Staff were studying the implications of thedefence clauses of the Treaty. It was greatly to be hoped that theUnited States Government would see tneir way to guarantee thisdefensive alliance of the western European Powers.(b) It seemed desirable that the defence obligations of theTreaty should come into operation only in the event of an unprovoked aggression upon one of the signatories. Was it sufficiently clear thatthe language of Article IV of the draft would limit these obligations to occasions when the aggression Avas unprovoked? The cabinet invited the Minister of State to look into this point, keeping inmind the importance of not appearing to weaken the defence pro-visions of the Treaty.(c) The Cabinet were assured that Article IV would cover an armed attack on Gibraltar or Malta.(d) Article I was so framed as to enable the overseas territories of the signatory Powers to make their contribution towards theeconomic recovery of Europe.(e) Dominion Governments had been kept in touch with theprogress made in preparing the draft Treaty.(/) The Foreign Office should take special steps to ensure that full publicity was given to the conclusion of the Treaty. The british broadcasting Corporation should make a special feature of it, in both their home and overseas services; and full use should be madeof the news-reels. Further publicity on western Union should bearranged to follow up the original announcement. There was some danger that public comment might concentrate mainly on the defenceclauses of the Treaty; and to counteract this special emphasis shouldbe laid on the advantages of the economic provisions. The ForeignOffice might provide guidance on the points to be stressed in ministerial speeches over the next few weeks.The Cabinet-Approved the draft of the Five-Power Treaty annexed to cp. (48) 83; and authorised the Foreign Secretary to signa treaty in this form, subject to any minor changes whichmight be adopted as a result of the negotiations which were still continuing in Brussels.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (48) 84) on the results of the HavanaConference on Trade and Employment.The Cabinet were informed that the Final Act of theConference would probably be signed on 22nd March by virtually allthe participating countries. Its main task had been to consider thedraft Charter for an International Trade Organisation prepared at the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee at Geneva in1947. Signature of the Final Act would not involve a formalcommitment to accept the Charter, or even to recommend acceptanceto national legislatures, but the signature of the United kingdom delegate would undoubtedly be taken to mean that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intended to recommend the Charter to Parliament.The draft agreed at Geneva has been substantially accepted bythe Conference. On three major issues, however, changes had been introduced on which the United Kingdom Delegate had reserved hisposition pending final  instructions by Ministers.    First,  the
Conference had adopted an amended Article which weakened thepower of the Organisation to control the use of restrictive quotas forthe protection of infant industries in under-developed countries.This Article would be criticised by export interests in this country,but it was in line with the views expressed by the Economic PolicyCommittee on 30th December, 1947 (E.P.C. (47) 15th Meeting,Minute 1) and was strongly supported by Dominion Governments.Secondly, difficulties had arisen over the provisions of the Genevadraft on non-discrimination. Since CP. (48) 84 was circulated,however, agreement had been reached on an Article which wouldenable members of the Organisation to choose whether to operate under the transitional provisions of the International monetary fund Agreement, or on the basis of the arrangements in force on15th February, 1948, or under the provisions of the Geneva draft.This was acceptable to us, and would mean that, so long as we werein balance of payments difficulties, no restrictions would be imposed on our right to discriminate up to 1952; thereafter, no new formsof discrimination could be introduced without the prior approval ofthe Organisation, but existing arrangements could continue, subjectto challenge. Thirdly, the Conference had departed from theprinciple of the Geneva draft that no new preferences should be created and no existing preferences increased. It had now beenagreed that no obstacle should be placed in the way of newpreferential systems, provided that they were between countries inthe same &apos;&apos; economic region &apos;&apos; and were calculated to assist in their economic development. It was proposed to insert in the Charter an explanatory note which would enable the Organisation to interpret the term &apos;5 economic region &apos;&apos; as applicable to parts of the BritishCommonwealth. While the final draft was in some respects less acceptable to us than the Geneva draft, we should not be supported,even by Commonwealth Delegations, in pressing for the further changes which we should like to see incorporated in it. Refusal to sign would appear inconsistent with our attitude set out in the joint statement published in 1945 (Cmd. 6709) and with our active partici-pation in the work of the Preparatory Committee, and would seriously endanger the tariff concessions to which the United states administration had agreed. It was, therefore, recommended thatthe United Kingdom Delegate should be instructed to sign the FinalAct without reservation.In discussion, it was suggested that the provisions of the draftCharter relating to non-discrimination would be more readilyaccepted by Parliament if an assurance could at the same time begiven that they would replace the obligations imposed by Article of the Anglo-American Financial Agreement. It was pointed outthat the United States Government were unable to modify the termsof that Agreement without the approval of Congress. But it hadbeen made clear in the Agreement that the provisions of Article 9were in anticipation of more comprehensive multilateral arrange-ments, and it could reasonably be assumed that Congress would inin due course agree to an appropriate modification of the Agreement.It was proposed to take the matter up with the United StatesGovernment immediately with a view to a submission being made to congress when they were asked to.ratify the Charter. The Charterwould not be submitted to Parliament for ratification until Congresshad reached a decision.Some dissatisfaction was expressed with the terms of the revisedArticle relating to new preferences. Ministers felt that the greater freedom allowed by the revised text might prove seriouslydisadvantageous to us, and that there was a risk of serious discrimination -nation against the British Commonwealth in this matter. Thephraseology of the revised Article and explanatory note was vagueand ambiguous; moreover, no definite obligation was imposed on theOrganisation to interpret the Article on the broader lines suggestedby the explanatory note. These provisions of the Charter would undoubtedly be criticised in Parliament as a blow to the system of commonwealth economic integration created at Ottawa. against this, it was pointed out that the revised Article was acceptable to
Dominion Governments, and we could look for no support from themin further opposition to it. The best answer to criticism would bethat in present circumstances the economic integration of theCommonwealth could be secured more effectively by means of bulk purchase, long-term contracts and development schemes than by anypreferential system. Nevertheless, the United Kingdom delegation should continue to try to secure a more acceptable form of words.If this should not prove possible, the United Kingdom Delegate, insigning the Final Act, should make it clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment interpreted the Article, in conjunction with theexplanatory note, as meaning that it would be incumbent on theOrganisation to treat proposals for new preferences within theBritish Commonwealth on the same basis as other proposals coveredby the Article. He should also make it clear that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had accepted the terms of this Article with reluctanceand would maintain a close watch to ensure that there was in practiceno discrimination against the British Commonwealth in this matter.Full publicity should be given to this declaration.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Delegate should beauthorised to sign the Final Act of the World Conferenceon Trade and Employment, on the understanding that, ifhe had failed to secure any improvement in the Articledealing with new preferences, he would, before signing,make a statement, on the lines suggested in the Cabinet discussion, regarding the attitude of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment towards that Article of the Charter.(2) Approved the consequential amendments to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade set out in Appendix 11to CP. (48) 84.Town and country planning.Claims for loss ofDevelopmentValue: Pay-ment of Pro-(essional Feesincurred byClaimants.(previous reference:C.M. (46) 107thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Town and country planning (CP. (48) 82) proposing that the Central Land board should be empowered to pay professional fees incurred by landownersin claiming compensation for loss of development value under theTown and Country Planning Acts of 1947.In support of this proposal it was argued that there was muchto be said in equity for relieving private individuals of costs whichthey would not have had to incur but for the action of parliament in depriving them of part of the value of their property. This hadbeen urged when the Bills were before Parliament, and the minister had then promised to consider the point. The proposal was alsosupported, however, on the ground that it would greatly simplify theadministrative task of determining development values. It wouldbe of substantial assistance to the Central Land Board if ownersemployed competent professional advisers to give an opinion on thedevelopment value, to negotiate with Government experts and, where necessary, to appear at arbitration.On the other hand, some Ministers thought it would be wrong in principle for the Government to pay such fees. How could thepurchase of development rights be distinguished from various othertransactions in which the State was committed to pay some form ofcompensation to individuals? A dangerous precedent would beestablished if the Government admitted that the individual was entitled to recover the cost of professional services which heemployed in his dealings with Government Departments. Moreover,if the Government offered to pay professional fees, there was a risk that unreliable and unscrupulous people might be encouraged to setthemselves up as advisers to claimants.In further discussion it was suggested that consideration mightbe given to the possibility of establishing some Government organisa-tion of valuers, paid by salary, whose assistance would be madeavailable without charge to owners claiming loss of development
value. Alternatively, might the Government form a panel of approved valuers for&quot; this purpose and prescribe the fees which theycould properly charge for this work ?The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Town and Country Planning, to review the position inthe light of the Cabinets discussion and to considerwhether other means could be devised of meeting theadministrative difficulties outlined in CP. (48) 82.Wages Policy.Pay of SeniorPolice Officers.(previous reference:CM. (48) 20thConclusions,Minute 5.) &apos;4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary(CP. (48) 74) and by the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (48) 81) about a proposal to introduce higher scales of pay for senior police officers.The Home Secretary said that in 1946 agreement had beenreached on revised scales of pay for police officers below the rank ofsuperintendent. He had then appointed a committee to submit proposals for rationalising and reducing the excessive number ofscales of pay for chief constables, and a similar committee had&quot; beenappointed in December 1947 on the pay of superintendents. Theformer committee had recommended revised scales of pay for chief constables and assistant chief constables and, though he was notobliged to do so, he had thought it right to refer their recommenda-tions to the Association of Municipal Corporations and the CountyCouncils Association. The former Association had accepted the new scales, but the latter had eventually reported on 29th January thattheir executive council had decided to refer the proposals back totheir police committee, which was tantamount to rejecting them.The police were being called upon to discharge very heavy responsi-bilities at a time when most forces were undermanned, and he feltthat if the Government did not give effect to the revised scales, whichwould have been brought into operation long since but for thedilatoriness of the local authority associations, they would be opento a charge of bad faith and his own relations with senior police officers would be seriously prejudiced. The then Secretary.of Statefor Scotland had rejected a suggestion that the work of thecommittees should cover Scotland and, this being so, it seemedunreasonable that the difficulties of applying corresponding scalesto the Scottish police should stand in the way of their application inEngland and Wales.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, if higher-payscales for senior police officers were brought into force, he thoughtit would be impossible to resist the demands of the Police Federationfor further increases in pay for police officers below the rank ofsuperintendent, and this, in turn, would be held to justify claims forincreased pay from members of the fire service and, possibly, fromother local authority employees. The three associations of localauthorities in Scotland had rejected the revised scales proposed forchief constables and assistant chief constables, and he did not see how, in the light of the policy announced in the White Paper on personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321), the Governmentcould compel the Scottish police authorities to accept these scales.On the other hand, it would cause grave discontent if senior police officers in Scotland were paid less than the correspondingofficers in England and Wales. He therefore suggested that theindependent committee on police pay and conditions of service,which the Home Secretary and he had undertaken to appoint in 1949as part of the settlement reached with the Police Federation in1946, should be appointed immediately, and that an appeal shouldbe made to senior police officers to allow their claims to be consideredby this committee along with those of constables, sergeants andinspectors.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reluctantly-come to the conclusion that the proposed increases in the pay of senior police officers ought to be deferred. The Government hadspecifically undertaken to observe the principles set out in the white paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices and, if the proposed increases were granted, their position would be compromised.In discussion there was general recognition of the difficult position in which the Home Secretary would be placed if the revisedscales were not brought into force. It was contended, however, thatthe deliberations of the committees could not properly be regardedas negotiations in a process of collective bargaining completed beforethe publication of the White Paper and that the Government couldnot therefore enforce the scales without a serious breach of the policy laid down in the White Paper. Whilej therefore, it was accepted that the Home Secretary&apos;s proposals could fairly be regarded asdoing no more than give chief constables and superintendents animprovement in pay corresponding to that obtained by the lowerranks in 1946, it was the Cabinet&apos;s view that there was no alternative to asking these officers to accept the position that in present circum-stances the application of the new scales must be postponed. If theHome Secretary so desired, the Prime Minister or the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would join with him in conveying this decision to representatives of chief constables and superintendents.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer for the time being the application of the revised scales of pay for chief constables, assistant chief constables and superintendents proposed in CP. (48) 74.Cabinet Office, S.W 1,15th March, 1948.
