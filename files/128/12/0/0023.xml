1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inin the House of Commons in the following week.Immediately, after the Easter Recess the Chancellor of theExchequer would open his Budget, and the combined debate on theBudget and the Economic Survey for 1948 would be taken on 6th,7th, 8th, 12th and 13th April.Time would have to be found for a general debate on ForeignAffairs in the fairly near future, but it should be possible to resist any demand that this should take place before the Easter Recess.Reference was made to a Motion which had been tabled by anumber of Government supporters expressing regret at the PrimeMinisters statement on 15th March about the employment of Com-munists in certain branches of the Civil Service. The cabinet considered that the Government Whips should have been consulted before this was tabled, and the Chief Whip was invited to take thismatter up with those responsible for the Motion.The Cabinet were informed that legislation might be requiredto provide for the medical supervision of day nurseries in factories.The Minister of Health was invited to bring this matter before theLegislation Committee, which was to hold on 23rd March a further review of the Legislative Programme for the current Session.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 88) about the effect on parliamentary procedure of the new system of equalisation grants which was to be introduced by the Local Government Bill. Mr.Speaker&apos;s advisers had ruled that, after this Bill became law, any bill which affected rateable values or authorised an increased charge on the rates would have to be supported by a Financial Resolutionauthorising any consequential increase in equalisation grant. Thememorandum therefore recommended that the House of commons should be invited to pass a resolution to the effect that during thecurrent session the Standing Orders and practice of the Houserelating to provisions embodying charges on the public revenueshould not be deemed to apply to provisions in any Bill (whether public or private) affecting rateable values or authorising anincreased charge on the rates by reason only that this might operate to increase the amount of equalisation grant. In moving this resolution the Government spokesman should explain that it was merely a transitional measure designed to meet the immediate situation and that the Government were considering what theproper procedure should be in future sessions. They were at presentdisposed to think that there should be no change of procedure inrespect of public Bills, and that such of those Bills as affectedequalisation grant should in future be supported by a financial resolution; but that some modification might be required in therules of procedure governing private legislation which authorisedrate-borne expenditure. The memorandum indicated the lines onwhich private Bill procedure might be modified in future sessions.In discussion it was agreed that a resolution in the terms ofthe first alternative draft set out in the Annex to CP. (48) 88 shouldbe moved before the Local Government Bill became law. It was likely that the Bill would be presented for the Royal Assent on24th&quot; March.As regards future sessions, the position must be regularised,but further consideration was required before it was finally decidedwhat changes in procedure were needed. In particular, the localauthority associations should be consulted about any changes in private Bill procedure.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to arrange for a resolution tobe moved in the House of Commons, in the terms of thefirst alternative draft set. out in the Annex to cp. (48) 88, before the Local Government Bill was presented for the Royal Assent;-2 b 2
(2) Asked the Lord President to settle, in consultation with thePrime Minister, who should speak on behalf of theGovernment in support of this resolution;(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord President, the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Scotland, to consider furtherwhat changes should be made in the future procedure of the House of Commons governing legislation, whether public or private, affecting equalisation grant.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (48) 77) covering memoranda by the three service ministers on the need for additional accommodation for the services in the United Kingdom. They also had before them a memorandumby the Minister of Health (CP. (48) 87) setting out the arrange-ments for allocating available building resources among the various departments interested in the building of houses.The Cabinet were informed that all the Services wereexperiencing difficulty through the continued use of hutted accom-modation, which was deteriorating rapidly, and that much of theantiquated barrack accommodation now used by the Royal&apos; navy and the Army ought to be replaced or reconditioned. There wasalso a serious shortage of married quarters in all three Services;and the Army, and to a somewhat lesser degree the other two services, were in urgent need of up-to-date drill halls and other accommodation for the territorial and auxiliary forces. This lastrequirement was of special urgency, for the Secretary of State forWar estimated that, unless work was begun early in 1949 on a five-year programme of permanent building, involving an expenditureof  13 million a year, the Territorial Army would be quite unableto handle the National Service reservists for whom provision mustbe made from 1st January, 1950, onwards.The following points were made in discussion: (a) An interdepartmental committee, with a Ministry of Healthchairman, met quarterly to consider the needs of GovernmentDepartments, including the Service Departments, for the provisionof houses. This committee considered the programmes for married quarters, and arranged for proposals for providing married quarters in particular areas to be considered locally in relation tothe building resources available and to other claims for houses inthe area. These requirements of the Services should continue to betreated as part of the general housing programme.(&amp;) The Minister of Works had announced on 15th March that additional licences for maintenance, repair and minor works wouldbe issued in any areas where, owing to the reduction in the capital investment programme, building workers had become available for whom the Ministry of Labour could find no alternative employmentin essential work. If in these areas there was an urgent need for additional workers for work on maintenance or minor adaptationfor the Services, application should be made to the appropriateRegional Director of the Ministry of Works.(c) Proposals for new building in 1949, including the provisionof new buildings for the Territorial Army, should be submitted tothe Investment Programmes Committee, who were aiming at sub-mitting by July 1948 a report on the investment programme for1949. There were, however, certain areas in which the needs of theTerritorial Army could be met by acquiring and adapting existingpremises and it might be possible to put some of this work in hand at once under the arrangements described in paragraph (b) above.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the current Service programmes for the pro-\    . vision of married quarters should continue to be dealtwith by. the interdepartmental committee described inC. P (48) 87&apos;
(2) Took note that the needs of the Services for additional1 labour for1 maintenance and for adapting existingpremises would to some extent be met by the decision toallow an increased amount of maintenance, repair andother minor building work to be undertaken in those areas where the cuts in the investment programme hadfreed building workers for whom other essential employ-ment could not be found;(3) Agreed that the; programmes of the Service departments for new building in 1949 should be considered by the investment Programmes Committee.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 85) covering the eighth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion: In the first nine weeks of 1948 the drain on our reserves of gold and dollars had exceeded the forecast figure by over  31 million this had been mainly due to drawings by India, Egypt and Belgiumwhich would not be repeated, and to a recoverable payment of 16 million to South Africa. We should, however, be in great difficulties during the next few months as it seemed unlikely thatany payments under the European Recovery Programme would bemade before June.Comparison of current production with that achieved in thecorresponding month of 1947 was apt to divert attention from thefact that still greater output was required to meet current nationalrequirements. Would it be possible in future reports, not only to compare current output with past achievement, but also to indicatehow far it fell short of current needs ?, The Cabinet were informedthat this could not readily be done except for industries for whichproduction targets had been prescribed.,r&apos; In paragraph 12 of the report it was stated that the outputof cotton yarn had almost reached the weekly target ratefor the year 1948. This statement was incorrect. The weekly targetrate given in this paragraph of the report failed to take into account the increase in the targets for textiles which had been made to offset the reduction of the export target for engineering products.Account should also be taken of deoreased output during the holidayperiods of the year. In this connection it was suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to the general question of expressingannual production targets in terms of equivalent weekly rates of output.Reference was again made to the importance&apos; of settingproduction targets for individual factories. This would providea more effective incentive for the workers than a total annual target for the whole industry. The Cabinet were informed that steps were already being taken to prescribe such targets in the cotton industry.The figure of 7,341 foreign workers placed in employment inJanuary (paragraph 6 of the report) did not include some 3,200former prisoners of war and Polish civilians for whom employmenthad also been found during January.If substantial unemployment developed in an industry inwhich foreign workers had been placed, special care would haveto be taken to ensure that the British workers were not the first to lose their employment. The position was being carefully watchedand there was as yet no reason to retard on this account the recruitment of foreign labour.It was pointed out that the table in paragraph 14 of the report,on food consumption in this country before and since the war,related to the consumption of food by the total population. Therehad been a 5 per cent, increase of population since 1938, and thiswould have to be taken into account in any calculation of foodconsumption per head.
801 162Prices. The volume of exports in January had been 128 per cent, c1938, and the latest figures showed that in February the rate cexport had improved still further. The rise in the prices of ouexports was,, however, beginning to taper off. In yiew of th. &quot;i: i; approaching end of the sellers&apos; market, it seemed inexpedient turge exporters generally to make further efforts to obtain increase. ,f prices.  . nk&apos; Wi -icy v\       - ;The increase in the general: index of prices of imported rai; materials was due mainly to increases in the prices of wool anv wood-pulp.: Timber prices, on.the other hand, seemed likely to falIt was suggested that timber merchants should be required to pason to consumers the full benefit of any drop in the wholesale pricesWage Rates. It was suggested that a report might usefully be made to thiCabinet on the effectiveness of the White Paper on Persona. ;   Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd.. 7321) in checking wage movements.  This report might also indicate whether any further actioicould usefully be taken to.follow up the White Paper..   The Cabinet-; ,,  v        , Took note of CP. (48). 85 and of the points raised in thidiscussion.Strike of 5.   The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet of the latestEngineering developments in the. strike of liftmen and engineering staff in estab-Staff lishments managed by the Ministry of Works.   This was anEmployed by   unofficial strike affecting members of five different unions.   It hadMinistry of     been alleged that themen&apos;s application for increased pay had beenWorks.    n.,; outstanding for over a year; but in fact their application had notto: --it *: , been lodged until January 1948 and there was no foundation for thesuggestion that the negotiations, had been unduly protracted. Thereioihai        was little doubt,that the strike had been promoted for the purpose:   / of embarrassing the Government.f The Minister ,said that he would... have an opportunity of explaining the true facts in reply to a Private Notice Question- rig which was to be put to him by Mr. Churchill in the House ofr,      ;1 ;    Commons that afternoon r He intended to make a firm appeal to; , the men to return to work and allow their grievances to be nandledthrough the recognised machinery for negotiation.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement, by the Minister of Labour and-wlhul ji;r!jV,.i,:;^::!K endorsed the.general line which he was proposing to take in reply to.Mr. churchill&apos;s.Question^Cabinet 0,jfice, S.
