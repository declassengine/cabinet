1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C.p. (48) 143) covering the report submitted to theGovernments concerned by the conference in London on the futureof Germany.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, at their meetings on31st May and 7th June, the Cabinet had been informed of therecommendations which the conference had made. He had, how-ever, thought it right to seek formal Cabinet approval of therecommendations after his colleagues had had an opportunity of seeing the report of the conference. The United States Governmenthad already informed the French Government that they acceptedthe recommendations and he hoped that his colleagues would authorise him to send a similar message on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. The full report would not be published but, as theCabinet knew, a communique had been issued on the previous daysetting out the recommendations. He proposed to make a statement in the House of Commons after Questions on 9th June and, if itwere then suggested that there should be a debate on the resultsof the conference, he would indicate that this was a matter for the leader of the House.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations of the conference on thefuture of Germany as set out in the report annexed toC.P. (43) 143, and authorised the Foreign Secretary toinform tne French Government that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment had accepted these recommendations.2. The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that theEnglish Law Officers had now advised that there was some room fordoubt about the constitutional propriety of the Home Secretary&apos;announcement that he intended to advise His Majesty to commuteevery death sentence by conditional pardon to a sentence of penal servitude for life. This strengthened the case for the Home Secrertary&apos;s making a statement to the effect that, in view of the alteredcircumstances, he proposed to consider each case on its merits. TheCabinet should bear in mind that in the House of Lords on 2nd June,with tlie authority of the Home Secretary, he had, stated that, ifthe prospect of a change in the law in the near future disappeared,a wholly new set of circumstances would arise which must beconsidered afresh by the Home Secretary. He himself would haveno objection to its being said in any statement that might be made that he had assented to the Home Secretary&apos;s original announcement.The Home Secretary said that  he effect of the Law Officers&apos;opinion was now being considered by his advisers. There wa.s some ground fpr believing that a precedent for his announcement of16th April might be found in a statement made in the past withregard to advice to the Crown on the exercise of the prerogative ofmercy in cases of infanticide.In further discussion it was suggested that it was difficult to regard as unconstitutional an announcement in which both houses of Parliament had acquiesced. It was also pointed out that, shouldthe Home Secretary reach the conclusion that a further statementought to be made, it would be helpful if he could quote any precedent for his original announcement. &apos;The Cabinet- &apos;..............................Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to consider, in the light of the Law Officers&apos;opinion and of the points made in discussion, whether,pending the return of the Criminal Justice Bill to theHouse of Commons, he should make any further statement with regard to his advice to the Crown on the exercise ofthe prerogative of mercy in capital cases:-Cabinet Offitce, S.W.1,8th June, 1948.Germany.(previous reference erence:CM.
