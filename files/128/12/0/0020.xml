Siam. 1.   The  Foreign  Secretary  proposed  that  His  Majesty&apos;sGovernment should now accord diplomatic recognition to the existing government of Siam. The present Prime Minister, though he hadseized power by a coup d&apos;Etat, had consolidated his position and now appeared to command the confidence and support of a majorityof the population.The Cabinet-Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should enter into diplomatic rela-tions with the existing Government of Siam.EuropeanEconomicCo-operation.(previous reference:C.M.(48^16thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer ((5.P. (48) 75)covering a memorandum prepared by the London Committee on european Economic Co-operation on the functions and constitutionof the Continuing Organisation, for which provision had been madein the report of the Paris Conference.The London Committee&apos;s memorandum had been prepared asthe basis of the instructions to be given to the United kingdom delegation at the meeting of the Committee of European economic co-operation which would open in Paris on 15th March. that meeting would afford an opportunity for the Foreign Secretary notonly to make clear the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government on thequestion of European economic co-operation, but to give a lead tothe peoples of Europe on which the prospects of European recoverymight depend. Since the Paris Conference it had emerged that,even on the most favourable assumptions, the European recovery programme would not in itself enable the participating countries to balance their trade with the western hemisphere. This would only be possible if those countries were prepared to pursue a policyof full economic co-operation, in association with the BritishCommonwealth and the European colonial territories overseas. Butit was important that the economic and political implications of thispolicy should be clearly understood. Though it need not be assumed that any sudden or dramatic changes in our national economy would necessarily be involved, the ultimate consequences might be far-reaching. Participating Governments would in future have todetermine their economic policies with due regard to the needs of western Europe as a whole; and this meant accepting the possi-bility that drastic modifications might have to be made, as time went. on, in the existing economic systems. But there was no alternative course, if western Europe was to achieve political stability andeconomic independence, and His Majesty&apos;s Government, havingpledged themselves to this policy, must be prepared to adhere to itand accept its implications.The Cabinet had a full discussion of OP. (48) 75, in the courseof which all Ministers expressed their views.There was general agreement that there was no alternative toa policy of full support for closer economic co-operation in western europe, and that this policy should be adopted on the assumptionthat it would be maintained even at the cost of considerable changesin the economic structure of the United Kingdom and some loss ofthe advantages which we now enjoyed over other European countries.We might, for example, have to forfeit some of the supplies of coarse grains which we were now able to obtain, with the result that theprogramme for expanding the live-stock industry would be delayed,and our share of the available timber supplies might be reduced.But, thanks to Marshall Aid, the proposed policy was not likely to lead to any marked reduction in our standard of living in the next four years, and by the end of that period production in the UnitedKingdom and the other participating countries should haveexpanded sufficiently to enable us to maintain and even to raise our
present standards. The policy outlined in CP. (48) 75 represented!an extension to western Europe of the principles of economic planning which the Government had adopted for the United King-dom, and it was the only means by which the United Kingdom andthe other participating countries could establish themselves in aposition in which they were economically dependent neither on theSoviet Union nor on the United States. It was therefore desirablethat His Majesty&apos;s Government should adopt it in a positive andoptimistic way and should give a strong lead to the other partici-pating countries. The success of the Continuing organisation would depend largely on the extent to which administrativeresources from the United Kingdom were made available. It wouldalso be desirable to do everything possible by publicity from theUnited Kingdom to ensure that the peoples of all the participating countries responded vigorously and wholeheartedly to this new policy.Particular reference was made to the importance of associatingthe Dominions and Colonies with the project. So far as concerned the Colonies, the consultations which had already been started withother colonial Powers such as France and Belgium should go on,but any suggestion that colonial territories were to be exploited forthe benefit of Europe should be avoided. It was essential that theproposals should be presented in such a way as not to alienateDominion Governments, and we should make it clear to them thatthey would be fully consulted at every stage. It was proposed that,before the meeting of the Committee of European economic co-operation on 15th March, the Foreign Secretary should explainhis proposals to the High Commissioners in London, who hadalready been supplied with copies of the Annex to CP. (48) 75, andthat a note amplifying and explaining the speech which he wouldmake on 15th March should be sent to all Dominion Governments.It would also be desirable to consider strengthening the UnitedKingdom representation in the Dominions on the economic side, andthe staffs of the Dominion High Commissioners in London might be strengthened in order to ensure that Dominion Governments were kept fully informed. The extent to which different dominions would wish to be associated with the working out of the policy mightwell vary and there was no question of attempting to persuade themto participate directly in the Continuing Organisation.The Cabinet were informed that, in the view of the Common-wealth Relations Office, an attempt to arrange an early meeting of prime Ministers would not be likely to be successful.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the recommendations with regard to the continuing Organisation set out in the memorandum annexed to CP. (48) 75 and invited the Foreign Secre-tary to give a strong lead to the Committee of european economic Co-operation on the lines proposed.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations,in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, to communicatetheir views to Dominion Governments and agreed that,before 15th March, the Foreign Secretary should meet theDominion High Commissioners in London and DominionGovernments should be supplied with notes explainingand amplifying the statement which he would make tothe Committee of European Economic Co-operation.Germany.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 5thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (CP. (48) 78) reporting the results achieved in the informal discussions on the future of Germany which had been heldin London between delegations from the United Kingdom, theUnited States, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg.The Foreign Secretary explained that he had circulated thismemorandum so that his colleagues might have Without delay a fulleraccount of these discussions than had been given in the statement
issued to the Press on the adjournment of the discussions. He recog-nised, however, that his colleagues would have had little time toconsider his memorandum; and he suggested that, if after further study any of them wished to raise any point on it, the subject mightbe set down again for discussion at a future meeting of the Cabinet.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 73) covering a draft of theMonopolistic Practices Bill.The Cabinet were informed that the President of the Board ofTrade had modified his proposals in certain respects, in the lightof comments received from some of his colleagues. The Cabinet&apos;consideration of the Bill would be facilitated if the Presidentsrevised proposals could be circulated and if some of the ministers most directly affected could have an opportunity of consultationwith him before the Cabinet&apos;s next meeting.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer their consideration of the MonopolisticPractices Bill until their meeting on 11th March.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (48) 76) proposing action to follow up theWhite Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321).The Minister proposed to consult with the British EmployersConfederation and the Trades Union Congress in order to ensurethat the White Paper was brought formally to the notice of all joint negotiating bodies in industry and of all the constituent organisa-tions of the Confederation and the Congress. On the other hand,he did not think it appropriate to send the White Paper to theNational Arbitration Tribunal, the Industrial Court or otherarbitration authorities. He would in future require wages councils and wages boards to satisfy him that they had taken full accountof the considerations set out in the White Paper when they submitted for confirmation proposals for wages increases, and a draft of aletter intimating this to wages councils and wages boards was annexed to CP. (48) 76. He also proposed that the White paper should be brought to the notice of the Agricultural Wages Board,whose orders were not subject to confirmation either by himself orby the Minister of Agriculture. The Minister suggested that theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland should bring the White Paper to the notice of all local authorities and thatit should be sent to the members of the committees concerned withthe fixing of nurses&apos; and teachers&apos; salaries. He also thought itdesirable that other Ministers should take similar steps to bringthe White Paper to the notice of trade organisations. While theMinistry of Labour would be prepared to advise Departments on questions connected with the interpretation of paragraph 10 of theWhite Paper, the decision in any particular case must appear tohave been taken by the Department concerned and there should beno disclosure of the views expressed by the Ministry of Labour.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Board of Trade had already done all that seemed possible to give guidance to representative organisations of traderson the principles of the White Paper.(6) The Ministers concerned had arranged to send copies of theWhite Paper to the board of socialised industries.(c) It was suggested that trade organisations should be sent,in addition to the White Paper, a copy of the speech made by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 12th February, which had referredto the possibility of reductions in prices and profits; and it wasagreed that this suggestion should be further considered when the
s5 94 0Federation of British Industries and other trade associations hasubmitted their proposals for a voluntary limitation of prices, profiand dividends.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the action proposed in paragraphs 2, 4 and 5 oiCP. (48) 76 and agreed that in giving decisions on tUinterpretation of paragraph 10 of the White Pape3Departments should not disclose any views expressed by!the Ministry of Labour.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider, in consultation with the other Ministers con-lcerned, what further statement on prices and profits!should be given to trade organisations, in amplificationlof what had been said on this subject in the White]Paper.Parliament.electoral reform.(previous reference:CM. (48) 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomelSecretary (CP. (48) 64) proposing that the Representation of the!People Bill should be amended in order to give seventeen additional!seats to English urban areas.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the representa-tions made since the introduction of the Bill, he had decided thatan additional member should be given to each of the eight boroughswith an electorate of over 80,000 for which the Boundary Com-mission had proposed only one member. He also proposed that anadditional member should be given to each of nine large dividedboroughs where the average electorate under the Commission^recommendations ranged from 61,153 to 71,133, but where theaddition of a member would not bring the average below 51,827.The addition of these seventeen new seats would mean an averageelectorate for English boroughs of 57,833 per constituency, ascompared with 55,360 for English counties, and an average of 56,758for England, as compared with 49,581 for Scotland and 51,641 for wales; and the total membership of the House of Commons would remain less than the figure recommended by the Speaker&apos;conference in 1944. He was satisfied that the proposals could be defended on the ground that they avoided excessively large con-stituencies and remedied the undue preference given to rural areasin the recommendations of the Boundary Commission.The following points were made in discussion : (a) Under the proposals made in paragraph 4 (b) of CP. (48) 64the boroughs of Bristol, Leeds, Leicester and Nottingham would begiven more seats than they had at present and would have an averageelectorate per constituency of under 53,000. The general view of theCabinet was, however, that the grant of an additional seat to theseboroughs could be justified on merits, irrespective of their pastrepresentation.(b) The proposals would be criticised by the Opposition, whose attitude was understood to be that they would agree to the grant ofan additional member to each of the eight boroughs with electoratesof over 80,000, provided that the City constituency were restored and provision made for at least eight University seats.(c) The precedents did not support the view, which had been advanced by the Opposition in the debates on the Bill, that changesin the electoral system should be made only on the basis of agreementbetween the political Parties.The Cabinet- jApproved the proposals in CP. (48) 64 for giving seventeen 1additional seats to English urban areas; and invited the home Secretary to ask the Speaker to arrange for the IBoundary Commission to prepare proposals for the conse- gquential rearrangement of constituencies in the nine largeboroughs mentioned in paragraph 4 (b) of CP. (48) 64.
eviouserertce:(48)14thusions,ite 4.)7. The Prime Minister reported the progress made in theParty Leaders5 Conference on the Parliament Bill and the reform of the House of Lords. There seemed to be a fair prospect of finding a basis of agreement on the reform of the House of Lords, but lessprogress had been made towards agreement on the amendment of the parliament Bill. The Conservative leaders were demanding that theperiod of delay under the Parliament Act procedure should be aperiod of twelve months from the first occasion on which a Billreceived its Third Reading in the House of Commons. The Govern-ment representatives had put forward the suggestion that the periodmight be either twelve months from Second Reading or six months from Third Reading, whichever was the longer; but it was true thatin the normal case a period of six months from Third Reading wouldnot be longer than a period of twelve months from Second Reading,and the Opposition leaders had rejected this formula as an emptyconcession. The Government representatives had then considered whether they should put forward the formula &quot; twelve months fromSecond Reading or nine months from Third Reading &quot;; but, before doing so, they desired to have the views of their colleagues on thisproposal. The Prime Minister explained the practical effect of sucha formula by reference to the major measures passed in the present parliament, the Government of India Bill of 1935, the two measuresenacted under the Parliament Act in 1913, and the probable courseof controversial legislation in the 1948-49 Session. detailed examination of the time taken by these measures in the two Housessuggested that the worst result of adopting such a formula would bethat a complex and controversial Bill, which had taken an unusuallylong time in passing through the Commons might, if it had to be passed under the Parliament Act procedure, take two or threemonths longer to pass than it would if the Parliament Bill wereenacted in its present form. The question on which the views of theCabinet were sought was whether this concession should be made inthe hope of averting a breakdown in the Party Leaders&apos; Conference.In discussion there was general agreement that, from thepractical point of view of handling the Government&apos;s legislative programme for the remainder of the present Parliament, there wouldbe no great disadvantage in a formula of &quot; twelve months fromSecond Reading or nine months from Third Reading.&quot; Indeed, theParliamentary time-table for the remainder of the present Parlia-ment would be more easily handled if the Parliament Bill passed inthat form before the end of the present Session than it would be ifthe Bill were rejected by the Lords and had to be enacted under the parliament Act procedure. Another advantage would be that, ifthis formula were put forward and accepted, the Parliament bill would be enacted as an agreed measure and would be less liable to repeal by a subsequent Conservative Government. Finally, unlessagreement could be reached on the amendment of the Bill, there wasno prospect of finding an agreed basis for proceeding with the reform of the House of Lords.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the government might have difficulty in justifying to their supporters any extensionof the period of delay permitted under the Parliament Bill as intro-iduced. It was also suggested that, if under its new constitution the House of Lords were to become more of a revising Chamber,there might be less ground for any extension of the period of delay.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their meeting on 11th March; and invited the Prime Ministerto circulate a note on the implications of amending the parliament Bill on the lines which he had suggested in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,8th March, 1948
