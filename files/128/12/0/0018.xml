Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in&apos;the House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that a number of Members had settheir names to a Motion protesting against the action of the Ministerof Home Affairs in Northern Ireland in prohibiting a meeting atLondonderry which was to have been addressed by two Membersof the Parliament at Westminster, and asking that the Governmentof Ireland Act, 1920, should be so amended as to make it impossiblefor the Government of Northern Ireland to prohibit a meetingconvened by Members of the Parliament at Westminster to discuss matters within the responsibility of that House. According to his information, this meeting had been prohibited on grounds of public order; and the Government of Northern Ireland were, and must continue to be, exclusively responsible for the maintenance of public order within their jurisdiction. In these circumstances he was not disposed to find time for the discussion of this Motion.Official 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that in a debate in the House of history of Lords on 10th March Lord Trenchard would advocate the prepara-the War. tion of a joint Anglo-American history of the war. There wouldProposal for probably be widespread support for this project in the House of joint Anglo- Lords, and efforts had therefore been made to persuade LordAmerican Trenchard to frame his Motion in terms in which it would notHistory. embarrass the Government if it were passed.   There was, in fact,no practical prospect of making an early start on an official Anglo-American history. For some time to come the available staffs in both countries would be fully occupied with the preparation of theirseparate histories; and any attempt to embark on a joint historyat this stage would result either in duplication of effort onEreliminary research or in the production of an inadequateistorical work.The Cabinet-Endorsed the views expressed by the Lord Privy Seal and took note that a statement on these lines would be made inreply to the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords.Parliament.legislative programme for the 1948-49Session.(previous reference erence:C.M.(47)80thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 68) submitting a provisional plan for thepreparation of legislation for the 1948-49 Session.The Lord President said that, in ^addition to drawing up a provisional programme of legislation for the 1948-19 Session, theFuture Legislation Committee had made a forecast of the legis-lation which might have to be included in the 1949-50 Programme.They had assumed that the 1948-49 Session would run from October1948 to August 1949 and would be followed by a Session runningfrom October 1949 to the Dissolution. If the Parliament Bill didnot become law in the current Session some readjustment would benecessary, but it was in any event desirable that Departments and parliamentary Counsel should, during the next six months, presson with the preparation of the Bills listed in paragraph 5 of cp. (48) 68. The proposals should be regarded as provisionalpending the formulation of a final Legislative Programme for the1948-49 Session concurrently with the preparation of The King&apos;sSpeech; and the mention of a Bill in CP. (48) 68 should not beregarded as authorising the Minister concerned to anticipate TheKing&apos;s Speeches- for the- next two Sessions by promising that itwould be introduced in the present Parliament. No promise tointroduce legislation should be, given without prior consultationwith himself.
The following points were made in discussion : (a) The policy issues connected with the proposed agricultural marketing and Food Policy Bills ought to be settled as soon aspossible. These were to be examined in the first instance by acommittee of officials with a Treasury chairman.(&amp;) The Future Legislation Committee had been asked by theHome Secretary to include in the provisional programme for 1948-49a Sports Grounds (Licensing) Bill, but they had not been convincedthat a Bill of this kind was urgently needed and had felt that itwould be unpopular with football clubs and their supporters. Onthe other hand, if nothing were done to carry out the recommenda-tions made in the report on the accident at the Bolton footballground in 1946, any further incident of this kind would expose theGovernment to severe criticism. There would, however, be difficultyin obtaining materials for carrying out any constructional work required in the interests of safety and, if legislation were to beintroduced, it should provide for bringing the safety requirementsinto operation by stages.(c) Since the proposals set out in CP. (48) 68 had been drawnup, the Agriculture Ministers had reached the conclusion that itwould be desirable to pass in the 1948-49 Session an Agriculture(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. The main object of this Bill wouldbe to give authority for the payment of a number of agriculturalsubsidies which were necessary as part of the programme for increasing agricultural production.(d) In view of the need for full consultation with the repre-sentative associations, it would be impossible for the Ministry ofHealth to have the Nurses Bill ready for introduction before christmas 1948.(e) The Future Legislation Committee had hoped that it wouldbe possible to avoid introducing legislation to give effect to therecommendations of the Ridley Committee in the present Parlia-ment. The Bill could not be ready for inclusion in the 1948-49Programme and it would be awkward to have to pass a complicated and controversial measure of this kind in the final Session. It was,therefore, unfortunate that it should have been stated in the Houseof Lords on 26th February that the Government hoped to introduce legislation to deal with the topics covered by the report of the RidleyCommittee. This statement had been made without consultationwith the Minister of Health or the Lord President.(/) It might be necessary to introduce legislation in the current session to give security of tenure to small shopkeepers. The demandfor this legislation came mainly from Scotland, but it would beimpossible to confine any legislation to Scotland and the Bill wouldbe controversial.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, pending the formulation of a final legislative programme for the 1948-49 Session, parliamentary counsel should proceed with the preparation of the Billslisted in paragraph 5 of CP. (48) 68.(2) Invited the Future Legislation Committee to review fromtime to time the progress made with the preparation oflegislation for the 1948-49 Session and to consider, inthe light of the points noted in paragraphs (6) and (c)above, whether the provisional programme should include a Sports Grounds (Licensing) Bill and an Agriculture(Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.(3) Authorised, the Committee On Future Legislation toarrange for the preparation of an appropriate numberof minor Bills for introduction, in October 1948.(4) Took note that the Legislative Programme for the 1949-50Session might have to include the Bills listed in para-graph 7 of CP. (48) 68.
Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, after consulta--tion with the Minister of Health and the President ofthe Board of Trade, to circulate a memorandum to theLord Presidents Committee on the question whether legislation should be introduced in the current session to give security of tenure to small shopkeepers.4   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 67) covering the seventh of his periodical&apos; reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : The net drain on our reserves of gold and dollars in Februaryhad been  43 million, making a total drain of about  100 million forthe first two months of 1948. It had proved impossible to reach agreement with the Belgian Government on any scheme which wouldenable us to avoid having to make substantial gold payments to belgium, and it seemed probable that we should have to inform themthat from 8th March all gold payments to Belgium must stop. this might mean serious interruption of trade, including the loss of belgian steel supplies. It was unfortunate that we should have todo this at a time when discussions were in progress in Brussels onmeans of promoting closer union among the countries of western europe, but we could not afford to allow the drain on our reserves of gold to continue, and it was hoped that our action would compel the Belgian Government to accept arrangements which would meet our difficulties.Satisfactory agreements had been made with Poland and finland but it was improbable that any comprehensive agreement would be reached with Yugoslavia. The agreement with Finlandprovided for supplies of wood pulp and of timber, though it had been necessary to leave open the question of the price to be paid for the timber.If we could obtain increased supplies of plywood we should beable to develop a profitable trade in exporting timber houses manu-factured in this country. Further attempts should be made to obtainplywood from non-dollar sources. It was also desirable that moreshould be done to develop the export of timber from british honduras.At their meeting on 2nd February the Cabinet had invited theMinister of Supply to appoint a working party of officials to prepare a report on the problem of securing adequate supplies of scrap forthe United Kingdom iron and steel industry. The Minister ofSupply had since agreed with the Prime Minister and the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer that it would be preferable to entrust this enquiry to a small committee of persons outside Government service under the chairmanship of Sir Graham Cunningham. The com-mittee would be asked to concentrate in the first instance on theproblem of obtaining commercial scrap from Germany, and theMinister of Supply had arranged that they should go to Germanyimmediately and make a report to him within two or three weeks.The main obstacle in Germany seemed to be the reluctance of thescrap merchants to part with supplies until confidence in the markhad been restored; but there was also some reason to believe that theprice offered was too low to tempt the merchants to sell, and that more would have to be done to supply food and clothing for workers engaged in the collection of scrap.It had been intended that the working party of officials shouldalso report on the problem of securing adequate supplies of pig iron,but the Minister of Supply thought it would be preferable to ask the Iron and Steel Board themselves to report on this. He had noreason to believe that the existing capacity for the production of pig iron was not being fully used.
\\ g 126Economy in During the war the basic stress for structural steel work haithe Use of been raised to 10 tons per square inch, but had since reverted tlSteel. 8 tons per square inch.    There was little doubt that a standardof 10 tons per square inch would be satisfactory but, though tliBritish Standards Institute had been at work on the matter for ovJa year, they had not yet issued a revised standard. It was estimate!that if the war-time standard were adopted there would be a savinjof about 100,000 tons of steel a year.Foreign It was suggested that the possibility of bringing single womelLabour. from Italy to work in the pottery and textile industries should tlexplored.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C,P. (48) 67.(2) Approved the revised proposals made by the Minister oiSupply for investigating the problem of obtaini:adequate supplies of steel scrap and pig iron for the sindustry and invited him to report to the Cabinet t!results of the urgent enquiries which were to be mainto the difficulties connected with the supply of commercial scrap from Germany.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to expedithe issue of a revised British standard for structunsteel and to arrange, in consultation with the otheMinisters concerned, for the immediate application othe revised standard,(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultatioJwith the Secretary of State for the Colonies, to considelwhat action could be taken to develop timber export!from British Honduras.(5) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with thjForeign Secretary and the President of the Board olTrade, to examine the possibility of importing femafellabour from Italy for work in the pottery and textile industries.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th March, 1948.
