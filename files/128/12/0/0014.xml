97CM, 15 (48)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, subject to theapproval of the two Governments, agreement had now been reached in the trade negotiations with the Argentine and he was anxious that the conclusion of the agreement should be announced in theHouse of Commons that afternoon. He read to the Cabinet the text of his proposed announcement.The basis of the agreement was that, to enable the argentine government to complete the purchase of the British-owned Argentinerailways for  150 million, we would pay  110 million in andvance for supplies of essential foods and animal feeding-stuffs which wehad contracted to buy from the Argentine in 1948 and early 1949.We had also undertaken to facilitate the export to the Argentineof certain important commodities, including 1 million tons of coal and some 2 million tons of petroleum products. The argentine government had agreed to give most-favoured-nation treatment to the import of British goods and to grant import permits to thevalue of  10 million in 1948 for United Kingdom goods whoseimport into the Argentine had hitherto been restricted or prohibited.The Argentine Government had also agreed that, other things being equal, their Departments would give preference to United kingdom firms in making purchases. Finally, it had been agreed that allpayments between the sterling area and the Argentine shouldcontinue to be settled in sterling.In discussion it was agreed that in announcing the conclusionof this agreement the Chancellor of the Exchequer should expressappreciation of the work of the Mission which had conducted these negotiations on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and of theassistance given to them in their task by His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Buenos Aires.The Cabinet-Approved the conclusion of the proposed trade agreementwith the Argentine  Government;  and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to announce the conclusion ofthe agreement in the House of Commons that afternoon.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (48) 35) covering a report prepared by a working party of officials on the 1948 dollar position and proposing that the recommendations made in paragraph 40 of this report should be accepted. They also had before them a memorandum bythe Minister of Food (CP. (48) 49) commenting on the recommenda-tions on food supplies, and a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (48) 51) setting out revised recommendations on food supplies which had been agreed on by the Economic Policy Committee in a preliminary discussion of the issues raised in CP. (48) 35 and cp. (48) 49.In CP. (48) 35 attention was drawn to the increasing gravity of the dollar position. The net drain on the country&apos;s gold and dollar reserves in 1948 was now likely to be some  100 million inexcess of the estimate contained in CP. (47) 283. Further, it was now estimated that the net drain in 1949 would be some  300 million.It was clear from these figures that, even if full and acceptableMarshall Aid were forthcoming, our reserves would decrease sub-stantially during the first year, and would go on decreasing, thoughat a lower rate, in subsequent years. The provision of Marshall Aid,therefore, would do no more than afford a brief opportunity for themembers of the sterling area to make the efforts necessary to securefreedom from dependence on further dollar aid in subsequent years.In this situation it was essential that all reasonable measures shouldbe taken at once to safeguard our remaining reserves, and the recom-mendations made in paragraph 40 of the Annex to CP. (48) 35had been put forward with this object. If Marshall Aid were not forthcoming, much more drastic action would be necessary; but until-2 &quot; b 2
the outcome of the discussions in Congress was known there wouldbe no justification for adopting emergency measures which mustseriously distort the country&apos;s economy.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposalfor a cut in timber imports made in paragraph 34 (6) of the report annexed to CP. (48) 35 required modification. He wished to explore the possibility of some reduction in imports, but he would not proposeto make any cuts which would involve interference with the housing programme.(b) The drain on our gold and dollar reserves in the period since 1st January had been disproportionately heavy. Thus, theEgyptian Government had drawn their full allocation of convertiblesterling for 1948, and under our existing agreement with the BelgianGovernment we had had to make available to them  12 million ofgold. It was, however, hoped to redress the balance with Belgiumover the rest of the year and a satisfactory agreement had beenreached with India under which their allocation of dollars for thefirst half of 1948 would be limited to  10 million.(c) Our difficulties had been much aggravated by the movementof the terms of trade against us, and it was estimated that a returnto the 1938 position would enable us to save some  300 million of dollar expenditure a year. The benefits of a fall in the world pricesof our main imports would, however, be delayed to some extent by our long-term contracts with overseas countries.(d) There would be advantage in an international wheat agree-ment, if it provided for substantial reductions in our current wheatcontract prices, even though some concession on prices in the latervears of the agreement were involved.(e) The Minister of Agriculture said that he did not dissent from the proposal in paragraph (e) of OP. (48) 51 that the Ministerof Food, in examining means for reducing our imports of wheat from canada, should take into account the possible substitution of an equivalent amount of coarse grains for the 20 per cent, of wheat which United Kingdom farmers were expecting to retain from the1948 harvest. As a result of the Argentine agreement, however,farmers expected an increase in feeding-stuffs rations, and it was most desirable that some means should be found of meeting thisexpectation, whether by allowing them to retain 20 per cent, oftheir wheat or by making further overseas purchases of coarse grains. An announcement on this matter ought to be made well inadvance of the start of the new ration period on 1st May.(/) Prehininary discussions had indicated that when the trade negotiations with Canada were resumed in March, the canadian government would ask for payment for all supplies to be made inUnited States dollars. This would place us in a very difficult position, unless the United States Government could be persuaded to make the necessary dollars available. The Canadian government proposed to take the initiative in raising this matter with the UnitedStates Government.(g) Some Ministers expressed concern at the extent to which our dollar expenditure was being increased through the sale of oil to soft-currency countries. It was pointed out that on several occasions in the past two years it had been suggested that the cabinet should be given more information on this subject and the figures nowprovided revealed that, in spite of the country&apos;s very grave economicplight, such sales were continuing at a rate of over  50 million ayear.There was general agreement that every effort ought to be madeto secure a substantial reduction in the dollar expenditure of the oil companies. For this purpose the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Fuel and Power should, as proposed in CP. (48) 35,have discussions with the chairmen of the companies. It waspointed out, however, that political and other issues of great com-complexity were involved in the sale of oil to soft-currency countries, and
each case would have to be examined individually in the light of thesame criteria as were applied in allocating exports of any othercommodity. There would be some alleviation of the situation as the tanker position improved; and it was now expected that the UnitedStates Administration would release a number of Liberty tankersin March.(h) The decisions reached by the Cabinet would be made public in the Economic Survey.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations contained in paragraph 40of the report annexed to CP. (48) 35.. as modified by CP. (48) 51,and by paragraph (a) above.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 48) covering a report by the exports Committee on the steps which were being taken to stimulateUnited Kingdom exports to Canada in 1948.The Cabinet were informed that the estimate of the increase inthe value of United Kingdom exports to Canada (from  44 million in 1947 to  70 million in 1948) had been made on a realistic basis andthat every effort was being made to secure a greater increase.The following points were made in discussion: (a) The export of United Kingdom goods to Canada was handi-capped by the present high freight charges. It had recently beenpossible to secure a reduction in freight charges for motor cars, butin general the level of freight charges made United Kingdom goodssold in Canada dearer than comparable United States goods.(&amp;) For reasons connected with their balance of payments withthe United States the Canadian Government had prohibited or cutdown the import of certain types of goods. In doing this they had sought, so far as possible, to avoid restricting imports from theUnited Kingdom; but in certain cases, in order to avoid the chargeof discrimination against the United States, they had felt boundto apply a corresponding prohibition or reduction to imports fromthe United Kingdom. Thus, it was estimated that four times as many United Kingdom motor cars could be sold in Canada as were allowed for in the present quota. We were pressing for a higherquota for cars, but there could be no certainty that the canadian government would grant this.(c) It was in Canada&apos;s own interests, and particularly in theinterests of the Prairie Provinces, that United Kingdom exports to canada should increase. Action had already been taken to impressthis on the Canadian Government, and the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade would keep inmind the desirability of taking advantage of the goodwill towards this country which prevailed in Canada.(d) The President of the Board of Trade had arranged to seethe Chairman of the Cotton Board, who had recently visited canadian  order to see how far cotton exports from the United kingdom could be expanded. The prospects of expansion were reasonably good, but any increase of supplies to Canada would have to be at theexpense of the home market.(e) The President of the Board of Trade had discussed withrepresentatives of book publishers the possibility of expandingexports of books, particularly text books, to the United States and canada.(/) There seemed to be good prospects of increasing engineeringexports and particularly exports of capital equipment.(g) The expansion of United Kingdom exports both to canada and to other destinations was hampered by the fact that so manyUnited Kingdom products were of the non-essential class and were therefore the readiest victims of import restrictions imposed by countries who were in balance of payments difficulties.
Parliament.AmfTlflTTlPTlt,of theParliamentAet.(previous reference:CM. (48) 11thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. THE LORD PRESIDENT said that at their meeting on 4th February the Parliamentary Labour Party had been informed ofthe scope of the all-Party discussions on the Parliament Bill and onthe reform of the House of Lords. Subsequently, Miss Jennie Lee,M.P., and certain other members of the Labour Party had writtenasking that this matter should be raised again at a Party meeting sothat the Government spokesman might explain (i) whether it was proposed to make any concession which would lengthen beyond oneyear the period for which the House of Lords could delay Govern-ment legislation; (ii) whether the all-Party conference would consider any reform of the House of Lords less radical than theabolition of the hereditary principle; and (iii) whether it was inthe interests of the Labour Party to accept minor reforms of theHouse of Lords which would add to its status and vitality withoutaffecting its Conservative majority. The Lord President said that,after consulting the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal, he had replied that it would be inexpedient to reopen the matter at thepresent stage, when the Government were about to begin their con-consultations with the other Parties. It would not be practicable forthe Government to prescribe any limits or restrictions on these dis-cussions other than those which had been indicated by the lord privy Seal in his speeches in the House of Lords on 2nd and 4thFebruary. It had been made clear in these speeches that, if a basis for further discussions was provisionally agreed upon, the repre-sentatives of the different Parties would then confer with their ownmembers before the discussions were renewed; and the Governmenthad promised the Parliamentary Labour Party at the meeting on 9th February that they would be effectively consulted before anyoperative agreement was reached. Thus, the position of the Parlia&apos;-mentary Labour Party and of the National Executive was amplvsafeguarded.The Cabinet took note of the Lord President^ statement.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,16th February, 1948.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 48 and of the points made in discussion;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to consider what further steps might be taken to persuade the Canadian Government toremove restrictions on imports from the United Kingdom.
