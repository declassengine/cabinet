Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.criminla justice BUI.capital punishment.(previous reference:C.M.(48)27thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.As regards subsequent weeks the Prime Minister said thaton 26th April he would move an Address of Congratulation toTheir Majesties on the occasion of their Silver Wedding.The House of Commons were anxious that a further debate onForeign Affairs should be held in the near future. The foreign secretary said that he would be ready to suggest a date for thisafter his return from his forthcoming visit to Paris.2. On the Report Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill on14th April the House of Commons, against the advice of theGovernment, had carried by a majority of 245 votes to 222 a new clause providing that for an experimental period of five yearsimprisonment for life should be substituted for the death sentenceas the penalty for murder.Ministers agreed that the Government must acquiesce in thisdecision, recorded by a free vote of the House of Commons, andmust in due course recommend the House of Lords to accept the new clause.The Home Secretary said that he had been considering how heshould discharge his responsibility for advising the Crown on theexercise of the prerogative of mercy in capital cases during theperiod before the new clause became law. He believed that, in the face of this vote by the House of Commons, it would be wrong for him to allow the death sentence to be carried out in any case which came up for decision before the proceedings on the Criminal justice bill had been completed in the present Session. A more difficult situation would arise if the House of Lords rejected the new clause,and the passing of the Bill was delayed until the following sessionby reason of a disagreement between the two Houses on this point.In that event it might become necessary to revert for a time tothe practice followed hitherto in deciding whether or not to recom-mend clemency in capital cases. For the time being, however, he intended to assume that the new clause would be enacted duringthe present Session; and on that assumption he proposed that, mean-while, no death sentence for murder should be carried into effect.He proposed in every case to recommend to His Majesty that the death sentence should be respited and commuted to one of penal servitude for life. He hoped that the Secretary of State for scotland would follow the same policy.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable tocontinue to act under the existing law until the Bill altering ithad finally become an Act: it would be specially unfortunate if a second change of practice became necessary because the passageof the Criminal Justice Bill had to be deferred until the following session. Against this, however, it was pointed out that the prero-gative of mercy was not derived from statute law, and there wasno question of the Home Secretary&apos;s failing to comply with theexisting law if he followed the course which he proposed. Inadvising the Crown on the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in capital Cases, it was the duty of the Secretary of State to take intoaccount, among other considerations, the current state of publicopinion on the general question of capital punishment; and, in viewof the vote recorded by the House of Commons on the previous day, it was clearly open to him to proceed on the basis that it wouldbe repugnant to public opinion that any sentence of death for murdershould be carried out while Parliament was still considering the criminal Justice Bill.The question was also raised in the Cabinefs discussionwhether the new clause, which was at present limited to murder,should be extended so as to apply equally to sentences of death passed on conviction of treason, arson in royal dockyards or piracy. Itwas pointed out that for the two latter offences the death penaltyhad not in practice been imposed for many years past. It was equally unlikely that any person would be sentencecr to death for35289-1 b 2
treason in time of peace. In these circumstances it was unnecessary to amend the clause which the House of Commons had passed, andit was inexpedient that the Government should attempt to do so.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the proposal that during the remaining pro-ceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill in the present session of Parliament the Home Secretary and the Secre-tary of State for Scotland should in every case recom-mend that any death sentence for murder should berespited and commuted to one of penal servitude for life.In further discussion Ministers agreed that, in the light of thisexpression of opinion by the House of Commons, the Cabinet should review at an early date the existing powers of courts to impose the death penalty in the British Zone of Germany, in British colonial territories, and in the Armed Forces of the Crown.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit a memorandum onthe question whether the death penalty should continueto be imposed as a penalty either for war crimes or byControl Commission courts for current criminal offencesin Germany.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit amemorandum on the continuance of capital punishmentas a penalty for murder in British Colonial territories.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to report to the Cabinet,after consultation with the Service Ministers, what con-sequential alterations should be made in the powers of courts-martial if the civil courts in this country weredeprived of the power to impose the death penalty for murder.economic affairs.(previous reference erence:C.M.(48)23rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Man-Power.Production.3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 105) covering the ninth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : The total numbers in civil employment had risen in Februaryby 27,000, not 29,000 as stated in paragraph 1 of CP. (48) 105.The production of coal in the first fourteen weeks of 1948had exceeded the,target for the period, and the figures of employ-ment in the industry had also continued to rise steadily. Steel pro-duction had reached a level which should enable the year&apos;s target of 14 million tons to be substantially exceeded, and it would benecessary to review the allocations of coal, &amp;c., to the industry toensure that output could be sustained at this higher rate. The rateof increase in the labour force of the. textile industries was disappointment -pointingly slow, and greater reliance must now be placed on increased efficiency as a means of securing the larger output required. the motor industry was making satisfactory progress towards its exporttarget of 75 per cent, of total production, but the increase in thetotal value oi car exports was noticeably less than the increasein the number of vehicles exported.The number of new permanent houses completed was larger than had been expected : it had risen to 15,725 in February and toabout 17,000 in March. As the number of new contracts was strictlycontrolled, the housing programme was being brought into balance.In some areas local authorities were being prevented from placingnew contracts, though there were ample stocks of bricks available and local unemployment among bricklayers; and, as the shortageof houses was still acute, this position was causing concern. Couldthere not be some latitude to relax the existing restrictions in such areas ? It was pointed out that. the Cabinet had agreed on 23rdFebruary to the allocation of an additional 60,000 standards of
timber for housing during 1948 to enable a further 30,000 permanentbouses to be started in that year. Though stocks of timber were now high, a further allocation for this purpose might endangersupplies against future requirements. The Chancellor of theExchequer undertook, however, to have the point considered. in industrial building steel was the limiting factor, but an additionalallocation had recently been made which should enable the most urgent requirements to be met.The small reduction in exports in February was without signi-significance. The volume of exports in March was about 130 per cent,of 1938; and the three-monthly averages during the period from january 1947 had shown a steady increase.Attention was drawn to difficulties in expanding our coal exports. No restrictions were now placed on the export of coal,but markets were hard to find; this was largely due to the poor quality of the coal offered and the high prices quoted. ministers were concerned lest the goodwill of European importers should beforfeited, as after 1918, because the industry took advantage ofa temporary shortage to sell poor quality coal at excessive prices.It was possible that the United States would shortly cease to supplycoal to Europe on a large scale, and it was important that we shouldbe in a position to take full advantage of any such change in thesituation. There was a risk that the National Coal Board mightconcentrate on the problems of production to the detriment of efficient distribution and marketing. The Minister of Fuel and power was discussing these questions with the Board; and atten-tion would be given to the need for creating, within the Board, an effective functional organisation with special responsibility formarketing and export.The drain of gold to Belgium had continued, but it was hopedas a result of the recent agreement that a balance would shortly be achieved and that a part of our losses would be recovered overthe next eighteen months.The terms of trade had continued to move against us during march. While there had been some further rise in the prices ofour exports, the increase in import prices was even greater. Tosome extent this was due to the fact that a number of our long-term contracts had become due for renewal, and we could not hope to renew them on the very favourable terms which we had originallysecured. Increasing difficulties were also being encountered in main-taining or securing export markets; and the transfer from dollarto soft currency supplies often involved the payment of higher prices.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 105 and of the points raised in dis-cussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to circulate amemorandum to the Production Committee on the pros-pects of expanding coal exports.4. At their meeting on 19th February the Cabinet had invited the Minister of Labour to concert with the other Ministers con-cerned arrangements for obtaining from public bodies, such as localauthorities and boards of socialised industries, immediate reports on all prospective or actual claims for higher remuneration made bytheir employees.The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the Minis-ter of Labour (CP. (48) 106) stating that, in his view, any formalrequest to the boards of socialised industries to supply informationof this kind would be contrary to the general policy towards the boards followed by the Departments concerned with socialised industries, and that for the same reason it would be undesirable to make a direct approach to local authorities. Arrangements had,however, been made under which the Departments would imme-diately pass on to the Ministry of Labour any information which
they might obtain, though it was admitted that the extent to which they   were able to obtain such information varied.In discussion Ministers pointed out that for the Government Ito ask the boards of socialised industries to supply this information Iwas in no way inconsistent with their policy of not intervening in 1the day-to-day administration of the boards.  The Government nad ]a special responsibility for ensuring that unjustifiable claims for 1higher wages or shorter hours made by public employees were not fgranted and it was impossible to accept a state of affairs in&apos; which they   would know less about claims by these employees than about Iclaims by workers in private industry!  It had been agreed that the minister of Labour should be responsible for questions of wages or Iconditions of work which arose m socialised industries, and there seemed to be no reason why he should not make a direct request tothe boards of these industries and to local authorities to supply him with the information asked for by the Cabinet at their meetingon 19th February.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour to reconsider, in the lightof their discussion, the proposals made in CP. (48) 106.Parliament.Amendment.of the parliament act.(previous reference:C.M.(48)21stConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet were informed that there was little prospect that the Conference of Party Leaders would find a basis of agreement on the powers of a Second Chamber. The Conservative leaders were unwilling to accept the Government offer that the period of delayunder the Parliament Act procedure should be either twelve months from Second Reading in the Commons or nine months from third reading in the Commons, whichever is the longer period : the leastthat they would be willing to accept, in order to secure agreementover the whole field of the discussions, was a period of twelve months from Third Reading. The discussions had, however, shown thatthe real issue between the Parties was not, as might at first appear,their differing views about the period of delay but a fundamental difference of view regarding the purposes for which the period of delay should be granted and used. The Conservative leaders believedthat the Second Chamber should have this power of delay in orderto ensure that, if serious disagreement developed between the two houses, the will of the Commons should not prevail xmtil the publichad become fully informed of the issues and time had been allowed for public opinion to crystallise. They clearly believed that theSecond Chamber should have power in the last resort to force theGovernment of the day to seek a General Election. This was a claim which the Government could not accept; and it had become clear that there was no basis for a lasting agreement between theParties on the powers of a Second Chamber.In these circumstances it seemed inevitable that the Conferenceof Party Leaders should be broken off.  A public explanation wouldhave to be given of the reasons why the Conference had&apos;failed tofind a basis for agreement, and it was thought expedient that thisshould also include a broad statement of the agreement which might/]have been reached on the future composition of the House&apos; of Lords &quot;if the difficulties about powers had been overcome.   It was contem-plated that an agreed statement would be issued on the points of iagreement and disagreement; and that thereafter each of the Party fleaders would be free to explain and defend his attitude.   TliePrime Minister indicated to the Cabinet the general lines whichthis agreed statement was likely to take.The Cabinet took note of the position.
Appointments 6.   The Cabinet were informed that the Minister of transport to Public had consulted the Lord President and the Minister of Health aboutBoards. a proposal to offer to the Clerk of a County Council a part-time((Previous appointment on the Hotels Executive.
