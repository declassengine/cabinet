43CM. 6 (48)27RationalHealthService.(previous reference:CM. (46) 93rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. (48) 23) on the attitude of the medical profession to the National Health Service. Annexed to this werecopies of the statement by the Negotiating Committee of the medical profession and of the Minister&apos;s reply to that statement. these documents had been circulated to all doctors.The Minister of Health said that, until the autumn of 1947,there had been some prospect that the medical profession as a whole would willingly accept the scheme for a National Health Service,and many leading members of the profession were still favourably disposed to it. The Negotiating Committee had, however, beendominated by a reactionary and vocal group, who, partly for political reasons, were seeking to prevent the Act from coming into operation.He himself believed that the medical profession had been treatedvery generously under the scheme and that the right course now wasto refuse any further concessions, apart from the appointment ofa committee to examine whether the Act safeguarded sufficientlythe rights of partners under existing partnership agreements. Itwould be wrong in principle to accept the claim that a doctor shouldhave a right to appeal to the High Court against a decision that hewas not fit to continue in the Service, for this would allow the courts to decide a matter which was essentially one for the Executive, andit should be noted that the Act gave doctors more protection thanthey had at present under the National Health Insurance Scheme.The proposal that doctors should be partly remunerated by a fixedsalary had great advantages for the beginner; and government supporters had favoured a much higher fixed element in the remuneration than the figure of  300 which he bad found itnecessary to adopt as a result of the recommendation in the SpensReport. In the doctors&apos; plebiscite, which was due to take place at the end of January, there would doubtless be a heavy vote againstparticipation in the National Health Service Scheme; but, if theGovernment yielded to this, other sectional groups would be encouraged to seek to frustrate the decisions of Parliament. Hewas satisfied that in the period before the scheme came into operation in July the force of public opinion would, if properly organised,compel the medical profession to modify their present attitude.He proposed to announce that the Act would be brought intooperation on 5th July, 1948.In discussion there was general support for the course proposedby the Minister of Health. It was suggested, however, that moreshould be done to explain the Government&apos;s case to the averagedoctor, and particularly to the younger members of the profession.While this would have to be done mainly after the plebiscite, theMinister of Health might consider issuing before the plebiscite afurther statement dealing briefly and clearly with those points, suchas the procedure for appeals, on which there appeared to be mostmisunderstanding.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal of the Minister of Health to appoint a Committee to advise him on the effect of the national health Service Act on the rights of doctors in existingpartnership agreements, and to give an undertaking tointroduce appropriate amending legislation if theCommittee advised that such rights were not adequatelyprotected.(2) Subject to (1), agreed that the Minister of Health shouldmake it clear that the Government intended to bring theNational Health Service scheme into operation in theform provided in the National Health Service Act, and agreed that the Act should be brought into operation on 5th July, 1948.(3) Took note that the Minister of Health would consult the34849-3 b 9
Lord President on the further measures which might betaken to ensure that full information about the positionof doctors under the scheme was made available both tothe general public and to the medical profession.Iraq.Anglo-IraqiTreaty of alliance.(previous reference:CM. (47)79thConclusions,Minute 3.)  &apos;2. On the previous evening the Regent of Iraq, after a meeting with members of his Government and other political leaders, had announced that the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty which had been signed at portsmouth on 15th January was not sufficient to consolidate the bonds of friendship between the two countries and that no treaty would be ratified which did not assure the rights and nationalaspirations of Iraq.The Foreign Secretary said that this was evidently an attempt by some political elements in Iraq to divert attention from the realcause of the recent outbreaks of disorder in Baghdad and to discreditthe Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Iraq, who were stillin London. Those who had advised the Regent to issue the state-ment were not fully familiar with the contents of the Treaty.This,- in fact, made substantial concessions to the national aspira-tions of Iraq; and, if it were not ratified, the existing Treaty, whichwas less favourable to the Iraqis, would continue in force. ThePrime Minister of Iraq, in a public statement issued that morningin London, had indicated his determination to secure the ratification of the Treaty on his return to Baghdad.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House ofCommons.Scotland.legislative and Adminis-trativeDevolution.(previous reference:CM. (47) 94thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (CP. (48) 22) covering a draft White paper setting out proposals, approved by the Cabinet on 11th December, for meeting the demand for a greater measure of Scottish control overScottish affairs. As a result of his consultations, the Secretary ofState was satisfied that these proposals would be acceptable to theScottish Executive of the Parliamentary Labour Party, the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, the Scottish Trades Union congress and the Scottish Council (Development and Industry) and that thedemand for a formal committee of enquiry would not be pressed.If the Cabinet approved the proposals, the Secretary of State would explain them to a full meeting of the Scottish Labour Group later in the day : he had already ascertained that they would not be opposed by Scottish Members of Parliament belonging to other parties.In discussion of the draft White Paper the following points were made : -(a) Appendix A, which set out the text of the proposedStanding Orders relating to Scottish business in the House ofCommons, would be omitted from the published version.(b) The Standing Committee on Scottish Bills would merelydiscuss the Bills referred to it under the proposed new standing orders and no Motions relating to these Bills would be put to theCommittee.(c) The statement in paragraph 1 that &apos;&apos; both the PrimeMinister and the Leader of the Opposition had commended Scottishaspirations &quot; should be omitted.
economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 1stConclusions,Minute 2.)Balance ofPayments.Devaluationof the Franc.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 19) covering the fourth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : The continuing drain on the dollar reserves of the sterling areagave cause for grave anxiety. The latest figures suggested that the dollar expenditure of India and Pakistan in 1947 might haveexceeded by as much as $90 million the limit proposed in thediscussions in the autumn with representatives of the sterling area countries. This was being investigated further in the current financial negotiations with those Dominions.Ministers expressed concern about the consequences which mightflow from our lack of full control over the dollar expenditure of therest of the sterling area. The efforts of the United Kingdom to redress its own adverse balance of payments with the western hemisphere-sphere were making some progress, but those efforts might at anytime be stultified by increased dollar expenditure by the rest ofthe sterling area over which the United Kingdom Government hadno effective control. Was it time to consider whether this dangeroutweighed the advantages which the United Kingdom had hithertoderived from acting as bankers for the whole of the sterling area?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had this questionconstantly in mind, and it might become necessary that some countries should cease to be members of the sterling area. TheCabinet would have an opportunity for further discussion of thisquestion when they considered the new estimate which he would shortly be circulating of the balance of payments position in 1948.The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in thediscussions on the proposed devaluation of the French franc.(d) The last sentence of paragraph 5 should be redrafted toavoid any suggestion that the new procedure would permit a large increase in the amount of Scottish legislation passed each Session.(e) It might be advisable to explain the proposals to a repre-sentative group of Scottish Peers before they were published.The Cabinet recognised that the publication of the White paper would stimulate the demands for further devolution to Wales.Support for the Welsh nationalist movement was strong in the Welshuniversities and schools and was growing in the industrial areas.It would be impossible to make concessions in the field of Parlia-mentary business similar to those proposed in paragraphs 5 to 7 ofthe White Paper, but the possibility of establishing for Wales some-thing on the lines of the Scottish Economic Conference should beconsidered, and it would be advisable for the Government to takethe initiative in this matter as soon as the White Paper was published.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d)above, approved the draft White Paper on scottish affairs annexed to CP. (48) 22 and invited the Secretaryof State for Scotland to settle with the Lord president and the Chief Whip the date of publication.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for Scotland would discuss with the Lord Privy Seal the suggestion that,before the publication of the White Paper, the proposals set out in it should be explained to a representative group of Scottish Peers.(3) Invited the Lord President to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Health, the First Lord of the admiralty and the Minister of National Insurance, what steps might be taken to meet a Welsh demand for the estab-lishment of a Welsh body similar to the ScottishEconomic Conference.
(d) The last sentence of paragraph 5 should be redrafted toavoid any suggestion that the new procedure would permit a large increase in the amount of Scottish legislation passed each Session.(e) It might be advisable to explain the proposals to a repre-sentative group of Scottish Peers before they were published.The Cabinet recognised that the publication of the White paper would stimulate the demands for further devolution to Wales.Support for the Welsh nationalist movement was strong in the Welshuniversities and schools and was growing in the industrial areas.It would be impossible to make concessions in the field of Parlia-mentary business similar to those proposed in paragraphs 5 to 7 ofthe White Paper, but the possibility of establishing for Wales some-thing on the lines of the Scottish Economic Conference should beconsidered, and it would be advisable for the Government to takethe initiative in this matter as soon as the White Paper was published.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a), (c) and (d)above, approved the draft White Paper on scottish affairs annexed to CP.

The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 19) covering the fourth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : The continuing drain on the dollar reserves of the sterling areagave cause for grave anxiety.

Production. Attention was again drawn to the need for stimulating recruit-ment to the textile industries and increasing the output of those industries. The Cabinet were informed that the production committee had recently held a comprehensive review of thesequestions and their recommendations would shortly be submittedto the Cabinet.It was suggested that this might be an opportune moment toarrange for the extension of the existing agreement for the workingof a longer week in the coal-mining industry. The Minister of fuel and Power said that, in accordance with the decision of the economic policy Committee on 9th January, he had informed the national coal Board that, while the published target for coal production in1948 would be set at a minimum of 211 million tons, the governmenth oped and expected that a higher output would in fact be achieved;and he had asked the Board to consider whether it was desirable for this purpose that they should negotiate an extension of theexisting agreement for longer working hours.Exports. The Cabinet were assured that the Board of Trade were taking all practicable steps to secure the diversion of exports to the western hemisphere and that industry generally was collaborating effectively in this policy. The following specific suggestions were made forfurthering the sale of British goods in America : (a) From the point of view of securing lasting markets, couldnot greater use be made of brand-names for goods sold in America ?Thus, it would be advantageous if British cloth could carry arecognisable brand-mark.(b) The prospective world shortage of oil might compel the useof smaller cars in America. This was the time to represent theBritish car as a contribution to the world&apos;s oil problem.(c) Special efforts should continue to be made to seek markets for British goods in the western areas of the United States.Attention was drawn to the substantial increase in the wholesale prices of farm products in the United States. This increased theimportance of our current efforts to develop alternative sources offood supply for the United Kingdom.The Lord President said that, as requested by the Cabinet on15th December, he had discussed with the Chancellor of theExchequer the suggestion that the Government should make availableto Members of Parliament periodical reports on the economic situa-tion. They had agreed that Members of Parliament might receivecopies of the notes which the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave to therepresentatives of the Press at his periodical Press conferences oneconomic affairs. Members would be told that, if they informed theParty Whips that they wished to receive this material, it would besent to them as a matter of course. If this arrangement provedsatisfactory, it could be extended subsequently to material which wasmade available at Press conferences held by other Ministers.The Cabinet approved these proposals and authorised the lord president to give effect to them.The Cabinet-Took note of CP.
