The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleagues, welcomedMr. Hugh Dalton&apos;s return to the Cabinet on his appointment asChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.2. The Prime Minister said that experience in the summer of1947 had emphasised the need for making arrangements in advance to ensure that a reasonable number of Ministers would be availablefor the transaction of Cabinet business at all times throughout the summer recess. He would, therefore, be asking all Ministers toinform him, through the Secretary of the Cabinet, of their holidayplans. When these were known, he would consider whether asufficient number of Ministers would be available for duty at all times throughout the Recess : he hoped that on this occasion it wouldnot be necessary for him to ask many Ministers to modify arrange-ments which they had already made.The Cabinet were informed that important decisions wouldhave to be taken, in about the second week of September, on a five-year economic programme which had to be formulated inconnection with the European Recovery Programme. It would be convenient, therefore, if Ministers closely concerned with those questions could arrange to take their holidays during August.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.4. In the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill on theprevious dav the House of Lords had deleted, by a majority of181 votes to 28. the clause suspending the death penalty for murder.The Home Secretary recalled that a substantial majority of Govern-ment supporters in the Commons had voted in favour of this clause,despite the advice given by the Government; and on the third reading of the Bill he had announced that the Government acceptedthe decision of the House of Commons. In the House of Lords, onthe other hand, though some speakers had offered uncompromisingopposition to any change in the existing law, it seemed likely thata majority would accept some compromise by which the death penaltywould be retained for a limited class of murders, as when a prisonermurdered a prison officer or a criminal committed murder in anattempt to evade arrest. He therefore sought the advice of hiscolleagues on the question whether an attempt should be made to devise some such compromise and to ascertain, by discussion at ameeting of the Labour Party, whether it would be acceptable to amajority of Government supporters in the House of Commons.The Home Secretary also recalled that, on the assumption thatthe new clause would be enacted during the present Session, he had decided that it would be his duty to ensure that meanwhile no death sentence for murder should be carried into effect, and he had announced his intention to advise His Majesty to commute everydeath sentence by conditional pardon to a sentence of penal servitudefor life. In the House of Lords debate on the previous day theLord Chief Justice had argued that this decision was unconsti-tutional. Subject to any views which his colleagues might have tooffer, he did not propose to modify his earlier decision on accountof this criticism.The Cabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should continueto advise commutation of all death sentences passed while the suspension of the death penalty was under discussion in the present session of Parliament.On the main issue the Cabinet recognised that, since the clausesuspending the death penalty had been passed by the House ofCommons, widespread doubts had been expressed about the wisdom of making this change in the law at the present time, and it seemed likely that the balance of public opinion throughout the country was against the clause. In the discussions on the Parliament Bill theGovernment had taken the line that the House of Lords was not 2

(48) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)trie xLuuse u-l uuiumujio, &quot;-^-^ - ----- - i- ,   - -      , ,,if the Government now considered that the earlier decision of the commons on the question of capital punishment did not accuratelyreflect the present mood of public opinion throughout the^ country jthev should find some means of avoiding a direct conflict oi view onthis issue between the Lords and the Commons. It was sigmscantthat Lord Chorlev. the President of the National Council lor daeAbolition of the Death Penalty, should have indicated in the Lordsdebate on the previous dav that he would be prepared to agree thatthe death penalty should be retained for treason or for the murder of a policeman or a prison officer. The Lord Chancellor had drawnup an outline of a clause designed to reserve the death penalty forspecially serious classes of murder, and there was reason to believethat a compromise on those lines might be acceptable to majorityopinion in the Blouse of Lords. There was no evidence that among government supporters there had been any substantial swing oaopinion against the clause since it had been carried on the report stage of the Bill; but it was possible that, if the difficulties of thesituation were fully explained at a Party meeting, a majority ofGovernment supporters might be persuaded to vote in favour of sucha compromise.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Healthsaid that in the circumstances which had now arisen they would beErepared to support a reasonable compromise along the lines whichad been indicated in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion. *The Cabinet (1) Agreed to recommend to the Parliamentary Labour party that the Government should seek a solution of thesituation arising from the decision of the House of lords to delete Clause 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill by putting forward a compromise clause under which the death penalty would be retained only for certain specifiedclasses of murder.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip to takeinformal soundings with a view to as&amp;rtainim? whether in the circumstances which had arisen a compromise solution on these lines would be acceptable to the more moderate opponents of the death penalty among Govern-nient supporters in the House of Commons.(3) Invited the Home Secretary and the Lord Chancellor to devise a new clause giving effect to the suggestedcompromise, which could be discussed at an early meetingof the Parliamentary Labour Party.5. The Lord Privy Seal &quot;said that, when the debate on theSecond Reading of the Parliament Bill was resumed in the Houseof Lords on 8th June, members of the Conservative Opposition were likely to urge that the Bill should be rejected outright. There was,however, a substantial body of Cross-Beneh opinion in the Lordswhich would be in favour of giving the Bill a. Second Reading and seeking to amend it in Committee in a way which might be acceptable to all Parties. In these circumstances it would probably be necessaryfor him to indicate, in replying to the debate, how far the Govern-ment would be prepared to go in accepting amendments which mightbe moved in Committee. Would his colleagues be agreeable to Msgiving an indication that, if the Bill went into Committee, ttu;Government would be prepared to accept an amendment providing that the &quot; period of delay &quot; under the Parliament Act procedure should be either twelve months from Second Reading in the commons, or nine months from Third Reading in the Commons,whichever was the longer ?In discussion there was general agreement that it would be unwise for the Government to promise in the Second Reading debate
cm. m c-sb)to accept: any particular amendment which might Ibe mewed anaCommittee. The Government spokesman could not properly gpsfurther than to promise that the Government would he prepaid toconsider on their merits amendments which did not destroy ithe imaimprinciple of the Bill.The Minister of Health said that in his view lit would fepreferable that the Government should make it clear from the outsellthat they were not prepared to make any further concessions on this bill. The amendments which had been tentatively discussed in tfikeParty Leaders7 Conference had been put forward in the hope offreaching a comprehensive agreement on both the powers and the composition of a Second Chamber; and. as no such comprehensiveagreement had been reached, the Government were mow under mmobligation to look favourably on any of those suggestions.. he himself had not been in favour of attempting to reach -an agreementbetween the Parties on House of Lords reform and, now thai ttteattempt had failed, he thought the Government would he in a mnehstronger position if they insisted that the Bill must be passed isthe form in which it had left the Commons, even if it had to teenacted in this form under the Parliament Act procedure. He -was concerned at the lengths to which the Government representatives in the Partv Leaders&apos; Conference had gone in discussing; House (offLords reform, without full consideration of all the issues ibj itfeCabinet; and he believed that, if any further concessions were mmmade on &quot;the Bill, the Government would find themselves in grasdifficulties with the Parliamentary Labour Party.In reply it was pointed out that the alternative JoTmulla, dftwelve months from Second Beading or nine months from TMsdHeading had been fully discussed by the Cabinet on Sth and11th March, ana the Cabinet had agreed on the latter date that_    - othe formula might be put forward by the Ministers taking part iaathe Party Leaders&apos; Conference on the basis that the Governmentwould be prepared to include this in any agreed set (off proposals on which the Party Leaders might undertake to ascertain the &quot;viewsof their supporters. It was clear that no concession could now temade on the Bill without further discussion at a. meeting rf tikeParliamentary Labour Party. But the immediate question was whether the Government spokesman in the Second Heading sfefeatoshould exclude in advance all possibility of the Governmenfsagreeing to anv amendment in the Committee Stage.In further discussion it was suggested that in the SeassajtHeading debate the Government should take the line that iffeprimary object of the Bill was to ensure that the power off the IJnrfsto delay the passage of legislation could not be used to prevent aGovernment from making effective use of the fourth session off a five-year Parliament. They were determined to secure that (ohfeeftIf, however, the Bill were given a Second Beading they wonM teprepared to consider in Committee, on their merits, any amendments which -were consistent with that object. There was general support for this suggestion.The Minister of Health said that, in agreeing that the (Gaswenm-ment spokesman might take this line in replying to the -See-cuidReading debate, he should not be understood to conrmit Mmselff tothe view that the powers of delay which might be accorded to theHouse of Lords as now constituted would be appropriate fegr are formed House of Lords designed to discharge the ffumetMjOS rfa revising Chamber.The Cabinet-Agreed that, in replying to the debate con tike Seam!Reading of the Parliament Bill in the House toff Lends, toneLord Privy Seal might indicate that, if the Bill memsesla Second Reading, the Government would te patepamsi toconsider in Committee, on their merits, any ainiaemdiffitvennt^which were not inconsistent with the Bills primarr shiest35556 - if. :?
of ensuring that the power of the Lords to delay legisation could not be used to prevent a Government from making effective use of the fourth session in a five-year Parliament.

Sudan. (Previous Reference: C.M. (47) 60th Conclusions, Minute 5.) 

6. The Foreign Secretary said that since 10th May His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo had been negotiating with the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs on a draft Ordinance for constitutional reform in the Sudan. In return for Egyptian approval of the draft we had offered to agree to-

(i) Two nominated Egyptian members on the Executive Council.

(ii) An Anglo-Egyptian Committee to supervise the elections to the Legislative Assembly.

(iii) An Anglo-Egyptian-Sudanese Committee to supervise the Sudan&apos;s progress towards self-government.

This offer had not satisfied the Egyptian Government, who had pressed that the Egyptian members of the Executive Council should be heads of departments in the Sudan administration. We could not accept this, since we were pledged not to introduce Egyptians into the Sudan administration; but His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had been authorised to offer a third seat on the Executive Council to be occupied by the senior staff officer of the Egyptian forces in the Sudan. The Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs was satisfied with this offer and it was understood that he had the support of the majority of the Egyptian Cabinet. The Egyptian Prime Minister, however, wished to insist on equality of status for the Egyptian members of the Executive Council and his view might prevail. The extended time-limit fixed for the final Egyptian reply expired on 7th June and, if the reply was not favourable, it was proposed to authorise the Governor-General to promulgate the Ordinance without Egyptian approval. This would be illegal, but our case in equity would be strong and it seemed unlikely that the Egyptians would bring the matter before the International Court. Any further delay would lead to unrest in the Sudan, which might well spread to Kenya.

The Cabinet-

Agreed that, if by 7th June the Egyptian Government had not approved the draft Ordinance for constitutional reform in the Sudan, the Governor-General should be authorised to promulgate the Ordinance without Egyptian approval.

Palestine. (Previous Reference: C.M. (48)34th Conclusions, Minute 1.)

7. The Lord Privy Seal said that Lord Strabolgi had put down a Question for Monday, 7th June, inviting a further Government statement on Palestine. If this Question were asked, a debate might develop on the situation in Palestine. He assumed that this would be undesirable and he therefore proposed to arrange for the Question to be removed from the Order Paper.

The Foreign Secretary said that any debate in either House on Palestine at the present stage would prejudice the efforts of the United Nations mediator to reach agreement on a date for the beginning of the proposed four weeks&apos; truce in Palestine.

The Cabinet-

Took note that the Lord Privy Seal would arrange for Lord Strabolgi&apos;s Question about the situation in Palestine to be removed from the Order Paper.

Steel Scrap. (Previous Reference: C.M. (48)31st Conclusions, Minute 3.)

8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Supply (C.P. (48) 130) reporting what had been done to increase deliveries of booty scrap from Germany and to place additional contrasts there for commercial scrap.

The Minister of Supply said that the situation was extremely disquieting. Though good progress had been made in providing the


C.M. 35 (48)

equipment necessary to enable deliveries of booty scrap to be increased, it had so far proved impossible to do anything effective towards obtaining commercial scrap. Even if all went as well as possible, we were likely to be 1/2 million tons short of the amount of scrap needed in the year 1st July, 1948-30th June, 1949. He would circulate shortly to his colleagues the final report of the Graham Cunningham Scrap Investigation Committee.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that we now had to face strong competition from the United States for supplies of German commercial scrap, and it would be dangerous to rely on obtaining large quantities from Germany. The fall in steel production that would take place if we failed to obtain the necessary supplies of scrap would be disastrous to our whole economy and, in his view, every effort must be made not only to obtain the maximum amount from Germany but also to draw supplies from other foreign countries and to exploit all possible sources of supply in the United Kingdom. He understood that the output of scrap from ship-breaking at Faslane, Garelochhead, could be considerably expanded if arrangement were made to add to the labour force, and the additional labour could be housed in empty camps in the neighbourhood.

The Foreign Secretary said that a date for the introduction of currency reform in Germany had now been fixed. If the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Supply would give him the necessary information about our difficulties in obtaining German commercial scrap he would take the matter up with the United States Ambassador. He would also be glad if the Minister of Supply would let him know whether the Italian Government were carrying out their undertaking to deliver scrap to the United Kingdom.

Other points in discussion were :-

(a) The production of pig iron was being expanded as rapidly as possible, but this did not affect the immediate need for large supplies of scrap in the next year or two.

(b) In recent trade discussions with the French Government an attempt had been made to obtain scrap from France.

(c) The Egyptian export tax on scrap had been withdrawn, but physical difficulties made it impossible to obtain more than very limited supplies from Egypt.

(d) The Minister of Supply might consider with the Minister of Transport whether highway authorities might not be asked to expedite the work of removing derelict tram lines during the next year or two.

(e) General Loch had accepted the invitation to take charge of the work of obtaining both booty scrap and commercial scrap from Germany.

The Cabinet-

(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Supply to give the Foreign Secretary a note showing what quantities of commercial scrap were required from Germany in the year 1st July, 1948, to 30th June, 1949, what difficulties stood in the way of obtaining this scrap and what suggestions might be made to the United States Government for overcoming these difficulties; and took note that the Foreign Secretary would then consider how the United States Government might best be approached.

(2) Took note that the Minister of Supply would shortly circulate a further memorandum on steel scrap covering the final report of the Graham Cunningham Scrap Investigation Committee, and invited the Minister to include in his memorandum estimates of the amount of scrap which might be obtained from overseas sources other than Germany and from the collection of scrap in the United Kingdom in the year 1st July, 1948, to 30th June, 1949.


(3) Invited the Mijmister of Supply to investigate the suggestionthat the output of scrap from ship breaking at Faslane,Gareloc-hhead. eoold be expanded and to report to thePrime jfeiister on this matter within a week.social services inWesternEurope.(previous reference:CM. (48)29thConclusions,Minute 2.)9. The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary(CP. (48) 131) covering the report of the Official Committee set upin accordance with the Cabinet&quot;? decision of 23rd February, 1948,to consider the possibility of securing a uniform standard of social services in Western European countries. They also had before thema memorandum by the Eoielgn Secretary (CP. (48) 132) covering a report by the&apos; Official! Committee on&quot; a proposal that the fivesignatories to the Brussels Treaty should jointly arrange a social services Exhibition.The Foreign S&amp;ereimr^ said that he was anxious that themachinery established by the Brussels Treaty should be used as soonas possible for promoting joint study and co-operation on importantsocial questions. The ofetiai Committee had drawn attention tocertain fields- in which Bseffal results might be achieved and had suggested certain topics thai His MajestyTs Government might putforward for discussion. If the Cabinet approved, he proposed to embody the Conmaittee^s proposals in a memorandum for submission to the Consultative OouboI established under Article VII of theTreaty. The Official Commelttee had also examined M. BidaulCsproposal for a Social Sendees Exhibition and had recommendedthat a film or series of Slums would be a better medium for portrayingthe social services of the Western European countries. He suggestedthat the Foreign Office amid the Central Office of Information, inconsultation with the Btepariments concerned with the main social services, should study iffc-s alternative proposal with a view toframing a reec an in en da: 102 for submission to the permanent commision at an early (date.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The work comaec-ted. with the introduction of the national insurance Scheme and tie National Health Service would impose a heavy strain on the stalls of the Ministry of National Insurance andthe Health Departments dnring the next six weeks. It would,therefore, be helpful if flue snfomission of the proposed memorandum to the Consultative Comndl could be postponed for a short period(b) Attention was drawn to the importance of developingco-operation in social services with Commonwealth Governments.Good progress was being made in this field.(c) There were already e-lose contacts with Western european countries in matters of edmc-atioB.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a useniEorandum based on the proposals made inthe report of the Official Committee on Social services in Western Europe annexed to CP. (48) 131 should beprepared for sdbinission to the Consultative Councilestablished raider Article VII of the Brussels Treaty,and invited the Foreign Secretary to settle with the health Ministers and the Minister of National insurance the date on wMdk this memorandum should be submitted.(2) Invited the lord President and the Foreign Secretary todiscuss the proposal made by the Official Committee on social Sendees In Western Europe that, as an alternative to a Social Sendees Exhibition, a film or series of filmsshould be prepared portraying the social services of theWestern Emuropean countries; and agreed that, if thissuggestion proved practicable, it should be submitted tothe Penmanemfc Commission established by the BrusselsTreatr.
United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information.

10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (C.P. (48) 124) giving an account of the proceedings at the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information. Annexed to this memorandum were the texts of three draft conventions which were to be submitted to the Economic and Social Council, together with any comments by the Governments which had taken part in the Conference. The Cabinet were asked to take note of these conventions and to agree that, subject to any comments that it might seem desirable to make on them as a result of consultation among the Departments concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government should inform the Secretariat of the Economic and Social Council that they were in agreement with the principles of the conventions.

Points in discussion were :-

(a) Article 3 of the draft convention on the gathering and international transmission of news would preclude a Minister from holding a Press conference confined to Lobby correspondents.

(b) When the draft convention on freedom of information came before the Economic and Social Council, the representative of His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to resist any attempt to make it automatically applicable to non-self-governing territories.

The Cabinet-

Took note of the draft conventions and of the resolutions passed by the United Nations Conference on Freedom of Information and agreed that the Economic and Social Council should be informed that, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above and to any other comments that it might seem desirable to make as a result of consultation with the Departments concerned, His Majesty&apos;s Government were in agreement with the principles contained in the draft conventions.

Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.

11. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it had been hoped to hold a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in June. This had proved impossible because the Prime Ministers of Canada and South Africa were unable to attend at that time and it was now proposed to hold a meeting in the autumn. Meanwhile individual Prime Ministers would be encouraged to visit the United Kingdom during the summer.

The Cabinet-

Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement and invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to arrange for a Parliamentary Question which would enable him to announce the Government&apos;s plans for a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.
