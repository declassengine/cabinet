1. On the Motion for the Adjournment on 14th May certainConservative Members intended to raise a debate on the military aspects of the situation in Palestine. The Cabinet agreed thatthe Minister of Defence should reply to this debate on behalf ofthe Government.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Whitsuntide Recess.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 122) seeking authority for thepreparation of a Bill to amend the Patents and Designs Acts inthe light of the Second Interim Report and the Final Reportof the Departmental Committee on those Acts (Cmd. 6789 of 1946and 7206 of 1947).With four exceptions this legislation would follow the recom-mendations made in those Reports, which had been well receivedby all parties interested in patent law. The Cabinefs discussionturned on these four exceptions, and the following points weremade: (a) A majority of the Committee had recommended that the comptroller of Patents and Designs should be empowered to rejectapplications for patents on the ground that the claim lacked inven-tive merit and involved nothing more than the application of elemen-tary common knowledge. The Judges of the High Court were,however, opposed to this recommendation, and it was not proposedto give effect to it.The Cabinet were informed that the Department of scientific and Industrial Research considered that patents of this kind were a definite hindrance to industry and would prefer that the Comp-troller should have power to reject such applications summarily.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, however, that in his experience claims based on elementary common knowledge hadsometimes led to developments of great scientific and industrialimportance; and it was only after searching enquiry that theimportance of the claims had been recognised. He did not thinkit would be possible to identify a class of applications which could safely be left to be handled summarily under the authority ofthe Comptroller. Other Ministers endorsed this view, and it wasagreed that the Committee&apos;s recommendation on this point shouldnot be accepted.(b) The Committee had proposed that two special Judges withtechnical or scientific qualifications and previous experience inpatent litigation should be appointed to deal with patent actions.The Lord Chancellor agreed that one such Judge should beappointed, and it was proposed that the Bill should provide thatone additional puisne Judge should be appointed primarily forpatent work.In discussion it was suggested that it ought not to be provided in the statute that the Judge appointed for this work should have special technical or scientific qualifications and practical experience in patent litigation. Such a statutory requirement might limitunduly the Lord Chancellors field of choice in the making of theappointment, and it might also become an embarrassing precedent.The Bill should provide merely for the appointment of an additionalpuisne Judge for this work, and it should be left to the LordChancellor to select a person suitably qualified to undertake it.The Lord Chancellor should be consulted on the wording of thisclause of the Bill.(c) It was proposed that the Bill should go beyond the recom-mendations of the Committee in providing remedies for preventingmisuse of patent rights or for securing a more extended use ofsuch rights. The Bill would provide that a Government Departmentmight apply for a licence under Section 27 of the Patents and designs Act, even where the actual manufacture would be under-taken by another person.   It was also proposed that where such
an application was based on the report of the Monopoly Commissionto be appointed under the Monopoly (Inquiry and Control) Bill,the Commission^ report should be accepted as conclusive evidencethat the patent was being restrictively or insufficiently used or thatits further use was in the public interest or in the interest of aiparticular trade or industry. These proposals were likely to provokesome controversy.The Cabinet were assured that Section 27 of the Act would not become fully effective unless Government Departments wereempowered to make such applications; and they approved theproposals put forward in paragraph 7 of CP. (48) 122.(d) The Committee had recommended that disputes between employers andr employees about the ownership of inventions might,with the consent of both parties, be submitted to the Comptrollerfor determination. It was, however, proposed that the Bill should give either party the right to submit such a matter to the comptroller, whether or not the consent of the other party hadbeen obtained.   The Cabinet endorsed this proposal.The Cabinet-(1) Subject to the point noted in paragraph (b) above, approved the proposals set out in CP. (48) 122 for legislation to amend the Patents and Designs Acts; and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to arrange for this legislation to be ready for introduction early in the1948-49 Session;(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to submit the draft Bill in due course for examination by theLegislation Committee.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financial negotiations which the Economic Secretary, Treasury, had beenconducting with representatives of the Ceylon Government had nowbeen brought to a satisfactory conclusion. The agreement reachedwould have the effect of blocking the greater part of Ceylon&apos;ssterling balances for the time being, on the basis of allowing arelease of  3^ million to meet Ceylon&apos;s current deficit in 1948, a working balance of  4 million and a contingent release of  1 million to be drawn upon if food prices rose. Ceylon had also undertaken to play her part in strengthening the dollar reserves of the sterling area. This point was of some importance, for Ceylon expected to earn this year about 180 million rupees&apos; worth of dollars whileintending to limit her dollar expenditure to about 100 million rupees.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Ceylonese representatives were well satisfied with the terms ofthe agreement which had been reached.The Cabinet took note of these statements.British. Trade. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that in a recent interview the philippines. Philippine Minister in London had expressed great interest in theExpansion of possibility of expanding trade between the United Kingdom andthe Philippines. It would be useful if the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade could see theMinister and ascertain in greater detail the prospects of expandingthis trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look into this in consultation with the President of the Board of Trade.Ceylon.financial agreement.Cabinet Office, S.
