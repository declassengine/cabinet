1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptian Governmenthad refrained from offering any comment on the draft Ordinancefor constitutional reform in the Sudan. They had been given ampletime in which to communicate their views; and he proposed thatthe Governor-General should now promulgate the Ordinance withoutEgyptian approval. A statement would be made in the House ofCommons later that day explaining the substance of the Ordinanceand the efforts which had been made to secure the agreement of theEgyptian Government.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Germany. 2.   The Foreign Secretary reminded the Cabinet that the(Previous       French National Assembly would on the following day resume theirEef erence:      debate on the report of the London Conference on the future of cm.(48)37th  Germany.   Whatever the outcome of this debate, he thought that conclusions,    the British and United States authorities should proceed to carryMinute 1.)     out the Conference^ proposals in the combined Anglo-AmericanZone.   Every effort had been made at the Conference to meet theFrench point of view; and he was not prepared to accept theproposal which had been put to him by the French Government thata further attempt should be made to secure the participation of theSoviet Government.The Cabinet-Agreed that the recommendations of the London Conferenceon the future of Germany should be put into effect in theAnglo-American Zone of Germany, even though they werenot endorsed by the French National Assembly.Burma. 3.   The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the deterioration(Previous       in the political situation in Burma. Thakin Nu, the Prime Minister,Eefsronce:      had recently announced his intention to resign on 20th July and1CM. (47)78th   to devote himself to the leadership of the Anti-Fascist People&apos;conclusions,    Freedom League.   He had accompanied this announcement by a minute 2.)     statement of policy which was Communist in tone and substance andat variance with the moderate line which he had hitherto pursued.His object may have been to save his Coalition administration bytimely concessions to extremist Left-wing opinion, but, if thismanifesto correctly reflected their policy, the Government of Burmamust now be considered to have thrown in their lot with Communism.His Majesty&apos;s Government should therefore review the obligations towards Burma which they undertook under the Treaty and exchange of Notes of October 1947.There was general agreement with this suggestion. Ministersalso thought it would be advisable for the Foreign Secretary to makeit plain to the Burmese Ambassador in London that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were greatly concerned at the failure of the Governmentof Burma to give effect to the undertakings into which they had entered last year. Some doubt was, however, expressed whetherThakin Nu&apos;s statement represented so marked a departure from hisearlier attitude as might at first sight appear. Even at the time ofthe negotiations for the Treaty, the Anti-Fascist People&apos;s FreedomLeague had been in negotiation with the more moderate of the twoCommunist parties in Burma, in the hope of using it to defeat theother. It was suggested that U Tin Tut might be able to throwsome light-on the situation, if he could be persuaded to talk frankly,and The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider this suggestion.35672-4 B 2(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Commonwealth Affairs Committee should review, in the light of recent developments in Burma, the commitments undertaken by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the Anglo-Burmese Treaty of 1947;(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would inform the burmese Ambassador in London of the concern felt byHis Majesty&apos;s Government at the failure of the Govern-ment of Burma to carry out their undertakings in that treaty.European 4.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the strain imposedEconomic       0n the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation by theCo-operation,   demands of the United States authorities for the supply of statistical(Previous       information in connection with the European Recovery Programme.reference:      These demands were so extensive and exacting that there was a riskO.M.(48)29th   that the Organisation would break down under their burden.   TheConclusions,    position might improve as the result of the new arrangement by which minute 2.)&apos;    Mr. Harriman would nominate representatives to attend meetingsof the technical Committees of the Organisation, but it seemed desirable that the United States authorities should be warned ofthe consequences which might follow unless they moderated their requirements.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the Head of theUnited Kingdom Delegation to the Organisation for Euro-pean Economic Co-operation to discuss with Mr. Harrimanthe possibility of securing a substantial reduction in thedemands made on the Organisation by the United states authorities for statistical information in connection withthe European Recovery Programme.Iron andSteel Bill.(previous reference:CM. (48) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)Scope of acquisition.5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Iron and steel bill. In addition to the papers considered at their earlier discussion on 7th June, they now had before them a further memorandum bythe Minister of Supply (CP. (48) 145) setting out the arguments for bringing the iron and steel industry under public ownership.The Cabinet first discussed whether, as proposed by the Ministerof Supply, the Bill should provide for the acquisition of all com-panies producing in 1946 and 1947 upwards of 50,000 tons of iron ore or upwards of 20,000 tons of pig iron, ingot steel or re-rolledproducts. This would bring under public ownership 85 companiestogether with 155 subsidiaries. An alternative and more restrictedscheme would bring only 32 companies and 100 subsidiaries under public ownership.Against the wider scheme, it was urged that the Minister ofSupply and the Iron and Steel Corporation would find greatadministrative difficulty in controlling the activities of such a largenumber of companies. Moreover, the wider scheme would accentuatethe difficulties which would arise owing to the combination of ironand steel production with other activities, for the predominantinterest of some of the firms which would be taken over was in their other activities. It was also suggested that a desirable element of competition might be provided by leaving some of the medium-sizedfirms in private ownership. It was accordingly proposed that theBill should provide for the immediate transfer of only 32 companies with 100 subsidiaries and should confer power to bring additionalcompanies under public ownership as and when this becamedesirable.In favour of the wider scheme, it was pointed out that it would bring under public ownership virtually all those companies withinthe field now controlled by the Iron and Steel Federation.   These
formed a coherent and manageable group and their acquisition would avoid many of the difficulties of reorganisation which were boundto arise if a number of fairly large firms was left in private ownerrship. Even the restricted scheme would bring under public ownership several companies whose predominant interests were inother activities and, though the amount of hiving off would be greater under the wider scheme, no new question of principle wouldbe raised. The alternative of providing for the acquisition ofadditional firms at a later stage would create conditions of uncer-tainty in which private firms would be afraid to embark on new development. On political grounds the wider scheme was to be preferred and it was understood that nothing less would satisfy thetrade unions.Other points in discussion were : (a) It would be desirable to take powers in the Bill to preventcompanies which were to be brought under public ownership fromhiving off activities in order to evade the objects of the Bill, and a warning to the industry on this matter might have to be given atan early date. On the other hand, it would be open to the Ministerto give his approval and encouragement to the hiving off in anticipation of the Bill of activities which formed no part of what it was desired to bring under public control.(b) It was most desirable that the proposed Corporation shouldhave the services of the staff of Steel House. This could not besecured by legislation, but there was a reasonable prospect that thestaff would find in the employment of the Corporation the bestscope for the use of their qualifications.(c) There was general agreement that firms which fell outsidethe definition in the Bill should not have an option to demandinclusion in the scheme of acquisition. This decision could be defended on the ground that the grant of an option might lead tothe Corporation^ being saddled with a number of obsolescent plants.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Bill should provide for the acquisition ofall companies producing in 1946 or 1947 upwards of50,000 tons of iron ore or upwards of 20,000 tons of pigiron, ingot steel or re-rolled products;(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to consider what powers might be taken to prevent firms from hiving off activitieswith a view to evading the objects of the Bill;(3) Agreed that firms outside the definition in the Bill shouldnot be given the option to demand inclusion in thescheme.Powers of the In CP. (48) 123 it was proposed that the Bill should confer onCorporation. the Corporation the sum of the existing powers in the memorandaof association of all the companies which would come under public ownership, and should leave each company free to exercise thepowers conferred by its own memorandum. Many of the powers which the Corporation and individual companies would thus be free to exercise authorised the carrying on of activities far removed from the production of iron and steel and some of the moreextraneous powers had not, in fact, been exercised hitherto. Thegrant of such wide powers to the Corporation might exciteopposition and it was suggested in CP. (48) 123 that, if necessary,the Government should offer so to amend the Bill as to restrict theCorporation to the sum of the activities actually performed at thedate of transfer by the companies, and to limit each company toactivities which it was actually performing, subject to a proviso that the Minister should have power to authorise the corporation or an individual company to undertake additional activities.It was pointed out that the Government might incurunnecessary criticism by proposing to confer on the Corporationpowers to carry on such extraneous activities as banking, distillingand printing, and that the experiences of the Transport Bill had
shown the strength of the opposition that might develop. On theother hand, no similar difficulties had arisen in connection with theCoal Industry Nationalisation Bill, the Electricity Bill or the GasBill and it was undesirable to limit the powers of the companies toonarrowly.The suggestion.was made that criticism might be avoided byconfining the functions of the Corporation to that of a holding company. There would then be no need to define its powers andthe existing companies could be left with the powers under the memoranda of association.Attention was also drawn to the importance of conferring onthe Minister of Supply adequate powers to control the Corporation.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Minister of Supply, in the light of the dis-cussion, to circulate a further memorandum dealing withthe powers to be conferred on the Corporation and, inparticular, with the suggestion that the Corporationmight be constituted simply as a holding company.It was pointed out that, if the Bill was to be passed underthe amended Parliament Act, there would be no scope tor amendingit after it had been sent to the House of Lords for the first time.It was therefore desirable to give as much time as possible forconsideration of any reasonable suggestions for amendment and theMinister of Supply had proposed that there should be a reasonableinterval before Second Reading and between Second Reading andthe Committee Stage in order to give opportunity for discussions with interested parties. The suggestion had also been made that theBill might be introduced at the end of the current Session, in orderto give longer time for public comment on its provisions.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be inexpedientnot to follow up the publication of the Bill within a reasonable time with a full exposition of the case for it. If, however, the Bill were introduced at the end of the current Session this would have to bedone by a Government statement which, whether it took the formof a White Paper or some other form, would anticipate theMinister&apos;s speech on Second Reading. There was, therefore, muchto be said for not publishing the Bill until two or three weeks beforethe Second Reading debate. This would probably mean publication in October, when the short Session proposed in CP. (48) 147 would still be in progress, and the possibility might be considered of holding in that Session a Second Reading debate in which theGovernments case could be expounded.The Cabinet-(5) Invited the Minister of Supply to discuss with the lord president and the Chief Whip the arrangements for theintroduction of the Iron and Steel Bill.There was general agreement that the arguments set out by theMinistry of Supply in OP. (48) 145 justified the Government inproceeding with the scheme outlined in CP. (48) 123. It was,however, suggested that the Socialisation of Industries Committeeshould, examine these arguments and submit to the Cabinet a revisedstatement setting them out in greater detail.Other points in discussion were :-(d) There was good reason to believe that the efficiency of the managing and technical staff in the iron and steel industry wouldnot be impaired by the removal of the profit motive, provided thatthere was no substantial reduction in the salaries and privilegesattached to their posts.(e) The Corporation would have to encourage individualmanagements to take a personal responsibility for the success oftheir undertakings.
(/) In filling vacancies in or in reorganising the boards of directors of existing companies, the policy should be to appointdirectors with direct experience of the production side of theindustry.(g) So far as the workers were concerned, the strongest:justification for the Government&apos;s proposal was that they wouldwould remove the fear of a return to the policy of restriction of out-put which had largely prevailed in the inter-war years.The Cabinet-(6) Subject to Conclusion (4) above, approved the scheme setout in CP. (48) 123 for bringing the iron and steelindustry under public ownership;(7) Invited the Socialisation of Industries Committee toexamine the arguments in favour of the scheme outlined in CP. (48) 145, and to prepare for the Cabinet a revisedstatement setting out these arguments in greater detail.6. The Prime Minister drew attention to reports, published in certain newspapers on 12th, 13th and 14th June, purporting to describe the course of the Cabinefs discussions on the Iron andSteel Bill and the views held by individual Ministers.In discussion grave concern was expressed at the continuingdisclosure of confidential discussions between Ministers. For the efficient conduct of Government business it was essential that ministers should feel able to speak among colleagues with fullassurance that the confidential nature of those discussions wouldbe respected. If these disclosures continued the conduct of cabinet business would be seriously prejudiced.The Prime Minister impressed on all his colleagues theimportance of exercising the greatest discretion in relation to thebusiness discussed at meetings of the Cabinet and its Committees.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 147) on the adjustments to be made in theParliamentary programme in consequence of the decision of theHouse of Lords to reject the Parliament Bill.This memorandum recommended that three further sessionsshould be held before the present Parliament was dissolved. In thefirst of these, a short session running from 14th September to about27th October, 1948, the Parliament Bill would be passed by the commons and sent to the Lords for a second time, but no otherlegislative business would be transacted. This would be followed bya long session, running from late in October or early in November,1948, until December, 1949, in which the Parliament Bill would be passed into law and the Iron and Steel Bill would be passed by the commons for the first time. In the third session, which would openin January, 1950, and would be relatively, short, the Iron andSteel Bill could, if it had been rejected by the Lords in the precedingsession, be passed into law under the amended provisions of the parliament Act.An alternative course would be to hold two normal sessions in1948/49 and 1949/50. In the first of these the Parliament bill would be sent to the Lords for the second time and the Iron andSteel Bill for the first time. In the second the Parliament bill would be sent to the Lords for the third time and the Iron andSteel Bill, if rejected by the Lords in the preceding session, for thesecond time. This arrangement would, however, have the disadvan-tage that in the final session of the Parliament both these bills would be running simultaneously and, if the Lords had not rejectedthem earlier, both would have to be put forward for Royal Assentat the end of the session immediately before the General Election.
The Iron and Steel Bill could then become law only by virtue of a parliament Act which had received the Boyal Assent on the same day. The Government would thus be leaving in jeopardy, right upto the eve of the Dissolution, their policy of passing the Iron andSteel Bill in the lifetime of the present Parliament; and there was some risk that technical difficulties might at the last moment preventthat Bill from being passed into law before the General Election.The Cabinet agreed that the better course was to hold threefurther sessions as recommended in CP. (48) 147. They also agreedthat under this timetable it would be preferable that the shortsession in the autumn of 1948 should be opened by Commission.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals, put forward in paragraphs 8 and7 of CP. (48) 147, for the arrangement of the remainingsessions of the present Parliament;(2) Authorised the Lord President and the Lord Privy Seal to consult with the leaders of the Opposition with a viewto reaching agreement on this proposed arrangement ofthe remaining sessions of the present Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th June, 1948.
