2. On 18th November, 1947, the Cabinet had decided that inthe proceedings on the Criminal Justice Bill the Home secretary should advise Parliament on the Governments behalf that thepresent was not an opportune time for abolishing capital punish-ment; but they had agreed that Ministers who dissented from this advice should be free, if they so desired, to vote for the abolition ofthe death penalty.The Lord President invited the Cabinet to review their decision that Ministers should be free to vote against the advice which wasto be given on this issue by the responsible Minister as representingthe considered view of the Government. It was undesirable inprinciple that Ministers who shared a collective responsibility shouldvote in different Lobbies, even on an issue of this kind. Tor this wasnot wholly a matter for the individual&apos;s conscience, as the vote onthe Prayer Book Measure of 1927 had been: it also involvedquestions of law and order for which the Government had a collective responsibility. He recognised that some of his colleaguesheld such strong convictions on the moral issues involved that they felt they could not conscientiously vote against the abolition of the death penalty; but, in view of the constitutional principle at stake,he felt obliged to ask the Cabinet to consider again whether the viewsof these Ministers would not be sufficiently met if they abstained from voting.In discussion there was general support for the view that itwould be preferable if those Ministers who felt unable, on grounds of conscience, to vote for the retention of the death penalty couldcontent themselves with abstaining from voting&apos;. It would no doubt be deduced that Ministers who so abstained felt, unable to givepositive support for the retention of the death penalty, but in thespecial circumstances it would be permissible for those Ministers tojustify their abstention on the ground that they did not wish to embarrass their colleagues by voting against the advice given by theHome Secretary on the Governments behalf. From the angle of theGovernments collective responsibility there was a practical differ-ence between abstaining and actually voting against the advice given on behalf of the Government. In these circumstances it would notbe necessary for Ministers who felt unable to vote with the Govern-ment in this Division to be absent from Parliament during the wholeof the debate.The Cabinet Agreed that members of the Government (including LawOfficers and junior Ministers) who felt unable, on grounds of conscience, to vote for the retention of the death penaltyshould abstain from voting in the Divisions to be taken on this issue in the proceedings on the Criminal justice bill.3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the courseof the discussions with the Soviet authorities about the accidentwhich had occurred on 5th April to a British civil aircraft carryingpassengers to Berlin. This aircraft had been approaching theGatow airport in the British sector of Berlin when it came intocollision with a Soviet fighter aircraft. Both machines had crashedto the ground and all the occupants had been killed. Representa-tions had at once been made to the Soviet authorities in BerlinEroposing that representatives of the four Occupying Powers shouldold an enquiry into the causes of the accident, and asking that an assurance should be given meanwhile that British aircraft using theair corridor to the western sectors of Berlin would not be molestedby Russian aircraft.    Though this assurance had been given-3 b 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
AustrianPeace Treaty.(previous reference erence:CM. (48)2ndConclusions,Minute 4.)4.   The Foreign Secretary said that from his discussions in thiscountry with Austrian Social Democrats and from enquiries madeon his behalf by Sir William Strang in Vienna he was satisfied thatdemocracy could best be preserved in Austria by the early signature of the Austrian Treaty and the consequential withdrawal of theAllied armies of occupation.   The signature of the Treaty would lead to the withdrawal of Soviet troops, not only from Austria,where their presence afforded opportunities of arming Communistsupporters, but also from Roumania and Hungary, where troops were being kept to preserve the lines of communication of the soviet forces in Austria.  The Soviet Government had indicated that theywould be prepared to accept payment of 150 million dollars inrespect of their claim to former German assets other than oilinterests and certain shipping assets; and he hoped it would bepossible to reach a reasonable compromise over the British, american and Russian claims to oil concessions in Austria.   There were stillcertain outstanding issues to be settled, such as reparations claims,frontier rectifications and the right of Austria to import arms forher armed forces; but he believed that Russia might welcome theopportunity of reaching a settlement which would enable her towithdraw her troops from Austria and consolidate her position in eastern Europe. He recognised that Austria would be faced with serious economic difficulties if she were unable to trade freely withthe Balkans, but he hoped that these would be mitigated by the promotion of closer economic ties with Italy.verbally, on the evening of the accident, by the Russian Commandantin Berlin, the reply to our written representations had not includedany such assurance and had proposed that the enquiry into the causes of the accident should beheld by representatives of the Britishand Soviet Governments only. An enquiry so limited was not likelyto give satisfaction to the United States and French Governments,especially as two United States citizens had lost their lives in the accident. The Foreign Secretary was therefore replying that an anglo-Soviet enquiry could be accepted if representatives of theUnited States and French Governments were associated with it.In view of the unsatisfactory nature of the Russian reply he also proposed that the whole of the correspondence should now bepublished.Land Corridor The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the restrictions to Western which the Soviet authorities had sought to impose on movementSectors of through the land corridor giving access to the western sectors of berlin. Berlin.No restrictions were now being placed on the free movement oftraffic by road or canal or of freight traffic by rail. The soviet authorities were, however, asserting a right to stop passengertrains for the purpose of inspecting the passengers&apos; documents.They sought to justify this action by alleging that Germans had inthe past been allowed to leave Berlin by these trains. It was possiblethat some irregularities had occurred; and in any event it wouldbe inexpedient to allow this minor inconvenience to be made theoccasion for a serious breach with the Soviet authorities. It was unfortunate that the Allied Powers had not concluded in 1945 a detailed agreement regulating travel from the western Zones to berlin. In Austria written agreements had been made on thecorresponding problem of access to Vienna. Steps would now haveto be taken, in a more difficult atmosphere, to conclude a satisfactoryfour-Power agreement on this question in Germany. It would,however, be inexpedient to allow the significance of these difficulties to be magnified in public discussion.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s state-ments.
Soviet 5. The Foreign Secretary said that the firm attitude adoptedby the Finnish Government had resulted in the signature of a treaty which, on the face of it, preserved Finland from Soviet interference in her internal affairs and treated her rather as a neutral bufferState than as a Soviet satellite. The Soviet Government had not pressed for bases in Finland and, although in war the provisions inthe treaty for prior consultation before Soviet troops enteredFinland might be of little effect, Finland had at least been given abreathing space and in a few years&apos; time, when she had completed the payment of reparations to Russia, her natural trade interests were likely to strengthen her ties with Western Europe.6. The Cabinet were informed that, although it was difficult to forecast the results of the impending elections in Italy, the latest reports suggested that the Government might survive the CommunistParty&apos;s challenge. The Communists seemed to be making no head-UJJO, way in the north, and the main danger was in the south, where they5.) had been able to exploit the peasants&apos; grievances against thelandowners.rap. 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (48) 99) covering a report by the Scrap InvestigationCommittee on the prospects of obtaining steel scrap from Germany.The Minister of Supply said that the Committee had reachedthe conclusion that there would be little chance of obtainingsubstantial quantities of commercial scrap from Germany until theGerman currency had&apos; been reformed. They had therefore recommended measures to increase the rate of delivery of booty scrapin 1948 to 50,000 tons a month, which, together with imports fromother overseas sources and deliveries against the contracts alreadyplaced for commercial scrap, would provide enough imported scrapto enable 14 million ingot tons of steel to be produced in 1948. Hisown view was that, while every effort should be made to increasedeliveries of booty scrap, we must secure considerable additional imports of commercial scrap in 1948 in order to enable the produc-tion of steel to be raised beyond the target of 14 million tons andto provide adequate stocks for 1949. He therefore proposed to pursue the question of placing further contracts for commercialscrap, and he would circulate a further report to the Cabinet by theend of May showing what he had been able to do in this direction and, if necessary, making proposals for more drastic action.Meanwhile, he hoped that all the Departments concerned would regard as a matter of first urgency the provision of the equipmentnecessary to secure an immediate increase in the deliveries of booty scrap and to handle the increased deliveries of commercial scrapwhich he hoped to secure.The following points were made in discussion: (a) The Soviet Government had originally shown signs ofwishing to co-operate in currency reform in Germany, but in recent weeks progress had been held up through the breakdown of theControl Council meetings. Unless discussions could be resumed ona four-Power basis at an early date, it was proposed to hold three-Power discussions on currency reform in Western Germany alone.(6) In accordance with the recommendation made in para-graph 21 of the report annexed to CP. (48) 99, the Minister ofSupply was taking steps to ensure that adequate transport facilities would be available to handle increased deliveries of scrap fromGermany.The Cabinet-Endorsed the policy which the Foreign Secretary waspursuing with regard to the Austrian Peace Treaty.
(c) The Minister of Supply was satisfied that there was now norisk that foreign buyers would be allowed to acquire in overseas territories British surplus stores or equipment from which sub-stantial amounts of scrap could be obtained.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals made in CP. (48) 99 for increasingdeliveries of booty scrap from Germany, and invited thethe early provision of the equipment listed in para-graph 8 of that memorandum.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Supply should try to placefurther contracts for commercial scrap from Germany.(3) Took note that the Minister of Supply would circulate afurther memorandum by the end of May showing howfar it had been possible to increase deliveries of booty scrap and what progress had been made in&apos; placingadditional contracts for commercial scrap.Ministers concernedCabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th April, 1948.
