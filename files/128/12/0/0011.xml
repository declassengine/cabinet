The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the Hioose esCoinmeBaa.Busmessiii Reference was made to the death of the Earl of Derby, and itHie Souse of was asked whether the business of the House of Lords should beLords, interrupted so that tribute might be paid to his memory. The PrimeMinister said that in the House of Commons these tributes were paid only on the deaths of Royal Personages, heads of States, formerPrime Ministers or Party Leaders and Ministers dying while in office- He thought it undesirable that this practice should beextended, and he had recently resisted a suggestion that the Houseof Commons should mark in this way their sorrow at the death ofMr. Gandhi. The Lord Privy Seal said that he would seek to persuade the House of Lords to follow the same practice in thismatter.Wages PoBcy.        2.   The   Cabinet were  informed  that  the  Trades  Union(Previous       Congress had represented to the Prime Minister that they shouldBeferenee:      have been consulted in advance about the statement on PersonalCM.

Ministers had been in consultationwith the Trades Union Congress for some time past on the general issues covered by that statement, and it. would not have been right-to consult the Congress on the actual terms of the statement before it was made in Parliament.  The Prime Minister said that he would reply in this sense to the representations which had been madeto Mat.Parliament. 3,   Xhe formula approved by the Cabinet on 3rd February hadamendunehii proved acceptable to the Opposition leaders in the House of Lords,of tie and the debate on the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill hadParliament now been adjourned so that discussions might be held betweenact representatives of the political Parties.i Previous The Lord Privy Seal said that he did not expect these dis-BefereBee:      cessions to be protracted.

And, in any event, the opposition leaders had undertaken that the House of Lords would either passor reject that Bill before the end of the present Session.It was likely that the Conservative Party would be represented in these discussions by the Marquess of Salisbury, Viscount Swintonand either Mr. Anthony Eden or Mr. Oliver Stanley. The liberal party would probably be represented by Viscount Samuel andMr. Clement Davies. The Governments representatives would be chosen by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet Took note of the position.economic affairs.(PreviousBefersmse:CM. (-3$Con efasSkgEffi,MiTiiiiibe 5L)BaEam-Be aafPavsmemits.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 32) covering the fifth of his periodical reports on the economic situation.The following points were raised in discussion : During the first three weeks of January the drain on our dollar reserves had been equivalent to a monthly rate of about  53 million,as compared with a little over  40 million in December 1947. if our dollar expenditure continued at this rate, it would be impossibleto confine the withdrawal from reserves within the target of 117 million which had been set for the first quarter of 1948.34933-4b 2
trade agreement j.Production.Exports.Some progress had been made in our efforts to secure a greater measure of control over the dollar expenditure of India and pakistan, but no final agreement on this question had yet beenrcJEtciiccIWe had concluded with Switzerland a very satisfactory tradeand financial agreement, which made it possible for us to reopen the tourist traffic from this country to Switzerland without loss of gold or dollars. The Swiss Government had adopted a most helpfulattitude; and the early conclusion of this agreement had assisted in steadying public confidence in sterling, following the depreciation of the French franc. It was unfortunate that the Press and theBritish Broadcasting Corporation had not given greater prominenceto this agreement or stressed its importance as a factor in the Govern-ment s policy for promoting the political and economic integration of western Europe. Further efforts should be. made to see that duepublicity was given to these trade agreements in the context ofGovernment policy for the union of western Europe.A critical point had now been reached in the negotiations withthe Argentine, and it was hoped that a satisfactory agreement would be concluded within the next day or so. If not, the negotia-tions would be discontinued. The Argentine Government wereshort of sterling and the basis of the agreement would be that, inorder to enable them to complete their purchase of the British rail-ways in the Argentine, we should make available to them an amountof sterling which would be treated as an advance payment on thesupplies which we had contracted to draw from the Argentine inthe coming year. The agreement would not, however, be concludedunless we could secure due facilities for the admission of our imports into the Argentine. The assistance given to our negotiators by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Buenos Aires had been most valuable.Recent experience in Buenos Aires illustrated the advantage ofentrusting the general conduct of such negotiations to someone otherthan a diplomat and holding the Ambassador in reserve to interveneat critical stages on the political level.In pursuance of the Cabinets conclusion of 26th January theLabour (Textile Industries) Committee had been appointed and had started work. Intensive local publicity would have to be under-taken in Lancashire in order to bring home to the workers in thecotton industry the gravity of the economic situation and the urgent need for increased output. It was, however, desirable that, in orderto clear the way for this campaign, Departments should first settlecertain administrative questions e.g.. what building facilities could be provided for securing miner improvements in the lay-outof cotton factories and to what extent the calling-up of cottonoperatives for military service could be deferred. The newMinisterial Committee were arranging for these questions to be con-sjdered urgently. Meanwhile all preparations were being made,both in London and locally, for an intensive publicity campaign tobe launched in the early spring.It had now been agreed that coal exports should be raised toan average rate of 300,000 tons a week. With this increased volumeof exports it was desirable that the National Coal Board shouldhave a larger measure of discretion in their choice of overseas markets. This was now under consideration by the overseas negotiations Committee. There were also indications that theexpansion of our coal exports might be hampered by the continuingexport of low-grade coal from the United States. We had beenunder heavy pressure from the United States Government to resumeour export of coal to European countries, as part of the european recovery Programme; and it would be anomalous if difficulties were now placed in our way by the desire of United States exporters toretain overseas markets which they had secured during the war.This was a matter on which representations might be made to theUnited States Government.We were still sending a substantial proportion of our exportsto soft-currency countries. The Cabinet were informed that thiswas due to the fulfilment of long-standing orders, particularly for
defence white Paper.(previous reference:CM. (48) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (48) 34) covering the draft of* a White Paperembodying the annual statement relating to defence.The Minister of Defence said that the bulk of the White Paperrelated to the Defence Estimates for 1948-49, which had beenapproved by the Cabinet. Paragraphs 51-62, which dealt with thefuture, were necessarily tentative, since it had not yet been possibleto draw up a co-ordinated long-term plan for the Armed Forces.He drew special attention to the decision, announced in para-graph 61, that in each of the years 1948, 1949 and 1950 the numberof men called up under the National Service Act would be limitedto a maximum of 150,000.The following points were raised in discussion : (a) The Government spokesmen in the debate should be pre-pared to defend the delay in producing a long-term co-ordinatedplan for the Armed Forces. They were also likely to be questionedon the state of preparedness of the Navy and on the suggestion that definite steps should now be taken towards the unification of thethree Services. Ministers should accept full responsibility for thedecisions announced in the White Paper and should resist anyattempt to place responsibility on the Chiefs of Staff.(&amp;) Some doubts were expressed about the decision, announced in paragraph 22, to exclude from the Defence Estimates for 1948-49all expenditure on research and development for civil aviation andatomic energy. Would this not mean that the Civil Estimates would carry more than their proper share ?In reply it was pointed out that there were good reasons forexcluding all expenditure in the field of atomic energy and that theTreasury were satisfied that the expenditure on research anddevelopment for aviation was reasonably divided between theDefence and Civil Estimates.(c) It was agreed that certain drafting amendments should bemade in order to make it clear that the proposal made in para-graph 47 for better co-ordination of the common administrative services of the Armed Forces was not put forward as a more satis-factory alternative to amalgamation; to improve the wording ofthe opening sentence of paragraph 60; and to avoid any suggestion in paragraph 61 that the means to be adopted for limiting thenumber of men called up under the National Service Act might involve the complete exemption of any group.India and the southern Dominions. It would necessarily be sometime before the change in export policy was fully reflected in the flow of exports.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Economic Report (CP. (48) 32).(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to considerwhether he could make, in reply to a parliamentary question, a statement welcoming the conclusion of theAnglo-Swiss Agreement.(3) Asked the Lord President to impress on the Chairman ofthe British Broadcasting Corporation the importanceof presenting these trade agreements with european countries in the context of Government policy for pro-promoting the unity of western Europe.(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Fuel and Power, whatrepresentations should be made to the United StatesGovernment regarding the continuing export of UnitedStates coal to European markets.
U.N.E.S.C.O. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of report of Education (CP. (48) 30) covering a report by his ParliamentarySecond Secretary on the Second General Conference of the United nations general Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation.Conference. Minister of Education said that the Organisation could be(Previous       developed into a powerful international agency for fostering the reference:      free development of the human spirit.   The United Kingdom had .M.(47)35th   taken the initiative in creating the Organisation and had main-Conclusions,     tained the leadership in its deliberations.    A series of nationalMinute 4.)      co-operating bodies had been created for the purpose of givingpractical effect in this country to the work of the Organisation; andhe hoped that Government Departments would afford it all possiblesupport.In discussion. Ministers expressed concern at the high level ofexpenditure for which provision had been made in the 1948 budget of the Organisation. Were the numbers of its staff subject tocareful control to ensure that they were usefully occupied?Although the United Kingdom contribution to the funds waspayable in sterling, the charge on the Exchequer would be sub-stantial. The maintenance of the United Nations organisation andthe specialised agencies on a sound and economical basis doubtlesspresented serious practical difficulties, but, if the position was notclosely watched, there was a risk that their authority would be weakened.It was pointed out that the Budgets of the United Nations andthe specialised agencies had been exhaustively discussed at therecent meeting of the General Assembly, and that the United King-dom Delegation had earned some odium by their insistence on theneed for strict economy and sound administration. Efforts werebeing made to persuade the United States Administration tosupport this policy on the ground that extravagance would inviterefusal by Congress to vote the necessary appropriations.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (48) 30, and of the points raised in the- &quot;&quot; discussion.(2) Authorised the Minister of Education to arrange for the documents relating to the Second General Conference of u.N.E.S.CO. (annexed to CP. (48) 30) to be published,with a brief formal introduction, as a Stationery Officepublication.(d) Under the proposals for limiting the number of men called up under, the National Service Act it would still be possible to make suitable arrangements for students who wished to do their periodof national service before entering a university or training college and to grant deferment to particular key workers. The question of granting block deferment to workers in the cotton industry was tobe discussed by the Minister of Defence with the Labour (textile industries) Committee.(e) The Secretary of State for the Colonies was reviewing withthe Minister of Defence what contribution the Colonies might make to Imperial defence.The Cabinet-Approved the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (48) 34,subject to the amendments agreed in discussion and to such other minor or drafting amendments as the Minister ofDefence might find it necessary to make.

(48) 39) putting forward the membership which hesuggested, after discussion with the Lord President and theChancellor of the Exchequer, for the proposed (^nnnifctee of enquiry into the restrictions imposed on the political activities of civilservants. The memorandum also set out the terms of reference pro-posed for this Committee.The Cabinet-Agreed that a Committee should be appointed, with the membership and terms of reference set out in CP.
