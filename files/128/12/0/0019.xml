6 pForeign Policyin Europe.(previous reference:CM. (48) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Foreign Secre-tary on the Czechoslovak crisis (CP. (48) 71) and the Soviet threat to Western civilisation (CP. (48) 72).The Foreign Secretary said that the past actions of the. SovietGovernment, culminating in the recent events in Czechoslovakia and finland, showed beyond any doubt that there was no hope of reaching a satisfactory settlement either by agreement among the four great powers or through the United Nations Organisation, and thatresolute action must be taken to counter the Soviet threat to western civilisation. He accordingly proposed that we should aim at completing, as a matter of urgency, the current negotiationsfor economic, cultural and defensive pacts between the UnitedKingdom, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg. Simul-taneously, we should seek to strengthen the defence of Westerncivilisation by enlisting the co-operation of Commonwealth coun-tries and all other friendly countries, including those in the western hemisphere; and special efforts should be made to strengthen parlia-mentary government in Italy, which was at present the weakest linkin the chain of non-Communist States. A further step towardseconomic co-operation in Europe would be taken at the meeting ofthe Committee of European Economic Co-operation which was tobe held in March but, in addition, there would have to be discussions with Commonwealth Governments and, through diplomatic channels,with the Governments of foreign countries in order to bring aboutco-operation in other fields. If the Cabinet gave general approval to the policy which he had outlined, he would report from time totime on the action taken to give effect to it.In discussion there was general support for the policy proposedby the Foreign Secretary, special emphasis being laid on the urgent need to strengthen the forces of democratic socialism in Franceand Italy and to prevent the weakening of the Commonwealththrough the secession of India, and possibly Pakistan. resistance to further Soviet expansion could not be successful unless we could secure a high standard of living both at home and in those countrieswhich were ranged on our side; but it would also be necessaryto base our campaign on the higher moral and spiritual values of western civilisation. In present conditions no country could afford the degree of mobilisation of man-power and resources attainedduring the late war, and a greater pooling of defence resourcesseemed inevitable. Meanwhile, however, it was desirable that theCabinet should have an appreciation of the military strength needed to support diplomatic action under the policy proposed by theForeign Secretary and of the defence measures needed if that policyfailed to prevent war. The weapon of propaganda must be usedto the full and it would probably be necessary to set up special machinery for this purpose. Propaganda must vary according tothe country to which it was addressed, and it should be such as toavoid creating embarrassment for the Foreign Secretary in hisdealings with foreign Governments through diplomatic channels.In further discussion, the following points were made : (a) The financial measures of the French Government had proved ineffective, and the economic situation in France was vervserious. The Government^ position was insecure and, if it fell, itwas likely to be succeeded by a Government of the extreme Rightor the extreme Left.(6) Should India and Pakistan secede from the BritishCommonwealth, their example might well be followed by ceylon and, in due course, Malaya. Difficulty in retaining these countrieswithm the Commonwealth would arise mainly from constitutionalforms, the dominant political Parties being committed to an abstractrepublicanism which made it difficult for them to accept allegiance to the Crown. It might be possible to meet this situation by devisingsome fresh constitutional form of association which would enablethese and similar countries to attain a new kind of independencewithm the Commonwealth.   The possibilities of giving India and
Pakistan special assistance for economic development should also be examined.(c) Experience in the war had shown the value of political warfare, and the Soviet Government and their satellites madeexhaustive use of it. The primary object of any propaganda campaign should be to provide the people of Europe with the leader-ship in Western Europe which Governments had so far failed toprovide, but its scope should be world-wide. It might be desirableto establish some organisation on the lines of the war-time political warfare Executive, which would work under Ministerial direction and in close touch with the Foreign Office.(d) There were certain directions in which the Labour Party,rather than the Government, might be found to be the most effectiveinstrument for conducting propaganda and strengthening andadvising the social democratic Parties in Western Europe.(e) There was some prospect that the Christian Churches mightbe prepared to take common action in defence of Western civilisa-tion, and it might be possible to secure this through the InternationalCouncil of Christian Churches. In recent years there had been a significant growth of sympathy with the principles of social demo-democracy in the Roman Catholic Church.- (/) Communism had prospered in primitive conditions. Therewas reason to suppose that it might not be equally successful inretaining a hold over the peoples of more highly-developed countries.It was therefore important that every effort should be made to con-concentrate propaganda on the Eastern European countries which werenearest to Western Europe.(g) Bilateral trade agreements had hitherto been made withEastern European States in the light of purely economic considera-tions. Was there now a case on political grounds for conceding more generous terms or for adopting more aggressive methods?(h) The possibility of affording greater economic assistance toScandinavian countries, possibly by long-term agreements, ought tobe considered.The Cabinet-(1) Gave general approval to the proposals made in paragraph 7of CP. (48) 72 for countering the Soviet threat to western civilisation;(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whatinterdepartmental machinery was required to enable full effect to be given to some of these proposals;(3) Took note of CP. (48) 71.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,5th March, 1948.
