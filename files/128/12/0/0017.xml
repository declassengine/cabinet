In the light of the debate in the House of Commons on17th December Ministers had agreed that a Bill should be preparedauthorising the payment of the increased benefits recommended bythe Select Committee which had reviewed the working of thePensions Fund for Members of the House of Commons. The bill itself was not to increase the rate of the annual contribution tothe Fund, but it was to include an escalator Clause under whichchanges in benefits and income limits, as well as contributions, mightbe made by affirmative resolution of the House.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this Bill was tohave been introduced shortly, but he was inclined to think thatin present circumstances its introduction should be postponed. TheGovernment were anxious to secure general support for their policyof stabilising personal incomes; and suggestions had been made that,in pursuance of that policy, the salaries of Members of the House ofCommons should be reduced. While it was true that this Bill wouldnot have the effect of raising salaries, the introduction of any proposals for increased financial benefits at the present time mightbe open to misconstruction.In discussion there was general agreement with the view expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

The Cabinet were informed that in the Second reading debate on the Local Government Bill in the House of Lords attentionmight be drawn to the new financial relationship which the Billcreated between the Exchequer and the local authorities. Hithertoa local authority had not been able to obtain a direct increase inits share of the block grant by increasing its expenditure; but infuture any local authority of an area whose rateable value was lessthan the average over the whole country would receive an increasein the shape of Exchequer equalisation grant in respect of increases of expenditure. The justification for this was that it was desirablethat all local authorities should be put in a position to maintainservices of a reasonable standard of efficiency; but the effect wouldbe to put on the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland a greater measure of responsibility for controlling excessiveor unreasonable expenditure by local authorities and, until the new system of valuation provided for in the Bill could be introduced,there was a danger that some local authorities would receive an unfair advantage because the&apos;assessments in their areas were undulylow.Public Boards.PoliticalActivitiesof Members.(previous reference erence:CM.

The - Cabinet were informed that in the Second reading debate on the Local Government Bill in the House of Lords attentionmight be drawn to the new financial relationship which the Billcreated between the Exchequer and the local authorities.

(47) 34thConclusions,Minute. 6.)4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (48) 53) on the extent to which political activities might properly be undertaken by members of the Boards of socialised industries. This recalled that when the Cabinet had considered this question in April 1947, they had contemplated that the positionwould be reviewed again in the light of practical experience, andit submitted for the Cabinefs consideration revised rules drawn upby the Prime Minister after discussions with some of his colleagues.In discussion some Ministers urged that the rules suggested inparagraph 4 of this note were too restrictive.  Many of the persons
whom the Government considered best qualified for appointment tothese Boards would have been actively associated with the labour movement and it seemed unreasonable that the responsible minister should be driven either to appoint a person whom he consideredless suitable or to impoverish the resources of a local branch of theLabour Party and so the public life of the locality. In particular,it was suggested that the rule that members of Boards, whetherwhole-time or part-time, should not maintain an active connectionwith a Party machine might be held to compel a person appointedto a Board to relinquish the post of Party leader in a local authority or of secretary of a trade union affiliated to the Labour Party. Itwas also argued that the Governments debating strength in theHouse of Lords would be seriously weakened by a rule that membersof the House of Lords who were whole-time members of boards should not intervene in debates involving matters of political controversy.In reply it was pointed out that the prohibition proposed inparagraph 4 (a) of OP. (48) 53 was aimed at persons who wereclosely connected with the Party machine and that trade union officials or Party leaders in municipal politics would not as suchbe debarred. A Party Government would, however, be open to gravecriticism if it appointed to positions of profit persons who wereofficers of the same Party or of any of its divisional or local branches.While it was true that the application of this rule would ofteninvolve a difficult choice for the Minister or for the person whom he wished to appoint to a Board, this was preferable to exposingthe Government to the charge of improper use of their powers ofpatronage. The matter could not be left entirely to the discretion of individual Ministers, as was shown by the differing views expressed in the course of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.In further discussion there was general agreement that para-graph 4 (a) of CP. (48) 53 should be modified so as to bring out more clearly that the prohibition applied only to persons holding suchoffices in a political Party as involved the discharge of executiveduties, and that it would not necessarily prevent the chairman or amember of the executive committee of a Party from retaining office as such if he were appointed a part-time member of a Board.Other points in discussion were : (a) It was important that the services of persons with experi-ence of local government should be obtained for the administration ofthe gas and electricity industries. It would not, however, be expedient to apply a different rule to appointments to the Boardsfor these industries.(b) In paragraph 4 (d) of CP. (48) 53 the word &quot; past &quot; shouldbe deleted, since it was not intended to debar a member of a Boardfrom forming new associations provided that these did hot conflictdirectly with the interests of the Board.(c) The rules were not intended to apply to membership of bodies such as trading estate companies or regional hospital boardswhere no office of profit was held.(d) It was not proposed to publish the rules though the Govern-ment might in practice be compelled to divulge the gist of them.X   TbTe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that paragraph 4 (a) of CP. (48) 53 should be modified to read : &quot;(a) Members of the Boards, whether whole-time or part-time, should not continue to serve as officers carryingout executive duties in any political Party;&quot;and that the word &quot; past    should be deleted from paragraph 4 (d);(2) Agreed that the political activities of members of the boards of socialised industries should be governed by the rulesset out in paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 53, subject to the modifications noted in Conclusion (1) above.
national  5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofaatee. the Exchequer (CP. (48) 55) on the provision of a national theatre.This explained that the London County Council proposed to finda site on the south bank of the Thames for a cultural centre, inwhich they were at present reserving space for a national theatre,and they were pressing the National Theatre Committee to show thatthey had a reasonable prospect of raising the funds required to buildsuch a theatre. The Committee had at their disposal only about 70,000 and saw no prospect of raising any further large sum fromvoluntary sources. In these circumstances the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed that the Government should undertake toprovide a substantial part of the initial capital cost of building anational theatre, which would be managed under the general direction of the Arts Council. He therefore recommended tnat theGovernment should announce their intention of preparing legislationproviding that if the London County Council made available, free of charge, a site for the purpose of a national theatre to any body ofpersons having at their disposal monies subscribed for the provisionof such a theatre, and if such a body submitted to the Treasuryproposals for building such a theatre, the Treasury might make outof monies provided ^by Parliament contributions not exceeding 1 million towards the cost of carrying those proposals into effect.It would be advisable that this legislation should be introduced inthe present Parliament, but it would be explained that the purposeof introducing the Bill at this stage was to give the necessaryassurance for detailed planning to be put in hand and that the project was not likely to be realised in practice for some time to come.In discussion the following points were raised (a) The London County Council would be making a consider-able contribution to this scheme, for the cost of the site would be substantial.(b) Members of the National Theatre Committee might be given some voice in the management of the theatre, but the effective controlof its management would be exercised through the Arts Council,which was subject to the financial supervision of the Treasury.(c) The cultural centre which was to be established on the South Bank of the Thames might include a concert hall. It was unlikely,however, that we should be able to include in the building programme for many years to come more than one concert hall for London, and itmight be found preferable to proceed first with the rebuilding ofthe Queen&apos;s Hall. The cost of providing a second concert hall might in any event be undertaken by the London County Council.In this connection it was suggested that further thought mightbe given to the project of building in central London a Hall ofRemembrance for those who lost their lives during the war. TheCommonwealth countries and our Allies might be willing to providematerials for the construction of such a building.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce that legislation would be introduced, during the present parliament, enabling the State to contribute towards theestablishment of a national theatre in London on the basis indicated in CP. (48) 55 and summarised above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2Qth February, 1948.
