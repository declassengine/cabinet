Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:C.M.(48)9thConclusions,Minute 1.)At their meeting on 2nd February the Cabinet had authorised the Lord Privy Seal to make a statement in the adjourned debate on the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill defining the con-ditions on which the Government were prepared to accept theproposal for discussions between representatives of the political parties which would cover the question of House of Lords reform.The Cabinet were informed that in the debate the Opposition hadcriticised the paragraph of this statement which defined the scopeof any discussion of the powers of the House of Lords, on the groundthat it would exclude discussion of the question of allowing areasonable period of delay in the event of an unresolved divergence of view between the two Houses. The Marquess of Salisbury andViscount Halifax had proposed amendments to meet this criticism and these had been discussed by the Lord President, the Lord privy seal, the Lord Chancellor and the Chief Whip, who had agreed. that the Government might reasonably propose an amended para-graph in the following terms : &quot; So far as discussions of the powers of the second chamber are concerned, they should be limited to ensuringreasonable time for the consideration of measures by the Lords,for the discussion of differences between the two Houses and forthe public ventilation of the points at issue.&quot;These words were designed to avoid any suggestion that theHouse of Lords might be given power to delay legislation beyond theperiod provided for in the Parliament Bill. Their intention was merely to concede, as open to discussion, the question whether anysafeguards were necessary to prevent the House of Commons fromrejecting amendments proposed by the House of Lords without allowing due time for the consideration of the issues raised by thoseamendments. There would, of course, be no commitment to accept any proposals that the Opposition might put forward, but by adopting a reasonable attitude on the scope of discussions, theGovernment would strengthen their position.In discussion it was urged that, if the paragraph were amended as proposed, it might be read as implying the admission by theGovernment that there was some justification for the claim that theHouse of Lords should be able to delay Government legislation long enough to enable the forces of public opinion outside Parliament tobe fully deployed. Moreover, even if the words added to the para-graph were interpreted in the narrower sense suggested, the factthat they bad been put forward by the Government would beregarded as involving some commitment to make a concession inthis matter.Further discussion suggested that any attempt to define pre-cisely the scope of the discussions on the powers of the House ofLords would either fail to be acceptable to the Opposition or force the Government into a position which would be inconsistent withtheir attitude when the Bill was before the House of Commons.There was, therefore, general agreement that the preferable coursewould be to propose a more general form of words.The Cabinet-Agreed that in the debate in the House of Lords theGovernment spokesman should offer to amend paragraph 1of the statement made by the Lord Privy Seal on theprevious day to read : &quot;The discussions.of the powers of the second chamber should be limited to ensuring reasonable time for the due performance by the House of lords of their functions.&quot;Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd February, 1948.
