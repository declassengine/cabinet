1. The Cabinet considered two memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 73 and 80) on the MonopolisticPractices Bill.Discussion turned first on the question whether power should betaken to break up trusts and monopolies, it was argued that thepowers conferred by the draft Bill annexed to CP. (48) 73 wouldnot be effective against restrictive practices by large combines andthat power should be taken to break up the trust or monopoly itself.The State had never been able to exercise effective control over a powerful private monopoly and the provisions of the draft Bill were likely to suffer the same fate as the common law doctrine of restraint of trade, which had been whittled away by a series of judicialdecisions. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Govern-ment had themselves recognised, by their policy of nationalisation,that a monopoly was not in itself objectionable provided that it was subject to public control. In the socialised industries public control was exercised through ownership, but it did not follow that other means of control would not be satisfactory. The larger trusts andmonopolies were often efficient productive or commercial units and,since associations of small firms frequently resorted to restrictive practices, it was difficult to see what would be gained by breaking upthe larger units. If a large trust or monopoly were engaging inpractices which were thought to be undesirable, the Commission onMonopolistic Practices could be asked to make an enquiry and, ifit reported that these practices were against the public interest, anorder would be made under Clause 11 of the Bill. Compliance withthe order would be enforceable by proceedings for an injunction.Moreover, apart from the sanctions contained in the Bill itself, theBoard of Trade would be able to combat undesirable restrictive practices by the exercise of their powers of price control; or theGovernment might themselves undertake the production ofparticular commodities which were the subject of restrictive practices. In the last resort it would be necessary to nationalise a trust or monopoly which did not prove amenable to control by other means, but this should be done by separate legislation.In further discussion the following additional points weremade : (a) The use of the phrase &quot; conditions of imperfect compe-tition &quot; to define the state of affairs which would justify a referenceto the Commission was unfortunate in that it implied that conditionsof perfect competition were in all circumstances desirable; andClauses 3-5 of the Bill should be recast in such a way as to definemore positively the conditions in which a reference to theCommission would be justifiable.(6) It should be recognised that, though trade associationsoften resorted to undesirable restrictive practices, some of their activities, such as the promotion of research, were unobjectionableand indeed in the public interest.(c) It was suggested that the Commission should be empowered .to take up cases on their own initiative. It was pointed out, however,that it would be inconsistent with the quasi-judicial position of theCommission to give them this power.(d) When the emergency powers of the Ministry of Foodceased to be operative, the provisions of the Bill would be useful for controlling restrictive practices in connection with the retail distribution of food.(e) It might prove difficult to justify the power given by clause 11 (2) to make orders in particular cases irrespective of any recommendations made by the Commission, even though such orderswould be subject to affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament.The Cabinet--(1) Agreed that the Monopolistic Practices Bill should not include power to break up trusts and monopolies.
Food. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofRation Scales Defence (CP. (48) 65) submitting proposals for reducing the over-for Overseas seas ration scales of the Forces with a view to saving dollarForces. expenditure.The Minister of Defence said that his proposals were based on reccomendatons of the Service Rations Scales Committee, which provided for adjustments in the rations of bacon, meat, fats, cheeseand sugar roughly proportionate to those already made in the homeration scales of the Forces. There would be no reduction in the totalcalorie value of the normal overseas ration scales, for the cuts inbacon, meat and cheese would be offset by increases in fats and sugar.He proposed that the cuts should not apply to Forces in palestine and that special arrangements should be made in certain overseasstations where local conditions made it impossible to obtain alterna-tive foods; and he invited the Cabinet to reject a proposal for anadditional cut of 3 oz. a week of meat and 1 oz. a week of bacon inthe rations of the Forces in Germany. The savings to be securedunder his proposals would be of the order of 5 million dollars a year.The Secretary of State for War had suggested that this smallsaving would not warrant the disturbance and discontent whichwould result from reducing the overseas ration scales; and all three service Ministers were opposed to any adjustments except the reduc-tion of the scale for Far East stations from 3,600 calories to3,400 calories.In discussion the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretaryof State for Air urged that the proposed reductions would have an unfortunate effect on the morale of troops stationed overseas. Inmany overseas stations supplies of substitute foods, such as freshfish and vegetables were either not available or could only be obtained at high prices which would entail higher messing allowances; and troops stationed in populous centres would find it difficult to under-stand why their rations should be cut when the local Europeanresidents were not rationed at all.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the present overseasration scales for bacon, meat and cheese were between two and three times higher than those granted to heavy workers in the UnitedKingdom; that special supplementary rations would continue to begiven to troops overseas who were undergoing arduous training ordoing heavy work, and that the scientific advisers of the Minister ofFood were satisfied that the reduced scales were adequate.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the proposals made by the Service RationsScales Committee for adjustments in the overseas ration scales of the Forces should be put into effect in all over-seas commands, including Far East commands, providedthat no reduction should be made in the scales applicableto Forces in Palestine and that special consideration should^ be given to certain overseas stations whereexceptionally adverse local conditions obtained.(2) Agreed that no additional cut should be made, beyond that jresulting from Conclusion (1), in the ration scales of jForces in Germany.(2) Took note that the President of the Board of Trade would-arrange for Clauses 3-5 to be reconsidered in the lightof the point noted in paragraph (a) above.(3) Invited the-Lord President to discuss the Bill with theMinisters who had taken a leading part in the cabinets discussion, and agreed to resume their consideration ofthe Bill at a later meeting.
(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to settle with the other ministers concerned the dates and stages for bringing into effect the approved reductions.(4) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider whether there should not be a corresponding reduction in the ration scales for the merchant navy.^Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House of Commons in the following week.the House of Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter Recess on 25thCommons.       March, and would reassemble on 6th April.The suggestion that the Economic Survey for 1948 should notbe separately debated but taken into account in the Budget Debatehad not proved fully acceptable to the Opposition leaders, who were disposed to press for a separate debate on the Survey. The cabinet agreed that this pressure must be resisted, and authorised the lord president to say, in his Statement on Business that day, that the survey would not be debated in the House of Commons in advanceof the Budget Debate.The Cabinet considered what reply should be returned to aQuestion, which was to be put to the Prime Minister that day byMr. C. Osborne, M.P., suggesting that a series of broadcasts shouldbe given by the leaders of the political Parties calling for a 10 percent, increase in production to meet the immediate needs of theeconomic situation. There was general agreement that this was nota subject which could be handled in broadcast talks outside the sphere of Party controversy, and that the suggestion must thereforebe discouraged. At the same time, nothing should be said whichmight imply that the Government underrated the need for increased production. The Cabinet. agreed that the reply should follow theline that the hon. Member&apos;s suggestion was not the best method ofsecuring the object which he had in view.YisconntSnowden.ProposedCommemora-tion in Housebf Commons.4. The Cabinet were informed that the Speaker had asked thatthe Government should be represented at a meeting which he was holding to discuss a suggestion that a bust of the late Lord Snowdenshould be placed in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was a bronzehead of Lord Snowden in his room at the Treasury, and he had understood that this was to be transferred to the House of Commonsten years after Lord Snowden&apos;s death.It was explained in discussion that it was the custom that astatesman should not be commemorated in this way until ten yearsafter his death, but it was not to be assumed that a former minister would be so commemorated as a matter of course when that periodhad elapsed. Many Prime Ministers and Party leaders had not beencommemorated in this way.It was the general view of the Cabinet that they should not support the suggestion that a bust of Lord Snowden should be placedin the House of Commons.5. The suggestion had been made that school-children shouldbe given a holiday on the occasion of the Silver Wedding of TheirMajesties The King and Queen on 26th April. The Cabinet agreedthat the best plan would be to arrange for school-children to havea half-holiday on that day- The schools could then assemble in the morning for special proceedings in celebration of the SilverWedding, and the children could have their, midday meal at the schools before dispersing for the half-holiday.
The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Education and the Secretary ofState for Scotland to arrange for a school half-holiday on26th April in celebration of Their Ma]esties bilverWedding. &apos;Parliament.Amendmentof theParliamentBill.(previous reference:C.M.(48)20thConclusions,Minute 7.)6 The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the suggestionthat the Parliament Bill should be so amended as to provide thatthe period of delay which must elapse under the Parliament Actprocedure before a Bill leaves the Commons for the last time shouldbe expressed as twelve months from the first occasion on which theBill received its Second Reading in the Commons or nine months from the first occasion on which it received its Third Reading inthe Commons, whichever is the longer period. They now had beforethem a memorandum by the Prime Minister (CP. (48) 79) m whichthe effect of this formula was analysed by reference to the time takento pass some of the major measures introduced in the present Parlia-ment, the Government of India Bill of 1935 and the two Billsenacted in 1913 under the Parliament Act, 1911. The memorandumalso examined the effect of the proposed formula on the probablecourse of the proceedings on an Iron and Steel Bill in the 1948-49Session. It concluded that, from the point of view of their imme-diate task of completing their legislative programme for the present parliament, the Government would gain by reaching agreement withthe Opposition on the basis of this formula. In the longer run,there would be advantage in getting the Parliament Bill passed asan agreed measure, for there would then be less risk of its beingupset by a Conservative Government at a later date. Moreover, if agreement could be reached on the amendment of the Bill, there wasa fair prospect of finding a basis for agreement between the political parties on the reform of the House of Lords. Against these advantages there must be set the difficulty of satisfying government supporters that it was expedient to offer a concession involving someextension of the period of delay originally proposed when the parliament Bill was introduced, and the Prime Minister invited theviews of the Cabinet on this point.In discussion it was pointed out that the present conference between Party leaders was proceeding on the basis that any agree-ment reached on the amendment of the Parliament Bill would determine finally the powers of the reformed House of Lords. If,however, the House of Lords was to become nothing more than arevising Chamber, it was arguable that the period of delay shouldbe less, not greater, than that for which provision was made in the parliament Bill as originally introduced. Under the formula nowproposed the period of delay might in certain circumstances be asmuch as fifteen months; and it might be said that a Second Chamberwhich could delay Government legislation for so long a period asthat would be in a position to challenge the authority of the Houseof Commons. If the Opposition desired to secure the reform of theHouse of Lords, they should be prepared to make concessions on the parliament Bill or at least to accept the Bill in the form in whichit was introduced. There seemed to be no occasion for the Govern-ment to make concessions, which were likely to be unpopular withtheir supporters in the House of Commons and in the country.On the other side, it was argued that, for the reasons indicatedin CP. (48) 79, there would be substantial advantage in getting the parliament Bill passed as an agreed measure. Moreover, it wouldbe most advantageous to the Labour Party if the political&apos; Partiescould reach a lasting agreement on the reform of the House of Lordswhile a Labour Government was in office with a substantial majbrity.There was a fair prospect of securing such an agreement on thebasis of abandoning the hereditary principle, avoiding any electiveor representative method of constituting-a Second Chamber, and bringing to an end the system which now secured an overwhelming majority for the Conservative Party in the Uppefi&quot; House..   The
7. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theLord President (CP. (47) 341) reporting a discussion at the lord presidents Committee on 12th December about the suggestion thatan attempt should be made to reach a settlement with the Eireproposed amendment of the Parliament Bill seemed a small price to pay for these substantial advantages. All that it involved wasthat on rare occasions a highly controversial Bill which had taken a disproportionately long time in the Commons could be delayedfor one or two months longer than the maximum period which wouldbe permissible if the Parliament Bill was passed in its present form.And it should be remembered that it had not in practice proved necessary to use the Parliament Act procedure since 1913. TheOpposition leaders might not be satisfied with the concession pro-posed, but in that event the onus of breaking off the discussions would rest with them. The Government, however, would be ill-advised to lose the opportunity of reaching a basis of agreement onthe wider issues through failing to put forward this relatively smallconcession on the Bill.The Cabinet were then informed of the broad lines on whichit seemed likely that agreement might be reached on the futurecomposition of the House of Lords. The understanding was that,if a firm agreement were reached between the Parties on both theamendment of the Parliament Bill and the reform of the House ofLords, the House of Lords would pass the Parliament Bill in itsamended form before the end of the present Session in the faiththat the Government would subsequently introduce legislation giving effect to the agreed scheme for the reform of the House of Lords.At the present stage, however, the Cabinet were not being askedto commit themselves finally either to the proposed amendment ofthe Bill or to the scheme of reform which had been indicated to themin broad outline. All that they were asked to consider was whetherthey were willing to ascertain the views of their supporters on theformula f6r amendment of the Parliament Bill which was proposedin CP. (48) 79, if that formula proved acceptable to the opposition leaders.Discussion then turned on the significance of the final sentence in CP. (48) 79, in which it was stated that, before they put thisproposal forward, the Government representatives in the party leaders&apos; Conference should know that they would have the unitedsupport of their Cabinet colleagues in commending it subsequently to the Parliamentary Labour Party and to the Labour PartyExecutive. It was argued that the Cabinet need not at this stage be asked to pledge themselves to full support of this single element in a set of proposals of which the remainder had not yet been finallyformulated. They would subsequently have an opportunity for considering the final proposals for reforming the constitution of theHouse of Lords. And it was in any event contemplated that all theParty leaders, if they reached agreement, would have an opportunityof ascertaining the views of their supporters on the proposals as awhole. All that the Government representatives in the Conferenceneeded at present was authority to put forward this proposal for amendment of the Bill on the basis that it was one which they wouldbe prepared to put to their supporters as part of a general agreementcovering both the powers and the composition of the House of Lords.The Cabinet-Agreed that the alternative formula for amendment of the parliament Bill, as described in paragraph 1 of cp. (48) 79, should be put forward at the Party Leaders&apos;Conference on the basis that the. Government would beprepared to include this in any agreed set of proposals,covering both the powers and the composition of the Houseof Lords, on which the Party leaders might undertake toascertain the views of their supporters.
Government over the controversy about the Lane Pictures; and(ii) a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor urging that these picturesshould be retained in London.The Prime Minister recalled that this question had arisenbecause it had been proposed to introduce a Tate Gallery Bill in thecurrent Session. He understood that this Bill was not urgently-needed, and he suggested that its introduction should be deferred for the present. This would make it unnecessary to reach any decision on the questions raised in CP. (47) 341 and CP. (48) 47.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thathe was satisfied that the Eire Government were not at presentdisposed to revive the controversy about the Lane Pictures.The Cabinet Agreed that the introduction of the Tate Gallery Billshould be postponed and that, for the present, no attempt should be made to reach a settlement of the controversywith the Eire Government over the Lane Pictures.8. The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister ofTransjordan, on his recent mission to this country, had asked thatthe existing Treaty of Alliance between the United Kingdom andTransjordan should be replaced by a treaty on the model of thatwhich we had offered to Iraq. In subsequent discussions in Ammanbetween our representative and the Transjordan Government, agree-ment had been reached on a draft treaty following the general linesof the draft Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. The Foreign Secretary said thathe would now like to authorise our representative to sign this treatysubject to ratification by the two Governments.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal to authorise our representative at Amman to sign the revised Treaty of Alliance between the United King-dom and Transiordan.Transjordan.Revision of treaty of1946.Foreign Policyin Europe.(previous reference:CM. (48) 19thConclusions.)Germany.(previous reference:CM.(48)20thConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Foreign Secretary said that in the current discussions in Brussels good progress had been made towards reaching agree-ment on the terms of the proposed treaties between the UnitedKingdom, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg. He was con-suiting the interested Departments on the terms of the economic,cultural and defence clauses of these treaties; and, if any points^of difficulty arose, he would try to dispose of these in discussion withthe Ministers concerned before he left for Paris at the end of theweek. It was, however, desired that, immediately after the paris conference, he should proceed to Brussels to sign the treaties. he therefore hoped that it would be possible for the Cabinet to approve the final texts of the treaties at their meeting on 15th March.10   The Foreign Secretary asked whether his colleagues had any points, to raise on his memorandum (CP. (48) 78) reporting theresults achieved in the discussions on the future of Germany whichhad been held in London between delegations from the United Kmg-dom, the United States, France, Belgium, Holland and Luxemburg.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary might inform theGovernments of the United States and France that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were in agrement with the general trend of these recent discussions on the future of Germany.
-czechoslovakia.(Previous[Reference:K.M. (48) 19thConclusions.)11. Reference was made to the letter which M. Jan Papanek,the Czechoslovak representative at the United Nations, had addressed to the Security Council asking that they should investigate the circumstances in which the Communist had seized power in czechoslovakia. The Secretary-General of the United Nations had decided that this letter could not be treated as a governmentalcommunication and would not, therefore, be submitted to theSecurity Council. Would it be practicable for a Government tomake a similar request to the Security Council or to some other organof the United Nations ?The Foreign Secretary said that he had already asked his advisers to consider this possibility.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,11th March, 1948.
