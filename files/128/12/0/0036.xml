Parliament. 1,   Xhe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.criminla justice Bill.capital punishment.(previous reference:C.M.(4S)35ihConclusions,Minute 4.)2. At their meeting on 3rd June the Cabinet had agreed thatthe Home Secretary should continue to advise commutation of alldeath sentences passed while the suspension of the death penaltvwas under discussion in the present Session of Parliament. later in the day, in the House of Commons, the Lord President hadresisted a suggestion that a statement should be made on this matter before the Criminal Justice Biii returned to the House of Commons;and on 4th June, in reply to a Private Notice Question, the HomeSecretary had indicated that he was not at present prepared eitherto modify Ms decision or     make a statement.The Lord Chancellor recalled that, in his speech on the ThirdHeading of the Criminal Justice Bill on 16th April, the HomeSecretary had justified the course wMch he proposed to take on theground that there was a prospect of an early alteration in the law.Since tMs prospect had now receded he recommended that the HomeSecretary should make a statement to the effect that in view of the altered circumstances he proposed to consider each case on its merits,having regard both to the particular considerations affecting thecase and also to general considerations of public policy. TMs would still leave it open to him to advise His Majesty to commute everydeath sentence to one of penal servitude for life.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a statement on thelines suggested would imply an admission by the Government thatthe will of the House of Commons was unlikely to prevail. Thefact that there was now less likelihood of an early change in thelaw had no real bearing on the rightness of the decision announced by the Home Secretary on 16th April; and the Opposition, whohad acquiesced in the decision at that time, could not reasonablychallenge it now. The Home Secretary&apos;s advisers had no doubt about the propriety of the course wMch he had taken and it was clear that he would not incur any penalties by persisting in it.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, pending the return of the Criminal justice bill to the House of Commons, the Home secretary should continue to advise commutation of all deathsentences passed wMle the suspension of the death penalty was under discussion and should resist any demand from the Opposition for a further statement onthis matter.The Cabinet then considered the draft clause designed to giveeffect to the suggestion approved at their meeting on 3rd June thatthe death penalty should be retained only for certain specified classesof murder. The&apos; effect of tMs clause was to retain the death penalty for murder committed either in the course of a felony involvingviolence or in resisting or avoiding arrest, or by the administrationof any poison or other destructive thing. The death penalty wouldalso be retained for the murder by a prisoner of a prison officeracting in the execution of Ms duty or for a murder committed bya person who had previously been convicted of murder.The following points were made in discussion: (a) The Home Secretary undertook to reconsider the expression&apos;&quot; felony involving violence.&quot;(&amp;) A police officer might be murdered in the execution of his duty but before he had actually attempted to arrest the person by whom he was murdered; and it might be desirable to amend theclause to cover tMs type of case.
v d germany.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 138 and 142) dealing with certain points, whichhad been raised at their meeting on 31st May, arising out of therecent conference in London on the future of Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that the conference had ended on1st June and that agreed recommendations had been submitted to theseveral Governments. In view of the forthcoming debate in theFrench Chamber of Deputies, he had thought it advisable to approve the recommendations without delay and a communique&quot; would bepublished that afternoon. Public opinion in France would thus be aware, before the debate took place, of the extent to which theFrench point of view had been met.   He had drawn the attention(c) It was intended that a man who committed two or moremurders on different occasions should be liable to the death penaltyeven though neither murder was of the type made liable to the death penalty by the other provisions of the clause; and it would benecessary to alter the draft in order to ensure that a person whocommitted murder on a second occasion before his trial for thefirst crime would be liable to the death penalty.(d) In presenting the draft clause to the Parliamentary LabourParty the Home Secretary should emphasise that its enactment wouldnot in any way limit his right to advise His Majesty on the exerciseof the prerogative of mercy in capital cases.The Cabinet-(2) Subject to the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (c) above,approved the draft clause which it was proposed to putforward in substitution for Clause 1 of the criminla justice Bill; and invited the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Lord Chancellor, to prepare a revised draft for submission to an early meeting of the parliamentary labour Party.The Cabinet then discussed whether there should be a free vote in the House of Commons on the new clause proposed in substitution for Clause 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill.In favour of allowing a free vote it was argued that theproposed new clause might conceivably be rejected by a combination of those Government supporters who held that the death penaltyshould be abolished completely and those Opposition members whowere against any change in the law; and that it would be lessembarrassing for the Government if the rejection took place on a free vote.Against this it was urged that, since the Cabinet were unanimous in their approval of the proposed new clause, it wouldbe necessary to require junior Ministers to vote for the clause andit would be invidious to do this if a free vote were to be allowed toother Government supporters. There were good reasons to believethat a substantial majority of Government supporters would favour the new clause, and if the meeting of the Parliamentary LabourParty were assured that the clause had been unanimously approvedby the Cabinet there was little doubt that it would be approved. in giving the meeting this assurance the Government spokesmen should explain that they were departing from precedent because of the exceptional circumstances of this case.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that a decision on whether there should be a free vote in the House of Commons on the new clause proposedin substitution for Clause 1 of the Criminal Justice Billshould be taken in the light of the discussion of the new clause at the forthcoming meeting of the parliamentary labour Party.
Iron andSteel BUI.(previous reference:CM. (47) 80thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofSupply (CP. (48) 123) covering a draft Iron and Steel Bill. they also had before them memoranda by the Lord President(CP. (48) 136) and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (48) 139) suggesting that the policy embodied in the Bill should be modified.The Minister of Supply said that in the draft Bill, which hadbeen prepared in consultation with the Socialisation of industries committee, he had sought to give effect to the decisions taken bythe Cabinet during the spring and summer of 1947. He had made,no attempt in the covering memorandum to state the case for bringing the iron and steel industry under public ownership. Hewas, however, personally in full agreement with this policy, andhe did not share the fears of those who thought it would have an adverse effect on production, though there was, unfortunately, a risk that output might fall in the next year or two as the result ofthe shortage of scrap. The Bill provided for the establishment ofan Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain, and for the transfer to that Corporation of the securities of certain companies, whichwould be specified by name in a schedule. For the time being theexisting company structures would continue, but they would besubject to the control of the Corporation as the sole shareholder.It was neither necessary nor desirable to acquire the ownership ofall the numerous firms engaged in the industry and he had reachedthe conclusion that the scheme should provide for taking over85 companies together with 155 subsidiaries. In CP. (48) 123he had referred to a more limited scheme covering 32 companies and 100 subsidiaries, but he was satisfied that the right courseof both the United States and the French Governments to the needfor adhering firmly to the policy agreed on; and there could, in his view, be no question of deferring the projected measures of currencyreform in response to the Soviet proposal for a further conference onthe subject. He was to be asked* in the House of Commons that daywhether the recommendations of the conference were to be submittedto Parliament before ratification, and whether the House would havean opportunity of discussing them,; and he proposed to reply thatthey were being considered by His, Majesty&apos;s Government, that any agreement would not take the form of a treaty and would not there-fore be subject to ratification, and that the question whether or notthere should be a debate should be taken up with the Leader of theHouse.As regards the points raised in the Cabinefs previous discussion, the Foreign Secretary said that he had taken up withthe United States authorities the suggestion that, if the FrenchGovernment should fail to associate themselves with the consti-tutional proposals agreed at the conference, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government should be free to revert to a system of direct elections for the Constituent Assembly.It was hoped that the revision of the Land boundaries would besettled before the Constituent Assembly met, but, in any event, theMilitary Governors should be able to discourage the Assembly fromdiscussing this subject. He had circulated under cover of cp. (48) 142 a description of the electoral system in the western zones of Germany, which showed that electoral laws and machinerywere a matter for individual Parliaments of the Lander and thatit was, therefore, neither desirable nor possible to ensure that one particular system was adopted throughout Western Germany. the electoral system of all but one of the Lander already included safe-guards against splinter parties; and in this respect the position inthe British Zone was considerably more satisfactory than inthe others.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.
was to adopt the wider scheme which was, in his view, sound andworkable and would be acceptable to the trade unions concerned.If the House of Lords rejected the Bill it would be impossible toput the scheme into effect or even to appoint the Corporation beforethe General Election in 1950; and 1st January, 1951, was probably the earliest date by which the scheme could operate. There was a Irisk that the companies which it was proposed to acquire might seek to evade the intentions of Parliament by divesting themselves of some of their assets, and it might be necessary to issue an appropriate warning on this point at an early date. The suggestion had been made in previous Cabinet discussions that a White paper should be published simultaneously with the Bill for the purposeof explaining the case for public ownership and giving an indication of future policy. In his view, however, it would be inexpedient toset out the case in the form of a White Paper, which would haveto be published some time before the Parliamentary debates began,and he would prefer to rely on other means of publicity. In arguingthe case for the Bill Ministers should avoid criticising existingmanagements and the technicians in the industry and in the Ironand Steel Federation, since it was important to secure their goodwill and co-operation.The Lord President said that the scheme in CP. (48) 123 foracquiring the stock of selected undertakings had no advantages overthe alternative scheme which he had put forward in CP. (47) 212.Thus, it contained no positive proposals for reorganising the industryand would leave its present structure unaltered. Moreover, theexisting directors, who would remain in control, would cease tohave any personal financial responsibility and might sabotageattempts to reorganise the industry. On the other hand, theproposals in CP. (47) 212, which would be generally acceptable tothe Iron and Steel Federation, would be a good starting-point forthe complete socialisation of the industry. In particular, theseproposals would give immediate and complete control of the industry,would socialise Steel House and would enable particular firms tobe brought under public ownership as and when this becameconvenient. Though this last process would take time, the characterof the industry, with its overseas connections, was such that it was doubtful whether effective measures of reorganisation would in fact be carried out any more speedily if the Government acquired thestock. The Cabinet should consider whether, in view of the pledgesalready given, they could at this stage take the risk of saying thatthey had decided that the scheme in CP. (47) 212 was preferable asa first step. If they so decided it would, in his view, be their duty to persuade Government supporters to accept it, and he believed that,if the Cabinet were united in the matter, they could succeed.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was impressed by thedifficulty of making out an effective case for the scheme proposed in cp. (48) 123. Moreover, a long period must elapse before thisscheme could be brought into effect and any loss of output in thenext year or two which might result from losing the goodwill ofthe companies would have serious consequences. There were there-fore strong arguments for trying to reach agreement with theFederation on a scheme of the kind outlined in CP. (47) 212., The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not regard the alternative proposals put forward by the Lord President aseither sound or practicable. It was true that they might lead tosome improvement in the planning of new development, but theywould leave substantial control of the industry in private hands.It was impossible to estimate the effect of the proposals in cp. (48) 123 and there was undoubtedly some risk of a fall in output; but, if the Government were to refrain from bringing theindustry under public ownership until a situation had been reached in which some fall in steel output could be contemplated withoutdisquiet, there might be a delay of from ten to fifteen years. TheGovernment were committed to a scheme of public ownership and
the proposals were, in his view, soundly conceived and gave a greatercertainty of adequate supplies of steel at reasonable prices than any alternative scheme.The Foreign Secretary said that the alternative to public owner-ship was the continuance of a powerful cartel which would not always be amenable to public control and might well pursue policiescontrary to the national interest. At present the enthusiasm of theworkers and the efficiency of the technical management enabled thebest possible use to be made of the existing capacity of the industry;but as a result of the methods of financing the industry which had hitherto prevailed that capacity was inadequate. On past experience there could be no guarantee that if the industry were left in private hands it would expand its capacity sufficiently tomeet the demands for steel which would arise if the United King-dom Government were to carry out their obligations under theEuropean Recovery Programme and the Brussels Treaty. He also pointed out that to abandon any idea of bringing the UnitedKingdom iron and steel industry under public ownership wouldbe inconsistent with the policy of seeking to promote the socialisation of the Ruhr steel industry.In further discussion several Ministers stressed the importanceof proceeding with the scheme embodied in the draft Bill in the life-time of the present Parliament.  The main points made were : (a) In order to maintain a high level of employment and tomake adequate provision for colonial development steel outputshould be raised to 17 or 18 million tons a year; and, if allowancewere made for our commitments to Western Europe, we should perhaps aim at an annual output of as much as 20 million tons.If the industry remained in private hands it would never embark on development schemes designed to give this level of output.(b) The industry was neither willing nor able to undertake thenecessary modernisation of its plant to bring down the cost of steelsufficiently to enable industries using steel to meet their UnitedStates competitors on equal terms.(c) So long as the industry remained in private hands it wouldbe impossible to secure that in the distribution of steel full effect was given to the Governments policy.(d) The Government must be assured of ample supplies of steel in case it should be necessary to embark on a programme of publicworks to counter deflation.The Prime Minister said that if the proposals in CP. (48) 123were to be carried out it was essential that a good case for pro-ceeding with these proposals at the present critical time shouldbe made. Paragraph 22 of CP. (48) 123 stated that in the ironand steel industry there was no question of inefficiency, or ofdisinclination or inability to carry through essential modernisation.On the other hand, the discussion had suggested that a good case for the proposals in CP. (48) 123 could be made out on other grounds. It seemed desirable that the Cabinet should have anopportunity of reviewing the arguments for these proposals and he accordingly suggested that the Minister of Supply should circulate a memorandum setting them out in full. They could then considerwhether it would be better to publish them in the form of a white paper or to expound them by other means.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Supply to circulate a memorandum setting out the arguments for bringing the iron and steelindustry under public ownership;(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (48) 123,CP. (48) 136 and CP. (48) 139 at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1th June, 1948.
