Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons,criminla justice Bill.(previous reference erence:C.M.(48)30thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.2. The Opposition Leaders in the House of Lords had askedwhether the Government would be willing to divide the criminla justice Bill into two parts, one dealing solely with the proposedsuspension of the death penalty for murder and the other covering the remainder of the Bill. The Opposition evidently expected thata difference would arise between the Lords and the Commons onthe proposal to suspend the death penalty and wished to avoid being placed in the dilemma that, if they persisted in their oppositionto that proposal, they would imperil the Bill as a whole and delay the introduction of all the other measures of penal reform which itembodied.The Cabinet took the view that it would be neither practicablenor desirable to divide in this way a Bill which had already passed the Commons.commonwealth affairs.description of Dominions.3. The Prime Minister said that he had noticed signs thatthe phrase &quot;white Dominions&quot; was creeping into official use on occasions when it was desired to distinguish the older Dominionsfrom India, Pakistan and Ceylon. This phrase should not be usedin official correspondence or discussions. When it was necessaryto draw this distinction, the most suitable general descriptions were&quot; the old Dominions&quot; and &quot;the new Dominions.&quot;The Cabinet-Invited Ministers in charge of Departments to bring thispoint to the notice of all concerned in their Departments.Land Require-ments of theServiceDepartments.StanfordPracticalTraining Area.(previous reference:CM. (47) 93rdConclusions,Minute 6.)353994. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Town and Country Planning (CP. (48) 126) on the questionwhether the War Office should retain possession of the practicaltraining area at Stanford in Norfolk Of whether they should releaseit in accordance with the pledge given to its inhabitants, when thearea was taken for training during the war, that at the end ofthe war they would be allowed to return to it. They also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Defence (CP. (48)127) dealing with the defence aspects of this question, and a memo-randum by the Home Secretary (CP. (48) 128) describing the natureof the pledge given at Stanford and comparing it with similarpledges given elsewhere.The Cabinet were informed that Stanford was one of five areasproposed for training with the use of live ammunition by all arms in combination. A public local inquiry had been held into theproposals for the Stanford area and the report of this inquiry(an extract from which was annexed to CP. (48) 126) recommendedthat the proposals should be abandoned because of the pledge given.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that, butfor the pledge, the commissioner who had held the public inquiry would have recommended that the Stanford area should be retained.If this area were released, the Government would find it difficultto reject the proposals for any of the other four practical trainingareas, however great the objections might be to the use of these areas. He suggested that the Government^ difficulties should \yexplained to the former inhabitants of the Stanford area, and thatthey should be asked to release the Government from the pledge.If the majority were willing to do this he would recommendretaining the area; but if, despite the explanations given to them,most of the inhabitants wished the pledge to be honoured, he thought-3 b 2
that the area should be released. He recommended that the same procedure should be followed at Purbeck, where a similar pledgehad been given.The Lord President said that the inhabitants of the Stanfordarea had been given a categorical pledge of reinstatement by theArmy Commander on the authority of the Secretary -of State forWar, and that, as Minister of Home Security, he had authorised the Deputy Regional Commissioner to negotiate with the inhabitantson the basis of this pledge. If the pledge were not honoured he himself would be put in an extremely difficult position and the faithof the public in any future undertakings given by Government wouldbe undermined. He added that since the war a lucerne-dryingfactory valued at over  115,000 had been erected in the area inreliance on the fulfilment of the pledge. He urged that the pledgeshould be honoured.The Minister of Defence and The Secretary of State for Warrecalled that the Government had declared that practical trainingof the type to be carried out in the Stanford area was essentialas a means of reducing casualties in war, and had agreed that theWar Office required a total of 648,000 acres, including a minimum of five practical training areas. There was no alternative area toStanford in Eastern Command which would be equally suitablefor practical training, and if the Stanford area were releasedit would be necessary to take over more valuable agricultural landin its place. Apart from the compensation payable in respectof any alternative area, the restoration of. the Stanford area would cost over  500,000, whereas, on a rough estimate, the cost of givingcompensation for its retention might be about  280,000, thoughit might be necessary to make some increase in this figure. Moreover,four or five years must elapse before the work of restoring theStanford area could be completed. The nature of battle trainingmade it impossible to train more than a relatively small numberof men at any one time and both Stanford and the other fourpractical training areas would be fully used in providing for theannual flow of regulars, territorials and national service men.Responsibility for providing adequate training for the armed forces rested on the Government and they would be failing todischarge their responsibility if they left it to the inhabitants ofStanford themselves to decide by a majority whether the area should be retained.Other points in discussion were : (a) The Minister of Defence said that if the tank gunneryschool at Purbeck had to be abandoned it would be impossible tomaintain the Army in a state fit to deal with any short-termemergency that might arise.(b) The Secretary of State for War said that it might bepossible to arrange for the lucerne-drying factory which had beenestablished in the Stanford area to continue in operation, eventhough the area were used for practical training.(c) About a thousand people had been ,removed from theStanford area when it had been taken over and 38 farmers had beendispossessed. Complete information was not available about thenumber who had settled permanently elsewhere.In further discussion there was general agreement that theGovernment should fully acknowledge the pledge of reinstatement,but should explain that for overriding reasons of national defenceit was necessary for them to ask that they should be released fromthat pledge. At the same time, they should undertake to give every possible assistance towards the re-settlement of any of the formerinhabitants who had been relying on being able to return to theStanford area. Each case should be dealt with on its individualmerits.   For this purpose full information should be collected and
all Departments concerned should collaborate in easing the positionof the displaced owners or tenants who were in need of assistance.Thus, the Ministry of Agriculture should give a preference to farmers moved from the Stanford area in the letting of any farmsunder their control. The announcement of the decision and thereasons for it, together with a general indication of what wouldbe done in assisting the resettlement of the former inhabitants,should be made locally in the first instance and immediately after-wards a general announcement should be made in Parliament.Thereafter, the task of arranging for the resettlement of individualsshould be actively pursued by the Departments concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the retention of the Stanford battle trainingarea;(2) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State for -War (i) to arrange for the decision and the reasons for it to be announced locally and immediately thereafter toParliament, and (ii) to establish interdepartmentalmachinery to ascertain the present circumstances ofpersons displaced from the Stanford area and to makeany necessary arrangements for their resettlementelsewhere.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (48) 121) reporting the result of the enquiries which he had made, at the Cabinets request, into the consequentialchanges which should be made in the powers of courts-martial ifcivil courts in this country were deprived of the power to impose the death penalty for murder.The Ministers conclusions were that (i) for murder, theServices should conform to the civil code; and if the power of thecivil courts to pass sentence of death for murder was suspended, thecorresponding power of courts-martial should be similarly sus-pended; (ii) for treason, there should be no change in the law; and(iii) for serious offences against Service discipline in war, no change should be made until the Service Departments found a convenient opportunity for bringing up to date their disciplinary codes as awhole. The Minister suggested that power should be taken in the criminal Justice Bill to suspend the power of courts-martial toimpose the death penalty for murder. Clause 70 of the Bill already provided that the provisions in Clauses 2 and 3 abolishing penal servitude, hard labour and whipping might be applied by Order-in-Council to the disciplinary codes of the Services; and it wassuggested that this Clause should be so amended as to extend alsoto Clause 1 of the Bill.In discussion it was pointed out that Clause 1 of the criminla justice Bill might be deleted in the Committee Stage in the Houseof Lords; and in that event it would not be practicable to makethe proposed amendment of Clause 70. The desired modification in the powers of courts-martial would then have to be made by aprovision in the next Army and Air Force Bill and by special legislation to amend the Naval Discipline Act.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the substance of the proposals put forward in cp. (48) 121, and summarised in (i) to (iii) above;(2) Agreed that the method of suspending the power of courts-martial to impose the death penalty for murder shouldbe considered further when it was known what attitudethe House of Lords would adopt towards the proposal,in Clause 1 of the Criminal Justice Bill, to suspend thecorresponding power of the civil courts.
economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (48) 31stConclusions,Minute 5.)Man-Power.Coal.Steel.Building.external trade.6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (48) 125) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were raised in discussion :-r-There was a rise in the total number of men in civil employ-ment broadly consistent with that assumed in the Economic Survey.On the other hand, &quot;the number of unemployed showed no signs of rising to the figure of 450,000 given in the Survey, and it seemed clear that the man-power in the building and civil engineering industries would not contract in the manner implied in the survey and in the White Paper on Capital Investment. The expansion ofman-power in the textile industries had hitherto proceeded at onlyhalf the rate needed to secure a total increase of 108,000 in 1948.This was probably due in part to the fact that women&apos;s earnings in the cotton industry were no higher than in industry generally,and in the woollen and worsted trades were 3 per cent, less thanthe average.The situation in the coal industry had deteriorated since Easter.The slow increase in man-power was not unexpected, for it hadbeen assumed that the main expansion of the labour force wouldtake place in the second half of the year; but the rate of output per man-shift was disquieting. This, together with the failure tosecure any marked improvement in attendance, meant that produc-tion was running from 3 per cent, to 4 per cent, below what was expected. This was not due to lack of equipment; and, althoughthe diversion of labour to new development work might account for some falling-off in production, the main difficulty was undoubtedly the failure of the miners to carry out the undertaking to work longer stints which had been given in return for the intro-duction of the five-day week. Unless there was a marked improve-ment in the next week or two, the Minister of Fuel and Powerproposed to arrange a meeting with representatives of the national coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers, at whichhe would press for the implementation of the agreement to worklonger stints, and would revive the suggestion that an extrahalf-hour should be worked each day in place of Saturday workingwhich, in most areas, was not operating satisfactorily.There was general agreement that such an approach was required. The National Coal Board should also be encouraged to concentrate on improving management at individual pits.There had been a record output of steel ingots and castings inApril, without any significant reduction in the stocks either of scrapor of pig iron.In England and Wales the number of houses completed would fall off in the later months of 1948. This would be partly due tothe drastic reduction in the number of new houses started, andpartly to the Ministers insistence on obtaining competitive tenders for houses. The total output for 1948 would, however, be more than had been expected. Virtually no new tenders for houses in scotland were being approved, but a year or two must elapse before theprogramme could be brought into balance.The Minister of Health said that the Production Committeehad recently agreed that an announcement should be made in Junethat, from 1st July, the limit below which no licence would berequired for building or civil engineering work should be raised to  100 on any one property. Unless in the next few weeks therewere signs of an increase in unemployment in the building industryhe would wish to raise with the Production Committee the questionof deferring this change for a further period.Though the Board of Trade&apos;s figures exaggerated somewhat the adverse trade balance, continued expenditure on imports at the rateof the first four months of 1948 would raise the value of imports during the first half year to about 10 per cent, more than had been
assumed in the Economic Survey. The main reason for the increased expenditure on imports was the continued adverse trend in the termsof trade. The share of exports sent to the Western Hemispherewas 18 per cent, in the first quarter of 1948, as compared with;17 -1 per cent, in the last quarter of 1947, and 16-8 per cent, inthe last six months of 1947. The export of motor cars continued torise and the majority of overseas buyers seemed to be satisfied withthe quality of British cars.The drain on gold and dollar reserves in the first half of thesecond quarter had been only  26 million, compared with the drainof  147 million in the first quarter. This improvement was mainly due to the decline in the total expenditure of the rest of the sterling area and to a receipt of  6 million from South Africa in repayment of dollars paid on her behalf in January. The increase in UnitedKingdom purchases in the sterling area and the general improve-ment in the balance of payments position of the rest of the sterling area had been reflected in the steadily rising sterling balances of these countries.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that efforts wouldbe made to maintain a reasonable balance between our exports ofcapital goods and our purchases from the countries to which thoseexports were sent. Representations on this point had recently beenmade to him on behalf of Siam. If Siam&apos;s confidence in sterlingwere weakened as a result of our failure to fulfil orders, this might lead to similar difficulties in other Asiatic countries.The Cabinets attention was drawn to the likelihood of a claim for a further increase in agricultural wages. This claim would be strengthened if an increase of wages were granted to county councilroadmen.Our shipping earnings were not yet sufficient to yield a netfavourable balance, though it was hoped that this would be achieved by the end of 1948. Further progress depended largely on theamount of steel available for new shipbuilding, and the First Lordof the Admiralty and the Minister of Transport were about tosubmit a memorandum on this point to the Production CommitteeThe Cabinet-Took note of CP. (48) 125 and of the points raised inthe discussion.7. The Foreign Secretary made a full report to the Cabineton the negotiations about the Palestine situation which had been proceeding in the Security Council and through the diplomaticchannel. After describing in detail the different attempts whichhad been made in the last few days to bring about a truce inthe fighting in Palestine, he drew attention to the fact that the arab states, in rejecting the Security CounciFs request that both sidesshould observe a &quot; cease-fire &quot; order, had asked the Council to makenew proposals for a solution of the Palestine problem. While hewas convinced that the Jews and Arabs would not now reach anagreement among themselves, he believed that both sides might be willing to observe a decision reached by the United Nations; andhe thought that the only practical way out of the present difficultieswas to seek general agreement by the United Nations on a decision which might be accepted by both sides.In the Cabinefs discussion attention was drawn to the followingpoints : (a) Further consideration would have to be given to the employ-ment of British officers in the Arab Legion. It had originally been assumed that no difficulty would arise if these officers accompanied the Legion into those parts of Palestine which were to remain inArab hands under the Partition plan; and it was thought that their
Germany. 8.   The Foreign Secretary said that he proposed to circulate(Previous to the Cabinet, for consideration at a special meeting early in the reference: following week, a memorandum on the position reached in the six-C.M.(48)20th Power talks on the future of Western Germany.  This would deal,Conclusions, in particular, with the proposed political organisation for Germany,Minute 3.) the international control of the Ruhr, and guarantees against futureGerman aggression.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th May, 1948.presence might have a restraining effect on the Arab legionaries. Adifferent situation had, however, arisen now that the Legion had become engaged in military operations against the Jews. TheBritish officers who had been fighting with the Legion in Jerusalemhad been withdrawn to other parts of Palestine. But the positionof the other British officers with the Legion would also nave tobe considered, and it would probably be advisable that a further statement should be made.(b) The Foreign Secretary said that he did not propose torecognise the Jewish State of Israel, at any rate until the position had become more settled. It was suggested, in discussion, thatthe United Kingdom Government might find it embarrassing to withhold recognition, if all other Commonwealth Governmentsaccorded it. It was, however, pointed out that by no means allthe other Commonwealth Governments were anxious to recognise the Jewish State. South Africa had special reasons for doing so;but Canada was not anxious to recognise Israel and New Zealandwas now delaying recognition. There was no reason why all commonwealth Governments should accord recognition simul-taneously.(c) The Economic Co-operation Administrator in the UnitedStates had promised a committee of the Senate that he wouldenquire whether funds advanced to this country by the UnitedStates had been used to assist the Arab States in their operations against the Jews. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this enquiry might cause us some embarrassment; for, when we excludedPalestine and Transjordan from the sterling area, we had providedthem with United States dollars with which to finance their currenttransactions. He had arranged for a statement of the facts to beprepared and, when this was available, he hoped that the foreign secretary would hand it to the United States Ambassador inLondon and ask him to discourage further enquiries into thismatter by United States authorities. It seemed important that difficulties of this kind should not be allowed to affect the attitudeof the United States Administration towards the flow of supplies to this country under the European Recovery Programme.The Foreign Secretary said that he was not prepared to allow the domestic policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to be deflectedby the argument that a particular course of policy might affectthe United States attitude towards us in their administration ofthe Economic Recovery Programme. If we allowed ourselves tobe influenced unduly by that argument, we should lose effective control over our own policy and administration. The cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view on this point.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.
