Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Gabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Criminal 2.   The Cabinet were informed that, when the House of Lordsjustice Bill. divided on the proposal to suspend the death penalty for murder,(Previous on the Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice Bill, all membersJReferenee: of the official Opposition would be free to vote according to!c.M. (48)28th conscience. It was proposed that the backbench supporters of theConclusions, Government should similarly be allowed a free vote, but that membersMinute 2.) of the Government Front Brench should be required to vote inI Capital support of the Clause which had been inserted in the Bill by the punishment. House of Commons. The Cabinet endorsed this proposal. It was true that, when the House of Commons had divided on this clause in the Committee Stage, Ministers had been free to abstain from voting; but in the debate on Third Reading the Home Secretary had announced, with the authority of the Cabinet, that the government accepted the Commons&apos; decision. If the Lords now rejected theClause, the Home Secretary would be in a difficult position when the lords&apos; amendments were considered by the Commons; but his difficul-ties would be even greater if some members of the Government hadabstained from supporting the Clause in the Lords.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that members of the Government Front Bench inthe House of Lords should vote in favour of the Clausesuspending the death penalty for murder, even though a free vote on this issue was to be conceded to the back-bench supporters of the Government.Trial of Peers. The Cabinet were informed that on the Committee Stage of theBill the Opposition were proposing to move a new Clause abolishing the practice by which charges against Peers of the Realm for certaincriminal offences are tried by a special court composed of membersof the House of Lords. The Home Secretary said that he wouldhave included a provision to this effect in the Bill, if he had not thought it preferable to leave it to the House of Lords themselvesto take the initiative in proposing it. He therefore recommendedthat this new Clause should be accepted.The Cabinet-(2) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal to accept on the Govern-ment&apos;s behalf a new Clause abolishing the practice bywhich certain criminal charges against Peers of the realm are tried by a special court composed of membersof the House of Lords.SilverWedding ofthe king and Queen.(previous reference:CM. (48)21stConclusions,Minute 5.)353363. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter whichhe had received expressing the gratitude of The King and Queenfor the gift of a pair of Georgian silver sauceboats which theCabinet had made to Their Majesties on the occasion of their SilverWedding.b 2
National 4.   The Minister of Health gave the Cabinet his appreciationHealth of the probable course of the voting in the further plebiscite whichService. the British Medical Association were taking to ascertain whether(Previous doctors were willing to participate in the National Health Service.Reference: In Scotland there.was likely to be a large majority in favour of cm. (48) 9th participation.   In England and Wales substantial numbers mightConclusions, vote against participating in the scheme; but the Minister was minute 2.) confident that sufficient support would be forthcoming to enable himto bring the Service into operation on the appointed day.Housing 5.   The Minister of Health said that it had been contemplatedProgramme that, before the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, a statement in 1949. would be made on the scale of house-building in 1949.   It was,(Previous       however, the view of the Economic Planning Staff that this was reference:      not an opportune moment for making such a statement, and heCM. (48) 16th   accepted that view.   He had to answer that day a Question by conclusions,    Mr. Charles Smith, M.P., about the housing programme for 1949.Minute 4.)      He proposed to reply that final figures could not be given until afirmer estimate could be made of the supplies of timber which were likely to be available.   He proposed, however, to include in his reply a brief explanation of the reasons for the recent increase inthe number of local authority houses for which tenders had beenapproved.The Cabinet-Approved the lines on which the Minister of Healthproposed to reply to Mr. Charles Smith&apos;s question; and agreed that the Minister should postpone for the time beingany announcement of the scale of house-building in 1949.BritishFascistMovement..(previous references:CM.(46)31stConclusions,Minute 3; and cm. (48) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Home Secretary said that Sir Oswald Mosley had arranged to hold a public meeting in East London on 1st May.There was no power to prohibit such a meeting. The promoters of the meeting were, however, intending that it should be followedby a procession. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis had asked for his consent to the making of an Order under Section 3 (3)of the Public Order Act, 1936, prohibiting the holding of publicprocessions in that part of East London through which this par-ticular procession would pass. He proposed to authorise the making of this Order and to announce that it would be brought intooperation before 1st May.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval,  of  the Home  Secretary&apos;sstatement.Parliament. 7.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the PartyAmendment Leaders had finally abandoned their attempts to find a basis for of the agreement on the powers and composition of a Second Chamber and parliament had decided that their Conference must now be brought to an end.Act. They had prepared an agreed statement on the course of the discus-(Previous sions in the Conference, summarising the points of agreement and reference: disagreement, and it was proposed that, in order to meet the con-C.M.(48)28th venience of the two.Houses of Parliament, this should be publishedConclusions, as a White Paper.   It was hoped that it could be presented on minute 5.)&apos; 4th May.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.
8. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet onthe situation in Palestine. Action was being taken to recover full control of Haifa. British troops, supported by the Royal Air Force, -.were defending Jaffa against a strong Jewish offensive. the trusteeship Council had on 28th April obtained Jewish and Arabagreement to a truce covering the Old City of Jerusalem. The local military authorities had proposed that Jerusalem should be evacuated on 5th May, and the garrison transferred to Haifa; butthere were serious objections to this departure from our agreed plan of withdrawal and the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, had been instructed to take the necessary military action to maintain ourposition in Jerusalem until 15th May.The Foreign Secretary had urged the Arabs States to exercise a restraining influence over Arab activities in Palestine before15th May; and he had asked the United States Secretary of Statesimilarly to use his influence with the Jews. There was no evidenceof intervention by King Abdullah; and the Security Council trucecommission had appealed to him to refrain from intervening. Solong as Jewish attacks in Palestine continued, however, the Arabswere necessarily under strong provocation.During recent weeks, the United States Ambassador in london had repeatedly urged His Majesty&apos;s Government to postpone their withdrawal from Palestine, but it had not been possible to obtain from him any indication of the extent to which the United StatesGovernment might be willing to participate in enforcing a united nations settlement of the dispute. Mr. Douglas had been assured that, provided the Jews refrained from disorder, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would use their influence to prevent an invasion ofPalestine by Trans Jordan or any other Arab couixtr y. In reply toan enquiry about the Governments attitude towards a united nations truce, Mr. Douglas had been informed that, provided thatthe terms were fair and had been accepted by the trusteeship council and the Jews, we would use our influence to persuade theArabs to accept it. Further, if Arab-Jewish agreement was reached on a truce and we were asked by the Trusteeship Council to play a part, with others, in giving effect to it, we should be ready toconsider doing so, though &quot;no assurance of military participationcould be given.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState for Colonial Affairs (CP. (48) 112) submitting proposals for constitutional reform in Cyprus.The Cabinet were reminded that in October 1946 it had been announced that a Consultative Assembly would be&apos; set up in cyprus to consider the question of constitutional reform. It was nowproposed that the detailed scheme set out in the Annex to CP.(48) 112 should be submitted to the Assembly. This scheme hadbeen endorsed by the Commonwealth Affairs Committee; and, inthe view of the Governor, it represented the minimum concessiontowards a more liberal form of Government that was likely to prove acceptable to the Assembly and to Cypriot opinion generally. Themain features of the proposed constitution were an elected Legisla-ture with powers to debate and legislate on the affairs of the Islandwithin the limits set by our strategic interests; an Executive Councilresponsible to the Governor and not to the Legislature; and the
provision of a two-way link between these two bodies by (i) theappointment of certain officials to seats in the Legislature, and(ii) the appointment of representatives of the elected majority ofthe Legislature to the Executive Council. It was also proposedthat the unofficial- members of the Executive Council should be associated with the work of certain Departments of Government.The question of developing local Government was being separatelyexamined by the Cyprus Government.In discussion, it was explained that the Governor of Cypruswas hopeful that this scheme of constitutional reform would prove acceptable to the Consultative Assembly, and that the Cypriptswould make a genuine effort to work it successfully. There wasno real demand in the island for full self-government. Great carehad been taken, in framing these proposals, to safeguard our strategic interests.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the changing situa-tion in the Middle East, he would have preferred that the questionof constitutional reform in Cyprus should have been deferred. he recognised that this was not possible, but he considered that theproposals now under consideration went as far as it would be safe to go.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals for constitutional reform in cyprus submitted in CP. (48) 112.CapitalPunishmentin the BritishZones ofGermany and austria.(previous reference:CM. (48) 28thConclusions,Minute 2.)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (CP. (48) 111) on the question whether the death penalty should continue to be imposed in the British Zones ofGermany and Austria. *The Foreign Secretary said that, if the Criminal Justice Billbecame law in its present form, a Control Commission court whichtried a British subject for murder under British law would be unableto impose the death penalty. Meanwhile, it was proposed that, inaccordance with the policy approved by the Cabinet on 15th April,any sentence of death imposed on a British subject on conviction of murder by a Control Commission court should be commuted topenal servitude for life. On the other hand, it was recommendedthat the death penalty should continue to be imposed for war crimes,for offences punishable by death under German law or crimes againsthumanity under Control Council Law No. 10, and for offences forwhich the death penalty was prescribed by Military GovernmentOrdinances. Current conditions in Germany made it necessary toretain the death penalty for these offences. It would&quot; be wrong tofollow the Soviet authorities in abolishing the death penalty forcrimes against humanity under Control Commission Law No. 10.AH war crimes trials should be completed by 1st September, 1948.The Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General approved the policy proposed in CP. (48) 111 and it was intended that it should be announced in reply to a Parliamentary Question on 3rd May.The Cabinet-Agreed that British subjects convicted of murder under british law in Germany or Austria should be dealt withas proposed in CP. (48) 111, and that no further change should be made with regard to the imposition or executionof the death penalty in Germany or Austria.
11. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that he had recently discussed with the Minister of Civil Aviation, the economic secretary, Treasury, and the Chairman of British Overseas airways corporation a proposal that B.O.A.C. should buy five Constellationaircraft from the Eire company. Aer Linte. B.O.A.C. proposedto use these aircraft on the Australian route and estimated thatthey would thereby be enabled to make an annual profit of about 100,000 a year on this route instead of the current loss of over 1 million. Qantas Empire Airways, the Australian company whichoperated the Australian route with B.O.A.C., were already usingConstellation aircraft and it was clear that B.O.A.C. would be atan increasing disadvantage if they continued to rely on Lancastriansfor the four years which must elapse before a suitable Britishtype was likely to be available. If B.O.A.C. bought the fiveConstellations they would no longer need for the Australian routesix Solent flying-boats now under construction and it would probablybe necessary to cancel the orders for at least five of these, whichwould involve a compensation payment of half a million pounds.His own view was that, notwithstanding the general policy approvedby the Cabinet that British air lines should use British aircraft,there were good reasons for buying the five Constellations.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer would not object to this purchase if the Constellationscould be obtained for sterling and at a reasonable price and if itwere clearly understood that acceptance of this proposal did not mean abandoning the rule that British air lines should, wherever possible, use British aircraft. The Chancellor also considered that,before the order for Solent flying boats was cancelled, the possibility-lity of finding some other use for them should be explored.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Supply, saidthat, although the Minister of Supply recognised the advantages which B.O.A.C. would gain from the use of Constellations on theAustralian route, he felt that there were strong arguments againsta further departure from the policy that British air lines should use British aircraft. This policy had been approved by the Cabinet,not as a means of saving dollars, but in order to maintain thewar potential of the British aircraft industry and to encourage thepurchase of British aircraft by foreign air lines. If the order forSolent flying boats were cancelled, it would be difficult to maintainthe production of Solents by Short Bros, and Harland Ltd., and possible orders for Solents from Tasman Empire Airways and fromthe Argentine and Uruguay might be lost. Moreover, the purchaseof five Constellations now might lead B.O.A.C. to propose furtherpurchases later and, if the Corporation were to be allowed to buyConstellations every time they could be bought for sterling, it wouldbe impossible to maintain the British aircraft industry in a healthystate.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that there was no british aircraft now available that could compete on anything like equalterms with the Constellation, nor was there any certainty that theBritish aircraft industry would produce such an aircraft in thenext few years. If B.O.A.C. had to continue to use on the Australianroute interim types, such as the Lancastrian and the Solent, theywould incur losses which, in his view, could not be justified. he did not think there was any real risk that Tasman Empire Airwayswould withdraw their proposal to buy Solent flying-boats and it waspossible that Qantas Empire Airways would order Solents for theAustralia to Hong Kong route. If B.O.A.C. obtained the fiveConstellations it should be possible for them and Qantas EmpireAirways to maintain the Australian route, without furtherpurchases of United States aircraft, until a satisfactory British typewas available.In further discussion there was general agreement that B.O.A.C.should be given authority to buy the five Constellation aircraft,
provided that they could be obtained on reasonable terms. No steps should, however,.be taken to cancel the order for six Solent flying-boats until the Cabinet had had an opportunity to review the UnitedKingdom civil aircraft programme for the Corporations as a wholeon the basis of a report which was being prepared by the CivilAviation Committee.The Cabinet^-(1) Authorised the Minister of Civil Aviation to inform theChairman of B.O.A.C. that the Government approved thepurchase of five Constellations from Aer Linte, providedthat they could be obtained for sterling on termsacceptable to the Treasury.(2) Took note that the Lord Privy Seal proposed to circulate to the Cabinet a comprehensive report on the aircraft programme for the British Airways Corporations; and agreed that, pending consideration of this report, theorder for six Solent flying-boats for use on the Australianroute should not be cancelled.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,29th April, 1948.
