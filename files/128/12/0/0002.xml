The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (CP. (48) 12) covering a memorandum on the issues raised by. recent Argentine, landings on Deception Island inthe South Shetland Islands.The memorandum reported that since October last a number of argentine naval and commercial vessels had visited deception island, three shore parties had been landed, and a meteorologicalstation was apparently being established. Formal protests had beenmade, both locally and to the Argentine Government. Our legal title to Deception Island was strong; and, by reason of its harbour, the island was the most important strategic point in the falkland islands Dependencies. Inaction on our part would encouragefurther Argentine penetration into the Dependencies and might alsoprejudice the position&apos; of other Colonial territories, particularly those in the Western hemisphere, to which claims had been made by.foreign countries.. Three courses of action were open to us : to appeal to the Security Council, to use naval forces to assist the civil power in enforcing the domestic law of the Island, or to use naval forces to expel the intruders.The Foreign Secretary thought it would be inadvisable to adoptany of these courses. We had already informed the argentine government in our note of protest of 17th December (Annex. II to cp. (48) 12), that they should bring their claims to sovereignty inthe Antarctic before the International Court of Justice, and that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would abide by the Court&apos;s decision. Hethought that more vigorous action should now be. taken through the diplomatic channel to induce the Argentine Government to agree to reference to the International Court.1 &quot;  &quot;Points made in discussion were : (a) The strategic importance of Deception Island might be enhanced by any changes in the value of the Panama Canal in war.: (b) The Australian and New Zealand Governments were closelyinterested in the suggestion that questions involving the validity oftitles in the Antarctic should be referred to the International Court,It was agreed that they should be kept fully informed of developments.-  The Cabinet-....

Although the
3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 5) reviewing the situation resulting from the breakdown of the last meeting of the Council of Foreign ministers and outlining the policy which he proposed to follow in seeking thereconstruction of western Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that the guiding principle of his policy was to foster the creation of a truly democratic Germany.While nothing should be done to preclude the eventual emergence of a united Germany, it was important that the Germans should bemade more effectively responsible for managing their own affairs inthe western Zones. He therefore proposed that the scope of thebizonal economic organisation at Frankfurt should be extended,both in numbers and in powers and responsibility, and that plans should be made for the holding of elections and the establishmentlater in 1948 of German bodies exercising most of the functions ofa Government and Parliament. All possible steps should be takento raise the level of production in western Germany and to improve the German standard of living. Measures should also be taken toincrease trade between western and eastern Germany and betweenwestern Germany and the countries within the Russian sphere of influence. We should continue to carry out the reparations plan and should resist any proposal to suspend deliveries to the soviet union and her satellites. By suspending those deliveries, while continuing deliveries to the countries of western Europe, we were unlikely to induce the Soviet Government to be more co-operative inother spheres and should weaken our case for withstanding their claim to reparations from current production.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with thegeneral policy outlined in CP. (48) 5.The particular suggestion was made that the authorities in thewestern Zones might now seek to drive harder bargains in their trade negotiations with the Soviet Zone. Thus, it was suggested thatlarger supplies, of food-stuffs could be extracted from eastern germany in return for the substantial amounts of steel which were now being sent there from the western Zones.The Cabinet-Approved the policy, set out in CP. (48) 5, which theForeign Secretary proposed to follow in seeking thereconstruction of western Germany.Germany.(previous reference:CM. (47) 96thConclusions,Minute 3.)financial considerations involved were very different, the basic petrolration and the foreign travel allowances were, closely linked in thepublic mind; and the Government would.find it difficult to make a concession on one of these points without making any concession onthe other....The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances they could not: usefully continue their discussion of the proposals in CP. (48) 11until they had also before them a memorandum on the possibility of&apos; restoring a basic petrol ration.The Cabinet- -Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit a memo-: randum on the possibility of restoring a basic petrol ration;and agreed to continue at their meeting on 13th January,in the light of that memorandum, their discussion of theproposals in CP. (48) 11 for relaxing the restrictions on theuse of foreign exchange for tourist travel.

(48); 8,: on future foreign publicity policy.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States proposals for assisting&quot; the&apos; economic&apos; recovery &apos; of Europe! had crystallised theoppositionof the Soviet Goyernment,to any closer organisation ofthe democratic States of&apos;&apos;Western Europe; and&apos;it was clear that,although the recent-Soviet attempts to stir up trouble in France andItaly had largely failed, some&apos; closer \ form of union should be created in Western Europe in order to,resist the increasing penetration-tion of Soviet influenced1 It would have been premature to take action!in this direction before the recent&apos;meeting of the Council of foreign ministers; but the breakdown of that conference and the encouragingprogress made with&apos;the; plans for: European recovery, towards whichthe United Kingdom : Government had; made such an important contribution, had opened the, way :f or an. attempt to secure a greater measure of \ co-operation&apos; among the countries of Western Europe.It would be necessary to mobilise the resources of Africa in supportof any Western European union;-and, if some such union could be&apos; created, including not&apos;Only the countries of Western Europe but alsotheir&apos;Colonial possessions in Africa and the East,, this would forma bloc&apos; which/ both, in population and productive capacity, could stand&apos;&apos;on&apos; an equality Iwith&apos; the :western hemisphere &apos;and Soviet blocs.In discussion there was general; support for the proposal thatpositive steps should be taken to consolidate . the forces of theWestern European countries and their Colonial possessions. Thefollowing; points were made;:-(a);It&apos;was;important that in the execution of the policy out-lined in CP. (48) 6 too much emphasis should not be laid on itsanti-Soviet aspect.&apos; A policy which gained the unanimous supportof the Press and public opinion of the Right would fail to rallyAus^a.^,,,;,.,(; !hr4;, iThe-Cabinet (considered a memorandum. by the Foreign-peace treaty.?^Secretary, (CP;i(48) &amp;) jon;the negotiations&apos; for&apos; the;conclusion of ai(Previou^&apos;.! sKrr^peace, treat f or-Austria.;:KBefe^en^i^q-M^^jj^ig^S^^ said that&apos; when, the/ Council of ForeignG.M.(47)43rdMinisters^^,&apos;had broken off their discussions on Germany they hadConduswns^ ^ yagwed&apos;&apos;that- ^their^Deputies/might continue fa. :seek a basis for con-t^^&apos;&apos;?!?^..?.!^^^&apos;^&apos;?6^-&apos;^^ for Austria.&apos;;-He, had ,welcomed this decision,as it offered an opportunity to&apos;separate1 the Austrian problem fromthe more difficult problem of Germany; and kept open the possibility that/the: Armies of * Occupation might, soon be withdrawn fromiAustria.Hitherto the :main obstacle to ? the conclusion of a treaty had. been the ^Soviet claim; to German&apos;assets in Austria; but theSoviet Government had now shown some signs of readiness to definethat claim^ and he thought the western Powers might be well advised to, make: some ^concession on this&apos;point for the purpose of securing atreaty.

The danger of pursuing a policy which\     ^concentrated on opposition to the Soviet Government was, illustrated&apos;    ; by events in Greece,- where . it had not been found possible to...     .  strengthen the influence of the centre Parties.   Doubts were also&quot;&apos;- ..&apos; expressed about the,suggestion in. CP. (48) 6 that Portugal shouldV. : be included,in the western.democratic system.     ..   ;-:&apos;:. -    &quot; In reply, the&apos;Foreign Secretary said that it would be impossible:\ ,       : for,.him to&apos; give an effective lead without being critical of Soviet? :policy, but it was his intention to concentrate mainly on the positivesis- h *,!      &quot;and constructive side of his proposals.   So far as Greece was con-... cerned, every effort had been made to encourage the centre Parties,:r       i but they had proved incapable of forming a stable Government.  The: -^inclusion of&apos;Portugal in any Western European union would be most,   important because of her Colonial possessions in Africa.  There was; - ; ... !     no intention of attempting to bring Spain into the union so long as- the Franco Government continued in power.;      ;: &apos;(b) The most effective method of countering Soviet propagandawas to provide specific information refuting the misrepresentationsmade by the Soviet Government.   The Prime Minister&apos;s recentbroadcast illustrated how this could be combined with encouragement- -     ; of Socialist principles.&apos; &apos; - : (c) It would be necessary to work out more precisely thepurposes for which a closer union of Western Europe was to beadvocated. Co-operation might be for the purpose of defence or inthe economic or cultural fields; but, unless some positive point of. . , focus were devised, it, would be difficult to make any satisfactory progress. It might be advisable, in the first instance, to try to workout the basic principles in consultation with the French Government.(d) It might be desirable to establish some form of inter-&apos;   -   departmental organisation, including the Board of Trade, theColonial Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office, to work out&apos;        the basic principles of co-operation and advise on the lines whichpropaganda should follow;(e) Much progress had already been made in securing the,  co-operation of Western European countries in colonial matters.,  ;&apos; ,,, &apos;. .; The Secretary of, State for the Colonies had also devoted special.:   ...attention to.developing the understanding of democratic principles.. -    , i..   ,in the Colonial Empire through the Press, films and broadcasting,: .   through the fostering of the trade union movement, and through the: .&apos;.      , guidance of students from Colonial territories attending Univer-...;    ,\     ; necessities and Colleges in this country.... , , J (/) It would give much-needed encouragement to the Social,.:       :      , Democratic leaders in Germany if in any proposals for closer union.in Western Europe it was made clear that there would in due course/ &apos;&apos;        , be a place for Germany in the union.;.
