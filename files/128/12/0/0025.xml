175CM. 25 \iS)   112CM1 Service. 1.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the procedureExclusion of to be followed to give effect to his statement of 15th March aboutCommunists the employment of Communists and Fascists on secret work in theand Fascists Civil Service. He also indicated to the Cabinet the general linesfrom certain on which he proposed to defend this policy in the debate in the branches.       House of Commons later that day.(Previous ^n tne discussion which ensued particular attention was drawnReference:       to the following points :-CM. (48) 24th (a) Civil Servants held office at the pleasure of the Crown, and conclusions, could not claim the protection of the courts if they were dismissedMinute 1.)      because their conduct or efficiency fell below the standard required.They had no right to occupy any particular office or position, andwere liable to be posted in accordance with the requirements of theService.   Dismissal involved forfeiture of pension rights.(b) Where there was serious doubt about the reliability of a civil Servant employed on secret work, he should be suspended fromduty until the enquiries had been completed.(c) Persons who had been members of the Communist Partyduring the war and earlier might since have changed their views and become wholly reliable. It could not, however, be presumed that such persons were reliable merely because it was known or believed thatthey were no longer members of the Communist Party. It wouldbe advisable that full enquiries should be made in such cases. it followed that no stigma should attach to a person merely because hehad been the subject of enquiries.(d) The final decision to dismiss a person from the Civil service on these grounds, or to. remove him from secret work, would rest with the Minister in charge of the Department. It was, however,proposed to appoint a small advisory body consisting of three retiredCivil Servants to assist Ministers in the exercise of this responsi-bility. A Civil Servant liable to be dismissed or transferred onaccount of his membership of, or association with, the Communistor Fascist Parties would be entitled to make written representations to this advisory body and, if he so desired, to appear before thempersonally. He would be given sufficient particulars of the informa-tion against him to enable him to bring rebutting evidence; but itwould be impracticable to disclose to him the sources from which that information had been obtained. He would not be allowed tobe represented before the advisory body by counsel, or by a friendor a representative of his Staff Association; but it would be opento him to ask the advisory body to see witnesses who might testifyto his character. The procedure of the advisory body would bekept as flexible as possible.(e) It would be necessary to resist any suggestion that thereports of this advisory body should be made public. Ministers must take full responsibility for the decisions reached and must beprepared to defend them.(/) The great majority of the cases dealt with under this procedure could be met by transfer to other work, and very fewCivil Servants were likely to be dismissed from the Service on this account. It was agreed, however, that persons who had to be removed from the Service on this account should be given the option ofresigning in lieu of being dismissed. In either event their pension rights would be forfeited.(g) Care should be taken to ensure that any scientists removed from the Civil Service because of their connection with the Com-munist or Fascist Parties were not able to regain access to secret information in Universities and other agencies where secret work was done on behalf of Government Departments.(A) The Cabinet were informed that steps were being taken bythe Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers to ensure that members of the Armed Forces who were associated with the Com-munist or Fascist Parties would not be employed on secret work.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was invited to arrangefor similar action to be taken in respect of the Colonial Service.
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the procedure proposed for applying the principlethat persons belonging to, or associated with, the Com-munist or Fascist Parties should not be employed inconnection with secret work in the Civil Service; and took note of the general lines on which the PrimeMinister proposed to defend this policy in the debate inthe House of Commons that day;(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to takecorresponding action to ensure that persons belongingto, or associated with, the Communist or Fascist parties were not employed in connection with secret work in theColonial Service.Wages Policy:Statement onPersonalIncomes,Costs and prices.(previous reference:CM. (48) 20thConclusions,Minute 5.)Follow- upAction.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (48) 97) reporting developments following the despatch to Wages Boards and Councils on 9th March of the letter annexed to CP. (48) 76.The Trades Union Congress had taken the view that this lettermight be interpreted as meaning that the Government regarded theprinciples indicated in the White Paper as being in the nature ofa directive imposed by the Government rather than proposals forwhich the voluntary support of trade unions was being sought inthe national interest. The Prime Minister had received a deputationof the Trades Union Congress on 23rd March to discuss this question,and it had then been agreed that, as there was a genuine misunder-standing of its terms, the best course would be to withdraw the letter and to substitute another document which would express more clearly the Governments intention. A letter to the Trades UnionCongress, informing them of the withdrawal of the letter of9th March, had accordingly been handed to them at the meeting.Annexed to CP. (48) 97 was the draft of an alternative letter tobe sent to the Wages Boards and Councils in substitution for that of9th March; and it was proposed that the Trades Union congress and the British Employers Confederation should be consulted before it was issued.Trade Unions&apos;Discussion of white PaperPolicy.Civil ServiceArbitrationAward.The Cabinets-Approved the draft letter to Wages Boards and Councilsannexed to CP. (48) 97.The Cabinet were informed that the conference of trade union executives which had met on the previous day, had endorsed by amajority of over 3 million votes the report of the General Councilurging support for the Governments policy on wages and prices.The Governments decision to withdraw their letter of 9th Marchhad been an important factor in ensuring this satisfactory result.Nevertheless, the speeches at the conference had shown that therewas much opposition to the Governments policy, especially from thegroup of engineering unions, the Union of Shop, Distributive and allied Workers and the Civil Service Clerical Association.Attention was drawn to a recent award by the Civil ServiceArbitration Tribunal in which an allowance had been grantedsubject to the proviso that it should not be paid so long as the considerations outlined in the White Paper continued to apply.Some anxiety was expressed lest, if this formula should be widelyadopted by arbitral bodies, the Government might be under con-tinuing pressure to declare that the country&apos;s economic conditionwas no longer critical and a large number of approved claims mightaccumulate meanwhile. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe Governments intervention had made it inevitable that bodies concerned with wage negotiations would seek to share with theGovernment the responsibility for adverse decisions which they might make on account of the considerations set out in the White Paper.

In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute further reference was made to the recent strike of liftmenand engineering staff in establishments managed by the Ministryof Works.It was suggested that the White Paper on Personal Incomes,Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321) need not preclude consideration ofthe adjustment of wage rates payable to persons directly employedby the Government where those rates were substantially below thoseruling in comparable employment outside Government service.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour to submit a memorandum onthe circumstances which had led to this strike and on thecourse of the wage negotiations which were now proceeding.Cabinet Office, S.
