CM. 13 (48)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in     the House of Commons in the following week.the House ofCommons.Parliament.electoral reform.(previous reference:C.M.(4S)otnConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet were informed that the Common Council ofthe City of London would exercise their privilege of asking theSheriffs to attend at the Bar of the House of Commons to protest against the proposal to terminate the separate representation ofthe City in the House of Commons. After this formal protest theywere likely to ask that a deputation should be received to discussthe matter. There were indications that they were specially dis-disturbed at the prospect of the City&quot;s being merged into a singleconstituency with Finsbury and Shoreditch. The Cabinet agreedthat they must maintain the principle that the City of London should cease to be separately represented in Parliament; but there mightbe room for some compromise on the basis of merging the Citywith, say. the Abbey Division of Westminster instead of theShoreditch and Finsburv Division.Sir oswald mosley.Applicationfor BritishPassport3. The Foreign Secretary said that Sir Oswald Mosley had applied for a British passport. There was reason to believe thathe desired to go to South Africa for the purpose of discussing with air. PI row. Colonel Lindbergh and others the prospects of formingan international anti-Communist League. These and other activities in which Sir Oswald Mosley might engage abroad were likely tobe prejudicial to the relations of His Majesty&quot;s Government withforeign Governments: and on that account the Foreign secretary had decided to refuse the application for a passport. This decision might be challenged as an undue encroachment on individualliberties. The Foreign Secretary hoped that he might rely on thesupport of his colleagues in maintaining his decision.ihe Cabinet Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s decision to refuse pass-port facilities to enable Sir Oswald Zvlosley to travel abroadat the present time.India.(previous reference:CM. (47) 92ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments inthe discussions in the Security Council on the dispute between theGovernments of India and Pakistan over the situation in Kashmir.The Indian Government were dissatisfied with the course whichthese discussions had taken and were misinterpreting the efforts made by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations tobring about a reconciliation between the parties. The discussions were, however, continuing.The Cabinet took note of the position.Foreign Policyin Europe.(previous reference:C.M(4S)2r.dConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 46) outlining the steps which he proposed totake to further the policy of western union announced in his speech in the Foreign Affairs debate in the House of Commons on22nd January.The Foreign Secretary said that it appeared from the recentconversations between the Minister of State and the foreign ministers of the Benelux Powers that those Powers would be relue-tant to accept treaties on the model of the Anglo-French Treaty of alliance and Mutual Assistance concluded at Dunkirk in March1947 (Cmd. 7217), and were thinking rather of a regional pact,35039-1 b 2
possibly based on Article 52 of the United Nations Charter. TheFrench Government, on the other hand, were not inclined to favour a regional pact and recommended that the United Kingdom andFrench Governments should forthwith communicate to the BeneluxGovernments, as a basis for discussion, a draft treaty on theDunkirk model prepared by the Foreign Office. He proposed thatin communicating the draft treaty to the Benelux Powers it shouldbe made clear that it was put forward simply as a basis for discussion by a preliminary five-Power meeting of Foreign Ministers in aBenelux capital, which should take place early in March. Mean-while, a careful study would be made of the Pan-American Treatyof Rio de Janeiro, pacts under Articles 51 or 52 of the united nations Charter, the Soviet Treaties with their satellites and anyother instruments which might suggest possible modifications of thedraft to render it more acceptable to the Benelux Powers. Theobject of the five-Power meeting would be to settle the broad princi-ples on which the work of furthering western union should be carriedout: it would probably be found desirable, on the analogy of theCommittee on - European Economic Co-operation, to entrust the detailed application of these principles to a consultative committeeof representatives of the participating Powers, with sub-committees on particular aspects of the problem. He contemplated that this machinery would tackle such problems as co-operation in the sphere of finance and banking, including the possible establishment of a european branch of the International Monetary Fund; an examina-tion of the iron and steel industries of the United Kingdom, France,Belgium and Germany, with a view to deciding what types of pro-duction each country could most usefully develop in the interestsof all: a study of the possibility of securing greater uniformity inthe scope and standard of social services in western European coun-tries; and greater collaboration in the development of overseas territories.In discussion the following points were made : (a) Some doubts were expressed about the proposal to putforward a draft treaty on the Dunkirk model, even as a basis fordiscussion. The Dunkirk Treaty, apart from Article IV, dealtentirely with the problem of defence against German aggression,and a treaty laying such stress on defence would obviously be less acceptable to the Benelux Powers and other western european powers and excite more distrust in Russia than one concerned primarily with economic and social objectives.In reply it was pointed out that the French Government weredisinclined to enter into discussions except on the basis of a draft treaty on the Dunkirk model, and any further attempt to persuade them to abandon this point of view would lead them to suspect theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government to the Dunkirk Treaty. Theadoption of the Dunkirk model would not, however, preclude thefive-Power meeting from eventually reaching agreement on a state-ment of principles which would lay much more stress on economicand social objectives, and it would be the aim of the foreign secretary to guide the discussions in this direction At the sametime, our own security interests made it essential that defence shouldnot be entirely left out of account. Moreover, the Soviet Govern-ment might regard a regional pact as aimed against them; but theyhad raised no objection to the Dunkirk Treaty and could not reasonably object if a draft treaty based on that model were taken asthe basis of the discussions.(6) The Chiefs of Staff were at present studying the military implications of Western union, in the light of preliminary consulta-tions which they had had with the Prime Minister, the foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence.(c) Before the five-Power meeting took place the Cabinet shouldhave an opportunity of considering in more detail the constitutionof the proposed consultative committee of the participating Powers
and of its sub-committees, and the interdepartmental machinery forco-ordinating the work of the interested Departments of the UnitedKingdom Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he intended to circulate amemorandum to the Cabinet for consideration in the following weekoutlining his proposals on these points.(d) Most of the Dominion Governments had welcomed theinitiative taken in this matter by the United Kingdom Government,though the South African Government were inclined to favour a regional pact based on Article 52 of the United Nations Charterrather than a treaty on the Dunkirk model. The Australian Govern-ment had, however, expressed some misgivings about this policy andwere likely to regard with disfavour the inclusion of the overseas territories of the Western European Powers in any Western union.It was suggested that these doubts might be allayed if DominionGovernments were given a clearer indication of the foreign secretary&apos;s objectives, on the lines of the explanation which he had given to the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that the urgent need to reach agreement on the proposed five-Power meeting would make it im-possible to consult Dominion Governments or give them a furtherexplanation of what was proposed before a definite proposal for thefive-Power meeting was communicated to the French and BeneluxGovernments.(e) Western Germany would have to be brought within the scopeof the Western union proposals on the same basis as she had beenbrought into the Marshall Plan.In further discussion there was general agreement that theForeign Secretary should proceed on the lines which he had indicated to the Cabinet, on the understanding that the proposal for a five-Power meeting would be linked rather with the general policy announced in the debate on 22nd January than with the preparationof draft treaties on the Dunkirk model.The Cabinet :-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to propose to the FrenchGovernment and to the Governments of the BeneluxPowers that a preliminary five-Power meeting of foreign ministers should be held in a Benelux capital early inMarch to discuss the furtherance of the policy for western union outlined in his speech in the House ofCommons on 22nd January.(2) Agreed that the draft treaty prepared by the Foreign office on the model of the Anglo-French Treaty of Alliance and mutual Assistance should be communicated to theGovernments concerned as a basis for discussion at theproposed meeting.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would circulate amemorandum to the Cabinet in the following week out-lining the organisation of the proposed consultative committee of the participating Powers and of its sub-committees and the interdepartmental machinery forco-ordinating the work of United Kingdom Departments.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,12th February, 1948.
