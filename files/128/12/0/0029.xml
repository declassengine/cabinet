1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was proposed that the debate on Foreign Affairs should betaken on 4th and 5th May. The Opposition had suggested thatthe latter part of the second day might be devoted to a discussionof a detailed motion on European Union, which had been tabled by Mr. Eonald Maekay, M.P.; and other members. The cabinet agreed, however, that it would be inexpedient that the debate shouldend with a formal vote on such a motion. An informal arrangement might be made between the Parties, with the concurrence ofMr. Speaker, by which the latter part of the debate would be devoted to discussion of this subject so long as the discussion wasnot taken on the basis of a motion and did not end in a formalvote. The Cabinet invited the Chief Whip to seek an agreement on this basis through the usual channels.The Cabinet were informed that the Second Reading of the. Criminal Justice Bill would be taken in the House of Lords on27th April. The Lord Privy Seal was seeking to arrange that thisshould be a general debate on the Bill as a whole, and that the debate on capital punishment should be taken during the committee stage. It seemed likely that the Lords would invite the commons to reconsider the new Clause suspending capital punishment as a penalty for murder but that, if the Commons insisted on it, theymight acquiesce in its becoming law.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 108) reporting the results of the meeting ofthe Foreign Ministers of the signatory Powers of the brussels treaty held in Paris on 17th April, 1948.The main purpose of the meeting had been to settle the organisa-tion and permanent seat of the Consultative Council to be set up under the terms of Article VII of the Treaty. It had been decidedthat the Council should be composed of the&quot; five Foreign ministers and should meet, at least once every three months, in each of thecapitals of the signatory States in turn. The permanent organ ofthe Council and the Secretariat, as well as the bodies responsiblefor security matters, would, however, be established in London.Provision had also been made for meetings of Ministers or officials to carry out the intentions of the Treaty in economic, social and cultural matters.In view of recent developments in Europe it had been urgedthat, while every effort should be made to secure United states support, the five Powers should simultaneously initiate military conversations designed to build up gradually a combined military force and a single defensive organisation. The Foreign secretary had accepted this proposal, but had argued that equal importanceshould be attached to the other aspects of co-operation for which provision had been made in the Treaty. Financial discussions wouldin fact take place in The Hague during the following week. Thepermanent organ would meet on 26th April, and its first task would be to put the military conversations in train.In discussion, the following points were made : &apos;(a) M. Bidault had suggested in conversation that the five powers might organise a joint Social Services Exhibition. Thissuggestion could be examined by the Official Committee on the social services in Western Europe.(&amp;) The Foreign Secretary had emphasised the need for avoiding any overlapping between the organisation established under theTreaty and the Continuing Organisation for European economic co-operation, and this view had been accepted by the other foreign ministers.
The cabinet endorsed the policy followed by the Foreign Secretary atthe meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the signatoryPowers of the Brussels Treaty on 17th April, 1948.European -3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignEoonomio       Secretary (CP.

On 16th April a convention, combiningthe multilateral agreement and constitution in one document, hadbeen signed by Ministers representing the participating countries,and this would be published shortly as a White Paper.   TheOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation would comprisea Council of all the participating members with an Executive Com-mittee of seven. Its constitution was flexible and would give freedomfor development to meet needs as they arose.   Some difficulties hadbeen encountered in selecting the site for the seat of the Organisa-tion, and in filling the chief posts.   It had now been decided thatParis should be the seat of the Organisation; and that M. Marjolinshould be appointed Secretary-General, for which post he waseminently qualified.   In order to meet the wishes of the benelux countries, the Foreign Secretary had renounced the Chairmanship. of the Council in favour of a Belgian representative; but the UnitedKingdom Delegate to the Organisation would be Chairman of theExecutive Committee.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the arrangements made for theestablishment of an organisation for European economic co-operation.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd April, 1948.
