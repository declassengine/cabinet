2.   The Cabinet had approved on 5th February the, PrimeMinister&apos;s proposals (CP. (48) 39) for the composition and terms. of reference of a Committee to enquire into the restrictions imposed on the political activities of Civil Servants.The Prime Minister said that Sir Philip Morris, whom he had originally proposed as Chairman of this Committee, was unable toundertake this duty. He now proposed to invite Mr. J.C.Masterman,Provost of Worcester College, Oxford, to preside over the Committee.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this change in the composition of the Committee.3. The Foreign Secretary said that it was proposed to publish a collection of original documents bearing on British Foreign Policyfrom 1919 to 1939. If the various volumes in this series were issued in chronological order, the diplomatic documents for the years 1938and 1939 would not be published until about 1953. At the moment,however, public interest would be directed mainly on the documentsfor these two years, which had a direct bearing on the immediateorigins of the last war; and it seemed desirable that these shouldbe published in the fairly near future while public discussion con-tinued, and books were being written, about the origins of the war.Subject, therefore, to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed that&apos;the documents for the years 1938 and 1939 should be. published outof chronological sequence. Even so, it would probably not be prac-ticable to publish the first of these before the end of 1948.-3 b 21. On the remaining stages of the Consolidated Fund bill that day the House were to discuss conditions in the police serviceand civil defence. Both subjects concerned the Home Office; andthe Home Secretary had arranged to speak on the first, leaving thesecond to be handled by the Under-Secretary of State. It was nowlearned, however, that the debate on civil defence would be openedby Sir John Anderson, and that the Opposition were expecting theHome Secretary to reply to that discussion. The Cabinet took the view that the Opposition were not entitled to ask that theGovernment reply should be given by a particular Minister; andthat, if they chose to discuss on the Consolidated Fund Bill twosubjects affecting a single Department, they could not properlypress the Minister in charge of that Department to ask the leave of the House to speak twice in the debate on the Bill. The Cabinettherefore agreed that the Home Secretary should adhere to his original plan of speaking himself on conditions in the police serviceand leaving the Under-Secretary of State to reply to the debate on civil defence.The Cabinet considered which Minister should move on23rd March the resolution about equalisation grant under the LocalGovernment Bill, which they had approved at their meeting on18th March (CM. (48) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 2). After discus-sion it was agreed that the Financial Secretary, Treasury, should move the resolution and that the Attorney-General should beavailable to speak if required.The Prime Minister&apos;s statement of 15th March on the employ -ment of Communists in certain branches of the Civil Service wouldbe debated on 25th March on the motion for the adjournment forthe Easter Recess. The Prime Minister proposed to intervene earlyin the discussion, and it was agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer should be prepared, if necessary, to reply to the debate.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Easter Recess.
The Cabinet-Agreed that, in the series of official documents bearing on british Foreign Policy from 1919 to 1939, the volumesPdealing with the years 1938 and 1939 should be published in advance- of the rest of the series.Foreign Policyin Europe.(previous reference erence:O.M.(48)22ndConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary made a report to the Cabinet on thecourse of the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Five-Power Treaty between the United Kingdom, France, Belgium,Holland and Luxembourg. Diplomatic representatives of the fiveGovernments were now discussing the form of the consultative council to be established under the Treaty. In arranging for continuing collaboration under the Treaty he expected that therewould be some further difficulties with the French; but he had been impressed by the efficiency and confidence of the other three Govern-ments. He was enquiring how the United States government proposed to give practical effect to the policy indicated in president truman&apos;s declaration of 17th March.The Foreign Secretary added that he would circulate to theCabinet a memorandum on the machinery to be established forsecuring continuing collaboration under the Treaty.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Trieste.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the circum-stances leading to the joint approach made by the Governments ofthe United Kingdom, the United States and France on 20th march to the Governments of the Soviet Union and Italy proposing thatthe Peace Treaty with Italy should be modified by an additionalprotocol placing the Free Territory of Trieste under Italiansovereignty. This proposal was justified by practical experienceof the difficulties of bringing into operation the special arrangementsfor administering Trieste which had been prescribed in the peace treaty. Discussions in the Security Council had shown that itwould be impossible to reach agreement on the selection of a governor of the Free Territory; and, until a Governor had been appointed,the regime envisaged by the Treaty could not be effectively intro-duced. In particular, it would be impossible to bring to an end the Allied military occupation of the Territory; and we could not contemplate keeping British troops in the area indefinitely. Mean-while, the Yugoslav Zone of the Territory had been virtually incor-porated in Yugoslavia by procedures inconsistent with the spiritof the Treaty. The three Governments had therefore decided torecommend the return ofthe solution most likely toasTerritory to Italian sovereigntymeet the democratic asnirations of Ithe inhabitants and to facilitate the re-establishment of peace and jstability in the area.There had been special reasons for making this proposal public iwithout delay. The forthcoming elections in Italy might determine whether a Union of Western Europe could include Italy, and the]prospects of the moderate Parties in those elections were uncertain.The Soviet Government had recently declared their intention tosupport the return of the Italian Colonies to Italy, and there was reason to believe that they had also intended to declare themselvesin favour of restoring the City of Trieste to Italian sovereignty.These declarations were doubtless intended to strengthen the handsof the Italian Communists in the forthcoming elections. Communismseemed to be gaining some ground, in Italy. Wliile the efforts ofthe Italian Government to counter it had been concentrated mainly in the north, it seemed to have made.some progress among the peasants in the south by exploiting their grievances against thelandowners.   In these circumstances it had seemed desirable that
early publicity should be given to the proposal that Trieste should1be placed under Italian sovereignty, with a view to strengthening the position of the moderate Parties in the forthcoming elections.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the declaration favouring thereturn to Italy of the Free Territory of Trieste.6.   The Cabinet considered the problems raised by the actionof the United States Government in withdrawing their support ofthe partition plan for Palestine and proposing that Palestine should12th   be placed under trusteeship.ions, There was general agreement that a false impression of the1.) attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government might be given if theBill. Palestine Bill were delayed on this account; and it was therefore decided that the Committee stage should be concluded and theremaining stages taken on 23rd March.Action It seemed probable that the Soviet representative on the SecurityUnited Council would veto the United States proposal. There might thenbe a procedural vote on a proposal to withdraw the matter fromthe Council&apos;s agenda or to summon a special meeting of theAssembly. It was impossible to decide yet what attitude theUnited Kingdom representative should adopt towards such pro-cedural proposals^ but it should be borne in mind that his votemight be decisive.There was clearly no hope that the proposal for a trusteeshipwould be accepted either by the Jews or by the Arabs and therewere serious objections to a suggestion which had been made inthe United States that order should be maintained by joint forces from the United States, the United Kingdom and France. Moreover,it might well be that in the new situation the Jews would seek toestablish a Jewish State covering such parts of the area allotted to them in the partition plan as they might reasonably expect tobe able to defend; and the King of Transjordan might seek toassume control of other parts of Palestine, a move which wouldstir up trouble among the other Arab States in addition to the disturbance which it would create in Palestine itself. A furtherfactor in the situation was that the United Nations commission were now unlikely to be in Palestine on the date when the Mandatewas surrendered and, indeed, there was some reason to believe thatthey would resign.The Cabinet agreed that, although there shoulcLbe no changein the date (15th May) fixed for the surrender of the Mandate, theBritish civil and military authorities in Palestine should make no effort to oppose the setting up of a Jewish State or a move into palestine from Transjordan, but should now concentrate on the task of withdrawing the civil administration and the British forces from palestine. The Chiefs of Staff should examine the possibility of accelerating the rate of withdrawal of British forces in the lightof the new situation. Particular care should be taken to avoidleaving isolated units either of the civil administration or of our forces at points from which their retreat might be cut off. Thisshould be avoided even at the cost of allowing the efficiency of ourcivil administration to run down, over wide areas of Palestine,before the surrender of the Mandate.Other points in discussion were : (a) The British authorities, in Jerusalem had done everything possible to secure the co-operation of Jews and Arabs in a scheme, for safeguarding the Holy Places, and the United Kingdom repre-sentative on the Trusteeship Council had pressed strongly for theearly appointment of a Governor in order that he &quot;might recruitthe necessary security forces. Unfortunately, however, the Trustee-ship Council had postponed consideration of this matter until28th April.
(&amp;) No attempt should be made to transfer to the UnitediKingdom or to a British Colony Jews or Arabs now held in Palestine&quot;prisons for terrorist offences.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the Chiefsof Staff to consider whether the withdrawal of british forces from Palestine could not be accelerated, in thelight of the developments likely to result from the UnitedStates proposal that the partition plan should be aban-abandoned.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to considerwhether the units of civil administration in Palestinecould not be concentrated in such a way as to reduce therisk that individual units might become isolated.Town and country planning.Claims for loss ofDevelopmentValue: Pay-ment of Pro-f essional Feesincurred byClaimants.(previous reference erence:CM. (48) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (48) 95) on the proposal thatthe Central Land Board should be empowered to pay part of the professional fees incurred by landowners in claiming compensationfor loss of development value under the Town and Country PlanningActs of 1947.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as requested by theCabinet on 15th March, he had reconsidered this proposal in consul-tation with the Ministers concerned; and in this further memoran-dum he had sought to remove some of the apprehensions which theCabinet had felt in their previous discussion. He was satisfied that,unless this scheme was adopted, there would be a vast increase inthe work falling on the Valuation Office and in the number of arbi-trations; and this would not only delay the assessment of develop-ment values, but might also involve the State in even greater expensesince costs would be awarded at the discretion of the arbitrator.The Cabinet had been concerned lest this scheme should establish a new precedent; but, as was shown in the note annexed to cp. (48) 95, the scheme was in fact in accordance with established practice in comparable matters such as the compulsory acquisitionof land. There was, as the Cabinet had feared, some risk that aGovernment contribution towards professional fees might encourageunreliable persons to set themselves up as advisers to claimants;but it would be possible to include in the scheme safeguards designedto reduce this risk.In view of the further considerations set out in CP. (48) 95,the Cabinet Approved the scheme, outlined in CP. (48) 82 and 95,for a Government contribution towards professional feesincurred by landowners in claiming compensation for loss,of development values.Monopoly(Enquiry andControl) Bill.(previous reference:CM. (48) 21stConclusions,Minute 1.)8 The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 93) reporting the results of the further discussion of the Monopolistic Practices Bill which he had held inpursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 11th March. Annexed to thismemorandum was a revised draft Bill, now entitled the Monopoly(Enquiry and Control) Bill.Instead of the expression &quot;conditions of imperfect competi-tion,&quot; to which the Cabinet had taken exception, the Bill nowreferred to &quot; conditions of monopoly or other conditions restrictiveof trade.&quot; The draft Bill considered by the Cabinet on 11th Marchhad provided that the conditions to which it applied should not bedeemed to prevail unless more than one-half of the goods in question were affected, and the Lord President and his colleagues had at first
been disposed to propose the substitution of &quot; a substantial propor-tion &quot; for &quot; more than one-half.&quot; Such a criterion would, however,be hard to defend in the House of Commons, would involve diffi-culties in administration and might in the last resort lead to a challenge in the Courts. It was therefore proposed to substitute&apos;&apos; one-third &apos;&apos; for &apos;&apos; one-half &apos;&apos;; and the President of the Board ofTrade, after examining all the actual cases in which he would now wish to take action under the Bill, was satisfied that this criterionwould be effective. It was agreed that it would be undesirable to empower the Board of Trade to give directions to the MonopolyCommission, but it was recommended that, where the commission had been asked to report whether particular conditions or practiceswere against the public interest, and had either reported that theywere not or had failed to make any definite report, it should never-theless be possible to make an order if the House of Commons had passed a resolution declaring such conditions or practices to be against the public interest. It was also agreed that, where the monopoly Commission had made a suggestion falling short of a recommendation for the use of statutory sanctions, the Board ofTrade might ask the Commission to ascertain how far theirsuggestion, or any suggestion made by the Board of Trade, was being put into effect. It was proposed that the Bill, if approved by theCabinet, should be considered by the Legislation Committee later inthe week, with a view to its introduction before the Easter Recess.The following points arose in discussion : (a) The Minister of Defence had hoped that it might be possibleso to define &apos;&apos; action against the public interest&quot; as to remove any danger that the provisions of the Bill might be exercised in such away as to prejudice co-operative societies. He considered that this could be justified on the ground that there were no restrictions onthe membership of these societies.The general view of the Cabinet was that it was unnecessary and undesirable to insert in the Bill any further safeguards forco-operative societies, who would, in fact, benefit by its provisions in so far as they could be used to prevent discrimination against theco-operative movement.(b) The exclusion of inland transport from the scope of the bill could be justified on the ground that the British transport commission and its Executives were subject to adequate control sofar as concerned their monopoly activities. It would be undesirable to take power in the Bill to deal with restrictive practices by shipping companies, since this would make His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment liable to be called on to use their powers against Britishparticipants in international cartels, and there was in practice littledanger of restrictive practices by coastwise shipping in the UnitedKingdom.(c) Clause 2 of the Trusts arfd Combines Bill, introduced bythe Minister of Defence in 1925, had enabled the Board of Trade torequire firms exercising monopolies or substantial control to furnishregular information where it was not thought necessary to make a formal order. It was not, however, necessary to take any similarpower in the present Bill in view of the provisions of Clause 12,which enabled the Commission to report on the extent to which firmshad complied, with their recommendations: There might also beoccasions on which an informal warning from the President of theBoard of Trade would be adequate.(d) The Trusts and Combines Bill had also provided that, before an order was made, it should be published in draft and the Boardof Trade should consider any objections by persons who might beaffected by it. The omission of any corresponding provision from the monopoly (Enquiry and Control) Bill could probably be justified onthe ground that the earlier Bill had made no provision for a preliminary investigation by an independent body of the nature ofthe Monopoly Commission; but the President of the Board of trade would bear in mind the possibility of making some concession onthese lines when the Bill was before Parliament.
petrol rationing.(previous reference:CM. (48) 4thConclusions,Minute 1.)&apos; 9. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power on petrol rationing (CP. (48) 90) and on the report of theRussell Vick Committee on the black market in petrol (CP. (48) 89).The Minister of Fuel and Power said that since January, whenthe Cabinet had last discussed petrol rationing, the administrative difficulties connected with the present scheme had not diminished.There was much public criticism of the anomalies associated withthe issue of supplementary allowances and, despite great efforts bythe police, it had proved impracticable to enforce effectively the rule that petrol might only be used for specified purposes. Thus the lawand its administration were being brought into disrepute. On theother hand, the withdrawal of the basic ration and the other cutsimposed had achieved substantial savings and,, in view both of the dollar shortage and of the uncertainties about future oil supplies, hehad regarded as impracticable any change which would addsubstantially to the present rate of consumption. Annexed to cp. (48) 89 was a summary of the recommendations made by theRussell Vick Committee on the black market in petrol. he recommonded that these should be accepted, subject to the modifica-tions indicated in CP. (48) 89, and he estimated that if this were done there would be an annual saving of 50,000 to 100,000 tons of petrol. As a complementary measure there should be a cut of10 per cent, in the allowances to goods vehicles, but this would notin itself produce any additional saving. On the other hand, it shouldbe possible to achieve a saving of about 20,000 tons a year insupplementary allowances, with the result that, without any increasein total consumption, from 70,000 to 120,000 tons of petrol perannum could be made available for any modification of the rationing system that might be considered desirable. His proposal was that,from 1st June, a standard allowance, sufficient to allow 90 miles amonth of motoring, should be given to every person owning a motor vehicle. The coupons making up the allowance would be availablefor six months and could thus be saved up for holidays. Thestandard allowance would be deducted in full from all existingallowances so that persons receiving supplementary allowances equalto or exceeding the standard ration would get the same amount ofTxrt uj:_____] j/u,J-J-C   UCUCVCU   l/UUbpetrolcould obtain the co-operation of the motoring organisations and had it in mind to set up a small advisory committee, including repre-sentatives of the Automobile Association and the Royal AutomobileClub, which would keep the rationing system under review and help him in the measures to be taken against the black market and in thescaling down of supplementary allowances. He also proposed thatthe form of the supplementary allowance coupons should be alteredso that changes in the amounts granted might be made at short notice.If the Cabinet approved his proposals, he would propose to announcethem immediately after the Easter Recess.Discussion turned mainly on the suggestion made in paragraph 4of CP. (48) 89 that, instead of introducing legislation authorising the more stringent penalties for black-market dealings recommendedby the Russell Vick Committee and summarised in paragraph 8 ofthe Annex, the Minister should continue to rely on the existingpenalties under Defence Regulations. There was general agreement that stringent penalties could be justified as a means of putting anThe Cabinet-Approved the Monopoly (Enquiry and Control) Bill in theform annexed to CP. (48) 93, subject to the amendmentsnecessary to give effect to the substitution of &quot; one-third &quot;for &apos;&apos; substantial proportion &apos;&apos; in Clauses 3, 4, 5 and 17;and invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate a revised draft of the Bill to the legislation committee.
end to the black market and that there were strong arguments for legislation providing for the automatic imposition on conviction ofthe penalties recommended by the Russell Vick Committee. It wouldbe necessary to verify whether there would be Parliamentary timefor such legislation, but it should be possible to secure a relativelyeasy passage for the Bill if it were made clear that the proposal togrant a standard allowance could not be entertained unless theGovernment had adequate powers to deal with the black market.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange forthe addition of colour and a chemical to commercialpetrol in accordance with the recommendations of theRussell Vick Committee.(2) Agreed in principle that it would be desirable to introduce legislation in the current Session to make possible the automatic imposition on conviction of penalties for black-market offences on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 ofthe Annex to CP. (48) 89, and invited the Minister of fuel and Power to discuss with the Lord Presidentwhether Parliamentary time could be found for thenecessary Bill.(3) Agreed that the recommendation of the Russell VickCommittee that motorists should keep coupon recordsheets should not be adopted for the present.(4) Approved the proposal for the grant of a standard petrolallowance to all motorists from 1st June, 1948, on theunderstanding that the Minister of Fuel and power would take steps to secure an annual saving of from70,000 to 120,000 tons on the present consumption of petrol by measures against the black market, by a cut of10 per cent, in allowances to goods vehicles and by reductions in supplementary allowances.(5) Approved the proposals in paragraph 12 of CP. (48) 90 for establishing an advisory council of representatives ofmotoring associations and for altering the form of thecoupons for supplementary allowances.10. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (48) 86) regarding the supply of paper for the Fascist periodical Action, which had now resumedpublication under the title Union (incorporating Action).Since the Cabinet last discussed this matter on 24th July, 1947,the Board of Trade, having no Cabinet authority either to grantor to refuse a licence for paper for this periodical, had leftunanswered all letters and applications from the publishers.Publication had now been resumed, however, with paper obtainedfrom printers&apos; or merchants&apos; stocks for the supply of which nolicence was required, and in the first issue the publishers haddisclosed that the Board of Trade had withheld a licence for thesupply of paper. As a result, it was now being represented, throughMembers of Parliament and otherwise, that this constituted an unfair discrimination. The President proposed to reply to these representations that, while the Government had not prevented theappearance of this periodical and would not use paper control as a method of imposing censorship, they were not prepared to issue a licence permitting paper producers to supply paper for this purpose.In discussion there was general agreement with the line whichthe President of the Board of Trade proposed to take. It was,however, suggested that he should veriiy whether any proceedingsmight be instituted against him (for example, by way of mandamus)on the ground that, by leaving the publishers&apos; applicationsunanswered, he had failed to discharge his obligations under thePaper Control Orders.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd March; 1948.The Cabinet-Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to replon the lines indicated in paragraph 3 of CP. (48) 86 to anrepresentations regarding the failure of the Board of Tradto authorise the supply of paper for the publication of thiFascist periodical.
