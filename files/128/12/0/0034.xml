1. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the courseof the discussions which had taken place with the United Statesand French Governments before the British resolution on Palestinehad been put before the Security Council on 29th May. this resolution called on Jews and Arabs to accept a truce in Palestinefor four weeks on specific terms which were designed to ensure thatduring that time no fighting men or war material would be intro-:duced into Palestine or into any of the Arab States, and that the holy Places would be safeguarded. The Council had accepted a french amendment providing that any men of military age whoentered Palestine during the truce period should not be mobilisedor put under military training during that period. This amend-ment would be unpopular with the Arab States, since it contemplated the continuance of Jewish immigration; but it was hoped that,despite this, the resolution would be accepted by the Arabs. Theyhad been assured that all transfers of Jewish immigrants from cyprus to Palestine would be suspended for four weeks. Thisdecision to suspend the transfers from Cyprus had been taken withthe knowledge and assent of the Jewish Agency.In discussion there was general support for the policy under-lying this resolution. It was recognised that compliance with the embargo on the movement of war material might involve some breach of our existing contracts for the supply of arms to Arab States. TheForeign Secretary confirmed, however, that there was no intentionof modifying our long-term obligations under our Treaty of alliance with Trans Jordan.There might be some pressure for an early statement in Parlia-ment. It was agreed that the Foreign Secretary should not makea statement that day, when the Jews and Arabs were considering what reply they should make to the Security Council&apos;s resolution;and The Prime Minister undertook to explain to the House ofCommons why no statement was to be made that day.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and endorsed his action in putting forward the resolution passed by the Security Council on 29th May.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (48) 134) reporting the position reached in the informal discussions on the future of Germany which were being held in London between delegations representing the UnitedKingdom, the United States, France, Belgium, Holland and luxembourg.These discussions had been concerned with three major problems : the political structure of western Germany, the inter-national control of the Ruhr, and the maintenance of security against future German aggression. On the two latter questionsagreement had been reached, but it had not been possible to reconcile the views of the French with those of the other Governments on thefuture political structure of Germany.The Cabinet first discussed the political structure of Germany.Agreement had been reached on a plan for establishing a provi-sional German Government in the three western Zones. Under this plan, the three Military Governors would, not later than 15th June,authorise the Ministers President in these Zones to arrange for a constituent Assembly to be convoked by 1st September, and to make proposals for the reorganisation of the present inter-Landboundaries. These proposals would, after scrutiny by the military governors, be submitted for approval by popular vote in the affectedareas before the Constituent Assembly was established. TheAssembly itself would proceed to draft a constitution in close con-sultation with representatives of the Western Powers; for, while, b 2
the greatest possible freedom would be left to the Germans to choosetheir own type of governmental structure, it would be necessaryto ensure that certain minimum requirements, agreed in advance by the occupying Powers, would be safeguarded in the constitution,and these principles would be set out in a letter of advice to besent to the Military Governors for their guidance during the consul-tations. At the same time, consultations would take place betweenAllied and German representatives on a new definition of the relationship between the Military Government and the new GermanGovernment to be established under the constitution. The draft constitution would in due course be referred to the military governors and, subject to their approval, submitted for ratification by the German people by public referendum. In a memorandumof 20th May addressed to the United Kingdom and United states government, the French Government had suggested that theseproposals should not be communicated to the Germans until theautumn, and that the members of the Constituent Assembly shouldbe chosen from the Land Parliaments and not by direct election.In support of these suggestions -the French Government had argued that the early establishment of a Constituent Assembly in western germany might provoke hostile reactions from the Soviet Govern-ment, and that the creation of an elected body would give a stimulus to German nationalism. The French Government were undoubtedlyin a difficult political position; for any proposals emerging from theLondon talks would have to be debated in the Chamber of Deputiesand the Government were likely to encounter strong oppositionboth from the Left and Right-Wing Parties. On the other hand,it was important that early progress should be made with thepolitical and economic reorganisation of western Germany: theGerman people were anxiously awaiting a lead and a clear pro-gramme, and further delay would have serious effects on the situationin Germany. Moreover, the Soviet Government would be quick todeduce that our reluctance to take effective action sprang from a sense of weakness and would be encouraged thereby to increase their pressure on the western Allies. In these circumstances, the foreign secretary suggested that it should be made clear to the FrenchGovernment that His Majesty&apos;s Government could not agree toany postponement which would have the effect of delaying until next year the establishment of a Constituent Assembly, though theywould not- object to the postponement of the notification to theGermans from 15th June toTsay, 1st July and of the summoning of the Constituent Assembly from 1st September to 1st October.In order to assist the French Government, however, it would notbe unreasonable to accept the compromise suggested by the UnitedStates Government that it should be left to the Land Parliamentsto decide whether the elections to the Constituent Assembly in eachLand should be by the people of each Land or by the parliament in each Land. If, in the last resort, it was not possible to obtainthe agreement of the French Delegation to these proposals, or ifthey were rejected by the French Government after debate in theChamber, it was recommended that the United Staters Governmentshould be informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government were prepared in principle to proceed with the carrying out of the constitutionalprogramme in the combined British and United States Zone.Ministers were in general agreement with the policy proposedby the Foreign Secretary. The adoption of a firm policy by theUnited Kingdom and United States Governments might give theFrench Government the leadership and support that it needed.In discussion, the following further points were made: (a) Attention was drawn to the suggestion in the military governors telegram No. 2888 of 30th May that the announcementof the proposals for currency reform and constitutional reformought to be made simultaneously. The Foreign Secretary said thatin his view the scheme for currency reform could, and should, proceedindependently.
(6) While the German people were naturally anxious for a unified Germany, they would welcome the present constitutional proposals for western Germany as providing scope for increasedGerman participation in the management of their own affairs.(c) The French argument that the establishment of an electedConstituent Assembly would stimulate German nationalism wasnot well-founded. Totalitarian elements in Germany were more likely to be encouraged by the continued denial of the normal outletsprovided by democratic political activity.(d) The British Military Governor was confident that, if itwere left to the Land Parliaments to decide whether the membersof the Constituent Assembly should be chosen by direct or indirectelection, the majority of these Parliaments in both the British andthe United States Zones would decide in favour of direct election.The French authorities would no doubt ensure that a decision infavour of indirect election was reached in their Zone, but therepresentatives -of this Zone would form only a small minority ofthe membership of the Assembly.(e) It was proposed that direct elections for the ConstituentAssembly should be conducted on the same basis as elections for theLand Parliaments. This system contained an element of propor-tionate representation, but it had so far worked fairly well. some ministers expressed anxiety lest the new German constitution shouldreproduce the central weakness of the Weimar Constitution whichhad so fostered the creation of a multiplicity of parties as to rendereffective government virtually impossible. Was it possible to ensurethe adoption of an electoral system which would not lead to the excessive fragmentation of political parties? The foreign secretary undertook to circulate a paper on this subject to theCabinet.(/) Ministers assumed that, if the French Governmentultimately declined to associate themselves with these constitutional proposals, the United Kingdom and United States governments would be free to revert to their original proposals for direct election to the Constituent Assembly. The Foreign Secretary undertook to reach a clear understanding on this point with the United StatesGovernment.(g) The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider whether theConstituent Assembly should be debarred from discussing the revision of the inter-Land boundaries.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 7 of CP. (48)134, regarding the policy to be pursued in respect of thefuture political structure of Germany.The Cabinet were informed of the agreement provisionallyreached for the establishment of international control over the ruhr industries. The French had found no support for their view that control should extend to the detailed management of particularfirms; and they had now agreed that international supervisionshould be exercised through a general control over the allocation of the production of the Ruhr industries. The provisional agree-ment contemplated the establishment of an international Authority(consisting of representatives of the United Kingdom, United States,France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and Germany) whichwould allocate between home consumption and export the produc-tion of coal, coke and steel by the Ruhr industries. During theperiod of military occupation this Authority would submit its recommendations to the Military Governors. Thereafter, theGerman Government would be responsible for giving effect to its decisions; and the Allied Governments would, if necessary, applysanctions to ensure that these decisions were carried out. Afterthe end of the military occupation this Authority could take overthe supervision of German disarmament, if no other international body were established for that purpose.
The following points were raised in discussion:-;(h) Although the agreement set no term for the duration ofthis international control, it clearly contemplated that it would continue after the end &quot;of the military occupation of Germany.(i) It would not be possible to include in this agreement any statement about the socialisation of the Ruhr industries. It had,however, been made clear throughout the conference that it remained the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government that the German people should be free, if they so desired, to bring the Ruhr industries under some form of public ownership. And there was in fact little doubtthat this issue would be pressed by the German trades unions.(j) It was important that the establishment of this control should not.be thought by the German people to be a purely punitivemeasure. For this reason it had been suggested that the agreement might include a statement to the effect that the Allied Powersregarded this as a first instalment in a general policy for co-ordinating the production of the principal industries of western europe. The Foreign Secretary said that such a declaration couldnot appropriately be included in the report of a conference limitedto the Powers concerned with the occupation of Germany; but the essence of this point was met by the statement, already includedin the draft agreement, that the work of the new Ruhr authority would be fully co-ordinated with that of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the proposals outlined in CP. (48) 134 fQr theestablishment of international control of the ruhr industries.The Cabinet were informed that the French Delegation had made it clear, at an early stage in the conference, that their con-currence in any recommendations made would be conditional upon their receiving satisfactory assurances that effective measures wouldbe taken to protect them against the threat of future German aggres-sion. The United States&apos; Government had been unexpectedly forth-coming in offering such assurances: As a result, it had been agreedthat United States forces would remain Germany until peace wassecured in Europe; that the occupation would last for a long period and that none of the western occupying Powers would withdrawits forces without first consulting the other Powers; that the Govern-ments concerned would consult together if any of them thought therewas a danger of the resurgence of German military power; andthat a Military Security Board would at once be established to assistthe Military Governors in enforcing the disarmament and demilita-risation of Germany.In discussion it was suggested that, if public opinion inGermany was not to be alienated, it might be expedient to modify the statement that &quot; the occupation would last for a long period.&quot;It might be preferable to refer to &quot; a considerable period.&quot; TheForeign Secretary undertook to consider this point.The Cabinet-(3) Took note with approval of the terms of the provisional agreement for providing security against future aggres-sion by Germany.SecurityagainstGermany.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,31st May, 1948.
