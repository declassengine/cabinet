35cm. 5 (48)        22Germany. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that, in accordance with the(Previous       policy outlined in CP. (48) 5, which the Cabinet had approved on reference:      8th January, the Military Governors of the British and UnitedC.M.(48)2nd    States Zones had now prepared a detailed scheme for extending theConclusions,    scope of the bizonal economic organisation at Frankfurt.    this minute 3.)&apos;    provided for the expansion of the Economic Council, the establish-ment of a Second Chamber to protect the interests of the land governments, and the creation of a small Administrative Committee.It had been made clear to the French Government that these arrangements would be temporary and that it would be open to themto put forward suggestions for their modification when the integra-tion of the three Western Zones came to be discussed. . The french foreign Minister had now accepted the draft of the announcement about this scheme, which was to be made to the Allied control council in Berlin on 20th January.The Cabinets-Took note with approval of the scheme for extending thescope of the bizonal economic organisation at Frankfurt.Cyrenaioa.(previous reference erence:CM. (47) 38thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CP. (48) 4) on the future administration of cyrenaica.This pointed out that, if the present state of uncertainty aboutthe future of the territory were prolonged, our good relations withthe local population would be endangered unless we adopted a more constructive policy for transferring to the people responsibility forthe management of their internal affairs. It was therefore proposedthat a start should be made, in consultation with local opinion, withrevising the existing constitution and machinery of administration and overhauling the present legal code. A new financial policy should also be formulated.The Cabinet endorsed the need for maintaining good relationswith the people of Cyrenaica, and agreed that this could best beachieved by pursuing a constructive and liberal policy and ensuring that our administration was efficient and acceptable. More rapid progress must now be made along these lines, in view of the decisionto transfer British troops from Palestine to Cyrenaica during the summer. An inter-departmental working party should prepare, for early consideration by Ministers, detailed proposals on the basis ofthe general recommendations made in paragraph 4 of CP. (48) 4.In discussion, the following points were made : (a) About 8,000 troops would be transferred from Palestine toCyrenaica by August next. The total niunber of British troops inthe territory might later rise to about 20.000. A substantial amountof accommodation would have to be built: and only a small part ofthe material required for this purpose could be provided locally.(&amp;) It should be possible to make available for Cyrenaica someofficers of the Colonial Service with special experience of administra-tion in Arab countries.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations contained in CP. (48) 4.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange for an inter-departmental working party to prepare detailed proposals on the basis of those recommendations, and tosubmit an interim report for early consideration by ministers.34849-2b 2
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (47) 336) seeking approval in principle of certain recommendations made by the Army and Air Force Courts-MartialCommittees of 1938 and 1946 regarding the appointment and func-tions of the Judge Advocate-General. In pursuance of these recommendations it was proposed that in future the Judge Advocate-General should be appointed on the recommendation of the LordChancellor and should be generally responsible to him. The judge advocate-General should also be relieved of responsibility for thepre-trial and prosecuting functions now carried out by his Militaryand Air Force Departments, and should be responsible only for thework at present undertaken by his Judicial Department and forgiving legal advice to the Secretaries of State. These changes couldnot be made immediately and, meanwhile, it was proposed to setup an official committee to work out the details.The Cabinet were informed that, if they so desired, the FirstLord of the Admiralty would be prepared to accept a correspondingchange in the method of appointment of the Judge Advocate of theFleet.The Cabinet-(1) Accepted in principle the recommendations of the Armyand Air Force Courts-Martial Committees of 1938 and1946, as summarised in paragraph 12 of CP. (47) 336.(2) Agreed that a corresponding change should be made in themethod of appointing the Judge Advocate of the Fleet,and invited the Lord Chancellor to take this matter up with the First Lord of the Admiralty.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (48) 18), covering the draft of a White Paper on theEast African Ground-nuts Scheme.This reported that the Government had made a start with thescheme, in advance of the setting up of the Overseas Food Corpora-tion, by employing the United Africa Company as managing agents.The progress of large-scale clearing operations in Tanganyika hadbeen delayed by difficulties in obtaining tractors and other equip-ment, by problems of maintenance, and by the intractable characterof the bush. The area cleared and planted for the 1948 crop would therefore be no more than 10,000 acres, as compared with the original estimate of 100,000 acres, and it would not be until 1949 that thescheme would make an appreciable contribution to our requirementsof oils and fats. As a result of the rise in world prices, the original estimates of the capital cost and annual operating cost of the scheme were now likely to be exceeded by  5,700,000 and  1,600,000respectively. On the other hand, the revenues of the scheme were also likely to be substantially above the original estimates inconsequence of comparable increases in the prices of its products.Ministers considered that an encouraging start had been madewith this project.  In discussion, the following points were made : -(a) Considerable dollar expenditure on equipment had been avoided by the use of surplus military stores. Thus, it was hoped to meet requirements for heavy tractors by the conversion of tanks.But it would be necessary to make extensive purchases of agri-cultural machinery from Massey-IIarris, Ltd., and this would involvedollar expenditure until the firm could build a factory in thiscountry. Special consideration was being given to the possibility of enabling the firm to do this.(b) The need for producing quick results had been fully kept inmind, but the most productive areas could not be developed untilnew railway and port facilities had been provided.(c) The scheme would not make a large-scale demand forfertilisers for some eighteen months.  Future procurement had been
carefully planned; and the prospects of developing the productionof fertilisers in Uganda were also being explored. The white paper should include a reference to the supply of fertilisers.(d) The operation of the scheme should be integrated with thegeneral plan of Colonial development.(e) The Ministry of Food should consider, in consultation withthe Treasury, the adequacy of the arrangements for local financial control.(/) The Minister of Food should hold a Press conference on thepublication of the White Paper, at which photographs illustratingthe scheme might be shown to the Press representatives.(g) Certain drafting amendments of the White Paper were suggested and approved.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the point noted in paragraph (c) above and to the drafting amendments noted in the discussion,the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (48) 18.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to arrange for the white paper, so amended, to be presented to Parliament.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theMinister of Food, respectively, to take up the points noted in paragraphs (d) and (e) above.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (47) 339) on certain proposals for a national war memorial which had been put forward by the War MemorialsAdvisory Council. This explained that in October 1947 the PrimeMinister had received representatives of the Council, who had urgedthat a site for a national war memorial should be earmarked and acommittee set up, with Government support, to collect subscriptionsand decide on the nature of the memorial. Subsequently, thePresident and Secretary of the Council had suggested to theMinister of Town and Country Planning that a Committee shouldbe appointed to consider whether there should be a national war memorial and, if so, what form it should take.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the suggestion thatthe Government should support the project for a memorial in theform of an open space round St. paul&apos;s. In favour of this it was urged that it would be fitting to place the memorial in an area whichhad been devastated during the war; that St. paul&apos;s was generally regarded as the mother church of the Empire; and that on aestheticgrounds it was desirable that there should be an open space around the Cathedral sufficiently large to enable the architectural meritof the building to be fully appreciated. On the other hand, mostMinisters were satisfied that there was no evidence of any effectivepublic demand for a national war memorial and that people livingoutside London, or even outside the City of London, would be reluctant to subscribe to a fund which would provide for the city of London an amenity in the form of an open space which the localauthority could itself provide under their planning powers. It wasalso pointed out that if the Government gave their support to anysuch project they would probably be forced to subscribe on a poundfor pound basis.Other points in discussion were : (a) If it were decided to proceed with a national war memorialin the form of an open space in London, there was probably more tobe said for a Westminster precinct than for an open space at st.. paul&apos;s, but the main objections felt by Ministers applied equally to the Westminster project.(6) By adding to the Cenotaph in Whitehall the dates of theSecond World War, the Government had given a lead against
commemorating by separate memorials those who had fallen in that war.  It would be inexpedient to deviate now from that policy.(c) No encouragement should be given to the provision of local war memorials in the form of statues or buildings.The Cabinet- Agreed that the suggestions made by the War MemorialsAdvisory Council for the appointment of a National war memorial Committee should be rejected.Parliament.electoral reform.(previous reference:CM. (47)96thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-tary (CP. (48) 3) covering the scheme submitted to him unofficiallyby the Boundary Commission for dividing into two-member constituencies the eight boroughs mentioned in the footnote to paragraph 25 of CP. (47) 333, and indicating the modifications inthe representation proposed for other constituencies which wouldprobably have to be made if such a scheme were adopted. Thememorandum pointed out that, if these boroughs were made into two-member constituencies, it would be difficult to resist claims for additional representation from three boroughs with electorates of79,821, 79,818 and 79,587 respectively, and from five dividedboroughs which, under the Boundary Commission^ recommenda-tions, would have an average electorate per constituency of about70,000. If these claims were conceded, the effect would be toincrease the total number of constituencies and to disturb the balanceof representation which the Commission had sought to achievebetween urban and rural areas and between London and the rest ofthe country. The Home Secretary therefore recommended that the representation of the People Bill as introduced should give effectwithout modification to the recommendations made by the boundary commission in their report.The Lord President said that be was convinced that when theBill came before Parliament the Government would be driven to concede two seats to each of these eight boroughs, and once they hadyielded on this point it would be virtually impossible to resist other demands for changes, with the result that the whole scheme of redistribution would be jeopardised. It would therefore be preferable to include in the Bill as introduced amended proposalscovering not only these boroughs but also other areas, such asBradford, where the Commission^ proposals seemed to be indefensible. The Government would then be on much strongerground in resisting pressure from Parliament to make other changes.So long as rural areas received representation adequate to thescattered nature of their electorates, he could see no reason againstsome change in the proportion of borough members to rural members,nor did he think that the addition of three or four members to the representation of the County of London would be objectionable.The modifications that he had in mind would not make the totalnumber of Members of the House of Commons excessive if allowancewere made for the abolition of the university franchise.The Minister of Health said that it would have been preferable to defer any proposals for the redistribution of Parliamentary seatsuntil there had been a reorganisation of local government areas.If, however, the Government were committed to proceeding withredistribution in the present Session, the least objectionable courseseemed to be to adopt the Boundary Commission^ recommendationswithout modification.The Chief Whip said that, whether the Boundary Commission^recommendations were included in the Bill unchanged or with modifications, it seemed most desirable that the Government shouldresist any pressure in Parliament to amend the proposals scheduledto the Bill. This course could be defended on the ground that thescheme of distribution could be adjusted subsequently by parliament on further recommendations from the Boundary Commission.
39CM. 5 (418)After further discussion it appeared that it was the general view of the Cabinet that the Government would be in a stronger position if the Bill as introduced reflected the recommendations ofthe Boundary Commission unchanged. This would not precludethem from modifying these recommendations while the Bill was before Parliament if, in the course of the proceedings on the Bill,it was made clear that changes were favoured by majority opinion inParliament. If the recommendations of the Commission were to beset aside, it was preferable that Parliament rather than the Govern-ment should assume the responsibility for doing so.The Lord President said that he was satisfied that changes would have to be made and he still thought it preferable that theseshoidd be made before the Bill was introduced.The Cabinet-Reaffirmed their decision that the initial report of the boundary Commission for England should be scheduled tothe Representation of the People Bill without modification.Parliament.Amendmentof the parliament act.(previous reference:CM. (48) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (48) 20),submitted by the Lord Privy Seal in pursuance of the request made atthe Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion on 6th January, indicating the lines on which he proposed to reply, in the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Lords on the Parliament Bill, to the suggestion that theGovernment should join with other political parties in consideringproposals for reforming the constitution of the House of Lords.&quot;This stated that Viscount Samuel had placed on the order paper of the House of Lords a Question asking &apos;&apos; whether theGovernment had been able to give further consideration to the advisability of summoning a conference of representatives of thethree parties in this House to examine the question of the constitu-tion of the House of Lords.&quot; It was known that both ViscountSamuel and the Marquess of Salisbury would raise this matter whenthe Second Reading of the Parliament Bill was debated, and theLord Privy Seal would then be obliged to make some statement onthe matter.In discussion the point was made that nothing should be saidto commit the Government to the view that a reformed House ofLords could safely be left with the powers which would be exercisable by the existing House of Lords after the current Parlia-ment Bill had become law. It was also agreed that the Governmentshould not be committed to entering upon discussions of the reform of the House of Lords unless the Parliament Bill was passed into law in the present Session.Subject to these points, the Cabinet agreed that in the debate on the Second Reading of the Parliament Bill in the House of Lordsan assurance might be given that the Government were willing toexamine, with representatives of the other political parties, thequestion of the constitution of the House of Lords.The Cabinet-Agreed that in the debate on the Second Reading of the parliament Bill in the House of Lords the Lord Privy Sealmight make a statement in the following terms : &quot; TheGovernment have given careful consideration to thequestion of the noble Marquess, Lord Salisbury, and to thatin similar terms of the noble Viscount, Lord Samuel, ofwhich previous notice has been given. The government regard the passing of this Bill in the form now before theHouse, or with any agreed amendments, as essential. when this has been done, they would be willing at a later stage in this Session to discuss, without prejudice on either side,the issues raised in the&apos;noble Marquess&apos;s question.&quot;
CivilAviation.procedure for OrderingAircraft.(previous reference:C.M.(48)4thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (48) 21) reporting the conclusions of the ministerial committee on the Socialisation of Industries on the procedure forordering aircraft for the airways corporations.The Committee, after hearing the views of the Ministers ofSupply and Civil Aviation, had reached the conclusion that it was too early to consider any major change in the organisation set upby the Civil Aviation Act, 1946. They had, however, agreed thatthe three airways corporations should at once set up an aircraftprocurement agency which would ensure that they all formulateda single set of requirements for basic types of aircraft for commonuse. They also recommended that the procedure for orderingaircraft (including designs and prototypes) for civil aviation shouldbe the subject of further enquiry by a small independent committeeincluding one or two persons with business and accountingexperience. Care should, however, be taken, when announcing theappointment of this Committee, to avoid language which would commit the Government to publishing the Committee&apos;s report.The Cabinet&apos;&quot;s discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthe proposed enquiry should be undertaken by a committee or by asingle individual. It was agreed that the aim should be to avoidhaving to publish the findings of the enquiry, and from this pointof view it might be preferable that it should be undertaken by asingle individual. On the other hand, the subject was one on whichindividuals were inclined to hold, or to develop, strong personal views; and a more balanced view might be obtained from a small committee of three persons. An enquiry by more than one personmight also command greater confidence with the aircraft industry,the airways corporations and the public. It would assist theGovernment in resisting demands for publication of the findings if,instead of announcing the appointment of a formal committee ofenquiry, the Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Lords said that the Government were taking steps to secureindependent advice on this question by calling into consultation oneor more persons with business experience to assist them in con-sidering the relations between the aircraft industry, the airways corporations and the Government Departments concerned in theordering of aircraft for civil aviation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that for the time being there should be no radical change in the general structure of the organisationestablished by the Civil Aviation Act, 1946.(2) Invited the Minister of Civil Aviation to arrange for thethree airways corporations to appoint an aircraftprocurement agency to co-ordinate the formulation of requirements for basic types of civil aircraft.(3) Agreed in principle that an independent enquiry should beheld into the procedure for ordering aircraft (includingdesigns and prototypes) for civil aviation; and took note that the Prime Minister would determine, after consulta-tion with the Lord President and the Ministers ofSupply and Civil Aviation, the precise form and scopeof this enquiry and the terms in which the intention tohold it might be announced by the Minister of CivilAviation in the debate in the House of Lords on21st January.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,19th January, 1948.
