ParliamentJ.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons.economic affairs.(Previous!reference.:CM. (48)83rdConclusions,Minute 6.)Man-Power.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of exchequer (CP. (48) 146) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were raised in discussion : The numbers in civil employment continued to rise, and thenumber of registered unemployed was still below 300,000. Butprogress in expanding the labour force of the under-manned indus-tries was slow. In June, 1939, these industries had employed 16-8per cent, of pur total manTpower : the corresponding figure in June,1946, liad been 16 per cent., in June, 1947, 15-5 per cent., and inApril, 1948, only 15-7 per cent! One of the main difficulties inredistributing the labour force was the shortage of living accom-jnodatiqn in the areas where the additional labour was required.It was, however, becoming increasingly important to ensure that additional labour was not only required, but could be absorbed,before new living accommodation was provided. Thus, the balanceof the emergency hostel programme had now to be shifted away from the textile areas, where foreign labour could not readily be absorbed, into the coal-mining areas, where foreigners could now beemployed.. Was there perhaps a similar risk that too many houses were being built in rural areas? The Cabinet were assured thatfarm workers would be available to occupy all the houses that couldbe built in rural areas for some time to come. For, in addition tothe need to relieve the general overcrowding in rural areas, it was desirable that, as houses became available, farm-workers now living in hostels and employed in gangs should be transferred to individualemployment on farms.. The labour force in the building industry had increased andby the end of the year was likely to exceed the target figure by200,000. Ministers should consider shortly what limits should beset for the building industry in 1949.Production. The coal situation was somewhat disquieting. Production hadnot risen, and there had been an increase in domestic consumption.Morepyer, the production of large coal was not sufficient to meet thedemands,of the home and export markets. The Minister of Fuel and power said that total production was now running at a rateexceeding by 300,000 tons a week the output of the correspondingperiod of 1947. And, although the year s output of deep-minedcoal might fall short of the target by 3 million tons, the output of open-cast coal was likely to exceed the target figure by about thesame amount. He had opened his discussions with the NationalUnion of Mineworkers. They were willing to make further efforts to secure the working of longer stints; but they saw no prospect of persuading the men to work an extra half-hour each day in placeof Saturday working. The high oyerseas demand for large coal was mainly due to the fact that European countries were receiving largequantities of small and unscreened coal from the United States;and it was desirable that the United States Government should be pressed to reduce their exports of this type of coal. The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that he would make representations about this to the London representative of the Economic Co-operation;    Administrator.Was enough being done to improve managerial efficiency in industry and to ensure that industry generally applied the resultsof; research ? The Cabinet were informed that much was being done,and that among the younger men there was a growing consciousness, pf the need tor adopting improved methods of management; but it, would be some time before these efforts began to show practical/A,.-   results..35672-5 b 2
external trade.Balance ofPayments.FinancialNegotiationswith Indiaand Pakistan.In May our exports by volume had been 140 per cent, above the1938 level, as compared with 132 per cent, in April. This expansionof exports was, however, more than offset by the increase in theprices of our imports. In conditions of world shortage, there was a natural tendency for the prices of our imports to rise disproportionate-tionately to the prices of our exports. For food and raw materialswere everywhere in demand, whereas much of our export trade wasin articles whose purchase could be postponed or dispensed with.Moreover, much of our current exports, e.g., of machinery, had been ordered some years before at the lower prices then ruling. Andin other lines, e.g., textiles, competition now prevented us from increasing our prices. There seemed to be little prospect of any sub-stantial fall in world food prices, even with good harvests; and itwas to be remembered that our imports of food from the Argentinecould not again be financed by the sale of capital assets.Substantial progress had been made in readjusting the geographical distribution of our imports and exports with a viewto reducing our adverse balance of payments with the western hemisphere-sphere. In the period February/ April, 1947, 50 per cent, of our imports had been drawn from the western hemisphere, 31-9 percent, from sterling area countries and 18 -1 per cent, from othercountries. In the corresponding period of 1948 only 34-9 per cent,of our imports had come from the western hemisphere, 38 per cent,from sterling area countries and 27 -1 per cent, from other countries.In the first period only 16-4 per cent, of our exports had gone tothe western hemisphere, 47-5 per cent, to sterling area countries and 36 -1 per cent, to other countries. The corresponding figures forthe second period were 17-7 per cent, to the western hemisphere,49-9 per cent, to the sterling area countries and 32-4 per cent, toother countries.The net drain on our reserves of gold and dollars had totalledonly  41 million in the two months of April and May; but we had drawn about  40 million in gold in the last ten days, and the total net drain for June was likely to be between  70 and  80 million.Thus, the total net drain for the first half of 1948 would be over 250 million, as compared with the estimate of  220 million. Forthe second half of that period we could expect repayment of about 80 million under the European Recovery Programme. We should thus be left with a net deficit of about  170 million for the first halfof 1948. If the total drain on our reserves, and our receipts underthe European Recovery Programme, continued at the same rate, weshould be drawing down our reserves at the rate of about  25 million a quarter. This was far more than we could afford; and the cabinet were warned that they would shortly have to consider, on their examination of the import programme, what adjustments should bemade to meet this situation.Little progress was being made in the current negotiationsregarding the sterling balances of India and Pakistan. The Indiannegotiators evidently recognised that it would be a long time before these balances could be repaid in full, and they were content thatfor the present the greater part should remain blocked at an interestrate of J per cent. They were, however, asking that as much as 250 million should be released over the next three years, and thathalf of this should be made available in dollars. They were pressingthis request in spite of the fact that on their present programmesthey clearly had no immediate need of sterling to finance their current purchases from the sterling area; for they were steadilyaccumulating sterling in their current transactions and now had a credit balance of about  90 million on current account. The Missionwere evidently acting within narrow instructions from their Govern-ment and had little latitude for making concessions in negotiation:and in these circumstances it seemed unlikely that any agreement would be reached. But, if no agreement were reached and Indiasought to use her sterling balances for dollar purchases, the onlysanction which we could invoke would be to compel her to withdraw from the sterling area; and that would have grave disadvantagesfor ourselves.
The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (48) 146 and of the points raised in thethe discussion.International 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by  theWheat Minister of Food (CP. (48) 150) proposing that His Majesty&apos;s agreement. Government should now ratify the International Wheat Agreement(Previous (Cmd. 7382) which had been signed on their behalf on 6th May, 1948.Reference: The effect of the Agreement was to require importing countries,CM. (47) 37th if called on, to buy in each of the next five crop years prescribedConclusions, quantities of wheat amounting in all to 500 million bushels, should minute 7.) tne price fall to a figure ranging from $1-50 a bushel in 1948/49 to$1-10 in 1952/53 : in return, exporting countries guaranteed tosell the same amount in these years, at a maximum price of $2 abushel. It was expected that most of the parties to the Agreement,including the Commonwealth countries, would ratify it, though itwas possible that the United States would fail to do so, in which event His Majesty&apos;s Government would be able to withdraw. TheAgreement did not cover Russia or the Argentine and it was im-possible to forecast how the prices for their wheat would move;but the good harvest prospects this year, coupled with the increasein rice supplies, should result in some fall in the present highwheat prices. The Agreement would make no immediate difference to the United Kingdom balance of payments, since most of our wheatimports were supplied under long-term contracts, but it should beof benefit to us in the long run.The Cabinet Agreed   that   the   International   Wheat   Agreement(Cmd. 7382) should be ratified.Civil Service 4.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theSuperannua- Exchequer (CP. (48) 148) covering a memorandum by the Treasurytion. outlining a scheme for providing pensions for widows and orphansof civil servants and for improving the pensions of civil servantsretired through ill health after short service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was proposed togive effect to this scheme in a Superannuation Bill which had been included in the provisional legislative programme for 1948/49. Thescheme would cover the Foreign Service as well as the Home Service.He suggested that the proposals in the Treasury memorandum should be modified so as to give an option to enter the scheme toestablished civil servants who had been in Civil Service employmentafter 8th May, 1945, and to enable single persons of either sex to nominate a dependent relative who would receive the same benefitsas those proposed for widows. The scheme would not be contributory,but the additional benefits proposed would be partly offset by areduction of one-third in the lump sums which under the existingcode were payable to civil servants on their retirement and it was estimated that the cost to the Exchequer would eventually rise toabout  3-25 million a year! The proposals constituted, in his view,a long overdue reform designed to remove a defect which made theCivii Service a worse employer than a considerable body of othercomparable employers, and he commended it to his colleagues.The following points were made in discussion : (a) The adoption of the scheme proposed would lead to claims for comparable treatment from other classes, such as teachers, localGovernment officers and members of the Armed Forces. It would beimpossible to bring the teachers&apos; superannuation scheme into linewithout a relatively lengthy actuarial investigation, and in the interval there would be some ill-feeling among teachers, who were already aggrieved by the refusal to recognise for superannuation pur-&apos; poses their period of compulsory military service before entering the
teaching profession. Further inquiries would also be necessary before an estimate could be made of the cost of giving similarbenefits to local government officers, but it was estimated that itwould cost  1 million a year to bring the National Health Servicesuperannuation scheme into line. As regards the Armed Forces,there would undoubtedly be claims for comparable benefits for the dependants of men under the rank of warrant officer.(b) Though civil servants would in fact be making some contri-bution towards the new benefits proposed in that there would be areduction in the lump sums payable to them on retirement, it wouldbe difficult to convince the public that this made the scheme a con-tributory one in the accepted meaning of this term; and there was a danger that the introduction of a scheme of this kind, shortly afterthe coming into force of the National Insurance scheme, woulddiscredit the level of the benefits provided by the latter and make itdifficult to maintain the principle that childless able-bodied widowsunder forty should not be entitled to pension. The Government had recently had to insist that the proposed scheme of supplementaryinjuries benefits for miners should provide for substantial contribu-tions from the workers, and they would be in a difficult position ifthey now adopted for the Civil Service a scheme of additional benefits, in the form of pensions for widows and orphans, which did not clearly provide for a substantial contributory element. Thedifficulties of grafting a contributory scheme on to the existing non-contributory Civil Service code were not thought to be insuperable;and it was suggested that a scheme might be devised under whichthe proposed deduction from the lump sums payable on retirementmight be commuted to an annual payment.(c) Though it was reasonable that the Civil Service should notlag behind other employers, there might be criticism of the intro-duction of proposals giving civil servants markedly favourable treatment at a time when the general policy of the Governmentaimed at preventing an undue rise in income levels. The cabinet should be given more information about the extent to which benefitssimilar to those proposed for civil servants were provided forcorresponding workers in private industry.(d) The question of extending the proposed scheme to Colonialcivil servants who were partly paid by the United kingdom excequer should be considered.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Treasury should consider, in consultationwith the other Departments concerned, (i) what claims from other classes for comparable treatment would haveto be met if benefits on the scale proposed were providedfor widows, orphans and dependants of civil servants and for civil servants retired through ill-health aftershort service, and what additional burden would thereby be thrown on the Exchequer and the rates; and (ii) what modifications could be made in the proposed scheme inorder to maintain the principle that insurance benefitsadditional to those provided under the National Insur-ance scheme should be made available only as part ofsupplementary schemes involving substantial contribu-tions from the workers concerned;(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit a further report to the Cabinet in the light of this furtherconsideration of the scheme.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th June, 1948
