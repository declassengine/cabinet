Prime Minister (CP. (h5)  272) Indicating the line which he- proposed to take in his forthcoming discussions withter.notio.nal President Truman and Mr. Mackenzie King about the inter-ntrol.       -   national control of atomic energy,TEE PRIME MINISTER said that his general thesis,which was outlined in paragraph 2 of his memorandum, wasthat power politics,  though they might for a time produce- on uneasy equilibrium, were bound to lead in the end to a violent clash of interests and to war; and that the only hope for world peace was that all should lay aside; nationalistic ideas ana strive without reservation to bringabout an international relationship in which war was entirely ruled out.      The -realisation of the destructive-power of the atomic bomb might,  he hoped,  have brought the peoples of the world into a condition of mind in which theywere more ready than ever before to recognise the validity of this general thesis.      We ought therefore to grasp this opportunity of establishing on a firm foundation an effective world organisation with both the will and thepower to preserve peace.The Prime Minister said that he was satisfied,  forthe reasons outlined in his memorandum,  that &apos;it would notbe enough to rely on an international convention regulating the use of the atomic bomb.     Nor was there any hope thatthe secret of its manufacture could be confined to a fewpeace-loving nations-.      The scientific basis of the discovery was already a matter of general knowledge:    and within a few years its manufacture would be within thereach of a number of countries.      He therefore proposed thatin the forthcoming discussions the issue should be squarelyfaced that there was no prospect of controlling the use ofthis new weapon unless we succeeded in establishing an effective world organisation with both the will and thepower effectively to preserve peace.There was general agreement with the views expressed by the Prime Minister.      Discussion turned mainly on the question of shoring with Russia, not only thefundamental scientific knowledge,  but also the practical&quot;know how&quot; relating to the manufacture of the atomic bomb.In paragraph 10 (f) of CP. (1+5)  272 it wassuggested that an immediate offer to share this information with the Soviet Government would not be likelyto lord them to change their present attitude to. worldproblems and might be regarded as a confession of weakness.It was therefore proposed that the establishment of better relations should precede the exchange of technical information.      Russia would,  in any event, be able to manufacture atomic bombs within a few years; and it wasduring those years that an attempt must be made.to build a world &quot;organisation upon  the abandonment of power politics.

. Some Ministers thought it would &quot;bo wiser to moke onimmediate offer to disclose this information.to the SovietGovernment.     The true basis &apos;of lasting peace was mutual confidence between nations;    and we should not only declare that as the objective of our&apos;policy, but be ready to takerisks in creating that sense of confidence.      If it was our policy to build world peace on a moral foundation, rather thanon a balance of power, we should be prepared to apply that principle at once in relation to the atomic bomb.      There wasa real risk that the Soviet Government would be unwilling toco-operate whole-heartedly in. the establishment of an effective world organisation so long as the British and UnitedStates Governments insisted on keeping to themselves thesecrets of manufacture of the, atomic &quot;bomb.      It was true thatthe Soviet Government were not at present fully co-operativein world affairs;    but. that was due in large measure to theirsuspicion of the western democracies.      This attitude was founded to some extent on their pre-war experiences:    the urgent need now was to remove the causes for that attitudeof suspicion.      There wss much to be said for offering fulldisclosure of this secret, but linking that offer withdiscussions of the means of co-operating in the establishmentof an effective world organisation.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thought it wouldbe a mistake to attempt to deal with the atomic bomb in isolation from other weapons.      Other countries might even now be following up scientific discoveries in other directionswhich might be turned to war-like uses.      He suggested that,in the forthcoming discussions, the Prime Minister shouldexplore the possibility of remitting to the United NotionsOrganisation,  as soon as it was established,  the task of devising suitable machinery for the full disclosure and exchange between all members of the Organisation of the resultof all scientific research including that which had a bearing on the development of new weapons of war.      international machinery for the exchange of such information might be developed by an extension of the war-time agreements betweenthe principal Allied powers.      It would be necessary that a staff of highly qualified scientists should be attached tothe Organisation for this purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER welcomed the Foreign Secretary&apos;suggestion.      He pointed out that,  in considering disclosure of the secret of manufacture of the atomic bomb,  it wasnecessary to have regard to other countries than Russia.A proposal on the lines indicated by the Foreign Secretarycould,  however, be brought forward to supplement the points made in paragraph 10 (fj of C.P.(us)  272 which dealt, notwith, our ultimate objectives, but merely with the situation,which we faced in the immediate future.

Other points raised in the discussion were:(a) In planning the new World Organisation we shouldprofit by experience of the League of Nations-.     Whilelasting peace must be built on international good-willand mutual confidence,  there must be the power to dealpromptly and effectively with any nation which threatenedthe peace of the world.      Effective sanctions must be devised, and there must be the will to use them.(b) THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY suggested that the argument, outlined in paragraph 10 (d) of CP. (45) 272,against the conclusion 03? a special convention regarding the atomic bomb was not fully consistent with some of thearguments used in paragraph 6 of the memorandum.      he hoped that the Prime Minister would not altogether exclude the possibility of an international convention renouncingthe use of the atomic bomb-.      Such conventions had somerestraining influence, as was shown by the fact that poisongas had not been used in this war.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his view it was notthe international convention which had prevented the use ofpoison gas in this war.      Nor did he believe that nations,once committed to war, would be deterred by reason only ofan international convention from using any weapon whichthey thought to afford the only means by which they couldgain their ends.      He did not, however, exclude thepossibility of a convention regarding the atomic bomb;The point which he was concerned to make in his memorandum was that it would not be enough to rely merely on theconclusion of an international convention.      The realsafeguard must be the creation of an effective world organisation for the preservation of peace.(c) THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY thought it would be inexpedient to stress the argument, used in paragraph 6 (c)of the memorandum, regarding Britain&apos;s peculiarvulnerability to attack by atomic bomb.      It should not be forgotten that the failure to enforce sanctions against italy under the League of Nations had been mainly due tothe fact that France was specially sensitive to the vulnerability of her territory to counter-measures by Italy.(d) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that it seemed to him unlikely that future hostilities would openby the use of atomic bombs by an aggressor Power.      A more likely situation was that a Power possessing atomic bombswould threaten to use them against a smaller Power unlessits demands were met.-      In such a situation other powers could do nothing to protect the threatened nation;    and could only open hostilities against the threatening Power.&quot;We had been unable to do anything to protect Poland in1939:    we could only declare war on Germany,The view was expressed that this difficulty could best be met by a system of general exchange of information about the development of new weapons.      Such a system should make it impossible for a nation to embark upon acourse of aggression fortified by the knowledge that itpossessed superior weapons which other countries had had no opportunity to develop.

(e) In this natter of the atomic bomb tension had arisen between the United States and Soviet Governments-We should seek to act as mediators and should let our views be known to the world.      We might by this meansrally around us the nations who feared the consequences of growing estrangement between the- United States and theSoviet Union.      There would be advantages if the PrimeMinister could let it be known that it was he who had taken the initiative in bringing about the forthcoming discussions in Washington.(f) The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s view thatit would be preferable not to put forward any specific agenda,or submit any document, for the forthcoming discussions in washington.The Cabinet:Endorsed, subject to the points notedabove, the general line taken in the aide memo ire (CP. (1+5)  272) which thePrime Minister had prepared for thepurpose of his forthcoming discussions on the international control of atomic energy.Cabinet Office, S.W..1. ,8th November, 1945.-h-
