(45)  60TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(6th December, 1945    -   10.0 a.m.)FOREIGN THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that heAFFAIRS had learned towards the end of November that theUnited States Secretary of State, Mr, Byrnes, had proposed suggested to M. Molotov that there should be anMeeting of early meeting in Moscow of the Foreign MinistersForeign of the United States,  the United Kingdom and theMinisters Soviet Union.      The subjects for discussion atthis meeting had not been stated;    but uponenquiry he had ascertained that Mr. Byrnes had inmind an agenda including (i)    procedure of theproposed Commission which was to submit to theUnited Nations recommendations for the international control of atomic energy;    (ii)    procedure forreconvening the Council of Foreign Ministers .andfor securing the prompt resumption of work bytheir Deputies on the preparation of Peace Treaties;(iii)    terms of reference for the proposed allied military Committee in Tokyo;    and (iv)    establishmentof an independent Government in Korea.The Foreign Secretary said that he haddoubted whether it would be expedient for the threeForeign Ministers to meet at this stage - havingregard, in particular, to the difficulties whichhad arisen from the attempt to exclude France and china from the work of the Council of foreign ministers, and to the suspicions which might bearoused if the Foreign Ministers of the three powers appeared to be prejudging matters which W6reto be discussed at the General Assembly of theUnited Nations in January.      We should certainlyincrease our difficulties with the French government if matters of concern to them were discussed at ameeting of Foreign Ministers at which they were not represented.He had put these considerations toMr.. Byrnes.      He was, however,  in some difficulty,for the suggestion of a meeting had already beenmade to M. Molotov, and it now seemed that Mr. Byrneswas determined to go to Moscow, if necessary alone.In all the circumstances the Foreign Secretaryfelt that he now had no alternative but to agree toattend the proposed meeting.      He proposed, however,

w1to make it clear to Mr. Byrnes that his agreement was conditional upon the understanding that thiswould be an exploratory meeting, designed toenable the three Foreign Ministers to ascertainand examine the difficulties between their governments before the General Assembly of theUnited Nations in January, and&apos; to exchange viewson the international control of atomic energy.He would also make it clear that he was notprepared to discuss matters which concerned theFrench Government,  at a meeting at which france was not represented,  and that this would preclude -any formal proposal at the outset to discuss thequestion of reconvening the Council of foreign ministers.The Cabinet agreed that in thecircumstances described the foreign secretary should indicate his willingness to attend the proposed meeting in Moscow on the understandingthat the discussions would be limited in the manner which he had indicated.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,  before any announcement was made about this meeting, hewould wish to obtain Mr. Byrnes&apos;  agreement to theconditions which he had outlined,  and he would alaodesire that both he and Mr. Byrnes should give an assurance to  the French Government that mattersdirectly concerning France would not be discussed at this meeting.      When both these points had been cleared,  an announcement could be made inParliament, possibly in reply to a Private notice question by Mr.  Eden.Cabinet Office, S.W.  1,
