(1+5)  57TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE confidential Annex( 29th November,  1945 - 11.0 a.m.)discussions onfinancialquestions opcommercialpolicy(previous reference:CM. (45) 50thConclusions)the memoranda -Cabinet had before them the followingCP. (1+5) 312:CP. (1+5) 297:CP. (i+5) 295:by the Chancellor of the exchequer covering the draft of a financialagre ement;by the President of the Board ofTrade covering the text of theUnited States proposals on commercial policy and the draft of a statement which the President proposed to mak.g inParliament,  subject to a satisfactory conclusion of the financial side ofthe negotiations;by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, reporting the attitude ofDominion Governments towards thediscussions on commercial policy^THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that thedraft annexed to CP. (i+5) 312 had not been approved bythe United States Government^ but represented the best that our negotiators were likely to be able to segurseIt would,therefore, be essential to give them freedom to make concessions on particular points, provided thgffethey did not depart substantially from the proposals set out in the draft.      He drew particular attentionto the following points:-(i) Amount of the credit.It was not yet certain that the United StatesGovernment would agree to extend to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment a credit of as much as fiki billions and,although our negotiators would try to obtain the full amount, we might have to be content with $1+ billions^It seemed likely that $750 millions of this amount^-and not $500 millions, as we had previously hoped, wouldhave to be set aside for the liquidation of Lend-Lease*(

(ii) Purpose of the Credit.Paragraph 2(11)  of the draft agreement,which provided that drawings on the credit should notexceed the United Kingdom overall cumulative adverse balance of current payments, had been proposed by theUnited States negotiators because of their fear ofcriticisms in Congress that the sole object of theagreement was to get the sterling area out of its present difficulties.    While he would prefer&apos;to omit thisprovision, it was not likely to cause any serious trouble.(iii) Waiver and postnonement of payment.There was good reason to hope  that theUnited States Government would agree to paragraph h(l),which provided for waiving the interest and postponing the repayment of the amount of principal due in any year in which the income of the United Kingdom from home produced exports,  together with its net income frominvisible current transactions, was less  than the amountof United Kingdom imports during 1936/38-    Our negotiatorshad resisted a proposal which would have given theUnited States Government the  right to audit our financial transactions, but had been compelled to agreeto paragraph h(ll), which imposed on His Majesty&apos;aGovernment the obligation not to avail themselves of theprovision for waiver and postponement except after-taking due account of the prospective and actuallyprevailing conditions of international exchange andthe adequacy of their ava.ila.ble reserves, as well as of the rate at which obligations to other creditors wereto be met.    Although this last requirement might conceivablygive the United States Government grounds for arguing that we wore discharging our obligations to othercreditors too quickly,  it was much more likely to operate in our favour, since it would enable us to point toobligations    lready incurred to other creditors as a reasonfor postponing our payments to the United States.(iv) Sterling area exchange arrangements.Paragraph 6 bound Ris Majesty&apos;s Government toproceed, not later than the end of 191+6,  to make arrangements under which sterling receipts from currenttransactions would be freely available in any currencyarea without discrimination,  and at the same time to seek,by voluntary agreement with the countries of the sterling area, a settlement under which   the   accumulated balanceswould be disposed of in one or other of the threeways set out in paragraph 6(11).    Thus, we were merelyundertaking to carry out, without committing ourselves,to an absolutely rigid time limit for completion,,  thenegotiations which it had always been our intentionto undertake with the sterling area countries.

(v) Exchange arrangements between the United States and&quot;the United&quot;&quot;.KingdomThe provisions of paragraph 7 had been carefullydesigned to enable His Majesty&apos;s Government to impose&quot;restrictions on the movement of capital and bound theGovernment only to refrain from imposing restrictions on current transactions.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE said that a difficult point arose on paragraph 7(11) of the draft agreement, which provided that,  if either the UnitedKingdom or the United States imposed quantitative traderestrictions as an aid to the restoration of equilibriumin the balance of payments,  such restrictions should be administered on a basis which did not discriminate againstimports from the other country in respect of any product.If this provision were read alone,  it might tie our handstoo much, and it was,  therefore, essential that our negotiators should obtain a written undertaking from theUnited States Government that paragraph 7(ll) was to bginterpreted in the light of the provisions with regard toquantitative trade restrictions and to State tracking in sections C and E of the American commercial policyproposals set out in Annex G to CP. (45:)  297.      If we obtained an undertaking of this kind we should not be precluded from continuing, for example,  to purchaseparticular products from cur Dominions or Colonies inaccordance with long-standing trade arrangements,  eventhough the United States Government were in a position tomake us an occasional offer of supplies of the same productat a lower price.The following points arose in discussion:-(a) Was there not a risk that the undertaking inparagraph 6 that current earnings would be made available,in due course for current transactions would be detrimental to this country since  it would throw open the UnitedStates market to sterling area countries?THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER pointed out tha%,unless we were able to make some relaxation of therestrictions on the use of sterling balances,  there was little hope of our being able to maintain the coherence ofthe sterling group,  some of the countries in which wergalready showing signs of a desire to breakaway.(b) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA, pointed out that,whereas paragraph 6(l) merely bound His Maje sty&apos;sGovernment to proceed to make arrangements for the releaseof sterling receipts from current transactions not later than the end of 1946,  the United Kingdom negotiators were of opinion that we were pledged by earlier undertakings, tocomplete the release of these receipts by the end of 1946.It would,  in his view,  be unfortunate if,  through ourinsistence on the form of words &quot;given in the draft,  the.chance of reaching agreement at an early date were to be lost.(c) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES askedwhether the proposals in paragraph 6(Il)(c) for writing offsterling balances would apply to balances held by Colonies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that  suchbalances - would be covered and it would be necessary toenter unto negotiations with representatives of theColonies on this matter in due course.

(a)  THE CHANCELLOR 01&apos; THE EXCHEQUER undertook toconsidor whether paragraph 6(11)(C)  should notrather refer to an &quot;adjustment&quot; of balances than to the&quot;writing offi; of balances,. *(e) THE MINISTER OP EDUCATION asked whether therewas not a danger that the undertaking in paragraph 7not to apply exchange restrictions to payments ortransfers arising out of current transactions betweenthe United Kingdom and the United States would enablecapital sums to be sent from this country to the UnitedStates under the guise of revenue, Cog.   through thepayment of excessive salaries to United States residentsin this country.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatthe risk of any such evasion was negligible.(f) THE MINISTER OP HEALTH asked whether theprovisions  of Section E of the American commercial policy proposals would prevent His Majesty&apos;s government from establishing now State, monopolies of particularproductsA   Under paragraph 2 of this Section a new Statemonopoly would be prohibited if it created a greaterprotective margin than the tariff that might have been negotiated in relation to  the product concerned.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP. TRADE said thatthe proposals would not preclude the creation of new state monopolies but were merely designed to preventGovernments from nullifying through the creation ofState monopolies reductions in tariffs to which theyhad agreed in negotiation^The Cabinet then considered whether the.proposals set out in Cop, (Ado) 312 should be generally approved,THE MINISTER OP FUEL AND POWER said thathe was still strongly of opinion that it would be a mistake to accept the proposals A which were, in his view, incompatible with the successful operation of a planned economy in this country and would ruin our export trade.-    It was wrong to assume that all theadvantage lay with the United States Government, since their need to export would place them in an impossible position if we refused to come to an agreement withthem on their terms..    It would be better for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to borrow from the United States,at 3, h or even 5 per cent than to accept the conditionsattaching to the credit which had been offered.,particularly since this involved His Majesty&apos;s* Governmentin supporting commercial policy proposals whichwere, in his view, objectionable.    In any event, itwas desirable that those members of the Cabinet whohad not been constantly in touch with the progressof the negotiations should have more time in which to assess the effect of the proposed agreements on their departmental plans.    He therefore urged that no decision should bo taken until these Ministers had had an opportunity for further consideration of theproposals.-A-

THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear that thepreponderant view in the Cabinet was in favour of authorisingour negotiators to proceed on the basis of the proposals inthe draft annexed to C. P. (U-5) 312 on the understanding thatthey were free to make concessions on points of detail(e.g.  with regard to a time limit for the unfreezing of sterling receipts from current transactions) -within thegeneral&quot;framework of the draft.Cab onet Office,  S.W.1.,THE MINISTER OP HEALTH supported the Minister of fuel and Power.      In his view,  it was a mistake that weshould approach the United States as suppliants,  since their need to find markets for their exports was just as great as our need for assistance.    He was convinced thata firm attitude on our part would produce a good effect onour general relations with the United States.      He alsourged that a decision on the proposals should be postponedin order to give all members of the Cabinet adequate timeto consider them.THE&apos;SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  said that-it was essential that a decision should be taken withoutfurther delay.    He had examined the proposals with great care In order to ensure that they did not constitute animpediment to the Government&apos;s internal policy, and he was satisfied that this point had been safeguarded.      He had also considered the possibility of obtaining a loan at ahigher rate of interest free from conditions, but even ifthis proved possible  (and there was evidence that theUnited States would not be willing to make us a loan at a ahigher rate of interest free from conditions)  the burdenof such a loan would be beyond our capacity.      Unless we obtained assistance from the United States,  it would beimpossible for us to make any progress with the essentialtask of reviving our trade with European countries.      Forthese reasons he was in favour of giving authority to our negotiators to proceed on the basis of the documents beforethe Cabinet.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he thought it was a mistake to regard the proposals put forward by the UnitedStates Government as designed solely to further their interests.      He believed that they were genuinely anxiousto promote a freer and more ordered world trade,  although they were undoubtedly influenced by the largely ill-informed criticisms which they had to meet in Congress.He did not believe that this country could face theprivations which it would be necessary to undergo if we failed to obtain assistance from the United States, andhe thought that any attempt to postpone the negotiationsfurther would lead to a less satisfactory bargain.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he appreciated the points which had been made by the Ministerof Fuel and Power and the Minister of Health,  but he was satisfied that failure to reach an agreement with theUnited States, with the consequent shortages of food andluxuries,  such as tobacco, would be disastrous for theGovernment.      He therefore strongly urged the Cabinet,  oneconomic, financial and political grounds,  to accept theproposals.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE supported theChancellor of the Exchequer.    He pointed out that,  so faras the commercial policy proposals were concerned,  our negotiators had obtained satisfaction on all the points which they had raised.
