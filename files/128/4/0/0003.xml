(i+5) 303:    embodying the Viceroy&apos;s comments onthe draft statement appended to cp. (i+5) 301.THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR INDIA (who handed round copies of a revised draft of the statementdesigned to meet, in part,  the comments made by theViceroy)  said that a promise had been given inParliament on 22nd November that a statement on theIndian situation would be made at an early date.      the revised draft statement which had been handed round didnot differ very materially from the original draftcirculated under cover of CP. (i+5) 301..      He had,however, felt it essential to make it &quot;clear that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not overlook the disturbanceswhich had taken place, although he had not gone as faras the Viceroy had suggested in placing the mainemphasis on the need for maintaining law and order.    Asregards the pro-posed visit of a Parliamentary delegation to India, it had originally been hoped to arrange an invitation from the Indian Branch of the EmpireParliamentary Association, in which event the Governmentof India would have met the expenses of the delegation in India.      Since,  however,  owing to the elections theIndian Branch of the Empire Parliamentary association was in abeyance, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had undertaken to meet the expenses of the proposedDelegation, and it was hoped that the arrangements forthe visit would now go forward.    If the Cabinet approved- the draft statement which had been handed round, he proposed that it should be made in both Houses ofParliament on 29th November.-1-

The following general points were raised indiscuss ion: -(a) While it was necessary to make it clear in thestatement that the Government of India must preserve law    andorder, it was even more important to consider what steps could he taken to prevent a. further deterioration of the situationin India.      The recent disturbances, which were due partly to the feeling in India about the Indian National Army trialsand events in Java, appeared to be regarded by the Indiannationalist leaders as premature.      But there were variousindications that Congress was aiming at the- promotion of widespread disturbances in India by about March, 1946*(b) The Government of India seemed to have no clearconception of their policy and consistently failed to obtainadequate publicity for their point of view.      This was in partdue to the nature of the Government, which did not contain the necessary political spokesmen who could put forward theGovernment&apos;s case.      But there had also been very great reluctance to make use of such aids to publicity as radio andmobile cinemas, even though, in the case of radio, repeatedoffers of assistance had been made from this country.(c) No steps seemed to have been taken by the Governmentof India&apos; to publicise the great achievements- during the war of Indian troops.      Thus, nothing in the way of a victorymarch of Indian troops had been organised in India.(d) It was desirable that there should be a change ofoutlook on the part of the Government &apos;of India corresponding to the change of Government which had taken place in thiscountry.      In particular, more emphasis should be laid on thesocial and economic advancement of India, and the Governmentof India should Tout themselves forward as the champion of the poorer Classes.(e) THE SECRETARY OP STATE POR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said thatif the aim was to give India self-government within ameasurable time, it was essential to give the Viceroy the help of new political advisers who could devote themselveswholly to the promotion of this policy, unhampered by thedetails of day-to-day administration.      A proposal for theappointment of such political advisers might perhaps have abetter reception if it were put forward by the proposed&quot;Parliamentary Delegation.(f) THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER said that, before making statements of policy foreshadowing social and economic developments in India,&quot; the Cabinet should be clear what suchpolicies involved and whether they could be made effective.It was specially important that the Cabinet should satisfy themselves that such sta.ternen.ts would not have the effect of weakening the authority of the Viceroy and the Government ofIndia at a time when they had to face a very criticialsituation.(g) THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION stressed the importance of ensuring that any Delegation from this country made contact with all classes and shades of opinion in India and was not confined to an officially conducted tour.      Opportunitiesshould be given for the members of the Delegation to visit the homes of Congress and Moslem League supporters and to address publie meetings.

Cabinet Office, S.W.1.,(h) THE MINISTER OP HEALTH suggested that,   inaddition to sending a Parliamentary Delegation,  theGovernment should make arrangements for a delegation of trade unionists to visit India and for a reciprocalvisit from Indian trade unionists to this country.The following -points were made on the draft&apos;statement:-(i) The opening sentence of the statement should berecast so as to avoid the suggestion that the disturbances had been caused by the announcement thatit&apos; was proposed to make a statement.(j)  THE SECRETARY OP STATE.FOR FOREIGN affairs suggested that there should be added to the statementa paragraph stressing the intention of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the Government of India to press on with the economic and social development of India andpromising a further announcement on this aspect of theGovernment&apos;s policy.(k)  THE MINISTER OF HEALTH urged that the statement should be recast in order to stress the differentoutlook of the present Government towards the Indianproblem.      For this purpose, less should be said aboutthe restoration of lav/ and order, and more prominencegiven to the positive steps which the government proposed to take to improve conditions in India.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clearly desirable that the points raised in discussion shouldbe considered further by the India and Burma committee before any statement was made.      The Committee should prepare a revised draft and should also make recommend-ations on the wider suggestions of policy which had beenput forward.      The Foreign Secretary would no doubtfurnish the Committee with a note on the proposal which he had made at (e) above and it would be helpful if he could also attend the meeting of the Committee&quot;.The Cabinet -Invited the India and Burma Committee to review the position, and to consider thedraft of the statement to be made inParliament,  in the light of the various points raised in the course of theCabinet&apos;s discussion.
