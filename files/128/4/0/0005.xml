(45)  322)  covering a memorandum by the Treasuryoutlining a possible time-table for the public announcement which would be made in the event of a successful conclusion of the discussions.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that sinceme-table had been drawn up news had been receivedthis &apos;from Washington that the americans that the first announcement of thenow thought it necessary-proposals on commercial

policy should he made simultaneously with the&apos;jointcommunique on the outcome fo the discussions as a whole.A further telegram was, however, expected from Washingtonlater that.day reporting the results of further discussions with the Americans on the publicityarrangements.      It seemed unprofitable therefore for theCabinet to discuss these matters until this furtherinformation had been received from Washington.THE PRESIDENT 01&apos; THE BOARD OP TRADE said that,  ifit were decided that the proposals on commercial policy should not be announced in advance of the joint communiqueon the results of the discussions as a whole, it would notbe possible for him to make in the House of Commons thelong statement embodied in Annex A to CP. (us)  297*If the first stage in the public announcement was  thePrime Minister&apos;s reading of the joint communique to -theHouse of Commons, he coule not follow this on the same day with a statement of this length on commercial policy.In these circumstances he would propose to reserve his statement for use in the debate which would take place inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR, DOMINION AFFAIRS said that-from the point of&quot; view of public opinion in Australia andNew Zealand, he was most anxious that the explanationscontained in the draft statement annexed to CP. (hd)  297should be given immediately after the publication of theAmerican proposals for an International Trade Agreement.If,  therefore, it was decided that both the financial agreement and the commercial &quot;policy proposals should be announced on the sane day, he hoped that some means would befound of making public at the same time the explanationsgiven in this draft statement.      THE PRIME minister suggested that in those circumstances he might add to thejoint communique a short statement containing thesubstance of the explanations given in the draft annexed to CP. (us) 297.This suggestion was approved by the Cabinet.The Cabinet proceeded to consider the terms of thedraft statement reproduced in Annex A to C.P.(us) 297*THE PRIME MINISTER raised the question whether this draftwent rather too far towards committing His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to supporting the American proposals for enInternational Trade Agreement.      Would it not be preferable,in-view of the attitude of the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand, if we confined ourselves to saying that wewelcomed these proposals as a basis for discussion at theproposed International Conference?      THE SECRETARY OP STATEFOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said that the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand would be content with a statement on thelines of the draft annexed to C.P.(h5)  297, provided thatit was made immediately after the announcement of theAmerican proposals.The Cabinet approved the terms of the draft statement on commercial policy annexed to- CP. (A5) 297-

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER drew attentionto a news-agency report which had reached London from washington, early on the morning of 2nd December whichreferred to a difference of view on this matter&quot;between members of the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was seriously disturbed at this apparent leakage of information.He proposed to have a searching enquiry made in washington.      This incident illustrated the need for exceptional caution on occasions when differences ofview were expressed in Cabinet.binet Office, S.W.1.
