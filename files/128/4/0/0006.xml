(45) 58thI Conclusions,Minute 2)THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER recalled thatat their meeting on 3rd December the Cabinet had authorised the Prime Minister,  in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and himself,  tosettle on their behalf any necessary modifications ofthe draft Financial Agreement which could be made without encroaching on the general principles alreadydetermined by the Cabinet.      Since then analternative draft had been put forward by therepresentatives of the United States Government.    this had been the subject of protracted discussions, as theresult of-which the outstanding difficulties had beenreduced to three, viz:-(i) The United States negotiators seemed to be seeking to deprive His Majesty&apos;s Government of thebenefit of the scarce currency provisions of theInternational Monetary Fund Agreement.(ii) It was not clear whether the draft agreement would affect the right of His Majesty&apos;s Government towithdraw from the Fund.(iii) It was proposed that at the end of fifteen months His Majesty&apos;s Government should not invoke theirtransitional rights under Article XIV of the international monetary Fund, both in regard to any dollar transactions with the United States and also generally.      The UnitedKingdom would then come under the full obligations ofconvertibility of the International Monetary Fund.Our negotiators had successfully resisted theproposal to deprive us of the benefit of the scarce currency provisions, and it had been agreed that theUnited States Government would not challenge our rightto withdraw from the Fund in order to regain liberty to devalue sterling, although, if the draft agreement were concluded, resignation from the   Fund would not give us the right to impose exchange control on currenttransactions between this country and the UnitedStates.      It had not, however, been possible to move the United States Government from their view that the transitional period should b6 limited to fifteen months and a compromise suggestion that the transitional period might run until December 1948 had been rejected.Thus,  the remaining question for the Cabinet was whether we should now acquiesce in a transitional period.of fifteen months or should stand out for some longer period at the risk of a break-down in the negotiations.

The United States Government argued that the loanwhich they were offering did away with the need for a1 ong transi ti ona 1 peri od* ao ffa-jp -ao dolloms-.....wopco^wetiriratt.      And in practice this reduction of the transitional period might well turn out to do uslittle harm.      We had already agreed that currentdollar earnings of sterling area countries should befreed within fifteen months, and we were also committed to the relaxation within the same period of restrictionson current dollar earnings by other founder members ofthe Fund,      The proposed reduction of the transitional period to fifteen months would,  therefore,  affect usin practice only in relation to current transactions with the Argentine,  Sweden,  Switzerland, Spain and portugal.If the proposed Agreement was looked at as awhole,  the terms offered to us compared very favourably with those accorded to France,  and, while we should still have to make strenuous efforts to restore ourposition,  the assistance provided by the&apos; United states should tide us over the next few difficult years during which we should be able to rehabilitate our industry and trade and, at the same time, make some improvement in the standard of living of our people.On the ether hand,  a break with the United States would lead to very great immediate difficulties.    It would necessitate heavy reductions in our imports of food,raw materials and tobacco, which would result in a sharp reduction in the standard of living,  and would prejudice the revival of our export trade through thefierce competition which we should have to fact fromthe United States.      The Canadian Government would not regard us as justified in rejecting the draft agreement on this one. point:  and we should have little,hope of maintaining the solidarity of the. sterlinggroup.    In the wider sphere of international affairs a break with the United States at this juncture mightbe disastrous.      Taking all this into account, he hadon balance and with some reluctance come to theconclusion that it would be wrong to press our view with regard to the length of the transitional period to the extent of breaking off the negotiations.    he realised, however,  that there would be considerabledifficulty in  justifying the reduction in the transitional period to Parliament and the cabinet might consider it desirable to make a final attemptto get the period extended, say,  until December 19H7.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP TRADE said that,while he regretted the attitude of the United StatesGovernment,  it -was logically defensible and, inpractice,  the adverse effect on us of a shortertransitional period was likely to be small.      Therewould no doubt be difficulty in  justifying the change-to Parliament,  but the alternative of a break withthe United States would be so disastrous that,  inhis view,   this difficulty must be faced.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that it was essentialthat we should obtain help from the United States ifwe were to rebuild our industry and restore our tradewith Europe.      He had hoped that the United states would have agreed to the extension of the transitional period to December 19H8,  and he thought it still worth

trying to obtain an extension until December 19k7*      3(In his view, however,  there could be no question of breaking off the negotiations on the narrow issue ofthe length of the transitional period.    In all thecircumstances our negotiators had done extremely wellin achieving as much as they had.      It should beremembered that the proposed Agreement, particularly inso far as it related to commercial policy,, arose outof Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agrement,&apos;which hadbeen accepted by the Coalition Government and byParliament.A number of other Ministers supported the viewthat the Agreement should be accepted.THE MINISTER OP FUEL AND POWER said that he didnot regard the length of the transitional period asa matter of crucial importance.      He remained ofopinion, however,   that the Agreement as a whole wasunsatisfacotry and would work to the detriment of thiscountry,      The Cabinet had been informe*d of theimmediate hardships which would be involved ifaccommodation was not obtained from the United States.But the Cabinet had not fully explored what ourposition would be in the long run if this offer were rejected.      He did not believe that our industrialrecovery depended necessarily on continuing importsfrom the United States.    He did believe, however,  thatindustri al recovery in the United States depended onthe grant of credits to enable us and other to buyUnited States exports.      In these circumstances, theharsh conditions which they were seeking to imposecould not be justified.    He feared that relationswi:th &quot;the United States would be much more liable to beembittered if,  as was likely, we found in due course that we were unable to abide by the terms of repayment,than by any break at the present time.    He recognised,however,   that the- Cabinet had decided to accept theAgreement and he would not press- his objections further.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that the object ofthe United States Government in proposing a reductionof the transitional period was clearly to counter theadvantage which we had gained by the  provision in thedraft Agreement under which we were not required to take up more of the  total loan offered than we might requireat any time.    This point would certainly be made whenthe proposals were submitted to Parliament.      He alsodrew attention to the difficulties which were likely to arise  through inconsistent interpretations being put onthe Agreements in this country and in the United States,Nevertheless,  it was impossible to break on the narrowissue now before the Cabinet and, while he felt thatour original approach to the United States had beenmistaken, he thought there was now no alternative butto accept the draft Agreement.In further discussion, it was pointed out that,the interpretation of the Agreements which we intendedto put before Parliament had been agreed by the UnitedStates Government and that this interpretation wouldbe published before any debate on the Agreement tookplace in Congress.    There was no reason why,  incommending the proposals to Parliament, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should not indicate that they were not allthat we might have expected.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the general viewof the Cabinet was clearly in favour of accepting the Agreement, even if the United&apos; States Governmentinsisted on limiting the transitional period to fifteen months.      With regard to tile suggestion that a finalattempt might be made to extend the period up toDecember 1947,  it was clearly undesirable that anysuch attempt should lead to a further worsening ofthe conditions proposed by the United States Governmentand,  in these circumstances,  the best course might beto authorise our negotiators to inform the UnitedStates Government that we accepted &apos; their proposals in substance but that it would very considerably easecur difficulties in presenting the Agreements toParliament if the transitional period could beextended until December 1947.The Cabinet -Invited the Prime Minister to Inform therepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Go/ em men tin Washington that it would substantiallyease the difficulties of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in presenting the Agreement   toParliament if the United States Governmentcould be persuaded to extend the transitional period to December,  1947.      If.,however,  this amendment could not besecured, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington was authorised to accept thedraft Financial Agreement as it now stood.Cabine t Office, S.W.1.
