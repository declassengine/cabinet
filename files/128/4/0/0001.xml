(1+5) 23rdConclusions,Minute Ut  and .M. (us) U9thConclusions,Minute 7)At the cabinet.net&apos;s meeting earlier in the day the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade had -made oral statementsregarding the position reached in the financial negotiations at Washington and in the paralleldiscussions on commercial policy,  in amplificationof the information given in their memorandaCP. (i+5) 269 and 270.OP THE EXCHEQUER recalled thatof his&apos; memorandum it was proposed that,morlean agreement to 0 loan on thein. the memorandum, we should indicate the American proposals fora in preparation for theational Trade OrganisationTHEin paragraph if we securedterms outlinedour willingness to supportan International Conferoneestablishment of an Internand should also propose to Parliament the acceptanceof the Bretton Woods Agreements.      The arguments infavour of supporting the American proposals for aConference on commercial policy were set out in cp. (h-5) 269 and had Peon elaborated in the statement made by the President of the Board of Trade.      TheChancellor said that he now wished to add someexplanation of the proposal for acceptance of the bretton Woods Agreements.      The ratification of these agreements would impose upon us three major obligations to co-operate in securing (i)    stability of exchange rates;    (ii)    relaxation of exchange restrictions sofar as concerned current payments;    and (iii)    con-vertibility of currency.      Of these,  the first was clearly to our advantage:      competitive devaluationforeign currencies had been one of the greatesthandicaps to our export trade in the    years betweenwars.      The acceptance of this obligation would leave us free to vary our rate of exchange up to 10 per cent,either way, by unilateral action,  and the   governing body of the Fund would be empowered to authorisevariation beyond this limit if they were satisfied thatin order to correct a fundamentalThe Agreements contained provisions to escape deflationary pressure from and finally it would be open to us,oi;heit was necessarydi s e qu i 1 ib r i urn.which allowed us&apos;-encies:&quot;esort, to withdraw from the agreement in the las;without leave or notice.The second and thirdobligations would not begin

to operate until after a transition, period, whichmust be of several years&apos; duration.- .   .Many safeguards were therefore available.But,  to make assurance doubly sure, the Chancellorproposed that our acceptance of the Agreements shouldbe accompanied by an interpretive declaration making it clear that nothing in the Final Act would requireus to adopt an internal deflationary policy at a timeof unemployment, and that it would bo fop::us to   -determine the duration of the transition period whichmust elapse before we assumed the obligations at(ii) and (iii) above.      A draft of this interpretivedeclaration had been prepared in the Treasury in thefellow in g t erm s: -&quot;The Governor and Executive Director of theFund who are appointed by the United Kingdom shall atthe earliest opportunity request,  under Article XVIII,interpretation of the Articles of Agreement asfollows:-(a) That having regard to the intention ofthe Government of the United Kingdom tomaintain Full Employment and to the terms ofArticle 1 (2) of the Articles of Agreement,the Fund shall agree,  under article TV,Section 5 (f), to any change proposed in the far value of a member&apos;s currency which isnecessary to protect that member from&apos;unemployment of a chronic or persistentcharacter.(b) That under Article XIV,  Section ii,  a memberis free to use his own judgment,  subjectto the provisions of that Article,  in settinga limit to the duration of its own transitional period,  provided only that it may be subject in certain circumstances to the provisionsof Article XV,  Section 2  (a)&quot;THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER said that itwould be a mistake for the Cabinet to consider the bretton Woods proposals apart from the proposals on commercial policy.      At an earlier stage Lord Keyn^shad admitted that it would be preferable to secure a trade agreement before ratifying the Bretton WoodsAgreements1;    and indeed it was obvious that the twoware closely inter-related.      These matters were allessentially parts of a single settlement, which shouldbe considered as a whole.In his view,  the objective which the UnitedStates Government had in. mind in the course of these negotiations vies to break up the Sterling Group.      Ifwe allowed them to succeed in this aim, we should be entirely at their mercy in matters of world   trade.Why therefore should we play into their hands by allowing them to make it,  in effect, a condition oftheir loan to us that we should ratify the BrettonWoods Agreements and thus destroy the coherence of the sterling Group?     Were we not accepting too readilytheir vague promises of co-operation in a multilateral

system of world trade?     was it likely that theUnited States Government would,  in practice^ throwopen their markets to us?     Yet in return for thesenebulous schemes, we were &quot;being asked to break upthe Sterling Group and to discard our power toenforce a discriminatory commercial policy.Our whole approach seemed to hove been basedon the assumption that we were suppliants for financialassistance.     But, while it was true that the borrowerwas always in difficulties,  so often was the lender:and it should not be forgotten that the United Statesproducers would be in a difficult position if it weremade impossible for us to take their -produce.      Infact,  the custom of the debtor countries was essentialto American prosperity.    If this point had been sufficiently stressed, we should have found ourselves in a position to drive a hard bargain.-    THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that, byratifying the Bretton Woods agreements, we should beabandoning the Sterling Area system.     And,  as the safe-guards to which the Chancellor had referred were likely to nullify the advantages of the Bretton. WoodsAgreements, we were likely to find ourselves in theposition of having the protection of neither.      Itwas clearly the purpose of the United Stores Governmentto destroy the Sterling Group, but it was to our advantage to maintain that system;    for our creditorsin the Sterling Group were anxious to trade with usin order to get our goods.As regards commercial policy,  he was apprehensive about the extent to which we should be committed to the proposals set out in Annex C to cp. (1+5) 269.      In paragraph 7 of CP.(L5) 270 itwas proposed that we should not only support theAmerican plan for a Conference with a view to theestablishment of an International Trade Organisation,but should also proclaim our general acceptance ofthe principles set out in the document which the americans were to issue.      Some of these principlesappeared to him to be based on a 19th centuryattitude towards international trade, which was unlikely to find acceptance by States like the soviet union.      If we were to support this proposal for aninternational Conference, he would hove preferred thatwe should go to it with our hands free.      The proposed terms for the loan were not so attractive as to warrant the high price which we were being asked to pay for it in the form of adherence to these other proposals.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY said that ourearlier acceptance of a multilateral as opposed to a bilateral basis for international trade had been given at a time when it was supposed that the United StatesGovernment would approach these matters in a truly co-operative spirit.     Now,  however,  there was a growingbody of informed opinion that the United StatesGovernment were using their position of financialascendancy in order to break down our system of empire trade,  and perhaps to threaten the cohesion ofthe Commonwealth.     We were not,  however, without^power to resist such pressure.      After the financialcrisis of 1931 we had refused to accept Americandictation and had largely restored our position by our own efforts, within two years, in developing our

Empire trade.      If we could not get better terms fromthe Americans than those indicated in the memoranda, now before the Cabinet, was&apos; it not worth considering,whether we could not do the same again?The Cabinet were     not yet fully informed of the full implications of these terms.      Thus,what would become of our pre-war debt to the UnitedStates?     And what would be the cost of liquidatingLend-Lease?     Would the proposed commitments., insinking fund and interest.,  tie a millstone round our.necks for a generation?THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that noquestion had been raised in the negotiations aboutthe revival of the pre-war American debt;    and therewas no reason to believe that the Americans hod any intention of bringing this matter up again.      Asregards the liquidation of Lend-Lease, a finalevaluation was now being made in Washington, and thebest estimate which, could be given was that forbillion we could secure all the stores which were: in the pipeline when Lend-Lease was terminated andall those In our possession which we were proposing to divert to civil uses.      This $-g- billion was included in the loan of $2^ billions now undernegotiations.In reply to the other points noted above,the following considerations were put forward byTHE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER and THE PRESIDENTOP THE BOARD OF TRADE:-In estimating the effect on the Sterling.Group of any settlement on the lines now suggested,it must not be assumed that there would be nodifficulty in maintaining the existing coherence ofthe Group if we now abandoned our attempts to secureaccommodation from the United States.      On thecontrary the Sterling countries were already showing-signs of anxiety to discontinue these special war-time arrangements, which involved them in very great difficulties;    and it was likely that, whateverhappened about the American settlement,  some countries would wish to break away very soon fromthe Sterling Group.This Government would be taking a very graveresponsibility if it declined to co-operate even in-these first tentative moves towards on international trade Agreement.      The suggestion that we should aiminstead at consolidating the Sterling Group andretaining our power to apply discriminatory policies in our foreign trading was inconsistent with the declared policy of the Labour Party, which was committed&quot;to making a sincere attempt at securing,in co-operation with other countries, a multilateralbasis for world trade.      This did not mean that weshould omit to safeguard ourselves against the    failureof those attempts.      Ample safeguards were,  however,provided in the proposals now before the Cabinet.     Itwas true that all these proposals were related partsof a single scheme;;    but we had clearly reserved

the right, if one part of the scheme &quot;broke downto an extent which would imperil the remainder,to withdraw our co-operation from the other ports of the scheme.It had &quot;been suggested that the UnitedStates.Government would not in the event make anysubstantial concessions by way of reduction oftheir tariffs.      But our support for theseproposals was based on the assumption that tariff reductions would be made;    and wo were in no way committed to abandoning Imperial Preferenceexcept   in return for tariff reductions.      Theobject of the nuclear conference in March, 19h7,was to see whether there was a sufficient prospectof tariff reductions to warrant proceeding to the wider international conference in June, which would seek to secure a general Trade Agreement.Some Ministers had doubted the wisdom of declaring our acceptance of the general principles set out in the document (reproduced in Annex C toC.F.(k3) 269) which the Americans were    proposing to issue in preparation for these conferences.      Infact,  however, that document now contained only those principles which we had ourselves put forward for acceptance in the course of the negotiations.All the American proposals to which we had expressed objection had in the event been withdrawn.The&apos;general principles set out in this documentreflected the primary objectives of policy which wewould wish to follow as an exporting nation.Finally,  our acceptance of these general principleswould not preclude us from suggesting modificationsor improvements when we came to discuss this document in detail at the proposed conference.TES FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he thoughtit understandable that some Ministers should feelreluctant to accept the terms proposed for the loan from the United States.      Throughout these negotiations he had himself felt the most profoundreluctance to agree to any settlement which would leave us subject to economic direction from theUnited States;    and he had subjected all theproposals made to a very close scrutiny from thispbint of view.      He would have much preferred a straightforward loan without conditions.      In the. end,

however,  he had been forced, to the conclusionthat we were faced with, the hard choice betweenaccepting these terras, as the best we could get,or struggling on without American assistance.That second alternative involved asking theBritish people to endure, for perhaps anotherthree years,  standards of living even lower than ^those to which we had been reduced at theend of six years of war.      When he consideredthe period of industrial difficulty with whichwe were in any event confronted,  he could notpersuade himself that it was right to ask theBritish people to go through that period onliving standards lower than those to which, theyhad already been reduced.      That in his view wasthe real issue.      Our negotiators at Washingtonhad satisfied themselves that these were the bestterms we were likely to get.      Were we to rejectthese terms and demand these further sacrificesfrom the British people?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL endorsed the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary.      We werein no position to dictate to the United StatesGovernment.      Although in the long run their economic difficulties might prove to be even greater than ours,  they were at present in acommanding position.      Unless we were ready toaccept accommodation from them,  on their terms,we must ask our people to face -conditions ofliving even worse than those which they hodendured during the war.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND fisheries said that in his view our negotiators had been extremely successful.      He did not see how anybetter terms for the loan could have been obtained;and,  as regards commercial policy,  he was gratifiedat the extent to which the Americans had beenbrought round to our views.THE SEGREThRY OF SThTE FOR WAR agreed withthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s view about the difficulty ofasking the British people to endure&apos; furtherprivations.      He considered,  however,  that if we nowturned away from Anglo-American co-operation,  the moral shock to the people of this country would be, even greater than the material loss.      Such adecision would confound all the hopes which thepeople of this country - and indeed the peoples of thewhole world - had built on the prospect of continuinginternational co-operation.      For,  if we took the lead in disrupting Anglo-American economic co-operation,  we could not expect the United states to continue&apos;for long to shoulder their internationalresponsibilities in political affairs.

THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA supported thisview.      He could not regard the suggested terras forthe loan as satisfactory, but he could not believethat any other solution so far suggested&apos; would be preferable - indeed, the alternatives suggested in discussion would be infinitely worse.      It wasinconceivable that we should proclaim to the world that we had rejected the only scheme which had so far been devised for international co-operation in financial and commercial matters.      These were&apos;theonly international agreements which were in sight;this Government would indeed be assuming a heavyresponsibility if it rejected these terms becausethey were not as good as we might wish.THE SECRETARY OF  STATE FOR DOMINION affairs said that he supported the proposals put to theCabinet by the   Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePresident of the Beard of Trade.      The DominionGovernments had been kept in close touch with theprogress of these negotiations.      They were quite readyto consider abating Imperial Preferences in returnfor tariff concessions;    and v/ere prepared to take part in the proposed conferences on that basis.    Weshould not be involved in any difficulties with dominion Governments as a result of going forward with,the proposals now before the  Cabinet.THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER said that it seemed to be the general view of the Cabinet thatthese proposals must as a whole be accepted.      But,&apos;even so, would it be possible to enter some reservationson the proposals with regard to commercial policy setout in CP. (us)  269?     These proposals seemed to him tobe unsatisfactory in certain respects.     For example,the provision in paragraph E, 1  of Chapter 3 in Annex Cto CP. (h-5) 269, which required State trading enter-prises in making purchases and sales to be guidedsolely by commercial considerations, might be interpreted in such a way as to make it impossible fora Government to be guided in its use of State tradingby considerations such as the desirability of an improved nutritional policy.      Again,  in paragraph Dof Chapter 3 of Annex C, which dealt with subsidies,there was nothing to prevent the United StatesGovernment from giving concealed subsidies in the formof lower shipping rates.      He would prefer that at thepresent stage we should neither accept the BrettonWoods Agreements nor commit ourselves to supporting the United States proposals for the establishment ofan international trade organisation, but should merelyoffer to take part in the conference which was to beheld in March, leaving our future course of actionto be decided according to the results of that conference.      He was convinced that if we adopted a firm attitude the United States would be compelledto make further concessions,  in view of their dependence on our markets to absorb their exports.    In any event,rather than become involved in the long-termdisadvantages entailed in acceptance of these proposals,he was inclined to think that we should appeal to thepeople of this country to risk the continuance of conditions of austerity.

THE FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY drew attentionto the statement by Lord Keynes in paragraph 25(i) ofthe.Annex to G.P.(45) 112 that we should not acceptassistance from the United States in the form of a credit if this meant payment, of interest and stipulatedterms of repayment,  since we could not undertake suchan addition to our existing obligations with any confidence that we could fulfil these obligations.He asked whether it would not be possible to make an interim arrangement under which we should be entitledto temporary accommodation from the United States inthe form of a monthly overdraft on which we would pay interest at the appropriate rate.      Such assistance might tide us over the immediate period of difficultywithout compelling us to assume long-term obligations which we were unlikely to be able to meet or toenter into  trade agreements which would injure thesystem of Imperial Preference.TEE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he would much prefer to make acceptance of  the Bretton WoodsAgreements condition on the  conclusion of a trade agreement.      If, however,  the Agreements had to beaccepted by 31st December, 1945, the question arosewhether the interpretative declaration which had been drawn up by the    Chancellor of the Exchequer in orderto safeguard our position gave us the necessaryprotection.      He had not had time to consider the wording of the declaration fully,  but it might wellbe argued that it would be for the    Governing Bodyof the Fund,   and not for His Majesty&apos;s Government,  todetermine when it was necessary to make a change in the far value of sterling in order to avoid unemploymentof a chronic or persistent character in the U.K.      he also doubted whether the words in paragraph (b) of thedeclaration designed to enable His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto determine  the length of the transition period before the provisions of the Agreements came fully intoeffect would,  in fact, give us a completely free hand,since they v/ere expressly stated to be subject to article XIV,  Section A. and Article XV,  Section 2(a)of the Monetary Fund Agreement.In reply to these points THE PRESIDENT OF THEBOARD OF TEADE said that,  if we wished to secureAmerican agreement to the proposed terms of the loan,it was essential that we  should indicate our support&apos;of the proposals in Annex C to C.P.(45) 269 as a basis for discussion at the proposed Conference in Marchand it would not be enough for us merely to., offer to   .take part in the Conference without any prior commitment.It was true that the proposals in Annex C didnot deal with shipping,  but it seemed clearly to our interest that questions of shipping and of civilaviation should be dealt with separately from questionsof commercial policy.The statement in paragraph E.1  of chapter iii of Annex C that State trading enterprises should be guided solely by commercial considerations was intended merely to prevent State trading enterprisesfrom being used for political objectives in theinternational field and would not affect theGovernment&apos;s internal policy.      Moreover,  the Britishnegotiators had received a clear assurance that the

paragraph would not bo inconsistent with long-term contracts with regular suppliers.      Thus, any arrangements with New Zealand for the supply of meatover a long period of years would not be affected bythe  fact that in any particular season anotherexporting country was able to offer supplies at a lower&apos;price.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that thispart of the document would be less open to misundor-standing if the order of the words were transposedso as to read &quot;..  .,  their State trading enterprises,in making purchases and sales,  should be guidedsolely by such commercial  considerations as price,quality,  terms of sale,  etc.&quot;.      Our negotiators in washington might seek to get this change made beforethe document was published.      If, however,  the americans were reluctant to make the change at thislate  stage,  it would be open to us to propose at theConference in March an amendment designed to clarifythe meaning of this paragraph.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theCabinet should know what the consequences would be ifwe decided not to seek aocommodation from the UnitedStates on the terms suggested.      To do no more thansecure the necessary imports of food and raw materials to maintain our existing programme of production and consumption we should have to borrow $1,000 million from the United States in 19u,6.      The alternative course of trying to rely on our own resources wouldhave the following effects on our standards of living.We should have to reduce the present rat6 of consumptionof practically  ill foods except bread and potatoes.During 19Z4.6 there would be some fall in the fat ration,the cheese ration would not be increased during thewinter, there would be no tinned milk or dried eggs, .imported meat would be reduced by 15, ,  sugar by50, ,  and tobacco by 80;-.      Imports of timber would be cut by 15,   and plywood by hOg.      The drive to restoreour export trade would be crippled,  since we shouldbe without adequate supplies of such raw materialsas cotton and should not be able to afford to exportsteel products.The objections which had been made by Lord Xeynesin August to  the acceptance of a loan on which weshould be liable for interest and repayment had,  ineffect, been met by the waivers described in paragraph hof C.Pi(h5)  2?&apos;0.      The suggestion of a monthly overdraftto tide us over the immediate future had been fully investigated, but would not be acceptable to theUnited States Government.As regards Bretton Woods the objects of theinterpretative declaration were those which he had stated at the outset of the meeting.      If the draft which had been prepared in the Treasury did not infact secure these objects, he would be very glad toconsider suggestions for improving the. wording.      Itvrould not,  however,  be possible to add-to theinterpretative declaration a provision making our acceptance of the Agreements dependent on theconclusion of a Trade Agreement. *

THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL (summing upthe discussion on behalf of the Prime Minister, whohad been obliged to leave shortly before the end.ofthe meeting)  said that the points raised in theCabinet&apos;s discussion had been very fully consideredduring the earlier stages of the negotiations.Admittedly we were not being treated as generouslyas we might have expected,  but it had to be realised that it would be fruitless for the United Statesnegotiators to offer us-terms which had no hope ofsecuring the approval of Congress.      It was essentialthat we should obtain the necessary dollars to pay for the Lena-Lease supplies&quot; in the pipeline at theend of the war with -Japan and to enable us to ease the position in the Sterling Group, which was in real danger of breaking up unless we were prepared to relaxthe present stringent control of dollar expenditure by members of the Group.      It was also clear that,unless we accepted accommodation from the United States,we had little prospect of being able to make good the damage which our industry and trade had sustainedduring the war.He felt that the general  sense of the cabinet was in favour of proceeding with the proposals madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade.      The misgivings which had been expressed by some Ministers would be recorded.The Cabinet -(1 ) Agreed that the United kingdom representatives in Washington should beauthorised to put forward the proposalsfor financial assistance to the UnitedKingdom set out in paragraph 2 of cp, (45) 270, on the understanding thatif these proposals were not acceptedthey should be free to put forward.  alternative proposals up to the limitstated in paragraph 3 of CP. (45) 270.(2) Agreed that any obligations entered intounder (1) above should be subject to thewaivers set out in paragraph 4 of cp. (45) 270.(3) Agreed that if the United states administration accepted and put to congress the proposals for financialassistance to the United Kingdom referredto in (1)  above,  His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould indicate their support of  theproposals for the establishment of anInternational Trade Organisation set outin Annex C of CP. (45) 269 as a basis fordiscussion at the Conference which it was proposed that the United States Governmentshould summon in March;    and should recommend to Parliament acceptance of  the bretton Woods itgreements.-1 0-

(h) Took note that the United StatesGovernment would publish their proposalsf o r a n I n t e r n a t i on a 1 Trade Organisation- ,on 11th November, and agreed to consider at a later meeting what arrangements should be made for Government statements on this matter in this country, bothin Parliament and elsewhere.(5) Took note that the Chancellor of theExchequer would consult the LordChancellor with regard to the wording of the interpretative declaration whichwould be a condition of the acceptance by His Majesty&apos;s Government of theBret ton Woods Agreements&apos;.C ab inet Offic e, S.
