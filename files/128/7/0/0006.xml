(1+6) 1+8thConclusions^Minute 1+)The Cabinet had before them a note by theSecretary (CP. (1+6)  217) covering&apos;telegrams from theCabinet Mission and the Viceroy giving their appreciation of the situation which might arise in India if agreement could not be reached on the basis of the proposals putforward on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.The Cabinet Mission believed that a crisis inthe negotiations would be reached between the 5th and15th June.      They were not without.hope of reaching agreement with both parties on all the points at issue,since they believed that a majority of the working committee of Congress desired to reach a peaceful settlement.      They thought it necessary, however,  thatsome plan of action should be prepared against the contingency of a failure to reach agreement.      Such a breakdown might occur because the proposals of His  -Majesty&apos;s Government were rejected (i) by the muslim league,  or (ill) by Congress,  or (iii) by both.      TheMission contemplated that,  in the first event, an interim Government would be formed which would include representatives of Congress,  some representativesminorities and a proportion of seats reserved forMuslim League but filled for the time being by officials or non-league Muslims.      In the secondthe position would be much more serious;    and anattempt to form a central Government might give to widespread opposition by Congress which wouldofthe2vent,disorders.In the  third event, viz.rise1 e adifto seriousthe scheme were rejected by both Congress and the muslim League,   the Cabinet Mission would return homeBefore doing so, however,   they would issueat once.shortly,for long-reviewed the Viceroy .the problem.a statement announcing that the search for a solution would be continued,   that meanwhile they were returningfor consultation with His Majesty&apos;s Government andthat the Viceroy would be re-opening negotiationsSuch a statement might hold the  situationenough to enable the position tc be fully in London and for instructions to be sent toregarding the basis of a new approach toIt was possible, however,  that such astatement &quot;would fail to hold, the situation and that theViceroy would soon be faced with open opposition from congress which might develop into a struggle similarto,  but more widespread and better organised than,that of 192+2,      The Mission therefore  thought it essential that the Viceroy should have from HisMajesty&apos;s Government an indication of the policywhich he  should adopt in that event.      They also thought it desirable that they should have this policyin their minds before  they embarked on  their finaldiscussions with Congress and. the Muslim League.
The Mission outlined the alternative policies whichmight be adopted in  the  situation.envisaged in their message.First,  an attempt might be made  to maintain the existing        &apos;form of Government for a further period and to suppress &quot;any-widespread opposition sponsored and directed by Congress.The Mission considered that our military and civil resources in India were insufficient to enable us to enforce such a&apos;policy of repression:    and that such a policy would mean an end.of political progress in India for a long period, during which government would have to be  carried on  by executive councils of officials both at the centre and in  the provinces.      they also believed that such a policy would be unacceptable to the supporters of his Majesty&apos;s Government  in  the United Kingdom.They therefore felt unable to recommend this course.Secondly, we might decide to withdraw entirely from india as soon as widespread opposition developed.      This would produce administrative chaos,  famine and civil war&apos;.      It would cause general consternation throughout the British Commonwealth;and  the Mission considered that wo  should not adopt this courseunless the  sheer necessities of the situation forced us to doso.A possible - variation of this plan would be to annouce our intention to withdraw from India by a certain date,e.g.   1st January,  1947,   and to attempt in the interval toarrange with the political Parties for a phased withdrawalwhich would give them time and. opportunity to organise theirown administration;      This plan would alienate Muslim opinion,both in India and throughout the Middle East,  and might provoke civil war in India.      If that occurred we should have failed to secure our main objective of averting administrativechaos.&apos;     The president of the Board of Trade was disposed, to favour this alternative;    but he had been prevented by illnessfrom taking part in the discussions leading up to  the formulation of this appreciation.      The other two members ofthe Mission recommended that this modified plan of withdrawalshould be rejected.Thirdly,  the suggestion had been made that HisMajesty&apos;s Government,  with the concurrence of the principalParties in India,  should submit the Indian problem for decision by the United Nations or some  internationalarbitrator.      This course was not recommended by the Mission.Having rejected  the alternatives summarised above,the Mission and the Viceroy both recommended that in thesituation envisaged the best course would be  to allow the six&apos; Hindu provinces of Madras, Bombay,  Control Provinces,United Provinces, Bihar and Orissa to become self-governingin every respect,  but to maintain for the time being theexisting constitution in the remainder of British India, and.the existing relations with certain of the Indian States.This would mean in effect granting Independence to southern and Central India and maintaining the existing position in north-West and North-Bast India.      An attempt would be made to persuade Congress and  the Muslim League  to accept this plan and to co-operate in its orderly execution, so as to gain timeto carry out  the division of the Indian Army,   the necessary arrangements for communications and other administrative arrangements consequent on this division of India.      The  sixHindu provinces would then proceed to set up the ir own groupGovernment which, when formed, would take over responsibilitywithin its area   for all central  subjects including foreignaffairs, defiance and communications.      In the remainder ofBritish India the present constitution would remain  in force,
but the Provinces would bo encouraged to determine their ownconstitutions with due regard to minority rights.      During thisinterim period we should encourage co-operation between Northern1India and the rest of India in the hope that feeling in favourof an Indian Union would grow.The Mission asked, on two grounds,   that they, should beinformed at once  of the preliminary reactions of the Cabinettowards these proposals.      First,  their handling of the nextphase of their discussions with the Party leaders, beginning-soon after 5th June, would, depend to some extent on the policywhich His Majesty&apos;s Government were likely to adopt in the last resort.      Secondly, a dangerous situation might arise quitesuddenly and it might then become necessary for prompt actionto be taken, with little time  for consultation with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in London, as any hesitation might endanger the lives of Europeans in India.The Cabinet first discussed,   in consultation with theChiefs of Staff and Field Marshal Auchinleck,   the military implications of the proposals put forward by the Cabinet Mission.The following is a summary of statements made by FIELD MARSHALAUCHlFLSCK in reply to specific questions put to him by various members of the Cabinet.The success of the proposed withdrawal from Hindustanwould depend very largely on the attitude of Congress towards this plan.      If their co-operation were secured,  the withdrawalcould be spread over a substantial period,  say,  three years,and it might then be carried, out without undue dislocation.      if their co-operation were withheld, however,  the movement wouldbecome an operation of war and it was impossible to predictprecisely how it would be achieved.      Plans had been made for collecting Europeans, Anglo-Indians and Indians needingprotection into centres where they could be protected by British-troops, and for removing them gradually to the ports whencethey could be evacuated either to the United Kingdom or to pakistan.      Even if the co-operation of the Congress leaders were secured,  there would be  some disorder and anti-Europeandemonstrations which would necessitate the introduction incertain areas of these  special arrangements for the protectionof Europeans.The Indian Army contained both Hindus and Muslims,and for the most part they were not segregated into separateunits.      Up to now it had been possible to rely on  the loyaltyof the Indian Army.      Active  steps had been taken to explain to the Army the nature of the  proposals made on behalf of HisMajesty&apos;s Government for enabling India to  secure her independence and so far the Army had in the main stood firm against communalinfluence.      If,however. Congress finally rejected the proposalsof the Cabinet Mission,  it would be  unwise  to-continue to rely on the Hindu element in the Indian Army, which would then besubject to strong political influence.      And,  if it became necessary to proceed to a division between Hindustan and Pakistan,Hindus would. Inevitably have  to be released from the Army andtransferred to Hindustan.      As the Hindus and Muslims were notsegregated in separate units,  the process of regrouping wouldbe  protracted;    and it would be several years before an efficientMuslim Army could, be created.
If Congress withheld their co-operation,communications in Hindustan would be paralysed;    and theBritish elements in those provinces would bo faced withthe alternatives of fighting their way out or waiting until they could, be extricated.     For this reason the plansprovided for maintaining control over key airports, so asto permit evacuation by air to  the airports.      If all european administrators were withdrawn from Hindustan,the railways could  still be operated - though withsubstantially less efficiency.In the circumstances envisaged it was likely that the Muslims would welcome a British decision to remainin Northern India.      The Muslims would expect to be attacked,  possibly within five years, by Hindustan;    andthey would also expect Hindustan to invite foreignintervention in Nor them India.      The Cabinet were informed,in this connection,  that there were already indication... ofslightly increased concentrations of Soviet troops tothe north of Afghanistan;    and there was also some evidence-that Soviet agents were moving southward through Persia.It was likely that the tribes on the North-Vest frontierwould take advantage of any weakness in the Indiancontingents on the frontier due  to the disorganisationarising from the separation of Hindus and Muslims in theIndian Army.      On the    other hand these Muslim tribesmight refrain from causing trouble which would embarrass the Muslim Government of Pakistan.If it became impossible to rely on the indian army, British troops in or within easy reach of india would not suffice  to maintain law and order throughout India.      In particular,  it would be  impossible to controlwith British troops alone all the munitions dumps and.factories throughout India.      The most that could be done with British troops would be  to garrison the ports andcertain key areas.      On the other hand the immediate,despatch of British reinforcements to India would not belikely to deter Congress from provoking disorder:    atthis stage it was likely to have an irritant,  rather thana sedative, effect.      The purpose of obtaining reinforcementswould be,  not to avoid trouble,   but to restore the situationwhen trouble had broken out.     For this pu.rpose as much asfour or five divisions might be required.      strengthening of the British air forces in India would be  of little value for this purpose;    for, although aircraft could be used inthe last resort to attack demonstrators,  they were of no value for the purpose  of protecting lives and property.THE CHIEF OF THE IMPERIAL GENERAL  STAFF said,that these appreciations by the Cabinet Mission and theViceroy raised very serious issues and the Chiefs of staff would wish to have further time in which to consider them.It was necessary to asses.-, the reactions, not only withinIndia,  but also on Indian troops serving outside India,in Burma, Malaya and the Netherlands East Indies.As regards British reinforcements for India,   two brigades were available in Malaya and one in Palestine.If, however, further reinforcements were required,   theycould be provided only at  the cost of reducing our military security in other areas,  e.g.  Palestine or Greece.-k-
The Chiefs of Staff would, like to have a further opportunity for careful study of the military implications of the alternative courses set out in the appreciationsannexed to CP. (2+6)  217 and also their effects on our military commitments in other parts of the world.      Whenthey had completed their study of these questions theywould wish to submit a considered appreciation to theCabinet.The Chiefs of Staff and Field Marshal guchinleckthen withdrew from the meeting.      The Cabinet proceeded to discuss the political aspects of the questions raised in CP. (1l6)  21 7.Discussion showed that the Cabinet shared thedislike of the Cabinet Mission for both of the extremecourses outlined in paragraphs 7 and 8 of their telegram,viz.  repression of a mass movement sponsored and directed by Congress or withdrawal from the whole of India.      Inparticular,  they took the vie?/ that having regard to current difficulties in Palestine and Egypt,   it was important to avoid any course which could be  represented as a policy of &quot;scuttle&quot;.      This would provoke very strongreactions in this country and in the Dominions and wouldhave a most damaging effect on our international position.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that such a policy -would greatly weaken his position in the forthcoming negotiations in Paris.The Cabinet did not favour the proposal inparagraph 9 of the telegram that we should announce our intention to withdraw from India by a specific date.In general,  the Cabinet felt that if the Mission&apos;sproposals were rejected it would be a mistake to give anyappearance of weakness.      To do so might well precipitatethe troubles which we wished to avoid.      The  suggestion was made that we should take the following line:    we were anxious to give India her independence and had put forward a plan to enable her to achieve it;    unfortunately thepeople of India could not agree among themselves on a plan for independence;    we could, not,  in these circumstances,allow a situation to develop in which there would bechaos and famine;    accordingly we must retain our responsibilities until the Indians were able to agree on a plan;     in the meantime our proposals remained open.There was strong support for this proposal, whichwould involve maintaining the existing form of Government.It was realised, however,&apos; that  the extent to which it wouldbe possible to follow such a policy must depend on theIndian reaction to it.      If in; fact it evoked widespreadresistance,  the policy would have to be modified, if only because it would involve very substantial reinforcement of our troops which we  should have great difficulty in finding.      But would there in fact be widespread resistancenecessitating repression of the  type which neither theMission nor the Cabinet favoured?      It was difficult to predict the Indian reaction,  but was tnere not a powerfulelement in Congress which would resist a course leading to chaos and anarchy and throw their weight against the moreirresponsible sections of Congress?
The Cabinet saw substantial difficulties in the positive proposal made by the Delegation in paragraphs 12 to22 of their telegram,  that the six Hindu provinces should beallowed to become self-governing in every respect while theexisting constitution continued in the remainder of british india and the existing relationship was maintained with, certain of the States.      Under such a proposal we should,  in fact,be giving to the Muslim League the Pakistan which we had so farresisted.      There would be little guarantee of fair treatment for the minorities in the Hindu provinces.      It would alsoundoubtedly take time for the new group Government of the Hinduprovinces to become effective and meanwhile the administrationof the present central subjects,  particularly communications,might well become chaotic.THE PAELlAIVIEKTijRY UNDEE-SBCEETARY OE STATE FOE INDIAsuggested,  as a possible alternative,   that a short Bill might be passed through   Parliament under which a provisional Governmentwith practically Dominion powers would be established in Indiabased on representation from the Provincial Legislatures.      he recalled that under the 1935 Act the Federal Legislature wasto be elected by the eleven Provincial Legislative Assemblies.It had not,  in fact,  proved possible  to bring the federal legislature into being.      Under the Bill which he how suggested,the eleven Provincial Assemblies would,  as under the federal constitution,  be empowered to elect a central Legislaturewith a fair representation of communal elements.      It in itsturn would then elect,  by a process of proportional re presentation,a central Ministry composed in fixed communal proportions.This Ministry would hold office during the interim period while a further search was made for a permanent settlement of theproblem.      Such an arrangement would both give  the Indiansself-government and gain time for a permanent solution.THE PRIME MINISTER asked that a written  statement ofthis proposal should be submitted to the Cabinet.In general, the Cabinet felt that it was difficult totake firm decisions as to the means of meeting a situation whichhad not yet arisen and which seemed in fact to be several movesahead.      They thought that,  if there were a breakdown,  it wouldbe very desirable that they should have an opportunity of discussing matters with members of the Cabinet Mission before-final decisions mere  taken.      They noted that the Missionconsidered that  the situation might be -held long enough to allow of this.      It seemed unlikely that either Muslims or congress would be so irresponsible as to ^uah matters to a sudden crisis.There might even be advantage in the short delay which, would be involved while the Mission came home  to discuss matters withtheir colleagues.Other points made in the discussion were as follows:-(a)      We must remember that the administrative machine inIndia -was now extremely weak.      There were very few Europeansin the administrative  services and those who remained were  tiredand perhaps dispirited.      The process of. handing over to Indianshad been going on a long time and the loyalty of the indians in the  civilian services was bound to be tempered by thoughtsfor their future when we had left the country.
(b) We must at&apos; all costs avoid a situation in whichwe had to withdraw from India under circumstances ofignominy after there had been widespread riots and attack,:.on Europeans. It must be clear that we were going freely andnot under compulsion. --(c) For economic, military and political reasons alike,we could not face a&apos; situation which involved committingBritish troops to long series of operations in India.(d) THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that at some point itwould be well to take the United States Government into our confidence.      It was agreed, however,  that it would be preferable not to make any approach to them until thesituation was a little clearer.(e) We could not exclude the  possibility that incertain circumstances the situation in India might bebrought before the United Nations as one which might affectthe peace of the world. -The Cabinet -(1) Agreed to resume their discussion of these issues at a later1 meeting when the Chiefsof Staff had completed their appreciation of the military implications of the  possible courses.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for India to submit a memorandum containing a study of the  implications ofthe  positive proposals made by the CabinetDelegation in paragraphs 12 to 22 of their memorandum.      This memorandum should alsoset out the alternative proposal which hehad outlined in the course of the discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary,  in consultationwith  the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for India,  to arrange for a memorandum to be circulated showing in what circumstances the situation in India might be brought to  theattention of the United Nations.G ab in e t Office,  S.
