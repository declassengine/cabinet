MINUTE confidential Annex(7th May, 19k6   -   11.0   a.m.)GERMANY The Cabinet had a preliminary exchangeof views on a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(Previous (CP. (246)  186) on future policy towards Germany.&quot;CM. (U6) 36th THE PRIME MINISTER said that this conclusions, memorandum posed the alternatives of continuingMinute 3) to work towards a unified (though federal! sed)&quot;&apos;Germany or seeking to promote the formation of a western German State or States which would be abulwark against the spread of communist influence from the east.      He did not at thisstage seek final conclusions, but he wished tohave a preliminary exchange of views with his cabinet colleagues before these issues were discussed with the Dominion Ministers,     His own view was that,  both on general grounds and because we had not the resources necessary to organise theBritish zone of Germany as a stable separate unit,the Foreign Secretary was right in suggesting thatthe general dangers of splitting Germany were greater than those of continuing our present-policy and that we might hope to avoid the dangers of excessive centralisation by encouragingpolitical development along federal lines.     Hehad recently received from the Deputy military governor of the Control Commission an appreciation,dated 5th May, of the effect of a further reduction or cessation of imports of food grainsinto the British zone.      This appreciation(which was rood to the Cabinet) showed the magnitude of the problems confronting our administration in Germany,  and afforded a strikingillustration of the economic and political difficulties with which we should be faced if weattempted now to build up Western Germany as aseparate unit.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that our acceptance of the conclusions of the BerlinConference   had put us in a very weak position.He believed that,  as time went on,  it would be generally recognised that the Berlin conclusionsregarding Germany had been unsound.      Meanwhile,the Russians wore maintaining their zone as aclosed area and denying to Western Germany a fair share of the food from the east;    and the executionof the agreed policy for reparations and for the-1-
reduction of the level of German industry,coupled with the inevitable food shortages,  wascreating conditions in our sone for which the blame was being laid at our door.     He was ingeneral agreement with the Foreign Secretary;&apos;view that we should continue to work towards a unified Germany,   though there should bo a muchgreater degree of decentralisation than in thepast.     Ho felt strongly,  however,  that in pursuing any such policy we must, while seeking to preserve good relations with the Russians,point out to them firmly and publicly theconsequences of their policy.&quot;    It was time thatthe Germans themselves and our other partners inthe occupation of Germany should! clearly under-stand where the fault lay.      At the same time,.weshould adopt a more positive and progressivesocialist policy in our zone,  in both economicand social matters, so that the democratic forcesin Germany should be encouraged and that we should stand out as the natural leaders of progressivedemocracy.      He did not accept the view that aclash with Russia was inevitable and he felt thatit would be possible for us,  while recognising the dangers inherent in the present Russian policy and developing a livelier leadership in Europe,  tokeep the way clear for the re-establishment of moreharmonious relations with the Soviet Union.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER saidthat he was concerned about the present positionin Germany.      Both politically and economicallywe seemed to be getting the worst of both worlds.He believed that our financial liabilities might even be increased if the policy of a unifiedGermany were adopted,  and he felt that this aspect of the matter would have to be considered before a final decision was reached.     Apart from this,;the arguments set out in paragraph 10 ofC.P.(U6) 186 in favour of working towards a unified Germany seemed to him conclusive.     Hewas strongly of opinion that we should avoiddrifting into an anti-Soviet policy.      He didnot acree with the -statement in paragraph 2 ofC.P.(ii6) 186 that &quot;the danger of Russia had become certainly as great as, and possibly even greater than, that of a revived Germany&quot;;    though he agreed with the statement in the following sentence that &quot;the-worst situation of all wouldbe a revived Germany in league with or dominated by Russia&quot;.     He hoped that any scheme for a unified Germany would provide for a large measureof decentralisation to Provincial Governments andfor the establishment cf the Ruhr as a. separate-province in which the industries would be owned by an international consortium.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that thescheme favoured by the Foreign Secretary seemedto be based on the grant of considerable-autonomous powers to the provinces, with a generaltendency to restrict the powers of the centre tothe barest minimum necessary for its co-ordinatingfunction.      A constitution imposed by the
victorious P.owers would be unpopular;    and it wasmistaken to suppose that we could establish and maintain a Federal system in Germany against the will of  the German people.      The fears expressedin G.P.(h6) 186 with regard to Russia seemed tobe exaggerated end insufficient recognition&quot; hadbeen given to the fact that the influence ofRussia inevitably weakened as it penetratedfurther to the west.     He agreed with the lord president that we should adopt a more positiveand progressive policy in Germany and should backthis up with suitable publicity.      Above all, itshould be recognised that in the end the Germanpeople would evolve their own political structure and that any attempt to impose on them conditionsalien to their natural development would fail.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that, while horecognised the force of the arguments advanced bythe Minister of Health, he was in general agree-merit with the conclusions reached in the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum.      It was impossible inpiresent conditions to determine our final policy.For the moment we must temporise.      He agreed,however,  that more vigorous steps should be takento publicise the British case.THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER saidthat it was difficult to reconcile our two aims of preventing the revival of Germany as a millitary power and encouraging the growth of a vigorousdemocratic system in Germany,      There would alsobe some difficulty in reconciling a federalpolitical system with a unified economic system.On balance, however, he saw no  alternative tothe lino suggested by the Foreign Secretary, short of abandoning our zone in Germany.      Russianinterests in other&apos;parts of the world wouldprobably limit their penetration into western europe.THE SECRETARY&quot; OF STATE FOR &quot;JAR saidthat if the proposal for a unified thoughfederalised Germany wore accepted  as our aim,we should have a stronger case to put to the world.Though i t wa a a11 r a ct i ve t o contemplate t he  ea rlywithdrawal of British troops from Germany, he himself believed  that&quot; we should have to maintain an Army of occupation there for some years if wowere to maintain conditions favourable to theestablishment of a strong social democracy inGermany.THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS pointed out that anyapparent inconsistencies in the policy suggestedin CP. (i+6) 186 were due to the need to steer acourse among the conflicting aims and policies inGermany.      Thus,  the French had always opposedpolitical unification, while  the Russians werein practice failing to carry out the agreement for economic unification.      He did not believethat publicising our case would suffice to remedy this situation unless we could secure more satisfactory economic conditions, and he attached
great importance to our insisting that russia should treat Germany,as an economic unit.      In?the last resort,  we -might for this purpose haveto suspend the operations for reducing the levelof German industry- in. our zone which we had undertaken in accordance with the BerlinAgreement.      With regard to the   point made bythe Minister of Kc-: 1th, he was sure that theForeign Secretary had no intention of seeking to impose a constitution on Germany against the will of the German people.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY of lancaster said that he was in general agreementwith the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion, providedthat in carding out any scheme of unificationaccount was taken of the views of the Germanpeople themselves.      He thought it important,however, to avoid. an,y scheme under which thecentral administration would consist of purelyco-ordinating bodies without effective control,or the separate provinces would remain underthe control of the separate Zone Commanders,since in either case there could be no prospectof building up an effective central administration.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.
