mCM. (U6) CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE united NATIONS In the course of the Cabinets discussionORGANISATION  about the proceedings in the Security Council or theDiscussions in     situation in Indonesia, THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said thatthe security council he suspected that the real objective of the SovietGovernment was to secure a foothold in South-East Asia.If they succeeded in their demand for an independent enquiry into the conduct of British troops in the dutch east Indies,  this would be a precedent for demanding theappointment of a similar Commission of enquiry in Indiaif disorders &quot;broke out there at the time of theconstitutional crisis which was now approaching.     Assoon as we had overcome the immediate difficulties inthe Security Council, we should consider very carefullyhow far the provisions of the United Nations Charter were likely to permit independent investigations into mattersof dispute within territories over which we exercisedsovereignty.      We might find ourselves in difficulty inthis respect &quot;by reason of the loose-knit organisation ofthe British Commonwealth:      for, while the SovietGovernment would not suggest that the Security council could concern itself with matters of dispute arising withinthe United Kingdom, they might he able to maintain the contention that the Council could concern itself withdisputes in British dependencies overseas.      This was aill possibility which the British Commonwealth must considervery seriously as soon as the First General Assembly ofthe United Nations Organisation was concluded.The Cabinet should also consider the intentions of the Soviet Government.      Their attitude towards Turkey
and Persia, their claims to former Italian Colonies in north Africa, and their attempt to secure the intervention of the Security Council in Greece all pointed to a desireto reduce British influence in the Mediterranean.      this made it more than ever important that we should proceed without delay with the revision of the Egyptian Treaty;    fora satisfactory Treaty with Egypt was the clue to continuedBritish influence with the Arab States in the Middle East.In the discussion which followed THE MINISTER OPHEALTH said that he doubted whether the prospects were quite so black as the Foreign Secretary suggested.      Therecent proceedings in the Security Council had enhancedBritish prestige in the eyes of the world, and the cabinet were indebted to the Foreign Secretary for the skilful way in which he had handled these discussions.      The foreign secretary had referred to the solidarity of Communists in allcountries.      The Minister had thought it significant,however, that in the recent proceedings in the security council the Polish representative, though a Communist, had expressed views contrary to those of the Soviet Delegation.He had othe^ evidence that in countries bordering on theSoviet Union there were growing signs of distaste for someaspects of Soviet rule.      It might be that the Communistwave in Europe was about to recede.      We must not,  therefore,allow Russian intransigence to drive us into an untenableposition in foreign policy.      The right course at thepresent time was to maintain our position and awaitdevelopments.      He himself believed that the foreign policyof the Soviet Government was influenced by the extent oftheir internal difficulties, both economic and social.There was no doubt that there was great internal stress inRussia to-day.11th February, 19u7
7In connection with the discussion on theappointment of a Special Commissioner for South-east asia (recorded in CM. (1+6)  ll+th Conclusions, Minute 2)THE FOREIGN SECRETARY recalled the public criticism ofrecent diplomatic appointments and said that he was aware that some supporters of the Government were anxiousto see more drastic changes made in the staffing of theForeign Office and diplomatic posts abroad.      It was notpossible for him to make the sweeping changes which somecritics desired;    but he was talcing steps to strengthen the staff, as opportunities arose.    When Lord Killtfarntook up his new appointment as Special Commissioner for south East Asia, he would be replaced in Cairo bySir Ronald I. Campbell.      In Greece, he had asked theWar Office to post General Scobie to another appointment and his place would be taken by General Crawford.Sir Rex Leeper would also be moved from Athens to anotherpost.      Mr.  le Rougetel was shortly to be moved fromBucharest.      In Chungking there would be little politicalwork for the time being, and he was taking this opportunityof sending out as our representative there a man with experience in the Consular Service who would be able todevelop the commercial side of the work.      Changes were also beinf made within the Foreign Office.11th February ^ 19u7
