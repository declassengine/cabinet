(1+6)   22ND CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 6Confidential Annex(8th March, 191+6   -   11.15 a.m.  )EMERGENCYPOWERSkCT, 1920Supply andTransportOrganisationThe Cabinet considered a memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP. (1+6.)  87)  embodying thereport of a Committee appointed by the Prime Ministerto consider the revival of the supply and transport organisation, which in the period between the twowars had been held in readiness to operate under theEmergency Powers Act, 1920, for the purpose ofmaintaining essential services in times of widespreadindustrial disturbances.The Committee had reached the conclusionthat, if such an organisation were to be re-created,all sections of the community, including employersand trades unions, should be invited to &quot;recognisethat any such organisation must be the instrument ofa national rather than a sectional interest, and thattheir co-operation would be necessary in its framingand, if the need should arise, in its operation&quot;.The Committee had therefore prepared a statement(annexed to CPi (1+6)  87) of the principles whichshould govern the establishment of such an organisation;    and they suggested that,  if this statement of principles were approved by the Cabinet,the question of creating an organisation for these purposes should be taken up in confidence withrepresentatives of employers and trade   unions afterParliament had passed the Trade Unions and TradeDisputes Bill.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said that,although he had been a member of the Committee, hecould not support its recommendations.      He himselfbelieved that the Government should make no suchpreparations in advance for maintaining essential services in the event of widespread industrialdisturbances.      An organisation, on the lines ofthe Supply and Transport Organisation must, if it wasto work efficiently, be elaborate and costly;    andit would be impossible to prevent its existence from becoming known.      The Government would, he thought,find it highlj&apos;- embarrassing to defend in Parliamenttheir action in creating such an organisation.      hewart /ould not himself be prepared to defend the use forthese purposes of the regional organisation of theMinistry of Health.      In any event he doubted whetherit was practicable to prepare in advance plans for meeting a purely hypothetical situation.      The right
organisation could not &quot;be framed until it was knownwhat situation it would have to meet..     different types of organisation might be appropriate for different kinds of strike and in different parts ofthe country.-     In these circumstances, v/hile he agreed that it was a responsibility of Governmentto see that essential services were maintained inthe event of widespread industrial disturbances,he was strongly of opinion that no preparations for this purpose should he made in advance, andthat the Government should rely on improvisingarrangements at the last moment to meet the particularkind of situation with which they were faced.There was general agreement that theGovernment must accept the responsibility for seeing that, in the circumstances contemplated by theEmergency Powers Act, 1920 (which might arise, notonly from industrial disputes, but also as a resultof action taken by political extremists), there wasno widespread or lasting break-down of services essential to the public safety and the life of thecommunity.      Discussion then turned on the questionwhether preparations should be made in advance toenable the Government to discharge that responsibility.On this point THE PRIME MINISTER saidthat he could not accept the argument that no plans should he made until the nature of the emergency was known.      By that time it might be too late to make effective arrangements:    and plans improvised in ahurry at the last moment were likely to contain thevery defects which it was desired to avoid, e.g.  inthe choice of persons to assume positions of localresponsibility in an emergency.      He also cited the analogy of war preparations, which were made - andhad to be made - against hypothetical contingencies.Finally, he pointed out that failure to make preparations in advance would increase the risk thatat the last moment undue reliance would be placed on military assistance.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY,  THE FIRST LORD OFTHE ADMIRALTY and other Ministers endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister.      In the discussion,however, the point was stressed that these preparationsneed not be carried at present beyond the stage of a paper plan.      Planning could be confined to senior officials in the Whitehall Departments mainly concerned:    there need be no consultation with regionalofficials and no communication of plans to regional headquarters:    and no persons outside the government service need be brought into consultation at thepresent stage.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that thepreliminary work should include the preparation of draft Regulations to be made under the emergency powers Act, 1920.
Having agreed that some preparations must he made in advance to meet&apos; such an emergency, the Cabinetnext considered whether it would be expedient to bringrepresentatives of employers&apos; organisations and tradeunions into confidential consultation in the making ofthese preparations,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said that,in making this proposal, the Committee had been influenced by the consideration that the creation of an organisation on the lines of the Supply and Transport organisation would involve far-reaching consultations with officials of numerous Departments;    that the preparations whichwere thus being made were likely to become known;    andthat, if the matter were raised in Parliament, an awkwardpolitical situation would arise unless the Governmentwere able to say that they were acting in consultationwith representatives of the employers&apos; organisations andtrade unions.It was pointed out that, if planning were confined to the preparation of a paper scheme by a small number of senior officials in Whitehall Departments, therewas no reason to fear any public disclosure.      If,however, the Government were asked in Parliament whetherthey had made preparations to meet such an emergency,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would himself he preparedto take the line that it was the duty of any Government tobe prepared for such a contingency and he would not seek to conceal the fact that a paper scheme had been prepared.He would, however, decline to disclose the details of that scheme.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY - said that in his view it would be inexpedient to bring representatives of theemployers or trades unions into consultation in thepreparation of such a scheme.      The trades unions would expect the Government to be ready to maintain essential services in an emergency;    but if they were asked inadvance to collaborate in devising an organisation forthis purpose, they might regard this as an invitation to assist in building up a strike-breaking organisation-.THE FIRST LORD OP THE ADMIRALTY supported this view.THE-MINISTER OF LABOUR and THE SECRETARY OP STATE FORSCOTLAND said that,  although they had supported therecommendation made by the Committee, they were nowopposed, on further reflection, to any advance consultationwith&quot; the trade   unions.The Cabinet -(1) Approved the first two paragraphs of the note annexed to CP. (2+6)  87, as astatement of. the general principles on which preparations should be madefor maintaining in a civil emergencyservices essential to the public safety and the life of the community?
(2) Agreed, that such preparations should be madein advance;    but directed that these shouldbe confined to the preparation of a paperscheme by a small number of senior officials in the Whitehall Departments mainly concerned,that no communication of this scheme (whetherby way of sealed instructions or otherwise)should be made to the regional- headquarters of Government Departments, -and that special care should be taken to reduce the risk ofany public disclosure of these preparations.(3) Agreed that it was a responsibility ofGovernment to operate any organisationrequired for maintaining essential services in a civil emergency;    and decided that representatives of employers&apos;  organisations and trade   unions should not be brought into consultation in advance, as contemplated inthe third paragraph of the Statement annexed to CP. (2+65 87.(1+)  Invited the Home Secretary to arrange forfurther preparations to proceed in accordancewith conclusion (2)  above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.\
