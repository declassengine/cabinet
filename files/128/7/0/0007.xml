The   :announcement that those invitations had been/       issued, which had been made on the previous day,/ i     had made it clear that/if the members of the two mainparties or of one of them were unwilling to acceptthe invitations,  an interim Government would be formed which would be as representative as poserlbleof those willing to accept the statement of 16thMay.      Though the first Hindu reactions to theannouncement seemed favourable,  there was reason to fear that the Congress Party would make difficulties about accepting&apos; the invitations.      Itwas possible that,   to ease these difficulties,  theViceroy might be pressed to include Sarat Bosein place of one of the other Congress representatives.There were objections  to his inclusion on accountof certain of his past activities,  and the viceroy and the Mission had  therefore sought guidance on whether,  if this point was pressed,  the viceroy should yield.In discussion,  there was very warmappreciation of the untiring efforts  of theMission and the Viceroy to bring the negotiations to a successful close;    and the view was expressed that,  thoucrh the outstanding difficulty must not hicomplyrealising to the full the objections to theinclusion of Sarat Bdsc in the interim Government,the Cabinet felt that it would be a mistake to jeopardise the successful conclusion of thenegotiations simply on this account.The Cabinet -(l)    Invited the Prime Minister to seek theapproval of His Majesty to Sarat Boso&apos;appointment to the interim government if the Congress Party should press forthis.-1-

A policyof remaining in the whole of India and firmly acceptingresponsibility for law and order would result,  if  oneIndian Army remained loyal, in an acceptable milit. ryCommitment and would safeguard our long-term strategic interests.      If the Indian o,rmy did not remain loyal,as might happen if the situation was not handledfirmly,  it might be necessary, if we were not toabandon India ignomlniously,  to provide five british divisions as reinforcements, with the consequentabandonment of commitments in the Middle East, Greece,Italy and Germany,  and with serious effects on our import and export programmes and on the demobilisationscheme.The Defence Committee had endorsed these conclusions and. had invited the Chiefs of Staff toprepare plans to meet the situation if we adopted apolicy of remaining in the whole of India and theIndian&apos;Army did not remain loyal.      They had alsoinvited the Minister of Transport to prepare plans for the early evacuation of British women and children from Indie and had agreed in principle that no furtherwomen and children should be embarked for India fromthis country.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the DefenceCommittee had taken the view that it would not bedesirable to take any overt action at the moment to reinforce our troops in India.

THE PAELIAMEfi&quot;TARY UNDER-SECRETORY OF STATEFOR INDIA recalled that the Defence Committee had agreed in principle that no further women and children should he embarked for India while the presentsituation existed.      Some 250 women and children had &apos;already booked passages to sail for India before theend of June,      It would be difficult to cancel thesepassages and the Viceroy had now said that he did notthink it necessary to prevent these women and children from sailing-:g;/g;p V.g .vW &apos;The Cabinet -(3)    Agreed that, until the situation wasclearer, no further action should be takento prevent women and children sailing fromthe United kingdom for India.Effect on    ^ ,    _^ The Cabinet next considered a memorandum byf 0 re i gn V&quot;   t he), S e c re t a ry u^f-SUta-te-;f er^-^er-e-i-g-n-^f f-a-i-r-relations (CP. (46) 222) regarding the possible effect uponforeign relations of developments in India.      Thememorandum set out the circumstances in which thesituation could be referred to  the United nations    SH?g-&amp;n-i-sa-M-on- on the initiative of either a foreign^        government or the Government of the United kingdom or of India.      The conclusion reached was that such a reference would have serious repercussions on our prestige and would not, so far as could be seen,bring any practical Help either to us or to India.Accordingly the intervention of the United NationsGrgcanfsa-tr-on should be avoided or,  if proposed by another Power,  be resisted..      The memoraandum alsoconcluded that any appearance that we were abandoningour position in India without a solution would immediately weaken our world position.      Equally/thepremature withdrawal of British forces from Germany,Italy, Greece or the Middle East,  or the withdrawalof Indian forces from Indonesia, would weaken most seriously our influence in those areas.In discussion it was pointed out that paragraph 16 of CP. (46) 222 was not meant tosuggest that we should, at this stage communicate tothe United States Government the hypothetical courses of action which we had under considerationbutmerely that we should inform them, once we had decided on a particular course of action.The Cabinet -(h)    Took note of CP. (46) 222.-3-
A possiblealternativeconstitutionfor aninterimGovernmentThe Cabinet then discussed thememorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for India (CP.   (46) 321) outlining apossible constitution which would give India,pending the working out of her permanentconstitution,  an interim Government elected bya federal legislature and with the maximumstatutory independence of control by Whitehall.STATS POP INDIAput forward as ;considering,  aspresent regime,- ?.: LtA MEN TARY UNDER SECRETARY OPexplained that the proposals worei course which might he worthan alternative to a return to theif the present negotiations &quot;broke down over the composition of the interim Government.The main feature    of the proposals would be a federal legislature consisting of a single chambercomposed of some 250 members elected by theprovincial legislatures and of a maximum of 125members from the States.      The federal ministry would be appointed by the Governor General afterelection by the federal legislature,  arrangements being made to ensure a proper proportion betweenthe various communities.      The powers of theCentral Government -would be based on the federal list and concurrent list in the Government of India Act,1935, but the provincial legislatures would beable to withdraw from the federal legislature anyitem in either list other than defence and external affairs and the means to execute them.The proposals would involve the passageof a short Bill throirgh^-a.rdi-ament--d-n--thise-euntry. . *In discussion it was pointed out thatthe scheme was based on the assumption that boththe major communities would be willing to help to run it.      Would there in point of fact heany assurance that they would do so?      It wasalso felt that difficulties would arise if somebut not all provinces withdrew a subject fromthe federal legislature.      In the case of currencyor customs,  for instance, this would be bound to cause trouble.    In any event it was felt that itwould be well to obtain the views of the CcbinetMission in India before.-pursuing the proposalsfurther.The Cabinet -(5)    Took, note of C. P.   (46) 221.
