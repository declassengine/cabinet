C.M.(k6)  18TH CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE 2(25th February, 19^6 - 11 a. m.)In addition to the points noted inC.M.(il6)  18th Conclusions, Minute 2,   the following points were made in the course of  the Cabinet&apos;s discussion:-(a) THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION said that one ofthe Spanish Republicans who had been shot was a very goodman,  and his execution was a deliberate affront to GreatBritain and France.(b) THE MINISTER OF FUEL AND POWER said that,although we were on good terms with M. Salazar,  there seemed to be some possibility of collusion between him andGeneral Franco.THE MINISTER OF STATE said that he would notbe surprised if there were such collusion,  though theForeign Office had no evidence of it.(c) THE MINISTER OF HEALTH referred to the revival of the influence of the Roman Catholic Churchthroughout Europe and particularly in Spain.(d) THE MINISTER OF EDUCATION asked whether Itwas not possible to apply some effective sanctions againstthe Franco Government.      Words alone would not secure itsoverthrow.      Need we continue to supply Spain with oil?(e) THE MINISTER OF STATE said that responsibleRepublicans in Spain   were anxious that no steps shouldbe taken which would precipitate civil war.      Nor wouldthey favour economic action which would penalise the mass of the Spanish people without causing muchinconvenience to General Franco&apos;s immediate supporters.
They also doubted whether it was expedient that a republican Government should come into power at thepresent moment, when it would have to face a seriousfood  crisis for which the Franco Government should bear the responsibility.(f) THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that,  while he agreed with much that the Minister of State had said,he would himself go further and point out that it wouldbe a great spiritual reinforcement to Republican forces in spain if they could be given some overt sign that thisLabour Government in the United Kingdom were sympathetictowards them.      In his view the Cabinet should consider what active steps could be talcen by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto assume the leadership among Socialist parties in Europe,especially in Spain.Cabinet Office, S.W.  1.
