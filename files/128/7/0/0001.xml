J^.CM. (U6)  1 ST CONCLUSIONS. MINUTE confidential Annex(1st January,  1 9I4.6 - 1 T a. m. )In the course of his account of the proceedings at the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers in Moscow,the Foreign Secretary referred to exchanges of views which had taken place on the following subjects ininformal conversations with Marshal Stalin andM. Molotov;-Mediterranean (i) Marshal Stalin had referred to the suggestion,put forward at the first meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers,  that the Soviet Government might beinvited to undertake trusteeship of Tripolitania.      Hehad expressed regret that the United kingdom Government;had not felt able to support this suggestion, and suggested that we had distrusted their intentions in&apos;this matter.      The Foreign Secretary had&apos; said that itwas not a question of mistrust:    we preferred to avoidcompetition with the Soviet Government in this area.Marshal Stalin had then said that he was anxious that the British should not leave Egypt.      The.foreign secretary said that we should shortly be undertaking a revision of the Egyptian&apos;Treaty, and he hoped thathe could rely on sympathetic support from the SovietGovernment in our negotiations with the egyptian government.      Marshal Stalin had promised such support..(ii) Marshal Stalin had. spoken with sympathy and understanding of our policy towards India.      He had referred to the dangers of a separatist movement inIndia,  and he expressed the hope that India would remain within the British Commonwealth,,      It was clear thathe was more apprehensive of trouble from India and theFar East than from the Balkans.(iii) Both Marshal Stalin and Ml Molotov had evidentlyfeared that it might be our intention to incorporateIndonesia within the British Commonwealth.;       TheForeign Secretary had given them a clear assurance thatwe had no such designs.      He had, however, explainedthat the Dutch had claims to these territories whichwe could not ignore and it was our policy to promotean amicable settlement between the Dutch Government andthe Indonesian leaders.      There had been a frankexchange of views, which should have removed any possible source of misunderstanding between ourselves and the Soviet Government on this question.MEETING of foreign ministers INMOSCOWIndiaDutch east indies
/withdrawal of       - (iv) The Foreign Secretary said that he had tried,.11 led Troops     without success,  to secure some agreement about thewithdrawal of Allied troops from Austria.      When he sought to raise this question, M. Molotov had evadedthe issue by bringing forward allegations that theBritish military authorities were supporting Fascistelements in Austria.      Similar charges had been made about the attitude of the British military authoritiesin Germany.      The Foreign Secretary had disposed ofthese imputations against British Commanders, but hehad not been able  to bring the&apos;discussion back to- the&apos;question of withdrawal of Allied troops from Austria.The Foreign Secretary said that it was clearthat the Soviet Government were not yet ready todiscuss this question.      It was his impression thatthey were anxious, for domestic reasons, not to bringany more of their troops back into Russia during thecoming winter.      The internal position in Russia wasnot, he thought, very -satisfactory.      War damage wasextensive;    and the administration were finding greatdifficulty in arranging for an industrial machinehighly geared for war to be  turned over to peace-time production.      It was doubtful whether the soviet authorities   would be able to enforce in future the samerigid control over labour as they had exercised beforethe war      Food was also short,  and from that point ofview also the Soviet Government found advantages in keeping large numbers of troops in occupied territory.It seemed likely, however, that the SovietGovernment would wish to propose large-scale-withdrawals of Allied forces of occupation,  as a gesture,  in connection with the proposed PeaceConference - possibly in the spring or early summer of 1946..      If so,   they would probably propose the simultaneous withdrawal of Allied Armies of occupationthroughout the world - including the withdrawal ofBritish troops from Greece and of United States troops from China.In the discussion which followed the foreign secretary&apos;s&apos; statement,  the following points were made:-(a) THE MINISTER OF HEALTH asked whether the SovietGovernment were likely to relax their rule prohibitingforeign aircraft from flying over Soviet territory.&apos;   THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had raisedthis question with Marshal Stalin, who was quiteadamant on the point.      There was no    doubt that theSoviet authorities were still highly reluctant to afford foreigners facilities for observing what was going on within Soviet territory.      The country was,in fact,  passing through&apos; a phase of great economicdisturbance and difficulty.      The Foreign secretary said that it might be helpful to relations betweenthe two countries if he made some public referenceto the economic difficulties which confronted theSoviet Government at the present time.(b) Reference was made to the attitude of Francetowards agreements reached at Three-Power. Meetings.
THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he would have preferred that Prance should be associated with these discussions,  and he hoped that there would be noregular meetings of the three Foreign Ministers afterthe meeting in Washington which had already been mooted.It must, however, be recognised that both the Russians,and to a lesser extent the Americans, were at presentunwilling to treat France as a first-class Power;    andthe French did not improve  the position by theirtendency to make claims disproportionate to theirpresent strength.      The Foreign Secretary added thatit was his policy to promote a closer understanding-be tween this country and Prance, and that our diijlomaticcontacts with the French, from the Foreign Ministerdownwards,  were close and cordial.      It was, however,difficult to translate this understanding into terrasof practical action.      Thus, while we were anxious to resume commercial relations and the Chancellor of theExchequer had agreed to set aside a substantial amountof currency for the &quot;purchase of French goods,  theeconomic dislocation of France was so great that it wasproving very difficult to promote a flow of trade.The French were also disposed,  instead of building up their international position by a series of agreements on smaller issues on which agreement could readily bereached,  to insist on raising major questions whichwere not ,yet ripe for international discussion, e.g*the control of the Ruhr.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.
