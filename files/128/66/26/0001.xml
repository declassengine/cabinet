CONFIDENTIALKtjLIAMENTARY     I. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken infAlRS the House of Commons during the period 14-18 January. Followingthe acceptance in principle of a recommendation of the ProcedureCommittee, the House would be asked to agree that it should sitfrom 9. 30 am to 3. 00 pm on Friday, 18 January and on subsequentFridays,The Cabinet -Took note.REIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidFAIRS that, after last-minute problems caused by Mr Mugabe&apos;s publicattitude to the cease-fire arrangements and by the adverse reactionidesia of Bishop Muzorewa, it was now agreed that the final documents ofthe Conference would be signed by all concerned (including theirious Lord Privy Seal as well as himself) at Lancaster House onerence: 21 December.    The main scene of action would now shift from;79) 25th London to Salisbury.    Many problems sti.ll lay ahead, particularlyidusions as regards the operation of the cease-fire;  although Mr Mugabe&apos;sJute 3 military commander, Mr Tongogara, seemed disposed to make itwork, Mr Mugabe1 s own attitude was less clear.    But it wassatisfactory that Britain had at last been able to lift all sanctionsagainst Rhodesia without provoking counter-action against Britishinterests or the break-up of the Commonwealth.The Cabinet -1. Took note and congratulated the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary and the Lord PrivySeal on their outstanding achievement in the faceof so many difficulties.ted States THE PRIME MINISTER said that she and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary had been most warmly received duringtheir recent visit to Washington and New York.    She had madeclear to President Carter that Britain would support any UnitedStates move to secure a Security Council determination againstIran under Chapter Seven of the United Nations Charter.    She hadalso raised with him the outstanding order of arms for the RoyalUlster Constabulary (RUC), making clear that it would be taken asa major victory for the Irish Republican Army if these arms did notarrive when they would be needed early in 1980.    The President hadreplied that the difficulty lay with the United States Congress, who1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcwould not at present a.gree to the order being fulfilled.    In talkingto the United States Secretary for Defense, Dr Brown, she hadstressed the importance of more British military equipment beingbought by the Americans to counter-balance Britain&apos;s largepurchases of United States equipment.    Here again the maindifficulty appeared to be Congressional.    Both these subjects wouldneed to be pursued further including the surprising inability ofBritish arms manufacturers to produce suitable weapons for theRUC.    Despite these matters, however, the extent ofPresident Carter&apos;s goodwiU towards Britain was most marked.His recent help during the final stages of the Rhodesian negotiationshad been a striking example of this.aneviousefer ence:C(79) 25thonclu sionslimit e 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that itremained unclear what would happen to the United States hostagesin Tehran and indeed whose authority their captors would acceptsThe longer the situation dragged on, the greater the danger ofinternal disintegration in Iran from which only the Soviet Unionwould benefit;  and the more difficult the position of the United StatesGovernment, despite the dramatic rise in President Carter&apos;spersonal popularity.    The Americans seemed to have decided notto try, for the time being, to impose sanctions via a Chapter Sevendetermination in the Security Council, where they might well not beable to muster the necessary votes.    In the absence of such adetermination it would not be easy for Britain to agree to variouseconomic and financial steps which had been proposed by theAmericans.    But France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland seemedready to take at least some of these steps and it would be difficultnot to follow their example.    The problem would be furtherconsidered later that day at a meeting of the Ministers principallyconcerned, under the Prime Minister&apos;s chairmanship.    Britain&apos;sposition remained uncomfortably exposed, not least because so manyof Iran&apos;s overseas assets were held in London;   and action againstthe British Embassy in Tehran could not be excluded.The Cabinet -2.Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL330
(CONFIDENTIALMMUNITY 3. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at the 18 DecemberTTAIRS meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council we had blocked agreementon the Commissions proposals for the non-quota section of theevious Regional Fund because they gave too much to France at the expensetference: of the United Kingdom and were inconsistent with the objective of0(79) 25th greater economic convergence as reaffirmed at the Dublin Europeaninclusions, Council.    On Rhodesia, it had been agreed informally in thenute 4 margins of the Council that the Commission would put forwardproposals enabling the Community to give preferential tradetreatment to imports from Rhodesia.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that,in the light of Press reports suggesting that the Commission wouldtake no further action for the time being against France despite theirillegal restrictions on imports of British lamb, he had spoken thatmorning to Commissioner Gundelach.    The latter had assured himthat he had received authority from the Commission to institutefurther proceedings against France when the European Court resumedwork after the Christmas recess if the French had not by thenopened their frontiers to British exports.    Commissioner Gundelachhad also invited him to provide the Commission with an assessmentof the financial damages suffered by the United Kingdom as a resultof the illegal action of the French.    It might not be easy to calculatethe losses suffered by producers, but it should be possible toquantify the loss to the Exchequer by reference to the cost of thefat sheep guarantee scheme.The Cabinet -Took note.aiTISHEYLANDteviou seference:C(79) 25thdelusions,inute 24. The Cabinet had before them a letter dated 19 Decemberfrom the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Industryto the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister covering both a draftParliamentary Statement on British Leyland (BL) and a letter, alsodated 19 December, from Sir Michael Edwardes, Chairman of BL,to the Secretary of State for Industry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that followingdiscussion in the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy onthe previous day he proposed making a statement to Parliament thatafternoon indicating that the Government had received the BL 1980Corporate Plan;  a request to provide the necessary funds to supportit to the end of the financial year 1980-81;  and a letter from theChairman of BL describing the circumstances in which the BL BoardCONFIDENTIAL331

The Committee had agreed that, given theconditions described in Sir Michael Edwardes&apos; letter, it was preparedto authorise funding for a further year as requested by BL.    It wouldbe his intention to make this letter available to Parliament at thesame time as he made his statement.    If he were then asked whatwould happen if the Company abandoned the Plan he would make itclear that there would have to be a mixture of closures and disposalsof the Company&apos;s assets.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the decision bf the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy.    They also approved the proposed ParliamentaryStatement on BL subject to amendments to take account of the pointsmade in discussion..The Cabinet -1.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government wereindebted to Sir Leo Pliatzky for his excellent report on non-Departmental public bodies, on which Ministers had now beenconsulted.    The main lesson was that the Government should takea much more critical attitude to proposals to establish neworganisations.    There should be early consultation wi h the Treasuryand the Civil Service Department about any proposals for newexecutive-type bodies;  and Ministers should be particularly waryof any proposals to &quot;hive-off&quot; Departmental functions to non-Departmental bodies which tended to be extravagant in staff andexpenditure.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the report should be published as a White Paperin the New Year, and that the Government should announce theirgeneral endorsement by way of a Written Answer to a ParliamentaryQuestion, which would also summarise the savings so far achieved.The Lord President should undertake a mopping up operation withDepartmental Ministers in the autumn of next year, to ensure thatdecisions had been taken on cases which were still in the pipeline.There should be further reviews of non-Departmental public bodiesfrom time to time, on the lines suggested in the report.CONFIDENTIAL332

SECRET(iHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 00CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6 JThursday 20 December 1979 at 9.00 amJBRIKERS AND The Cabinet had before them a minute from the Secretary of StateHpP le ME NT AR Y   for Industry to the Prime Minister, dated 28 November 1979,pNEFIT discussing the question of the supplementary benefit paid to thefamilies of strikers, and a minute from the Chancellor of theExchequer to the Prime Minister, dated 18 December, clarifyingthe legal position on the payment of tax refunds to strikers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that there hadbeen several discussions in the Sub-Committee on Economic Affairsof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on possible waysof altering the payment of Supplementary Benefit to the families ofstrikers, so as to encourage trade unions to bear a share of thecosts.    All the possible measures had their own difficulties, andafter further consultation with the colleagues most closely concerned -the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State forEmployment, and the Secretary of State for Social Services - he nowrecommended the proposals in his minute as being a suitable packageto implement the Manifesto commitment to take action in this field.Apart from considering the proposals themselves, the Cabinet wouldneed to give particular attention to what should be said in the SecondReading debate on the Social Security Bill, which woulct take placein the House of Commons that afternoon.In discussion the following main points were made -a. Whatever the administrative complexities ofadopting another course, it would be wholly inequitableto &quot;deem&quot; that non-unionists received strike pay whenquite clearly they would not.    Besides providing a sourceof propaganda for trade union recruitment, such a propositionwould be unacceptable to many of the Governmentssupporters.1SECRET334
GSECRETb. The concept of reducing the benefit entitlement ofthe dependants of people who voluntarily went on strike wasdefensible.    Before 1966, it had been generally acceptedthat the State had no responsibility for supporting strikersor their families, and the entitlement of strikers1 familiesto benefit had been introduced more or less inadvertently.There was now a widespread feeling in the country that thesystem had been abused, and that a return to something nearerthe pre-1966 situation was desirable.c. Legislation to deal with this subject wOuld beintensely controversial.    It would be desirable to avoidadditional controversy with the trade unioris in the next fewmonths when relations with them would be in a delicate state.d. It was a proper function of trade unions to providefinancial support for their members during strikes. Ifearly legislation were ruled out the Government shouldnevertheless bring public pressure on trade unions torecognise their responsibilities.    The threat of futurelegislation could provide an effective reinforcement of thispressure.e. While the Social Security Bill contained powers whichcould be used to &quot;deem&quot; income not necessarily received,the/ had not been devised with strikers in mind.    There wasthus a dilemma.    If the powers might later be used to affectthe entitlement of strikers&apos; families to supplementary benefitit would be necessary to warn the House, on Second Reading,of this possibility.    But if the Government then decided topursue a different course of action, for which the powers inthe Social Security Bill were not appropriate, a great deal ofunnecessary controversy would have been caused at aninopportune moment.f. If the Government did not warn the House of the fullimplications of the powers sought in the draft legislation,including its potential applicability to strikers&apos; families, theyrisked challenge about their intentions in the course of debateand might be accused of seeking to act by stealth.    Failure tomake the legal position clear, therefore, could effectivelydebar the Government from using the powers in the Bill tosupport its policies on Supplementary Benefit for strikers.Thus any powers required to support whatever scheme wasfinally agreed by the Cabinet would have to be taken in freshlegislation.2SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had serious misgivings about the package of proposalsbefore them.    In particular they were not prepared to accept thatnon-unionists should be &quot;deemed&quot; to receive strike pay. Furtherconsideration would need to be given to alternative approaches andshe would consider how best this might be arranged.    As to theSecond Reading of the Social Security Bill the Cabinet agreed thatthe Secretary of State for Social Services should not volunteer theinformation that the powers it contained could be used to &quot;deem&quot;the receipt of strike pay.    They accepted that this meant that thepowers could not be so used.    If pressed the Secretary of Statewould be free to say that the Government had no iritention of usingthe powers in the Bill for this purpose. /The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister1 s summing up of their discussion andinvited the Secretary of State for Social Servicesto be guided accordingly.2. Agreed that it was not their intention to usethe powers in the Social Security Bill for &quot;deeming&quot;income for the purposes of determining entitlementto Supplementary Benefit by strikers1 families.3. Agreed that, in any scheme to deal with theproblem of strikers and Supplementary Benefit,non-unionists should not be &quot;deemed&quot; to receivestrike pay.Cabinet Office21 December 19793SECRET33
