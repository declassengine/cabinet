SECRETIS THE PROPERTY OF HER.BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 36CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 11th ConclusionsMonday 23 July 1979 at 10. 30 amThe Cabinet resumed its discussion of public expenditure in 1980-81.ITURE     In addition to the papers considered at their earlier meeting, theCabinet had before them a minuta from the Chancellor of the Exchequerto the Prime Minister, dated 20 July, reporting further discussionse; in the Ministerial Group on Public Expenditure (MISC 11) about theloth Environment programmes;  and a minute dated 20 July from thejons, Secretary of State for Education about the proposed reductions in theEducation programmes.In discussion of individual programmes, the following points weremade:-a. Environment Programmes.   It was noted that agreementhad been reached in MISC 11 on reductions of  1, 000 millionin housing programmes;  of  54 million in the programmesof the Property Services Agency;  and of  225 million onother Department of the Environment services.    The Cabinetdid not favour a suggestion that higher rate relief onmortgage interest payments should be withdrawn as a counter-balance to the proposed increases in council house rents.The reduction in higher tax rates in the Budget had sharplyraised the real cost of mortgages to those paying the highertax rates and the maximum mortgage on which relief wasgranted had been held to  25, 000 without adjustment forinflation.b. Education and Science.    It was argued that cuts of 40 million in the provision for school transport wouldinvolve substantial increases in charges, particularly inrural areas.    On the other hand, there was a strong casefor rationalising the present arrangements for schooltransport.    Power might therefore be taken in the EducationBill to allow local authorities to charge for school transport,leaving it to them to decide the extent of provision.    It wouldbe reasonable to take credit for savings of  20 million in thefirst year if this were done, without specifying precisely theconsequences, which would be for individual authorities to1SECRET121
SECRETwork out.    On student grants, it was pointed out that there wouldhe considerable opposition to the changes in the minimumparental contribution which would be required tc achieve theproposed reductions.    These would bear particularly hardly onmiddle-income families.    The  20 million savings on this scoremight be forgone, and a further  10 million found from otherparts of the Higher Education Budget.     10 million should betaken from the allocation for science.    The reduction inprovision for under-fives should be confined to  20 million,which would leave provision in 1980-81 at about this year&apos;s level.c. Arts and Libraries.    Despite the considerable presentationaldifficulties, reductions of  28 million were agreed on thisprogramme.d. Health. A reduction of  85 million was agreed, noting thatthe health programmes had already bad to absorb the additional 45 million cost of the Value Added Tax increase in the Budget.e. Personal Social Services.    Reductions of  118 million wereagracd, noting that, this involved a cut of almost 10 per cent inthe services provided.f. Social Security.   The original proposals by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, involving abolition of death grant, anincrease in the pension age for women, and other measures, werepolitically impracticable.    As an alternative it had been suggestedthat the waiting days for sickness and unemployment benefit shouldbe increased from 3 to 6.    Another, and more attractive, way offinding most of the money forgone would be through additionalanti-fraud measures, provided the Department were allowed torecruit additional staff for the purpose.    It was noted that otherDepartments might be able to make comparable savings from therecruitment of additional staff, but there were strong politicalreasons for singling out Social Security fraud for special treat-ment.    The Department of Health and Social Security should beallowed to employ an additional 600 staff on anti-fraud workaiming at a net saving of  30 million a year, and more ifpossible.   Claims for additional staff by other Departments forsimilar work should be resisted.    Savings totalling  222 millionwere agreed on this basis.g. HMSO, CSD and COI.    The cuts proposed by MISC 11 wereagreed.h. Scottish Office.    A recalculation of the figures since theMISC 11 discussions suggested that the appropriate cut was 272 million subject to adjustment in the light of the Cabinet1 sdecisions on individual programmes.    Precise figures shouldbe agreed in MISC 11 and reported back to the Cabinet on26 July.2SECRET122
SECRETi.     Welsh Office.   Although a pro-rata allocation of thecuts made for English programmes suggested a reductionof  110 million, there was a strong case for preferentialtreatment for Wales, based on manifesto commitments tomaintain the road programme, which lagged behind that inEngland, and on the need to offset the effects of steel andcoal closures.    There was also evidence that the generalprovision of public services in Wales was below that in therest of the country.    As with Scotland precise figuresshould be agreed in MISC 11 and reported back to the Cabinet,j.     Northern Ireland.   A pro rata allocation suggested areduction of  111 million, even though this would lead toincreasing unemployment at a time when the securitysituation was still highly critical.    A reduction of  90 millionmight be practicable.    MISC 11 should look at this togetherwith Scotland and Wales.k.    Coal.    The Secretary of State for Energy was inseparate discussion with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,about the level of finance for the coal industry. Theconclusions should be reported to Cabinet.1.     Other nationalised industries.    The reductions proposedin Table 3 of C(79) 26 were all agreed.    It was noted that thisinvolved an increase in gas prices in real terms in 1980.It was also noted that the continued strength of sterling mightseriously damage the trading prospects of certain nationalisedindustries leading to increased calls on the Exchequer.m,,   Contingency Reserve.   A reduction of  750 million inthe Contingency Reserve for 1980-81 was agreed.    It wasnoted that Ministers would have to exercise considerablediscipline in bringing forward proposals for additionalexpenditure if this limit were to be held.n.    Disposals.   It was noted that the target for disposalsin 1980-81 would be  500 million.o.    Civil Service.   It was noted that the Chief Secretary,Treasury&apos;s, proposals assumed that the further manpowersavings to be considered by the Cabinet in September wouldyield at least a further  150 million.p.    End-Year Flexibility.    It was noted that the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, proposed to arrange, without anycommitment, for officials to consider possible ways ofallowing some flexibility on the allocation of expenditurebetween financial years, and to report back to Ministers inthe autumn.3SECRET
SECRETIn further discussion of presentation and tactics, it was argued thatany Government announcement before the Recess would automaticallylead to pressure for a debate.    There was no possibility of the Housesitting beyond 27 July.    It was not normal practice to announce thedecisions about the immediately following financial year at this earlystage.    In any case, decisions on subsequent years would have towait until the autumn.    However, the local authorities and nationalisedindustries would need some indication of the Governments intentions,in order to allow planning during the summer.    Without this, therewas some danger that the full reductions would not in practice beachieved in 1980-81.    Ministers needed to give further thought to theprecise form of any such guidance.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now taken clear decisions on all Departmental expendi-ture programmes, except for the minor adjustments needed to theScottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland programmes to take accountof decisions taken that morning.    The Ministerial Group on PublicExpenditure should meet the next day to agree figures for thesethree programmes, and shovld report their recommendations toCabinet for consideration on 26 July.    The Cabinet had also approvedthe proposed borrowing figures for the nationalised industries set outin Table 3 of C(79) 28, with the exception of the coal industry, forwhich provision should be agreed between the Secretary of State forEnergy and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and reported to Cabinet.At their next meeting the Cabinet should also consider the preciseterms of any guidance to be given to local authorities andnationalised industries, including the question of whether thereductions should be presented as a single global total, or should beitemised.    Cabinet had taken a number of other related decisions.The Contingency Reserve for 1980-81 should be reduced by 750 million.    The Cabinet would begin its discussions of CivilService manpower in the autumn on the assumption that furthersavings of  150 million could be found in 1980-81.    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury, should arrange for officials to consider thequestion of end-year flexibility, and report to the Cabinet in duecourse.    Any guidance given to the Press following the meeting,should make it clear that Ministers were considering publicexpenditure plans in the ordinary way, with a view to publishing aWhite Paper somewhat earlier than had been the practice in recentyears;  good progress had been made so far and there was generalagreement about the Governments approach to the problems.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office24 July 1979SECRET124
^ t-4 p^p1mb minister2 0JUL1979FILING INSTRUCTIONSFILE No.BLIC EXPENDITURE  19 80-81:    EDUCATION AND SCIENCEKLare to resume discussion of my programme in Cabinet onnday;   and it may be helpful if I send you this note aboutme points which,  as the minutes of yesterday&apos;s meetingC(79) 10th Conclusions, Minute 4)  bring out, causedferticular concern.understood you to take the view that the unspecifiedjditional cut of  30m proposed in para 35 of the MISC IIport attached to C(79)31, coming on top of the  517m, wento far and should be omitted.    Within the  517m there areree particularly difficult elements involving new or increasedarges which might stimulate demands for excessive pay claimsdhave serious political consequences:-Under 5&apos;s,Unless we are to make drastic cuts innursery education,  the proposed saving of  70m could beachieved only by amending the 1944 Act to allow localauthorities to charge  (perhaps  4 a week even for -part-time attendance).    Perhaps therefore we shouldstick to my original figure of  20m, which would enableus to keep provision in 1980-81 at about this year&apos;slevel.School transport.    The proposed saving of  40m wouldrequire legislation to enable local authorities to chargechildren living more than the &quot;statutory walking distances&quot;(3 miles for secondary pupils,  2 miles for others) fromschool.    The impact, especially in rural areas and onchildren attending denominational schools, would besevere:    to save half the present subsidy the chargeswould have to average  2.50 to  3 a week.    At the veryleast, the Cabinet may prefer to postpone action on thisuntil 1981-82.Student grants.    Of the proposed saving of  30m,  20mwould involve big increases in the parental contributionfrom those middle managers which the tax cuts in theBudget were particularly designed to help.    It wouldalso run counter to our long-term aim of abolishing theparental contribution when resources allow:    and, sincethis might prove the most unacceptable of all the cutsin my programme, I think on reflection it should be-1-
SUCRE!dropped.    It might instead be possible to find savingsof  10m elsewhere in higher education  (making a total of 45m in that sector).should perhaps also say a word about science.    A cut of asuch as  10m in the budget of the Research Councils wouldake it below this year&apos;s figure, even as reduced by theudget cut.    As you know, Britain still excels in science, andt is important that we should maintain support for our veryble young scientists.am sending copies of this minute to the other members of theabinet, the Minister of Transport and Sir John Hunt.AMARK CARLISLE-20 July 1979(Approved by the Secretary ofState and signed in his absence)SECRET
s e c r e tTreasury Chambers, RurliameM^VmtyfMni&apos; 3AG01-233 30rtmf,jinister2 3 JULI979CIUNG INSTRUCTIONS [rILE No. X\SX^BngPRESENTATION OP PUBLIC EXPENDITURE LTJTSAfter our discussion in Cabinet yesterday, I have been think-further about the presentation of our decisions on publicxpenditure.My minute of 18th&quot; July pointed to the operational argumentsor announcement before the recess.    But there are formidableifficulties about this course.    If we set it aside, we shall,swe realize, need to find a way of giving sufficient earlyoiidance to local authorities to enable the changes we want inheir programmes to be implemented in an orderly way.    But theoint i want to raise in this minute is that, if our mainnnouncement is delayed until the autumn, this gives a usefulcrucial, indeed - opportunity to do more to prepare publicpinion..  The fact is that the public in general are unprepared for theicale and nature of the public expenditure &quot;cuts&quot; which we are &apos;liscussing.    Many do not understand why such cuts are needed.&apos;n previous occasions large expenditure cuts have been understoodis the response to a sterling crisis.    This time there is no^parent crisis of this kind to explain the scale of the actionroposed.    On the contrary, sterling is strong, and the cuts wille thought by some to be an unnecessary attempt to impose extremeotions about economic management.We should seek to prepare public opinion in advance. Withe Qther Treasury Ministers I propose to underline, in speeches and/ toSECRET
secrete media, the seriousness of the situation which we face, andis implications for expectations not only about livingtandards in general but about the standard of public services,t will clearly be most useful if all our Cabinet colleaguesre willing to join in this campaign.This could lead up to the publication in the autumn of abite Paper giving a full assessment of the economic prospectsor the medium term, to set the context for a comprehensivennouncement of our public expenditure plans, covering notily 1980-81 but also the later years of the survey, forJhich the Chief Secretary and I will be bringing forward pro-osals after the holidays.    A comprehensive announcement of thisind could not of course be made until we have taken our decisionsn the later years, but it ought to be possible to do it by theInd of October, which would be satisfactory provided that wejind a solution to the immediate problem of the local authorities.The procedure we can discuss further at Cabinet on Monday. -e point I want to emphasize now is the importance of the politicalisk of presentation, and the possibility of using the comingseks to build on what was said at the time of the Budget to pre-ire the ground for the strategy we are now implementing on-iblic expenditure.I am copying this minute to the Paymaster General, thefief Whip and Sir John Hunt//h.(G.H.)July, 1979secret128
