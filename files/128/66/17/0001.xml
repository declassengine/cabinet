CONFIDENTIALNTARY    1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat Legislation Committee had this week approved six Bills forimmediate introduction when Parliament returned the following week,including the Bills on Industry, Shipbuilding and European Communities(Greek Accession).    Five more should be approved next week,among them the Education, Civil Aviation and Protection of OfficialInformation Bills.    The Companies and Competition Bills werealready before the House.    Among the Governments other majorBills, the Local Government, Planning and Land and BritishAerospace Bills should be ready during the first half of November;and those on Trades Unions, Social Security, Transport, NationalHeritage Fund and Health Services in time for Second Readingbefore Christmas.    The Housing Bill, and probably the CoalIndustry, Submarine Pipelines, Wildlife and Broadcasting Billsshould be published before Christmas.    A Bill would be ready onRhodesia if it were needed, for which drafting authority had beengiven.    Some of these Bills were later than originally planned, butthere was no question at this stage of having to drop any Bills forlack of Parliamentary time.    There would, however, be difficultyin meeting the deadlines for some of those Bills which requiredearly Royal Assent, such as the Industry, Education, Transport,Aerospace, Shipbuilding and Coal Industry Bills.    Priority wouldbe given to the Industry Bill and to others which were needed tosecure early financial benefits;  but where it was possible to makealternative financial arrangements to cover a delay in presenting aBill for Royal Assent it would be prudent to do so.    It was essentialto prevent any further slippage, which could affect not only thetimetable for a particular Bill, but also the programme as a whole.A Bill should not be delayed on account of provisions which couldbe deferred until later in the Parliament.    Any major Bills whichcould start in the House of Lords should do so.    Some difficultieswith the Parliamentary timetable were to be expected as the Sessionproceeded:  he would keep in touch with the Ministers concernedand requested that his colleagues should immediately inform himif they foresaw difficulties with their particular Bills.In discussion, it was pointed out that it had been necessary towithdraw the Protection of Official Information Bill fromLegislation Committee at short notice because of an unresolvedquestion of policy.    Unless policy issues were settled in good timebefore Bills reached the Committee, valuable Parliamentary timewould be lost.    It was noted that some Bills, especially thoserequiring Royal Assent before Easter, might need the use of theguillotine in the House of Commons.    There were arguments fordeferring its use until the New Year in the wider interests ofGovernment business in both Houses.1CONFIDENTIAL206
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Home Secretary would arrange for the outstanding policy matteron the Protection of Official Information Bill to be resolved, andfor the Bill to be made ready for early introduction.    The use ofthe guillotine should be considered when the need arose by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Chief Whip and theMinister concerned.    At this stage, the first priority was to getBills drafted, introduced and brought to Second Reading. TheGovernment had a heavy legislative programme before them and itwas essential to maintain the present timetable.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion.The Cabinet were reminded of the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the following week.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat having made it clear to the Patriotic Front that discussionson the next stages would proceed without them if they did notaccept the proposed constitution they would probably return to thenegotiations.    However the remaining stages would be much moredifficult and if we had to reach a settlement which did not involvethe Patriotic Front some of our friends and allies might turn outto be fair weather ones only.    Meanwhile some progress onpossible transitional arrangements was being made withBishop Muzorewa and General Walls.    The South African attitudewas difficult to assess as they appeared to be simultaneouslythreatening military intervention and withdrawal.    No Britishcommitment had been made about a Land Fund for compensatingdispossessed white farmers in Rhodesia.tic THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe speech by the Soviet President, Mr Brezhnev on 6 October inn Berlin had had some effect on current discussions within theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) on modernisation ofits long range theatre nuclear weapons.    The Belgians inparticular were showing signs of nervousness.    It was importantto avoid a repetition of the events surrounding the earlierdiscussion within NATO on the &quot;neutron bomb&quot;.In a brief discussion it was pointed out that the United States wereadopting a robust tone in the current NATO discussions and thishad been reflected in the attitude taken by West Germany at thetrilateral discussions which had just taken place in Hamburg. Weshould be similarly robust.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that during her recent visitto Rome, she had made it very clear to the Italian Prime Ministerthat we expected movement towards resolving our Budget problemBudget    at the Dublin European Council.    The Italians would press for lessemphasis on expenditure on price guarantees within the CommonAgricultural Policy and we would be able to give them some support;but we could not allow the Italians to impede progress towards asolution of our problem.3CONFIDENTIAL208
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, reporting on the meetingof the Council of Ministers (Finance) on 15 October, said that theprocess of considering the Commissions first report had beencompleted and they should now come forward with proposals forsolutions for the November meeting of the Finance Council. Ithad been a discouraging debate:  while everyone had reluctantlyacknowledged that the United Kingdom had a problem there was nodisposition to recognise how substantial and urgent it was. Theother member States were clearly hoping to dispose of the matterat the European Council with only a very modest alleviation of ournet contribution.    An extremely tough negotiation was thereforein prospect.THE MINISTER. OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)earlier in the week, he had raised the failure of the FrenchGovernment to implement the judgment of the European Court thattheir measures restricting imports of sheepmeat from the Uniteds Kingdom were illegal.    In a restricted meeting of Ministers theFrench failure to comply had eventually been condemned by mostother member States and by the Commission.    The FrenchMinister of Agriculture had merely said that the matter was beingconsidered by his Government.    A special session of the AgricultureCouncil had been fixed for 29 October to discuss a Communitysheepmeat regime: the situation would undoubtedly be very difficultif the French had not previously announced their intention to comply.It was likely that they would announce the lifting of the ban as fromabout the middle of November when the market normally becamefirmer:  but if they still continued to apply levies to our exportsthis would equally be illegal.    It would be helpful if, when thePrime Minister saw the President of the Commission on 22 October,she could stress the responsibility of the Commission to ensure thatthe French Government complied with the Court&apos;s ruling andwithdrew both the ban and the levy arrangements.In a brief discussion the seriousness of the French position wasstressed.    If member States refused to accept the clear findingsof the European Court the very basis of the Community would becalled into question.    Our compliance with Community law couldnot then be easily defended to public opinion in this country wherethe European Economic Community was in any case not popular.In particular, we faced a difficult political problem in the next fewweeks in passing the necessary legislation to implement the rulingof the European Court on the use of tachographs.    There was alreadyconcern about the attitude of Government supporters in view of the4CONFIDENTIAL209
CONFIDENTIALFrench failure to comply with the Court ruling on sheepmeat. Weshould not however threaten to disobey Community law ourselvesotherwise we should lose the support we had secured from othermember States.In reply to a question about the recent European Court ruling onfisheries, the Minister of Agriculture said that the Court hadcriticised the procedures we had followed in 1977 rather than thenational conservation measure itself.    The European Court wasdue to rule on other United Kingdom national conservationmeasures in January and it was likely that they would rule that amember State needed to obtain the approval of the Commissionrather than simply to consult them, before taking national action.With this in prospect, he was anxious at the forthcoming meetingof the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) to discuss conservationmeasures on a Community basis.    The position of the French wasnot strong since the trawlers which we had arrested werecontravening conservation measures which dated back to 1963.The Cabinet -Took note.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Employment, C(79) 43, setting out hisproposals on the four outstanding points in his intended IndustrialRelations Bill.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatMinisters had already generally approved his proposals forlegislation on picketing, the closed shop and union ballots. Heintended to introduce the necessary legislation in December, butthe timetable was now very tight and he needed urgent decisions onfour outstanding issues.i. Closed shop:  The Cabinet needed to decide howwide should be the/objection on conscience grounds to unionmembership which would protect against unfair dismissal,and whether they should be limited to objection to belongingto any union at all or could include objection to belonging toa particular union.    He suggested that the formula shouldcover those who &apos;had religious, ethical or moral objectionsto being a member of any union whatsoever or of a particularunion&apos;.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, it was argued that the original &apos;conscience clause&apos;had not gone far enough.    It would not have covered, for example,the firemen at Rhyl who had refused to join the previous year&apos;sstrike.    At the same time, exemption should not go so far as toallow a man to leave a union simply because of a personal quarrel.Against this, it was argued that, ideally, the Government wouldprotect the rights of anyone who wished to leave or remain out of aunion.    But it was necessary to proceed cautiously.    The courseproposed was about as far as the Government could go. However,the wording of the proposed &quot;conscience clause&quot; could still becriticised.    It was not easy to define ethical and moral objections,which appeared to mean the same thing.    It might be preferable toredefine the exemption to cover &quot;deeply held sincere and disinterestedpersonal convictions&quot;.    This formula had the advantage ofincorporating words which already had some legal significance, inthe context of conscientious objection to military service, whileretaining a common sense meaning which would be readilyunderstood oy the tribunals which would administer the proposedcode of practice.    They were also close to the language of theParty Manifesto, and there was much advantage in sticking towords which had already been used in public before.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed with the intention of the Secretary ofState&apos;s proposals but would have liked a more widely drawn definitionif this was possible.    He should consult with the Lord Chancellorand other interested Ministers, on the basis of alternative draftsprepared by Parliamentary Counsel following the lines suggestedin discussion, and bring fresh proposals before Ministers in duecourse.,ii.        Unreasonable exclusion or expulsion from a union.The proposal before the Cabinet was to include in the DraftStatutory &quot;Code of Practice&quot; on the closed shop, guidanceto the effect that disciplining by expulsion should be regardedas unreasonable behaviour if taken solely on such groundsas that a member crossed a picket line or refused to takepart in industrial action in breach of a procedure agreement.It was intended that a plaintiff should be able to draw attentionto this code in pleading his case before the tribunal. Thetest of Reasonableness&apos; would be for the tribunal or the HighCourt to interpret.    This proposal had the support of theConfederation of British Industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed with this approach to the problem.6CONFIDENTIAL211
CONFIDENTIALiii. Closed shop in the newspaper industry. TheSecretary of State&apos;s proposal was to reinforce the generalprovisions on the closed shop by providing a separatesection in the &quot;Code&apos; which would relate specifically to theposition of journalists.    It would make it clear that genuinebeliefs concerning Press freedom would be a suitableconscientious ground for objecting to becoming or remaininga member of a particular union or of any union at all.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion on this point,said that the Cabinet approved this approach to the problem, subjectto the Secretary of State for Employment satisfying himself thathis proposals were consistent with undertakings given to previousConservative Party Conferences.iv. GLADE.    The Secretary of State for Employmenthad circulated to the Cabinet, under cover of a minute dated12 October, the report of Mr Andrew Leggatt QC into therecruitment activities of the Society of Lithographic Artists,Designers, Engravers and Process Workers (SLADE). Thisreport had since been published.    As a result there hadbeen considerable public criticism of the undesirablepractices of this union in enforcing union member slipagainst the wishes of employers and employees in particularfirms.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that there was general agreement that the correct approachto this problem lay in statutory action to remove the immunitiesof a union acting as SLADE had done, thus making it possible foran injured party to take civil action against it.    There wereseveral possible ways in which this might be done, furtherconsultation would be needed to identify the best approach. TheCabinet authorised the Secretary of State for Employment, inconsultation with the Solicitor General, to consult the variousinterested parties accordingly.Summing up the whole discussion, the Prime Minister said thatthe Secretary of State for Employment should now proceed in themanner agreed by Cabinet, consulting where necessary, andreporting on these and any other outstanding points to the Cabinetor the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy in the middleof November, with a view to introducing legislation and securing aSecond Reading before Christmas.7CONFIDENTIAL2

SECRETOCUMENTIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 0CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday, 18 October 1979 at 10.30 amLIC EXPENDITURE;T0 1983-84:STANDING ISSUES&apos;ousrence:)l5thlusions,te 6The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChief Secretary, Treasury (C(79) 42) setting out the resultof his bilateral discussions with spending Ministersfollowing the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, and makingproposals to resolve the outstanding issues on five majorprogrammes.    They also considered a memorandum(C(79) 44) by the Secretary of State for the Environmentabout council house rents.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, by way ofgeneral background to the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper, saidthat the latest forecasts indicated a need to secure all ofthe proposed reductions in expenditure if there was to beany hope of keeping the public sector borrowing requirement(PSBR) at a manageable level and without allowing room forany reduction in the net burden of taxation. Whiletheoretically it was attractive to allow Government borrow-ing to increase in a time of recession, this was not apracticable course, given the very high level of borrowingalready needed to finance Government expenditure.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that Cabinethad agreed at its discussion in September to stabilise publicexpenditure at roughly its present level.    With the co-operation of spending Ministers, he had been able to makegood progress towards this target, and savings of some 4-5, 000 million had already beenagreed.   There were, how-ever, five main outstanding issues, which together left amargin rising from  1, 000 million at the beginning of theperiod to  1, 500 million at the end, on which decisions werenow needed.    For 1983-84 this margin was equivalent to3-4ponthe standard rate of income tax.  In his discussion hehad tried to reflect the broad priorities indicated by the Cabinet.Defence expenditure would, onhisproposals, riseby3percent Ie. volume terms starting from 1978-79 and Law andOrder by 2.\ per cent;  but reductions would be needed else-where to accommodate the increases, while maintaining1SECRET214
SECREToverall stability.    He had left a reasonable margin forcontingencies, to cover such possible claims as those ofBritish Leyland and of Rolls-Royce, of uprating of Child Benefits,and of the possible higher costs of unemployment benefits. Thefive issues outstanding were the Defence Budget, Agriculturalsupport, Housing and Council House rents, Education and theEarnings Related Supplement (ERS).In general discussion, it was argued strongly that the onlyalternative to the cuts proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury,were increases in taxation, in local authority rates, and in thelevel of interest rates.    This would run counter to theGovernment1 s general policy, and to the Manifesto on which ithad been elected.    Against this, it was argued that there wereinevitable inconsistencies within the Manifesto policies, andthat the situation had deteriorated since the Election. TheGovernment had to carry the country with it, if only to secureits own re-election:  its economic policies could not be carriedto fruition within the lifetime of a single Parliament.    Some ofthe measures proposed by the Chief Secretary were so politicallysensitive that the Cabiuet would have to balance them against therisk of increasing taxation.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his proposalswould enable the defence budget to increase by 3 per cent annuallyon average in volume terms over the period, starting from 1978-79.The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) target, to whichthe Government had subscribed, required an increase &quot;in theregion of 3 per cent&quot;.    By 1984, the defence budget would haverisen from 4. 8 to 5. 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP),a higher proportion than that of any other NATO partner. Thiswas a reasonable and defensible stance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that thetechnical interpretation of this NATO commitment was open todebate.    NATO had always worked in volume terms, as had thepresent Government when it extended the 3 per cent commitmentin the light of the growing Soviet threat.    If the Government nowpublished future figures on the basis proposed by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, it would be impossible to conceal a unilat-eral decision to go back to something like a 2 per cent annual growthrate.    This would be very damaging, both to our relations withour allies and to the morale of the armed forces.    In his view,the figures he had proposed, which rose to  160 million a yearmore than those of the Chief Secretary, Treasury in 1983-84,were the minimum necessary to honour our commitments and tomeet the real need.2SECRET215
SECRETIn discussion, it was argued that the Government was heavilycommitted, by its statements ii Opposition, and its actions sincethe Election, to maintaining the 3 per cent target in the senseunderstood by the Secretary of State for Defence.    It would bedifficult to defend, either to our allies, to the armed forces orto the Governments own supporters, any change in Ministers&apos;interpretation.    Against this, it was argued that the ChiefSecretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals were defensible in terms of thecommitments made and of the interpretations which our allieswere placing on their own parallel commitments.    The alterna-tive was further cuts in, for example, the Education Budget,which would be even more unpalatable.    Nobody disputed that theDefence programme should have high priority:  the question wasthe exact amount of resources to be allocated to Defence in thenext four years.    The United Kingdom already devoted a higherproportion of GDP to Defence than any other NATO ally, althoughits per capita contribution was smaller than some, because ofits relatively low GDP.    The rate of growth of the Defenceprogramme exceeded that of all other public expenditureprogrammes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet noted the serious reservations of theSecretary of State for Defence but the majority view seemed tobe that it would be best to plan on the basis of the figuresproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.culture THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as the Cabinet had agreed on4 October, a general review of Agricultural Support Policy wasunderway.    Discussion of the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;sproposals should be postponed until this had been carried9) 16th further,lusions,te 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the only issue on new construction concerned the level ofapprovals for new council houses from 1979-80 onwards. Duringthis period, the rate of slum clearance would have fallen off,private house building would be running at between 120 and 145thousand houses a year, the overall housing stock situation wouldhave moved even further into surplus (despite local shortages insome areas) but there would be a need to concentrate localauthority housing as far as possible to help special groups likethe elderly and the disabled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion on thispoint, said that the Cabinet agreed to a rate of new approvals of45, 000 a year from 1979 onwards.SECRET 3216
SECRETTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the majorremaining issue was that of council house rents.    His ownproposal assumed that rents would have risen to 11 per cent ofaverage earnings by the final year of the Public ExpenditureSurvey period.    It was common ground that rents were at presentunrealistically low.    If they were to rise, it would be best thatthey should do so quickly.    The effect on wage demands neednot be large:  there was no evidence that rent control in the pasthad moderated the pressure on wages.    The poorest council housetenants would be protected by the existing rent rebate arrange-ments,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatan increase of this scale in council house rents was the singlemos1; explosive political issue which faced the Government. Itwas a matter of political judgment.    In his paper he had set outfive options, showing the consequences for each in terms of publicexpenditure, effect on rates, and phasing.    His own preferencewas Option B, under which rents would be returned by 1983-84to a level which would be the same proportion of average earningsas in 1974 when the Conservative Government left office -8, 6 per cent of earnings.    This would produce savings of 1 billion over three years.    It meant committing the Governmentnow to average increases of  1.80,.  1, 55 and  1.45 in councilhouse rents in each of the next three years.    This would increasethe Retail Price Index (RPI) by 0. 7 per cent by 1983-84, whereasthe Treasury proposals would amount to an increase of 1.6 per cent.These figures assumed that about 100, 000 council houses would besold each year.    He did not believe it was practicable to move anyfaster than this.In discussion, there was general agreement on the politicalsensitivity of the subject.    In favour of a faster move, it wasargued that higher rents would encourage the move towardsgreater home ownership.     The 1974 level of rents as a propor-tion of average earnings were artificially low and had come at atime of rigid incomes policy.    By contrast, the post-war LabourGovernment had set a target of 10 per cent of earnings. Therewere already wide discrepencies between the level of councilrents in different cities, and no evidence of adverse politicalreaction.    It was quite wrong that Labour authorities should buyvotes by maintaining artificially-low rents.    There was no casefor protecting this particular part of local authority activity at atime when personal social services and transport had been sodrastically reduced.    The poorest part of the population was wellprotected by the existing rent rebate arrangements.    The alter-native to the course proposed was to add substantially to incometax.4SECRET217
SECRETAgainst this, it was argued -hat the council house tenant onaverage earnings represented the core of the trade union move-ment, whose support it was important to secure. TheGovernments success at the recent General Election haddepended on this group.    The effect of higher rents could not beseen in isolation.    It must be added to the impact of higherschool meal charges, charges fcr school transport, increasesin value added tax, and the general level of inflation. Theoverall effect on wage demands could be very damaging. Chargesin the public sector were automatically blamed on the Governmentof the day.    The Governments political commitments were notlimited to reducing taxation.    It had other objectives too, andmust be careful not to appear ae an uncaring Government. TheCabinet had ruled out any change in the present tax reliefarrangements for mortgages, but this simply highlighted thedifferent treatment given to council house tenants and to owner-occupiers, despite the importance attached to home ownership.In political terms there was a psychological barrier, whichmight b^ identified with rent incieases of  2 a week or more,comparable to the 50p ceiling on rent increases set in the 1974Rent Act.    The Government should be careful not to break thisbarrier.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Secretary of State for the Environment and theChief Secretary, Treasury, should between them agree on acourse which fell somewhere between Option C and Option D asset out in the Secretary of State&apos;s paper.    In doing so, theyshould provide for a steady rate of increase in rents,preferably of less than  2 per week, or alternatively expressedin percentage rather than in cash terms.    They should reporttheir joint recommendation to Cabinet as soon as possible.The Prime Minister, summing up the whole discussion, saidthat the Cabinet did not have time to complete their discussionof the disputed points at the present meeting.    They wouldresume their discussion on council house rents, of Educationand of the Earnings-related Supplement and reach final decisionson all the programmes at a subsequent meeting.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister!ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office19 October 19795SECRET
