CONFIDENTIALntary1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he expected to come underpressure from backbenchers, including a number of the Government&apos;sc\ supporters, during the debate on the Second Reading of the Europeangjill:       Assembly (Salaries and Pensions) Bill about the payment of a secondSecond     salary to Members of Parliament who were also members of theEuropean Assembly.    Most other European countries intended topay an abated second salary in similar circumstances.    It was forconsideration whether this fact should be acknowledged during thedebate and Members who wished to press the point told that theywould have an opportunity to do so in Committee.    There had alsobeen a prominent report in that morning&apos;s &quot;Daily Express&quot; about theabuse of expenses paid by the European Assembly, on which heintended to take a strong line in the debate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government should make no reference to the possibility of anabated second salary during the debate on Second Reading or to theopportunity of further consideration in Committee. Therecommendations on Members&apos; salaries which the Cabinet wouldconsider later in the meeting were clearly on the basis of a full-timejob, and the time which a Member gave to his attendance at theEuropean Assembly would be at the expense of his attendance atWestminster.    If Members wished to press the point they shouldbe prepared to do so openly in a vote.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat, following the United States Senate vote on the MilitaryAuthorisation Bill requiring President Carter to lift sanctionsagainst Rhodesia before the end of June, the House of Representativeswould probably pass an amendment to the Bill requiring the Presidentto take this action by 15 October.    If so the two Houses of Congresswould have to agree on a compromise.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that twoconferences about Vietnamese refugees were now in prospect. Onewould be held in Geneva under the United Nations High Commissionerfor Refugees, Mr Hartling; the other had been called by the UnitedNations Secretary General, Mr Waldheim, and would take place inNew York on 18 July.    This would be on a political level and woulddiscuss plans for international action.    We had been active in gettingthese conferences called and we should be expected to put forwardpositive suggestions.    This would involve a difficult decision. Wewould be expected either to offer to take more refugees in thiscountry if others did likewise or make funds available for theirresettlement elsewhere.In discussion there was support for the view that if we wanted othersto do more to resolve the problem, we would need a bargainingcounter ourselves.    On the other hand, it was argued that we alreadyhad two million immigrants in this country for whom we wereproviding education, housing and other amenities: and there waslikely to be adverse public reaction if we added to these a sizeablenumber of Vietnamese.    In preparing for the forthcominginternational meetings we would have to stand firmly on our positionthat it was up to other members of the international community to domore.The Cabinet -Took note.3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the meeting of Community Foreign Ministers on Monday hadagreed that the French Presidency should make a demarche on behalfof the Community to the Government of Vietnam about the refugeeproblem.    They had also been able to agree a statement on the MiddleEast which was critical of Israeli policy on settlements and thesovereignty of the West Bank.    Although it had not received muchpublicity, the significance of the statement had not been lost on Israelor the Arab countries and would probably be helpful to Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Council of Agriculture Ministerswas still continuing and for the time being the Commission weresticking to their proposals for a price freeze on commodities in surplus.The French were pressing for a small increase in prices even on milkbut we were continuing to resist this in view of the enormous cost ofthe milk surplus.    The French Minister of Agriculture had returnedto Paris and might be receiving fresh instructions.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL78
CONFIDENTIAL4.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, C(79) 22, dealing with theTwelfth Report from the Review Body on Top Salaries (TSRB) whichrecommended revised current rates of pay for Members ofParliament and Ministers, new rates for the Peers1 expenseallowance and an interim increase in Members&apos; secretarial andresearch assistant allowances.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY&apos;OF LANCASTER said that theTSRB had recommended very substantial increases in the pay ofMembers of Parliament (MPs) and Ministers.    MPs1 pay would beincreased to  12, 000 a year, that of Cabinet Ministers to  25, 000,that of Ministers of State to  20, 000, and that of ParliamentarySecretaries to  13, 000.    The Prime Minister&apos;s pay would rise to 33, 000.    In addition to these figures the proportion ofParliamentary salary retained by a Minister would rise to  7, 000.Peers1 expense allowances would be increased by about 100 per cent.Although these increases seemed large, they needed to be put incontext.    For example, the 74 per cent increase for Members ofParliament came down to 50 per cent when allowance was made forthe 1975 decision to abate part of the increase recommended in thatyear.    Over the same period prices had increased by more than60 per cent.    Compared with the rates now in use for pensionpurposes, the increase was only 28 per cent, broadly in line withthe increases recommended for other parts of the public sector.It was undesirable to allow these anomalies to continue because theydistorted the whole structure of pay and allowances in Parliament.The longer a decision was delayed, the harder the problem became.Feeling in Parliament was running strongly, particularly as a resultof premature publicity before the Report, and the Government hadlittle room for manoeuvre.    Apart from the rates themselves, therewere two particular problems: linkage and staging.    The House ofCommons had expressed a view in the past in favour of linking MPs&apos;pay to that of a grade in the Civil Service.    TSRB had recommendedagainst this, and indeed had hesitations about any linkage either togroups or indices.    Nevertheless despite their view that regularindependent review was the proper course for determining the salariesat issue they saw practical advantage in finding a suitable way ofkeeping the salaries of Members of Parliament up to date betweenreviews.    In this context their preferred solution would be linkagewith an index of general movements in earnings and they saw theappropriate percentile of New Earnings Survey of the Department ofEmployment as fulfilling the requirement.    Any form of linkagereduced the risk of adverse publicity each year.    But both methodshad their disadvantages.    The TSRB recognised that theirrecommendations might have to be staged, and listed a number ofoptions.    In his view this process should not extend beyond April 1981.3CONFIDENTIAL79
CONFIDENTIALIf the increases were staged, the new rates should be accepted infull for pensions purposes immediately as with other public sectorgroups.    Because of the recent leaks, it was important to announcethe Governments decision and publish the Report as quickly aspossible.    There would be a debate before the House rose for theSummer Recess.In discussion, it was first argued that the TSRB had fulfilled theirremit, and recommended a package of increases which would yield&quot;the rate for the job&apos; for Members of Parliament and for Ministers.Although their proposals might be criticised in detail, it would be amistake to undo the package or to tinker with individual proposals.Despite adverse Press criticisms that day, the public at large wouldprobably recognise that the Boyle recommendations were sensible.They would re-establish the pay of the ordinary Member ofParliament at a reasonable level and avoid the temptation tosupplement it by unreasonable expense claims.    Indeed therecommended levels would be generous for new and inexperiencedMembers.In further discussion, it was argued that, although the rates werereasonable, the increases were so large that some form of stagingwould be inevitable.    The Cabinet could not recommend to the Housetreatment for Ministers and MPs more generous than that which thepresent Government had conceded for public service groups. Norcould it give any promise of automatic updating for the future. Theexact pattern of staging should be agreed following the Cabinetdiscussion, in the light of the treatment given to recent public servicegroups.    But it might be necessary to stage over a period of twoyears, in three instalments, notwithstanding the difficulties this mightcause in the House of Commons.    Whatever pattern of staging wereadopted, it was desirable to adopt the new rates immediately forpensions purposes.In discussion of allowances, it was pointed out that Members ofParliament were entitled to generous travelling and living allowances,particularly in the case of those who had to maintain a second homein London.   Although this was not a matter covered by the BoyleReport, but was dealt with by a separate Resolution of the House,there was a case for re-examining the level of such allowances infuture, given the new level of Parliamentary salaries and the taxchanges made in the Budget.    There was some slight evidence, ina small minority of cases, that the present rules were abused.The case for an increase in Peers&apos; expense allowances was alsostrong, although there was also a danger of abuse.    The particularposition of Ministers outside the Cabinet in the House of Lordsneeded special attention.    When the Boyle recommendations wereimplemented in full, they would no longer be allowed to claim Peers&apos;4CONFIDENTIAL80
CONFIDENTIALexpense allowances, and the Boyle Report did not suggest anyalternative treatment.    However there was evidence that Ministersin the Lords were at a disadvantage compared with their colleaguesin the Commons because they, too, were called upon to performnon-Ministerial Parliamentary duties.    It would be sensible toinvite the TSRB to cover this question within the second part oftheir Report, which would also deal with the outstanding questionof secretarial allowances.In discussion of linkage, it was argued that any automatic hedgeagainst inflation was undesirable.    It would be damaging to theGovernment1 s counter-inflationary policy, but it would not avoidthe need for an annual motion and adverse publicity.    If any formof linkage were to be chosen, it was preferable to relate movementsin the pay of MPs to those in the pay of the Assistant Secretary gradein the Civil Service, as the House had overwhelmingly decided in avote in 1975.    This would be preferable to a link with the NewEarnings Survey of the Department of Employment, whichwas a precedent too easily copied by other public service groups.Another alternative was to commit the Government to a regularreview by the TSRB, though it would be difficult to persuade theHouse of Commons to accept reviews at more than two-yearlyintervals.The Cabinet noted that the Prime Minister and the Lord Chancellor,while accepting the salaries recommended for them as the appropriaterate for the job, intended not to draw any increase which would keeptheir actual emoluments ahead of other Cabinet Ministers and on theunderstanding that other members of the Cabinet would not makesimilar waivers.On the question of handling, it was suggested that an earlyGovernment announcement was now needed, accompanied bypublication of the Report.    The Government should takeresponsibility for tabling the necessary motions, but should notpropose any form of automatic linkage or frequent review.    It hadto be recognised that backbench Members might well tableamendments calling for such linkage or review.    In this event itwas important that the Cabinet should show a united front, and sincethey had reached no decision on the question of linkage, abstentionby Ministers from voting would be the appropriate course. ThePrime Minister would need to inform the Leader of the Oppositionof the Government1 s decisions before the announcements were made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to accept the TSRB recommendations on theParliamentary salary and on Ministerial and Office Holders&apos; pay asbeing the rate for the job.    The increase should be made in three5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALequal stages over a period which would give treatment no moregenerous than that given in any other recent public sector groupdecision.    The full rate^ should be adopted in full for pensionspurposes immediately.    The recommended increases in allowances,including Peers1 expense allowances and the interim increase insecretarial allowances for MPs should be paid in full immediately.The Government would not announce any decision about linkage. Ifamendments to the Government&apos;s motion were tabled to introducesome form of linkage, all Ministers would abstain from voting onthe amendments.    The Government would ask the Top Salaries ReviewBody to consider urgently as part of its forthcoming report onsecretarial allowances, the question of providing analogous allowancesfor Ministers and Office Holders in the House of Lords.    The PrimeMinister and the Lord Chancellor, whose salaries were higher thanthose of other Cabinet Ministers, would not accept that part of theapproved new rate for their offices which would keep their pay(inclusive of Parliamentary salary) above that of other CabinetMinisters.    The Government&apos;s decision should be announced by wayof statements by the Leaders of both Houses on Thursday 21 June andthe necessary motions should then be tabled and debated before theSummer Recess.    She would herself arrange to see the Leader ofthe Opposition shortly after the Cabinet meeting to inform him of theGovernment&apos;s decisions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.5.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment, C(79) 21, seeking agreement to thecancellation of the current rating revaluation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theabolition of the domestic rating system was a Manifesto commitment,even though it had to take second priority to the cutting of income tax.To continue with the current revaluation would undermine this objective,would help to perpetuate an inequitable tax, and would lead to greatacrimony.    It would be best to make no exception for non-domesticproperties, but to cancel the entire revaluation as the first step intackling the rating system.6CONFIDENTIAL
