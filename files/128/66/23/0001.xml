CONFIDENTIAL1.        The Cabinet were provisionally informed of the businessto be taken in the House of Commons during the following week.It was noted that the Opposition had not yet chosen the subject fortheir Supply Day.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatbusiness in the House of Commons would be very congested in theperiod before Christmas.    He intended to give first priority to thepassage of the Zimbabwe Bill, which should be taken through allits stages in both Houses before the recess,    To avoid a repetitionof the Parliamentary difficulties which had arisen on the earlierSouthern Rhodesia Bill, it was important that the House ofCommons should be given as much notice as possible.    He wouldalso aim to provide time for the Second Reading of the EmploymentBill and for allocation of time (guillotine) motions on the IndustryBill and, if necessary, on the Education (No. 2) Bill.   It would befor later consideration whether these motions could be combined,but in principle it would be better to take them separately inaccordance with the recommendation in the First Report from theSelect Committee nn Procedure, Session 1977-78.    It might bepossible to find time for the Second Reading of another Bill, butno assurance could be given at this stage.In discussion, it was pointed out that a difficult situation could ariseif the Second Reading of the Health Services Bill were delayed.The Health Services Board (HSB) were at present under a statutoryobligation to make recommendations for the withdrawal of pay bedsin National Health Service hospitals, and the Secretary of State forSocial Services was obliged to implement them.    An understandinghad been reached with the Chairman of the HSB, Lord Wigoder,that no further recommendations would be submitted provided thatthe Bill had received its Second Reading by Christmas.    If it didnot, there was a risk that a report might be submitted in the NewYear on which the Secretary of State would be obliged to act. Suchaction would be contrary to the policy of the Government, and wouldcause serious concern among their supporters in the House ofCommons and in the constituencies.In further discussion it was noted that time was unlikely to beavailable for the Second Reading of the Tenants&apos; Rights Etc.(Scotland) Bill, with the result that this and succeeding ScottishBills would be delayed in Scottish Standing Committee.    Nor wasthere likely to be time for a debate on the Rate Support Grant orders,which were normally taken before Christmas and on which delaywould lead to uncertainty over payments of grant.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that business in the House of Commons wouldbe seriously congested in the period before the recess and thatonly the Zimbabwe and Employment Bills could be assured of timefor Second Readings before Christmas.    If time could be found forIAMENTARYCONFIDENTIAL1292
CONFIDENTIALa third Bill the Health Services Bill would have a strong claim;otherwise this and the other items of business mentioned indiscussion would be taken as soon as possible after the Housereturned.    The recess should not, however, be curtailed and itwould be the intention that Parliament should reassemble onMonday 14 January.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to be guidedaccordingly.1Snee:22ndsions,22.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Salisbury delegation had now accepted the British proposalsfor a ceasefire.    The Patriotic Front had not done so, but theirposition would have to be made clear before 1 December, when theSalisbury delegation were determined to return home.    There wereserious difficulties over the requirement for the Patriotic Front toassemble all their forces (whose true numbers they had publiclyexaggerated) in certain designated areas;  and over the posture tobe adopted by the Salisbury forces, whose reasonable assumptionwas that at least some of the Front&apos;s forces would not in fact complywith the requirement and would need to be contained.    It might wellbe necessary to go ahead without the Front, although the door wouldin that case be left open for them to accept the settlement at a laterstage.   It was also possible that Mr Nkomo could be brought toaccept the settlement now, without Mr Mugabe.    If there was noPatriotic Front agreement, there would be a serious threat to theBritish community   in Zambia, and to British interests there andperhaps elsewhere in Africa,    Save in Nigeria, however, thereaction elsewhere in Africa was likely to be more muted, and theseriousness of Britain&apos;s efforts to reach a negotiated settlement waswidely recognised.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Iran remained dangerous and uncertain.    The size of theBritish Embassy had been much reduced, but it could not be withdrawn;: altogether without letting down both the Americans, to whom it wasst giving vital help, and the several hundred members of the Britishsions, community who were still unwilling to leave the country. Britishsupplies of Iranian oil had not so far been affected.2CONFIDENTIAL293
CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the large number *f Iranianscurrently entering Britain was giving rise to serious concern.A visa requirement should be imposed as soon as this could bedone without unacceptable risk to British personnel in Iran.Meanwhile every effort would be made to control the inflow atLondon Airport, where extra staff was likely to be required.The Cabinet -Took note.UNITYIRSeanll DublinNovember3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that, with the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary, she would be attending the meeting ofthe European Council in Dublin on 29-30 November.    The mainissue would be the United Kingdom&apos;s budgetary problem. OurCommunity partners had not yet accepted the seriousness of ourintentions.    In public expenditure terms it was impossible to justifya situation in which the United Kingdom, as one of the less prosperousmembers of the Community, would be subsidising other and mostlyricher countries of the European Economic Community (EEC), toan extent which greatly exceeded our overseas aid to developingcountries.    If, as seemed likely, we were not offered a reductionin our net contribution which we could accept, the argument wouldhave to continue.    We had no wish to disrupt the Community, andno intention of coming out of it, but our partners would have torealise that if, after reflection, they were not willing to correct thebasic inequity, the inevitable impact on the future development ofthe Community would be their fault rather than ours.    She wasapproaching the meeting with a determination to settle the questionand did not wish, at this stage, to reveal what action we might takeif the negotiations were to fail.    We had some latitude, since theCommunity Budget was on a calendar year basis and we were lookingfor relief on public expenditure during our financial year 1980-81,In discussion it was argued that it was not to be wondered at that ourCommunity partners seemed unlikely to come far enough to meet ourneeds at Dublin:  the Community moved slowly on such matters, andwe had come a long way since the previous European Council inStrasbourg in June when other member states had not been ready toaccept even that we had a case.    We were now likely to be offereda reduction of  300- 400 million, and possibly more.    That wasnot enough, and we should just have to keep plugging away for longer.The Common Agricultural Policy was in such a mess that someimprovement was bound to follow.    It would be important not toplay the hand in such a way as to make the Conservative Party appearto be anti-Europe an.    On the other hand the present situation wasindefensible, and it was vital not only for the EEC but in domesticCONFIDENTIAL294
CONFIDENTIALpolitical terms for the Government to stand firm on the Budget.Because vital political and economic interests of some of theCommunity partners were at stake in the Common AgriculturalPolicy (CAP), it would be even more difficult to secure adequatechanges in the CAP than to get relief 6n the United Kingdom&apos;s netbudgetary contribution.    But the Commission&apos;s latest proposalsfor reducing agricultural surpluses would hit our own farmersdisproportionately, and would have to be resisted.On the public presentation it was suggested that the two parts of ourBudget problem should be distinguished^      We could reasonablyhope to secure changes which would deal with our excessivecontribution although it would no doubt be conditional on an overallsettlement, we should be able to welcome this as a first step. Weshould then be left dealing only with the admittedly larger problemof our inadequate receipts from the Community Budget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that, unless we were offered something very closeto what we had asked for, she should not settle in Dublin,    We hada strong case based on the moral commitment which the Communityhad made in 1970 that if an unacceptable situation of this kindoccurred the very survival of the Community would demand that theinstitutions should find equitable solutions.    There could be no doubtthat the Community would face a crisis, which our partners wouldwelcome no more than we should, if this problem were not speedilyresolved.The Cabinet -1,    Took note, with approval, of      Prime Minieter&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Pean THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, on the adviceament *f the German Government and in order not to create difficultieswith the French in advance of the Dublin meeting, we had recentlyvoted in the Council of Ministers (Budget) against amendmentsproposed by the European Parliament to the 1980 Community Budget,the effect of which would have been to reduce provision for expendi-ture on milk surpluses under the CAP.    This had upset UnitedKingdom Members of the European Parliament (MEP&apos;s) who had beeninstrumental in getting the European Parliament to attack the highcost of agricultural surpluses.    The reasons for the Governmentsaction would need to be carefully explained to Conservative MEPs,In general, it was important for the Government to keep in closetouch with its supporters in the European Parliament.The Cabinet -2.     Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5TRJAL 4. The Cabinet briefly discussed the current industrialIRS situation.    Among the points made were:-a. Events were now moving favourably in British Leyland(BL) following the sacking of Mr Robinson.    The majortrades unions concerned had pulled back from official strikeaction, and a great deal of credit was due to certain seniorunion officials who had worked hard to contain the situation.The Company still faced difficult wage negotiations and themilitants were trying to present the Company&apos;s affairs as abattle between the Government and the unions.    It would beimpcrtant for Government Ministers to refrain from publiccomments about the Company which might play into themilitants1 hands.b. The reverberations of the resignation of the Board ofthe National Enterprise Board (NEB) were dying away.While the situation was still sensitive, the reaction of tradesunion leaders was not as hostile as might have been expected.As with BL it would be important to avoid acts or statementswhich might be misconstrued and inflame a delicate situation.It might for example be sensible to defer an announcementabout worker-directors in the Post Office for the time being.c. It was thought likely that the mineworkers&apos; ballot wouldresult in overwhelming support for the line being adopted bythe Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) inwage negotiations with the National Coal Board (NCB). TheSecretary of State for Energy had discussed the situation withthe Chairman of the NCB on the previous day and would bereporting the outcome to those colleagues most closelyconcerned.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategywould be discussing the situation at its meeting on the followingTuesday.d. The situation at the Charing Cross Hospital was muchimproved, and substantial quantities of oil had been deliveredto the hospital in the previous 24 hours.    The action takenagainst the strikers by the doctors and nurses of the hospitalhad been most effective.    A point to be noted for futurereference was that the strike had revealed the importanceto this hospital, and no doubt to other consumers, ofspecialised tankers able to carry the heated oil required byits furnaces.    The Ministry of Defence did not possesstankers of this type.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office28 November 1979 5CONFIDENTIAL296
