CONFIDENTIAL1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the period 22-26 October,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was essential for as many aspossible of the Government1 s major Bills to be introduced immediatelythe House of Commons returned from the Summer Recess. Althoughit was sometimes possible for a Bill to receive its Second Readingwithout the normal interval of two weekends from the date ofpublication, this would not be acceptable for substantial Bills of majorimportance.    Bills which had not been introduced before the longRecess could not therefore receive their Second Reading before5 November.    Nor should Bills be introduced in an incomplete orunsatisfactory state, in the expectation that faults or omissions couldbe made good by amendment in Committee:   such amendments wouldexpose the Government to serious criticism.    Consideration could begiven in due course to the introduction of certain major Bills in theHouse of Lords.    Bills starting in the Commons would need to reachthe Lords - where a timetable procedure was not available - insufficient time to protect their passage against delaying tactics byOpposition peers.    Ministers should therefore ensure that work onmajor Bills was completed as far as possible before the end of theRecess,The Cabinet -Took note.2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat, in the current government crisis in New Delhi, there seemedto be no clear majority in Parliament either for Mr Desai or for hismain rival Mr Charan Singh.    The latter was less well-disposed toBritain and less internationally minded.    It was uncertain whetherany Minister would now represent India at Lusaka, where Mr Desaihad been due to make the keynote speech.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that asecond British businessman had been arrested.    As in the earliercase he was unlikely to get a fair trial.    We had protested, particularlyabout the lack so far of consular access.    But we lacked any realleverage.    The scope for action in concert with other Westerncountries was limited but would be further examined.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatuseful progress had been achieved at the Geneva Conference onrefugees from Vietnam.    A total of 260, 000 places tor refugeeshad been pledged, as well as $190 million for the United NationsHigh Commissioner.    After an uncertain start, the Americans andsome others had followed Britain&apos;s robust line in criticism of theVietnamese Government, who moderated the truculent stance theyoriginally adopted and by the end of the Conference were privatelypromising to curb the exodus.    Our European partners had withsome difficulty now been persuaded to suspend for the time beingfurther food aid for Vietnam.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therestrained tone of the House of Commons debate on Rhodesia, andthe support for the Government&apos;s approach there demonstrated, hadbeen a satisfactory prelude to what was bound to be a difficultmeeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government at Lusaka.Thereafter the Government would be putting forward proposals forthe next step, which would take into account the views of those wehad consulted, including our American and European allies andmoderate governments in Africa.The Cabinet -Took note.3.        In a brief discussion it was noted that the recent meeting ofthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) had considered proposals fora common organisation of the market for sheepmeat.    It was not inthe United Kingdom1 s interest to have a Community regime forsheepmeat in its present form.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet had beiore them a minute from theLord President of the Council to the Prime Minister dated2 5 July 1979, reporting the conclusions of the meeting of theMinisterial Group on Dispersal (MISC 12) and covering the draftof a Parliamentary statement on dispersal which it was proposedshould be made later in the day.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy at their meeting on24 July had decided to confirm five of the moves in the existingdispersal programme, namely those of the Manpower ServicesCommission to Sheffield (1,850 further posts), the Export CreditsGuarantee Department to Cardiff (550 further posts), the Councilfor Small Industries in Rural Areas to Salisbury (67 further posts),the Stationery Office Laboratory to Norwich (40 posts), and of90 Customs and Excise posts to Southend.    They had agreed thatthere should be a substantial dispersal to Scotland, and hadinvited MISC 12 to give more detailed consideration to this andalso to the question of dispersal to Bootle.    They had not agreedto any other dispersal proposals.    MISC 12 had agreed thatdispersal to Scotland should consist of 650 posts to a building nowunder construction at East Kilbride, and at least 1, 350 posts toGlasgow giving a total of at least 2, 000 posts in all.    Under theexisting dispersal programme, the East Kilbride offices were dueto be occupied by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA),who had pointed out that the proposed move would involve halftheir headquarters staff and would cause considerable disruption,MISC 12 had agreed that Cabinet colleagues should be invited tovolunteer alternative posts for dispersal to East Kilbride, butno offers had been made and MISC 12&apos;s conclusion was thereforethat the move of ODA posts should be confirmed.    As for Glasgow,the Secretary of State for Defence had undertaken to try to find allthe necessary posts for dispersal from the London area.MISC 12 had noted that 250 posts had been volunteered fordispersal to Bootle, 150 computer posts by the Home Secretaryand 100 Property Services Agency posts by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment,    Given the needs of Merseyside and theexistence of the Crown Offices at Bootle which would soon be readyto accommodate 2, 300 staff, MISC 12 considered that there wouldbe advantage in the Governments committing itself to dispersing2, 300 posts to Bootle.    But there was no prospect of this numberof posts being volunteered, and MISC 12 had been given no .authority to designate particular Departments for this purpose.They recommended, however, that the field of choice should berestricted to those Departments who were due to disperse poststo Merseyside under the existing programme.    In discussion atMISC 12 it had been suggested that the Parliamentary statementshould not mention Bootle at all, but should leave the door opento further announcements about dispersal in due course. Themajority of MISC 12 had however considered that the Parliamentarystatement should represent the Governments final position as farCONFIDENTIAL3133
CONFIDENTIALIas the existing dispersal programme was concerned, without ofcourse ruling out the possibility of further dispersal exercisesin the future, and the draft statement reflected this view.In discussion of Scotland, it was argued that not only would dispersalmake the operation of the ODA more expensive and less efficientbut also that staff cuts would make the target of 650 posts moredifficult to achieve.    It was also suggested that the draft statementshould allow the Secretary of State for Defence some room to dispersestaff to Glasgow from outside London if this made better administra-tive sense.    On the other hand this might raise unnecessary fears inthe English regions, and the existing draft need not prevent a handfulof posts coming from elsewhere if need be.    The statement shouldalso say that &quot;at least&quot; 2, 000 posts would be moved to Scotland.In discussion of Bootle, it was pointed out that even withoutdispersal the new Crown Offices could be used for staff currentlyaccommodated in leased offices nearby.    On the other hand, it wassuggested that dispersal to Bootle was desirable on regional policygrounds and that the Cabinet should agree a total figure and authorisethe Lord President of the Council, or a Ministerial Grovp, to selectthe candidates.    It would however be impossible to do this for anannouncement that afternoon and in any case Departments whoseprojected moves to other locations were now to be cancelled mightbe in a better position to disperse to Merseyside than the Departmentswho had previously been intended to go there.In further discussion, it was argued that there should be furtherdispersal to Cardiff where the cancellation of the large Ministry ofDefence dispersal could have important political repercussions.Public expenditure problems could be overcome by renting existingoffice accommodation, or by using private developers to build the newoffices.    Against this it was argued that the Public AccountsCommittee had criticised Governments for the extent to which theoffice estate was rented rather than owned.    Cancellations ofdispersal plans would also lead to questions of what to do with halfcompleted buildings.In continued discussion a number of drafting changes to theParliamentary statement were agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet confirmed that the five moves agreed by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy should go ahead.   They agreed tothe dispersal of 650 Overseas Development Administration posts toEast Kilbride, and of at least 1, 350 Ministry of Defence posts toGlasgow, where the St. Enoch&apos;s site would be used.    They confirmedthe moves of 150 Home Office computer unit posts and 100 PropertyServices Agency posts to Bootle which had been agreed by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for the Environment respectively.4CONFIDENTIAL13
CONFIDENTIALThey agreed that the Parliamentary statement should refer to thenew Government offices at Bootle and should foreshadow furtherdispersal there beyond the 250 posts already agreed, thoughwithout specifying a figure.    They recognised that this was likelyin practice to lead to dispersal of substantial numbers of furtherposts to Bootle.    They had agreed that the Deparments to beconsidered for the further dispersal to Bootle need not be confinedto those Departments which had been due to disperse posts toMerseyside under the existing programme.    The Lord Presidentof the Council should consult his colleagues about what posts mightbe dispersed, and should report back to the Cabinet with firmproposals in due course.    The Cabinet had agreed that the rest ofthe existing dispersal programme should be cancelled.    They hadnoted that the sale of the St. Mellon1 s site at Cardiff could involvepolitical difficulties.    They had also noted that buildings now underconstruction at Southport and Blackpool would no longer berequired for dispersal, and invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to consider cancelling the building contracts orotherwise disposing of the buildings, in consultation with the ChiefSecretary, Treasury on the public expenditure implications. TheLord President of the Council should arrange for a statement of theGovernments conclusions to be made in both Houses of Parliamentthat afternoon, taking account of the drafting amendments which hadbeen agreed during the discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council, the Secretary of :..State for the Environment and the other Ministers&apos;concerned, to be guided accordingly.5CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET5,        The Cabinet resumed its discussion of Public Expenditure in1980-81.    It had before it, in addition to the papers considered at theprevious meetings, a minute from the Chief Secretary, Treasury,dated 25 July about the programmes for Northern Ireland, Scotland,Wales and Coal;  and a minute dated 25 July from the Chancellor of theExchequer about guidance to local authorities.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that since the lastmeeting, agreement had been reached on reductions of  90 millionin the programme of the Northern Ireland Office;  of  256 millionin the programmes of the Scottish Office;  of  107 million in theprogrammes of the Welsh Office;  and of  25 million in the externalfinancing requirements of the National Coal Board.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet hadearlier decided not to make any statement to Parliament before theRecess about the reductions in Puhlic Expenditure in 1980-81 whichhad now been agreed.    It had however noted that it would be necessaryto give guidance to the local authorities, and to certain other bodies,about their spending plans for 1980-81.    He had therefore circulated,with his minute of 25 July, the text of &apos;guidance&apos; which it wasproposed should be given to local authorities at meetings starting onTuesday 31 July.    Similar guidance would be given to nationalisedindustries and other public bodies involved.    The outstanding problemwas whether such guidance should be expressed in global terms, orshould proceed to itemise the main reductions which the Governmentwanted to see, although it had no power to impose them.    It might alsobe necessary to give guidance to the local authorities about thereductions to be made in later years.    Cabinet would also wish toconsider the arrangements for its own discussion of later years afterthe Recess.In discussion, it was argued that the Government, in its consultationswith the local authorities, had always stressed the need for flexibilityat local level, and had merely sought the advice of the local authoritiesabout the services on which reductions might be made. Havingreached decisions on the overall reductions, the Government shouldStow inform the authorities, and leave them to indicate how thesavings would be found.    The Government for its part should simply saythat it would make the necessary legislative changes which would permitthe authorities to make certain economies if they chose.Against this, it was argued that the Cabinet had in fact carefullychosen some of the main areas in which it wished cuts to fall. Ineducation, it had been particularly careful to avoid damage to the maineducational programme, concentrating reductions upon peripheralservices like transport and school meals.    These decisions would beseriously mis-represented if the Government did not give someindication of where it wished reductions to be made.    This wasparticularly important for education since it bulked so large in local4SECRET136
SECRETauthority total expenditure.    However, if the proposed guidancehighlighted the preservation of standards in education, this wouldsimply draw attention to the sharp reduction in other services whichmight be needed, for example in the provision of old people&apos;s homes.In further discussion, there was general agreement that the Cabinetshould return to the level of expenditure in subsequent years inSeptember.    It would be necessary to publish a White Paper coveringat least the expenditure levels of 1980-81 in the late autumn.However, there were arguments against publication of figures foryears after 1980-81,    It might be sensible to abandon the practiceof publishing five-year public expenditure White Papers, or ofmodifying substantially the degree of detail which was published aboutlater years.    The Cabinet needed a further paper on this questionbefore taking final decisions.THE PRIME MINISTER, Summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet confirmed the agreements which had been reached on theprogrammes for Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and Coal in1980-81.    They agreed that it would be necessary to give guidance tothe local authorities and to other public sector bodies.    This guidanceshould be given in confidence, despite the risk that it would leak,so that the Government could defensibly postpone publication untilParliament resumed.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consulta-tion with the Secretary of State for the Environment and the otherMinisters directly concerned, should agree the precise terms of theguidance to be given to local authorities.    Where it was necessary togive guidance to other public sector bodies, including the nationalisedindustries, this should be done in the normal way and after consultanttion with the Treasury in each case.    In preparing guidance to localauthorities the Chancellor of the Exchequer and his colleagues shouldtake account of the views expressed by the Cabinet and would, inparticular, omit detailed figures on the lines of Tables A and B in hisdraft statement.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should bring apaper to the Cabinet dealing with the arguments for and against thepublication of information for the later years.    The Cabinet woulditself resume its discussion of expenditure in later years on13 September.    In the light of progress made at that meeting, it wouldprobably be necessary for the Treasury to conduct bilateralnegotiations with the Departments concerned, the results of whichwould be considered by Cabinet on 18 October.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other Ministersconcerned to proceed accordingly.7SECRET137
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet had before them a minute dated 17 July fromthe Lord President of the Council, suggesting that, with theimposition of cash limit controls, the recruitment ban agreed byCabinet at its second meeting had now served its purpose and thatthe ending of the ban should be announced by a Written Answerbefore the Recess.    They also considered a minute from theSecretary of State for the Environment dated 24 July arguing thatthe ban should be retained, primarily in the interests of containinglocal authority expenditure.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, following hisminute of 17 July, most of the Ministers consulted had agreed thatthe ban could now be lifted.    It was a blunt instrument, andconsiderable flexibility had been needed by Departmental Ministersin applying it.    Cash limits now allowed a much more effectivecontrol.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe ban had been an unprecedented measure, which enabled him tourge local authorities to take similar action.    If the ban were nowlifted in Government Departments, it would be correspondingly moredifficult to persuade the local authorities, to whom similar cashlimit disciplines did not apply, to keep tight control over theirmanpower.    It was important, both in local authorities and inGovernment Departments, to retain political control over staffnumbers and new recruitment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the formal ban on recruitment should now belifted.    It was for Departmental Ministers to maintain control overstaff numbers and new recruitment in their own Departments. Theywould have to keep within their cash limits and should also adjust theirrecruitment policy to prepare for the very much larger cuts inmanpower which the Cabinet would be considering in the autumn.Any announcement about the lifting of the ban should make it clearthat strict discipline would be maintained over recruitment whichwould only take place sparingly.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council and the other Ministersconcerned to: proceed accordingly.8CONFIDENTIAL138
SECRET7, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Home Department (C(79) 32) about theReform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act.THE HOME SECRETARY said that reform of Section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act had been discussed extensively, both inOpposition and in Government.    His paper identified a small numberof important issues which still had to be decided, but a Bill woijldthen be prepared as soon as possible.    The report of theDepartmental Committee on Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act1911 (the Franks Committee) had received wide support and heproposed that the Government should wherever possible follow itsrecommendations.    Departures from them in a restrictive directionwould expose the Government to criticism both from the Oppositionand from some of their own supporters.    The outstanding issueswere the protection to be given to Cabinet papers and to informationabout the currency and the reserves;  the arrangements for thecertification of serious injury to the interests of the nation (whetherby the responsible Minister or on the advice of &quot;three wise men&quot;);and the cover which might be needed for the confidences of foreigngovernments.    On the latter he was more disposed to meet thewishes of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary. Arrangementsfor securing adequate protection under the Security and Intelligencecategory for certain activities of the Ministry of Defence and theArmed Forces should be the subject of further consideration byofficials.    The Bill might be suitable for introduction in the House ofLords.It was suggested in discussion that a more restrictive Short Titlemight be preferable to &quot;Official Information Bill&quot; in order toemphasise that the Bill was not to be concerned with freedom ofinformation.    The Long Title could be made proof against amend-ments to extend the scope of the Bill in this way, but the Long Titlecould itself be amended in the House of Lords,    If this were aserious possibility, it might be preferable to introduce the Bill inthe House of Commons to ensure that it did not reach that Housewith a Long Title that would permit wide-ranging amendments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that Cabinet papers and information regarding thecurrency and the reserves did not require the protection of criminalsanctions and that the certification of &quot;serious injury&quot; to the interestsof the nation should be the business of the responsible Minister.The Cabinet approved the proposals in C(79) 32 subject to the additionof a further category &quot;the confidences of foreign governments&quot; to thecategories of information which would have blanket cover, not subjectto the &quot;serious injury&quot; test.    Both the Short and Long Title must bedrawn tightly to minimise the scope for amendment.    With this inmind the Home Secretary should consider the case for an alternativeShort Title in consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the9SECRET
SECRETAttorney General.    Legislation Committee should take into accountthe likelihood of unacceptable amendments to the Long Title beingcarried when they considered whether the Bill should be introducedin the House of Lords.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to arrange for aBill to be drafted accordingly.10SECRET
CONFIDENTIAL8. THE PRIME MINISTER sa&apos;d that the next full meeting ofthe Cabinet was planned for Thursday, 13 September when publicexpenditure in the later years was due to be considered. Shewould however like to hold a meeting on Thursday 30 August tobe attended by those Cabinet Ministers who were not on holiday:but she would not wish members of the Cabinet to interruptplanned official visits or their holidays in order to return to Londonfor this meeting.    Ministers and Departments had been forced towork at great pressure during the early months of the newGovernment, and after the holidays more care should be given tothe careful preparation of matters coming to the Cabinet andtheir subsequent clear presentation in Cabinet papers. Neverthelessthe Government, had made a good start.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office26 July 197911CONFIDENTIAL- 141
kEVIEW OF DISPERSAL PROGRAMMEP, At Tuesday&apos;s meeting of the Ministerial Committee onconomic Strategy, you asked me to chair a small group of&quot;inisters (MISC 12) to reach decisions on certain aspects ofispersal which E Committee had left open, and to agree araft statement to be made in Parliament on Thursday 26 July.jhsc 12 accordingly met this morning.Jj E Committee agreed to the moves in Option 1 of the paper(79)26.   MISC 12 had to deal with the question of moves tocotland and to Bootle.. As to Scotland, E Committee expressed sympathy witheorge Younger&apos;s view that at least 2,000 posts should beispersed there.   At MISC 12 this morning, Francis Pym agreedhat he would do his best to find 1400-1450 London-based postso send to Glasgow.   MISC 12 also agreed that 650 posts shoulde dispersed to the building now under construction at Eastlbride, giving a total of something over 2,000 for Scotlands a whole.   Under the previous Administration1s plans, theast Kilbride building was earmarked for the Overseas DevelopmentMinistration.    Neil Marten argued strongly that the dispersalf this many posts - about half of HQ staff - would affect thefficiency of a small Department such as his much more than thatfa large Department.    While appreciating his difficulties weelt that the political need was overriding and that thejusting plan to disperse ODA posts should be confirmed unlessy of our Cabinet colleagues are willing to volunteer 650Iternative   posts for East Kilbride.    If such offers areorthcoming we will need to know by tomorrow morning.
t0 Bootle, we noted that 250 posts had been volunteered fors 2. there and that E Committee were content for up-to anional 2,050 staff to go there if their Departments- agreed. . ,0nction, we doubted whether this commitment went far enough. Incular, we thought there would be advantage, given -the needs ofvSide and the existence of the Crown Offices there, which willodate 2,300 staff, if the Government were able to commitfto dispersing 2,300 posts to Bootle.   We recognised that itnot be possible, in time for an announcement on Thursday, toagreement on which posts would go there, but we thought thecement would be precise enough if it said that the posts wouldfrom the Departments who are due to move to Merseyside under theing programme.    These are, the Home Office, the -Foreign andonwealth Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries andthe Health and Safety Executive and the Agricultural Researchoil (the moves previously-envisaged for them to Merseysideved about 4,000 posts so that there should be room to cut out! moves least attractive on managerial grounds).    The alternativeseither to announce the 250 moves already agreed, leaving thender of the new accommodation in Bootle to be filled by localfrom existing rented property, or leaving Bootle out of thencement altogether.0 other points arose of which you should be aware.irstly, some Ministers argued that we should not make, a final .cement on Thursday, but that dispersal should be a. continuingess.   Otherwise they argued that there would be a tendency forvs working in central London to creep back up.    I took thethat, while of course we were not ruling out further dispersalcises for all time, E Committee had decided to cancel the wholee existing exercise apart from Option 1 and the moves to Glasgowootle which we had been discussing.    I am sure that Thursday1 scement must be designed to end uncertainty as far as possible,e is no point in encouraging the assisted areas to hope forer dispersals which, in the next few years at least, they areoing to get.Secondly, Michael Heseltine pointed out that building contractsin progress for two moves which E Committee decided to cancel,ly the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys to Southport&apos;the building under construction is of a specialised designlimits the possibilities for alternative uses) and thertment of Health and Social Security&apos;s further move to Norcross,kpool.   &quot;We noted that the costing of the options considered bymmittee assumed that cancellation of these two dispersals wouldallowed by cancellation of the building contracts.ael Heseltime is reluctant to take this step.   &quot;We took thethat these were matters for him to sort out with the Chiefetary, Treasury.2143

STATEMENT .jl June the Government announced that it was going to review thelamroe of Civil Service dispersal.    The Hardman Report of 1973 hadced 3 possible options.    Our predecessors then produced a plan.wa6significantly different from any of them.len we came into office we found it was proposed not only to[r6e a further 21,000 Civil Service posts from London but alsofrom such places as Harrogate, Bath and Didcot.    Such dispersalfrom places outside London were never suggested in the Hardmanft and it is impossible to see the justification for them. Theprogramme would cost over  250m. during the remainder of thent Public Expenditure Survey period to 1983/84, and &quot;we should beinto the 1990s before the benefits from dispersal began to offsetOBtS, . .lilst I recognize that in the Assisted Areas the dispersalfamine has been viewed as an important element in improvingyment opportunities, nevertheless some of the importantderations which led to the setting up of the Hardman study nor apply.    In 1973 the Civil Service was expanding and thenment faced the jprospect of providing more offices at high1n rents.    This Government intends to reduce the size of thece.   Moreover, the gap between office rents in London and in thences has substantially narrowed and the long term financialits of moving people out of London are that much the less.Bving considered all these factors the Government have concludedI the present dispersal programme must be substantially reduced.se moves already in progress are so far advanced that theyHd continue.    These are the moves of the Manpower ServicesJssion to Sheffield, the Export Credits Guarantee Department toJffand the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas toOisbury.   There are 2 further small moves which would increase thency of the Departments concerned at very little cost.

Local Authorities2.     I attach a draft of a possible statement which the Secretaryof State for the Environment might be invited to make.    The drafthas been discussed between officials of the Departments mainlyconcerned.      The main questions which we need to decide in Cabinettomorrow are:(i)    Is it agreed that a statement should be made on theselines?      It has been emphasised strongly to us that,if the local authorities are to cut back their planson the scale required, they need to be told before theholidays.      Accordingly, even though we have decidednot to make a full statement to Parliament about allthe reductions in plans, I believe that this guidanceshould be given to the local authorities.(ii)    Does Cabinet have views on the best timing of such astatement?     The figures in it will need to be checkedwith Departments following Cabinet&apos;s final decisions- 1 -SECRET
programmes, and on the other hand except where largercuts had been identified in Opposition).      If we arenow to consult on the later years, it should be on thebasis of options not less than those needed to get backto the expenditure level of 1977-78.      Therefore paragraph I!7 of the draft is in terms of reductions, from therevised level for 1980-81, which would in fact achievethe 12j/17j per cent path.      The figure required for1980-81 is in fact intermediate between the 5 per centand 7s per cent options&apos; suggested.      Any consultationon housing (excluded from this paragraph) can bearranged separately, in terms to be agreed between DOEand the Treasury.      I hope Cabinet will agree thatconsultations should go forward on this basis, aimed atreports by end-September when we propose to resumeconsideration of /the later years.. Other Agencies3. We have been planning not to announce the rest of our publicxpenditure decisions before the autumn. But there may be a fewinor cases, besides the local authorities, where it is necessary0 take&apos;some action going beyond central government, and thereforeliable to become public, if the decisions are to be fullyeffective next year.      There may be one example in agriculture(Meatjand Livestock Commission).1jk-     I hope it can be agreed that, if colleagues are satisfiedthat such action is essential to secure the cuts in any specificcase, they should clear what they propose with the Treasury.Jjat^onalised Industries jI was also asked to cover the question of guidance to theationalised industries.      This is much less difficult than for0cal authorities but it is still not straightforward.- 3 -SECRET
(with minor adjustments, e.g. to Table A to a basisfamiliar to local authorities).      Subject to this,the announcement should clearly be made as soon aspossible.(iii)    Should the guidance for 1980-81 be given, for currentexpenditure, in terms of a single total, or itemisedby service?-    This was discussed in the MISC 11 report(paragraphs 6-9) which recommended the global approach,and in the minute of 18th July from the Secretary ofState for Education taking a different view. Clearlywe must now resolve this issue, choosing between the-alternative versions of paragraphs 3 and H in theattached draft.(iv)    Should the local authorities be consulted about thelater years?     The draft refers to the consultationon options for reductions in 1980-81 of up to 1\ percent (as agreed following the letter of 7th June fromthe Secretary of State for the Environment);    and itstates the Government&apos;s intention to publish its fullplans for I98O-8I and later years in the autumn.If the local authorities are to be consulted about theimplications for them of further reductions in thelater years, now is the time to do so.Cabinet agreed on 2kth May that, to provide options forgetting back by 1982-83 to the adjusted publicexpenditure total for 1977-78, reductions should beconsidered of 71 per cent on the Cmnd.7^39 programmesfor 1980-81, 12$ per cent for 1981-82, 17J per cent for1982-83, and not less than that again in 1983-84(except for the defence, law and order and health- 2 -SECRET
? e*.c l\ e tfti    The last Government made a virtue of aiming to give the&quot;ndustries &quot;by the end of the summer&quot;, rather than the end ofhe year, &quot;approval for 100 per cent of their agreed investmenttrogramme for one year ahead&quot; and a declining percentage ofhe programme for the next two years.      We cannot generally &quot;sayuch this year about 1981-82 and 1982-83.      But we should be able0 say something about I98O-8I, provided this can be done interms that preserve the option of using cash limits in a waythat exerts pressure for responsible pay bargaining.      I haveIlready told the Chairmen that we have it in mind to set cashimits in advance of pay negotiations.     But if they are to be aseful discipline, sponsor Ministers will need to present theolume figures for investment and financing which have beengreed as provisional maxima which are subject to later decisionsnd discussions on cash limits.      I ask sponsor Ministers tolonsult Treasury Ministers about the way in which our decisionsio far should be conveyed to the different industries.Decisions on the later years of the SurveyWe will need to return to decisions about- the later years ofe Survey period.      We should do so as soon as possible aftere holidays if we are to publish a White Paper soon afteriarliament reassembles.If you and other colleagues agree, I suggest that the Chief-cretary might circulate proposals which could be discussed inISC 11 or bilaterally with colleagues prior to further discussionCabinet, unless it is practicable to arrange a Cabinetfscussion fairly early in September.      We could aim in this wayreach as much agreement as possible with a view to settling^standing issues at Cabinet in the early autumn.- H -secret152

SECRETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1980-81inisters have been considering the public expenditure plansI98O-8I.    Given the poor prospect for economic growth next year,ffid-wide and in- the UK, there is a clear need to rein back the^rited plans for public spending.    To implement these planslull would have meant a rate of growth of public expenditurevolume terms, above the revised figures for the current year, bout 6 per cent.    This is out of the question, and taken in^junction with the substantial increases in public service pay,lid have been wholly inconsistent with the Government&apos;s economicrategy.   It would have meant adding to inflationary pressures[pushing up interest rates, and would have made some increase innet tax burden Inevitable.The Government will announce its decisions on the whole range ofgrammes for 1980-81 and later years in the autumn.    However, theml authorities need to know now what the scale of cuts affectingIn for I98O-8I will be, as they are planning their budgets now forft year.    In considering the scale of reductions for next year,&quot;have taken full account of the consultations with the local 5Horities on options for cuts of up to 7i per cent, and thelussion in the Consultative Council on 9th July.    The Secretarytate for Scotland will be seeing the Scottish local authorities;I have to say to you now concerns England and Wales. 1Within the overall need for spending reductions, the Governmentiks it right to give local authorities the maximum freedom toLde on the allocation of funds in accordance with their own&amp;1 spending priorities .KBut the Government has decided thatal authorities should plan on the basis of a reduction ofer cent on the plans for current expenditure in Circular79 for 1980-81 which amounted in total to  12,163m. ThisId be a reduction of 1 per cent on the levels I have askedal authorities to achieve in 1979-80.Hi
SECRETVJe shall want to discuss with you the most realistic allocationBong individual services, but the total of relevant expenditureJr Rate Support Grant will of course need to be consistent with(is overall level of current expenditure.    It is the Government&apos;s&apos;ew that priority should be given to law and order, and inrticular the plans for court, police and probation servicesould not undergo any reduction.4-^or its part, the Government intends to seek certain legislative \anges to give the local authorities more latitude in achievinge total.&quot;&quot;&quot;In the field of education, where the Governmentssh is that standards in primary and secondary schools should beintained, we shall ask Parliament to relax the statutoryligation on local authorities to provide school milk and meals,dto remove the restrictions on charging for school transport,th a view to savings totalling well over  200 million in80-8l.   We shall also ask Parliament to approve primary legislationallow local authorities to charge for planning permissions, andreduce the role of the counties in planning procedures; andcondary legislation to charge for the enforcement of buildinggulations, and amend the General Development Order.For capital expenditure, which is centrally controlled for eachograrame separately, the Government has decided that the nationaltals for the programmes for 1980-81 as set out in Cmnd.7^39evalued to 1979 Survey   prices) should be reduced by the amountstout in the attached table.    [B] .    Allocations to individualthorities will be made later.Por later years, beyond 1980-81, there have not yet been anynsultations on &quot;the options.    The reductions in expenditure inls year and next will need to be carried forward in the threeUowbliing years, which will be covered in the Government&apos;s fullc expenditure plans to be published in the autumn. Ibefore propose that, in the light of the allocation for 198O-8I155
SECRETg individual services, expenditure groups should reportI the Consultative Council by the end-September how theseductions in later years can best be achieved.    To that endey should examine options for reducing the level of totalcal authority spending now envisaged for 1980-81 (excludingusing, which is being dealt with separately;    and law andder), amounting to   5 per cent and 1\ per cent in 19 81-82, andeach case a further 5 per cent below these levels in 1982-83with the level in 1982-83 continued into 1983-8*! which willthe final year in the new public expenditure plans.I intend to issue this statement as a circular to localthorities shortly.3156

This would be a reductionper cent on the levels I have asked local authoritieschieve in 1979-80.

C077F j iuiM j Ai.rime MINISTER&apos;HE BAN ON CIVIL SERVICE RECRUITMENT   ^ \When we took office we imposed a 3 montWfreeze on recruitment tothe Civil Service as an initial measure/in our plans to curb publicexpenditure.    As I reported to you on 29 June, we have sinceagreed on adjusted cash limits to provide for a 2f% overall savingsin Civil Service staff costs this year, after allowing for some^essential exemptions.   And we shall be discussing plans forreductions in the longer term in September.2. Information from departments shows that we are now well oncourse to achieving the required saving in staff costs.    The banpas served its intended purpose of exerting an immediate pressureon numbers but now that we have established the new cash limits Ido not think we need retain it.3. The cash limits will compel continuing restraint in recruitmentby departments but continuation of the general ban, with its presentlargely indiscriminate effects, would cause unnecessary strains andmake more difficult the resumption of recruitment particularly ofsome good quality people.    The financial discipline of the cashlimit is now our constraint and we can leave it to colleagues topermit such recruitment as they consider necessary.    This willprovide a more flexible approach, enable recruitment, to be adjustedmore closely to operational needs and provide a more sensible run-into the bigger reductions we shall be discussing in September. Itherefore propose that we announce the lifting of the general banfrom mid-August by means of a Written Answer before the recess.^-    I am copying to Cabinet colleagues, the Minister of Transportand Sir John Hunt.SOAMES17 July 1979Mr MdUi160

You agreed that I might raise my worries-ally at Cabinet on Thursday and asked me in the meanwhile torculate a minute.jwould urge that at this stage we should not lift the ban, for theill owing reasons:i. this would be seen as a first weakening of the Government&apos;sresolution in the critical field of restraining publicservice manpower;ii. it would be extremely difficult for me to continue to asklocal authorities to retain a ban - which I believe isnecessary - if in central Government the restriction hadbeen lifted;iii. as the Lord President reminds us, we shall be discussingfuture,  and bigger, reductions in manpower in September.Until&apos;this exercise is complete I believe that the ban^should remain as it underlines the Government&apos;s determinationand, at the same time, will make easier the achievementof reductions.    Until that review is complete we simply donot know how credible our stance on manpower reductions willbe;the achievement of arbitrary percentage reductions is asignificant step.    But it is not a substitute for Ministerstaking day to day decisions about the details of their ownDepartments - a process which is made necessary by therecruitment ban.a^cept that we should now adopt a more flexible regime. Ministers^Portments should have discretion but the reporting proceduresuld, I believe, be agreed by the Lord President.    One refinement!jould adopt has been tried successfully by some of our colleagues -l0Cr&apos;l government.
