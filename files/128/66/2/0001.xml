CONFIDENTIALTAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commone during the following week, and that it wouldbe proposed that the House should adjourn for the Spring BankHoliday from Friday, 25 May until Monday 11 June.lislativetgrammeTHE HOME SECRETARY said that The Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) had approved a number of Bills forearly introduction in the new session.    These were the Bills onKiribati, Education, European Assembly (Salaries and Pensions),the Price Cornrnission, Off-Shore Installations and CriminalJustice (Amendment) (Scotland), for introduction in the House ofCommons;  and Bills on Companies, Limitation, Charging Ordersand Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) for intro-duction in the House of Lords.    These Bills, together with theremainder of the Debate on the Address and the Budget and theFinance Bill, should provide reasonable business for both Housesfor the next few weeks.    QL would now consider proposals for thefull legislative programme, on which he hoped to be able to makea preliminary report to the Cabinet in two weeks&apos; time.The Cabinet -Took note.REIGNFAIRSategic Armsidtationka (SALT)odesiaeviousference::(79) 1stnclusions,nute 22.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Americans had urgedthe Alliance to issue a welcoming statement on the completion ofthe SALT II negotiations.    So far as we were concerned, thiswould depend on the extent to which the United States Secretary ofState, Mr Vance, was able to resolve our doubts.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Prime Minister&apos;s remarksin the House of Commons on Rhodesia on 15 May had been wellreceived.    Lord Boyd had reported that the elections had beenfairly conducted and had been as free as possible in the circum-stances and that the outcome represented the wishes of themajority of the people.    This would be helpful in dealing withcriticism in other African countries.    Sir Antony Duff was inSalisbury where he was discussing with Bishop Muzorewa, amongother things, the question of establishing a British representativein Salisbury.    The United States Senate had passed by largemajorities three resolutions on Rhodesia which would causeproblems for the Administration.    The most important requiredCONFIDENTIAL19
CONFIDENTIALPresident Carter to make a judgment that the Case-Javitsamendment had been substantially complied with, and thus theconditions for recognition fulfilled, within fourteen days of theinstallation of the new Rhodesian government.    This could meanthat President Carter would have to make a decision by mid-June,THE PRIME MINISTER said that, while the timing of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision on recognition needed careful consideration, we shouldbear in mind the unde sirability of seeming to drag our feet onrecognition or merely following behind the United StatesAdministration.    Lord Boyd&apos;s report was very good and should bepublished.    Mr, Drinkwater, a member of Lord Boyd&apos;s team whowas also a member of the Boundary Commission and thereforeregarded himself as acting in a semi-judicial capacity, had put ina separate report, but although this raised certain problems it did notdiffer in substance from the conclusions reached by Lord Boyd.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that while the talks withChancellor Schmidt and his Ministerial colleagues had generallygone well the Germans had not yet accepted our case on theCommunity Budget.    They disputed our figures and this would haveto be remedied.    We should be careful not to appear to be re-negotiating the terms of entry but it was clear that we needed aneffective safeguard mechanism which the previous Administrationhad failed to get.    She intended to visit Paris for a meeting withPresident Giscard d&apos;Estaing of France on 5 June.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said the budget problemhad been the main item for discussion at the Council of Ministers(Finance) earlier in the week.    While stressing the Governmentscommitment to the Community he had sought to impress on hiscolleagues that this Government took at least as serious a view asits predecessor about the disproportionate budget burden on theUnited Kingdom.    Although the arithmetic was beginning topenetrate, other member states did not want to address themselvesto the need for changes and took refuge in arguments eg about otheradvantages which could not be measured.    Some countries like theIrish Republic were fearful that our attack on the budget arrange-ments would undermine the benefits they secured under the CommonAgricultural Policy,    We should enlist more support if we showedthat our attack was on the budget mechanism itself.    We were infor a long tough haul and a solution would only come at the highestpolitical level.    He had asked that it should be on the agenda of theEuropean Council in Strasbourg and we should need to develop ourcase firmly before then.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion it was noted that there was still an unresolveddispute over how monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) shouldbe treated for the purpose of budget transfers.    But even on theleast favourable treatment from our point of view, the UnitedKingdom was still the second largest net contributor.    It wasimportant to get the facts established and the Defence and OverseaPolicy Committee, Sub-Committee on European Questions wouldbe considering papers shortly.    It was also important that weshould convince our Community partners in bilateral discussionsbefore the matter was discussed in the Council, and the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary would be proposing to his colleaguesa series of intensive bilateral contacts.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat following his informal meeting with other CommunityAgriculture Ministers it was clear that the negotiations overagricultural prices for 1979-80 would be extremely tough. Along meeting of the Agriculture Council was scheduled for Junebut it was doubtful whether a settlement would be possible. Forinternal political reasons, the French Government were pressingvery hard for increased prices and they had the support of theIrish and new Belgian Minister of Agriculture.    The Italianswere our allies and there was some shift of opinion in Germany.He intended to have bilateral talks with his Dutch and Danishopposite numbers.In a brief discussion the political importance for the Governmentof sticking firmly to its position on a price freeze was stressed.If any concessions were made in the final stages this could onlybe on products which were not in surplus.    It was important thatthe Commission should continue to support our stand on a pricefreeze for surplus commodities.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhuePENDITUREf9-804. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury (C(79) 4) on the scope for cuts in publicexpenditure in 1979-80.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the latest forecasts for the publicsector borrowing requirement made it absolutely essential that cutslarger than those proposed in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper should beagreed urgently in order to leave room for immediate reductions indirect taxation consistent with realistic monetary targets and a fallin interest rates.    The aim should be to find extra savings of some 500 million to  600 million in 1979-80.    It was crucial to theGovernment1 s whole economic strategy that substantial and earlyreductions should be made in public expenditure.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the proposals inhis paper, which were based on work done by the Conservative Partyin opposition and on proposals from the Treasury, would yieldsavings of  750- 850 million in 1979-80.    In addition, he proposeda reduction in the Rate Support Grant of  200 million.    Disposal ofpublic sector assets might yield as much as a further  1, 000 million.Substantial further savings should be possible.    He proposed todiscuss individual programmes bilaterally with the Ministersconcerned after which he would report back to Cabinet with hisrecommendations.In discussion of the proposed cuts in Departmental programmes,there was general agreement that bigger cuts than those proposedin the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper would be needed.    It was howeverargued that blanket percentage reductions would be inappropriate.The need was to ensure that every Minister made the maximumsavings possible within his own programme, taking full account ofits circumstances.    The Government was prepared to give highpriority to the defence and law and order programmes, but this didnot exempt the Departments concerned from the need to eliminatewaste.    It would be helpful if individual Departmental Ministers weregiven targets for the reduction they might make, rather than asked tomake specific changes.    They were better placed than TreasuryMinisters to know the best ways of securing economies of the desiredsize.    Departmental Ministers would also need discretion in somecases to consult fringe bodies such as the Manpower ServicesCommission.    Switches in expenditure from one programme toanother need not be ruled out.    For example, support of overseasstudents might be made a charge against the aid programme, and fittedin to whatever total was available for aid, instead of being framedas part of the education budget.4CONFIDENTIAL22
CONFIDENTIALOn the question of the Rate Support Grant, it was argued that theproposed reduction of  200 million was too small.    The aim shouldbe a cut of at least  300 million, and it should be possible to findthis without difficulty out of a total grant of more than  7, 000 million.Most local authorities had substantial balances available, which theywould be able to run down.    While there was a danger of excessivelylarge rate increases in the following financial year as a result, theintention was to put pressure on local authorities to reduce theirexpenditure during the year so as to make this unnecessary. Earlydiscussions had already been arranged with the local authorityassociations in England and in Scotland.    The Government&apos;s generalline was clear, but any specific proposals to be put to the associationsshould be cleared in advance with Treasury Ministers.In discussion of sales of assets, it was pointed out that these werenot a substitute for cuts in real expenditure.    The two must gotogether.    The capacity of the markets to absorb these assets mightset an upper limit to the amount which could be raised in the firstyear.    But much would depend on the choice both of the assets to besold, and of the mode of disposal.    So far as possible, sales shouldbe made by placement with British institutions rather than by openoffers of sale which would bring in foreign buyers.    It would thereforebe better to aim at a long list of possible assets, from which atactical choice could be made during the year.    If legislation wasneeded to facilitate some of these sales, an omnibus Bill might bebrought in at an early stage.    As a separate exercise, the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, had already set in hand a review of means ofdisposing of public sector land.    Thi^ would include the question of&quot;Crichel Down rules&quot; which at present inhibited quick sales.Similarly, it was important that the sale of council houses should befacilitated by making available from City sources funds to tenantswho wished to purchase their own houses.    This would requireco-operation between the Treasury, the Bank of England and Cityinstitutions.In further discussion of the Contingency Reserve, it was pointed outthat the size of the Reserve could not be finally determined untildecisions had been taken on improvements in social security benefitsduring the rest of the year.    The Ministers concerned were alreadyengaged in discussions on these points.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the urgent need for immediate reductions in publicexpenditure in 1979-80 which would give the Chancellor of theExchequer the maximum room for manoeuvre in formulating hisBudget.    The aim should be to seek savings in 1979-80 some 500 million or  600 million greater than those set out in the Annexto C(79) 4.    To this end, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should5CONFIDENTIAL23
CONFIDENTIALformulate targets for reductions in expenditure for eachDepartmental programme, and should discuss these bilaterally withthe Ministers concerned.    He should report the results of hisdiscussions to the Cabinet for approval at the meeting on 31 May.The Secretary of State for the Environment, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of State forWales, and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should aim at areduction of at least  300 million in the Rate Support Grant for1979-80 before allowing for any offset to the teachers1 paysettlement to be discussed later in the meeting.    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury, should set in hand a review of the scope forselling assets with the aim of realising at least  1, 000 million in1979-80.    In consultation with the other Ministers concerned andwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, he should considerwhether legislation might be needed in order to remove obstacles tothe sale of some of the assets concerned.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, should make definite proposals for the size of theContingency Reserve for the remainder of 1979-80 in the light ofthe decisions shortly to be taken about social security uprating.The Cabinet agreed that the Reserve thus established should befirmly maintained for the rest of the year.    It followed that if theChief Secretary, Tieasury, was unable to accept any claim on theReserve in bilateral discussions or at meetings of CabinetCommittees, he should arrange for the issues to be brought to theCabinet for decision.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C(79) 5) by theChief Secretary, Treasury, about cash limits for 1979-80.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that it was essentialto maintain the credibility of the cash limits system as an importantpart of the Government&apos;s overall economic strategy.    The measureshe proposed were therefore tough but realistic.    The cash limits setby the previous Government had allowed for price increases, on thegoods and services purchased by Government, of approximately8-1 per cent: the outturn was likely to prove higher than this, but heproposed that Departments should absorb the additional cost withoutany increase in cash limits.    The cash limits for pay items,however, had allowed only for approximately 5 per cent increasesduring the year, and this was now quite unrealistic.    He therefore6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALproposed to adapt cash limits to accommodate the likely outturn,abated by an amount, between 3 and 5 per cent, which was thesubject of a separate paper from the Lord President of the Council(C(79) 7).    The combined effect of there two measures would be anotional saving of about  1, 000 million, which would impose aconsiderable discipline upon Departmental spending.In discussion, it was suggested that while Ministers would doeverything they could to live within the limits suggested by theChief Secretary, Treasury, there were a number of particularproblem areas.    The previous Government had set cash figuresfor the defence budget which under-provided for the programmes towhich they related.    An extra  100 million would be needed toremedy this.    But the defence budget had been given speciallygenerous treatment to accommodate the cost of the increase inarmed forces pay to which the Government was committed. Inreturn, as many economies as possible should be found. Therewas a good deal of waste within the defence budget, particularly inthe procurement area.    Sir Derek Rayner had already beenappointed to advise the Government on waste and the Ministry ofDefence would be one of his target areas.    However the savingsavailable in the first year might not be sufficient to offset theadditional costs of meeting existing commitments.    Ministers mighthave to consider the case for special treatment, but this should takethe form of an increase in the allocation for the defence budget, andnot of exemption from the discipline of cash limits.In further discussion, it was pointed out that the reductions proposedfor the National Health Service would imply a cut in volume terms of1 per cent, compared with cash increases of 13 or 14 per cent. Whilethis was acceptable to the Ministers concerned, this reduction wouldbe contrasted with the promises made by the Government when inopposition.    It was also suggested that the treatment of researchcouncils needed further consideration: it might be better to treatthem in the same way as universities, rather than as fringe bodies.It was also argued that big price increases for the nationalisedindustries would be needed in order to maintain existing cash limits.Proposals for price increases in gas, electricity and coal werealready under consideration.    The problem in the coal industry wasparticularly acute, because it was clear that, without furthermeasures, it would exceed its present cash limits by at least 250 million in the current year.    The right course might be toseek very large price increases immediately, and attribute this tothe inefficiency of the industry.    But the previous Government&apos;spolicy of refusing permission for pit closures, and encouragingextra coal burn in power stations to save oil, had also contributedto the problem.    Early Ministerial discussion of the problems ofthe coal industry was necessary.7CONFIDENTIAL25
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the need to maintain the integrity of the cashlimits system.    No increases in cash limits would be made in orderto accommodate increases in the prices of goods and servicespurchased by Government.    If additional resources were needed forthe defence or for the law and order programmes, each should beseparately considered by the appropriate committees as increasesin the public expenditure allocation for the year, and not asexceptions to the cash limits policy.    Cash limits on the RateSupport Grant for 1979-80 should be adjusted in the light of discussionof the previous item and of the decisions the Cabinet would take laterin the meeting on teachers&apos; pay.    Cash limits for universities andthe National Health Service should be dealt with on the basis decidedby the previous Government.    The cash limits for fringe bodiesshould follow the treatment to be agreed under the next item of theagenda for the Civil Service.    The Ministers concerned should tellthe nationalised industries that they were expected to observe thepublished cash limits on external financing requirements, and shouldmake the necessary adjustments to their prices as well as otheroffsetting action.    The Secretary of State for Energy shouldcirculate an early paper to the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy about the particular problem of the coal industry.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister andinvited the Ministers concerned to proceedaccordingly.6. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.8CONFIDENTIAL
WAYWARDPAYCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (C(79) 6) setting out a number of proposals aimedat creating a climate for responsible collective bargaining.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment raised a number of important issues about paymatters and the Government&apos;s approach to them.   It was desirable,however, that before considering these they should also have beforethem a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as theMinister with the central responsibilities in these matters.    In view ofthis and the other items on the agenda which it was essential to discussthat morning, discussion on the Secretary of State for Employment&apos;smemorandum should be deferred for later consideration in theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy.The Cabinet -Took note.NDINGEMISSIONPAY4PARABILITY8. The Cabinet considered a joint memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment (C(79) 3)about the work of the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Governmentneeded quickly to determine their attitude towards the StandingCommission on Pay Comparability both as regards its continuedexistence and the work with which it was charged by the previousAdministration.    There seemed little choice but to accept the existenceof the Commission for the purpose of dealing with those cases which hadalready been referred to it.    But he recommended that the Governmentshould reserve judgment on the long-term future of the Commissionuntil they could review the results of its immediate work.    They shouldallow the Commission to complete this work on the basis of the terms ofreference established for the individual cases.    The Government shouldsubmit as soon as possible general evidence to the Commission on theway they thought it should conduct its work.   A draft for this purpose,prepared by officials, was annexed to his note.    He would wish to see itstrengthened in some respects and would be glad to receive commentsfrom colleagues.    He recommended that the evidence should bepublished at the same time as it went to the Commission.    He invitedthe Cabinet also to agree that two outstanding cases - local authoritycraftsmen and British Waterways Board (BWB-) staff - where terms ofreference had already been agreed between the parties should bereferred to the Commission, without prejudice to the Governments viewon its longer-term role.    He invited Cabinet also to consider whetherthe existing membership of the Commission should be strengthened.CONFIDENTIALlv (s
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the Standing Commission on Pay Comparabilityshould be allowed to complete the work with which it had already beencharged on the basis agreed by the previous Administration.    They alsoagreed that the two groups for whom references had already been agreedbetween the parties - local authority craftsmen and BWB staff - could goahead, subject only to the reservation that the Secretary of State for theEnvironment should clear the respective terms of reference with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Secretary of State for Employmentbefore referring them to the Commission.    The Cabinet had noted thatthe BWB was, in some respects, a trading organisation.    The StandingCommission was not intended to deal with pay in trading organisationsand reference in this case was not to be regarded as a precedent on whichother trading organisations could base claims for similar treatment.The Cabinet had allowed this reference simply because of the stagereached in negotiation.    They agreed that whilst the membership of theCommission was not entirely satisfactory it would be undesirable to addnew members at this stage as to do so could be seen as implyingGovernment support for an ongoing role for the Commission.    On thisquestion the Cabinet wished to reserve their judgment until the resultsof the immediate work before the Commission was completed - at whichstage it would be possible again to consider the question of additionalmembership.    The Cabinet agreed that it was desirable to submit assoon as possible the Governments general evidence to the Commission.They would wish to see the draft annexed to C(79) 3 strengthened in somerespects, for example in the passages dealing with manning andproductivity.    Colleagues should submit comments to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer by Monday 21 May.    The Chancellor of the Exchequershould then circulate a revised version for clearance in correspondencebefore submission to the Commission and publication.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science (C(79) 8) about the handling of negotiations onteachers&apos; pay.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that,at the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on14 May, it had been agreed that reference of teachers&apos; pay to theStanding Commission on Pay Comparability was a preferable alternativeto arbitration, provided the terms of reference could be strengthened on10CONFIDENTIAL28
CONFIDENTIALlines agreed in discussion.    He had been asked to sound out the leadersof the Management and Teachers&apos; Panels of the Burnham Committee onthe acceptability of these changes and the prospects of getting agreementto a reference to the Commission.    The outcome and prospects weredescribed in his memorandum C(79) 8.    The Management Panel werecontent with the amendments proposed to the terms of reference and stillagreed that a reference to the Commission would be the best outcome.The leader of the Teachers&apos; Panel had emphasised the difficulty he sawin persuading his Panel to take the same view but had not ruled out thepossibility.    He recommended accordingly that reference to theCommission should remain the Governments objective and that theirspokesman on Burnham should put the revised terms of reference to theChairman of the Burnham Committee in the negotiations on the followingday.    His memorandum recommended in paragraph 3 a minor technicalamendment which needed to be made to the terms of reference to avoidunnecessary complications.    The teachers were bound to regard theamendments to the terms of reference agreed earlier as a loss to themwhich should be compensated by some further concessions elsewhere inthe Management Panel&apos;s offer.    His paper set out in paragraph 4 theminimum elements which in his judgment a revised offer would need tocontain if there was to be any prospect of the teachers agreeing to acomparability study.    The increase on rates to 9. 3 per cent overall wasonly a minor concession which would enable desirable structural changesto be achieved; the payment on account was no more than had beenoffered to other public service groups and should in any case involve nonet cost because of the &quot;claw-back&quot; condition.    The improvementproposed on the staging still left the teachers with less attractivearrangements than other public sector groups had already achieved.The proposal to give an undertaking of Rate Support Grant (RSG) forexpenditure arising in 1979-80 from the settlement was the key pointwithout which the Management Panel, in his view, would feel unable tomove.    The Cabinet&apos;s decision earlier in the meeting on cash limits andpublic expenditure (C(79) 5 and 4) had been that the Government shouldtreat all local authority settlements alike for the purposes of RSG butshould seek to make economies to offset the cost to central Governmentof higher settlements through an appropriate reduction in the size of theIncrease Order to be fixed later that year.    In the light of that decisionhe sought authority to tell the Management Panel that they could have anassurance of RSG support for the improved offer.    It was necessary alsoto consider the alternative of arbitration should it prove impossible toreach agreement on a reference to the Commission.    The local authorityleaders were strongly of the view that they needed to make a substantiveresponse to the full claim from the teachers before the matter could bereferred to arbitration in order to have a credible posture at arbitration.Such a response would most probably have to include 9. 3 per cent from1 April 1979 and payment on account, coupled with staging on the samelines as he had proposed in relation to a comparability study. Therewas also general agreement within the Management Panel that a totaloffer over all stages might have to add up to about 25 per cent though11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALviews varied on the size of the first payment from 1 April 1979. Hesought the advice of colleagues on the level of offer which theGovernment spokesman might be authorised to allow in order to enablethe Management Panel to make a substantive response to the teachers&apos;claims.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Chairman ofthe Management Panel in Scotland considered the revised terms ofreference were acceptable and there was a fair prospect of gettingagreement to a reference to the Standing Commission if an offer of9. 3 per cent plus a payment on account could be made. TheManagement Panel in Scotland seemed to attach less importance toguarantees on RSG.In discussion there was general agreement that a reference to theStanding Commission was preferable to arbitration provided the teachersaccepted the revised terms of reference, as further amended in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science. Adecisive factor favouring a reference to the Commission was that thiswas the only way of securing that teachers&apos; conditions of service wereproperly taken into account in settling remuneration.    Because of thisand other special circumstances of the teachers1 case a reference tothe Commission should not be regarded as a precedent for other groups.It was agreed that, in order to secure a reference to the Commission,some improvement in the Management Panel&apos;s offer could be accepted.These could include bringing the 9 per cent increase on rates up to9. 3 per cent overall;   some payment on account, on the strict under-standing that it wouH be clawed back regardless of whether the StandingCommission recommended any further increase;  and improved stagingto January 1980 and January 1981;  or if necessary, advancing thelatter stage to September 1980.    But an improved offer on this basisshould only be agreed on a &quot;without prejudice&quot; basis so that it could bewithdrawn if a reference to the Commission were not made.    It wasnoted that, in the event of the Commission undertaking a comparabilitystudy, its recommendations would, by law, have to be considered by theBurnham Committee as they had to make the final settlement. Thisopened up the possibility that the Commission^ recommendations mightsimply be used as a basis for further negotiations.    It was argued that,to avoid this, both parties should undertake in advance to accept therecommendations of the Commission so that subsequent negotiations inBurnham would be simply a formality.    On the other hand it was arguedthat the parties might be unwilling to make this commitment and that itwas perhaps unnecessary for the Government to press the point now.The Government had a veto in Burnham negotiations over the quantumof any offer and they would be able to exercise it should the teachersseek to exploit the Standing Commission findings in this way.12CONFIDENTIAL30
CONFIDENTIALIn further discussion it was argued that, in the event of a reference tothe Commission not being agreed, it should not be necessary for theManagement Panel to increase their offer of 9 per cent before theChairman of Burnham could decide that negotiations had broken downand that he should refer the matter to arbitration.    It would be quitewrong to agree to a Management Panel offer which might add up in totalto a figure as high as 25 per cent as this could fatally prejudice theManagement Panel&apos;s case at arbitration.    It was also argued that, if noagreement could be reached on a reference to the Commission, theGovernment should be willing to see some improvement in theManagement Panel&apos;s present offer in a final bid to get a negotiatedsettlement.    But such an offer should not involve any staging and shouldbe limited to a maximum of 12 per cent payable from 1 April 1979. Anysuch offer should be on a without prejudice basis and withdrawn if anegotiated settlement was not achieved.In discussion on RSG it wajs strongly argued that the Government couldnot give the Management Panel an assurance on the line recommended bythe Secretary of State for Education and Science.    The teachers&apos; claimhad massive financial implications costing, if met in full, over 900 million.    The Government could not meet their normal 61 per centshare of a teachers&apos; settlement on anything approaching that scale. TheCabinet had decided in their earlier discussion on public expenditure andcash limits that there would have to be a substantial offset in the size ofthe Increase Order later this year for local government expendituregenerally.    The size of this offset would have to take appropriateaccount of the cost of the settlement reached for teachers. The 300 million offset agreed in their earlier discussion related to localauthority settlements already reached and a further reduction would benecessary to take account of the teachers&apos; settlement.    It would bedisingenuous and misleading, given the Government&apos;s intention to securesubstantial economies in the Increase Order, to lead the ManagementPanel to think that they would get full RSG cover for the teachers&apos;settlement.    Nevertheless it would be important in explaining theGovernment&apos;s position to the Management Panel to avoid the impressionthat the teachers were being singled out or that the Government wishedin any way to interfere with the freedom of local authorities to decidewhere economies should be made, either within the education servicesor elsewhere.    The local authorities should understand that the offsetto be made from the total extra support through the Increase Orderrepresented the carrying through in local government of theGovernments stated intentions of making substantial economies in publicexpenditure generally.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the preferable course was for teachers1 pay to bereferred to the Standing Commission, provided that this was on the basisof the revised terms of reference proposed by the Secretary of State for13CONFIDENTIAL31
CONFIDENTIALEducation and Science.    A reference was justified as the only way ofsecuring that teachers&apos; conditions of service were taken into account insettling their remuneration.    It was accordingly not a precedent onwhich other groups should be able to justify claims to go to theCommission.    In order to improve the prospects of getting agreementto refer teachers to the Commission, the Cabinet were willing to seeimprovements made in the Management Panel&apos;s offer.    These couldcover structural changes which would bring the increase on pay ratesup to 9. 3 per cent; a payment on account for those earning up to  5, 000a year on the basis that, whatever the outcome of the comparability study,the full amount paid on account would be clawed back;  and with thebalance, if any, of the settlement paid either in January 1980 andJanuary 1981 or, if necessary, in January and September 1980 .    But theGovernment spokesman on the Management Panel should make it clearthat these improvements were to be offered on a &quot;without prejudice&quot;basis and should be withdrawn if agreement on a reference to theCommission could not be reached.    In that event the Cabinet acceptedthat, on balance, it would be acceptable, in order to try to reach anegotiated settlement, for the Government spokesman to agree to theManagement Panel increasing their offer from 9 per cent up to a ceilingof 12 per cent, again clearly on a &quot;without prejudice&quot; basis so that theoffer was not left on the table if negotiations were to break down andthe teachers&apos; claim went to arbitration.    The Cabinet were agreed thatthere could be no question of giving the Management Panel anunconditional assurance that the cost of the teachers&apos; settlement in1979-80 would be fully reflected in the RSG Increase Order later thatyear;  and it should be made clear to the Panel that the Governmentwould take the same position if agreement was not reached on a com-parability study and the claim went to arbitration;  Cabinet had alreadydecided on the earlier items on cash limits (C(79) 5) and publicexpenditure (C(79) 4) that the approach on RSG for 1979-80 in respect oflocal authority pay settlements should be that the cash limit for theIncrease Order later this year should be some  300 million less than ifthe cost of pay settlements had been taken fully into account. Thisoffset was to cover settlements already made.    A further offset wouldbe needed following the teachers&apos; settlement;  the amount could not bedetermined at this stage, but depending on the level of the settlement,it might have to be substantial.    It would be for individual localauthorities to decide where economies should be made within theirservices as a whole.    The Governments broad approach on RSG and paysettlements should be made known to the local authorities before theBurnham Committee meeting on the following day.    The Secretary ofState for Education and Science should agree a form of words for thatpurpose with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaries ofState for the Environment and for Scotland, taking account of theCabinefs conclusions.    Finally Cabinet agreed, on balance, that itshould not be a condition for the referral of the teachers&apos; case to the14CONFIDENTIAL32
CONFIDENTIALStanding Commission that both parties would have to agree in advance toaccept the findings of the Commission.    This decision took account ofthe technical rights of the Burnham Committee.    If in the event theteachers tried to negotiate higher levels of pay in Burnham than theCommission recommended the Government should use their veto on thequantum of the settlement to prevent this happening.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office17 May 197915CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 17 May 1979 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (C(79) 7) about the adjustment of cash limits for 1979-80 to takeaccount of recent Civil Service pay settlements.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Government&apos;spolicy was to seek significant reductions in Civil Service manpower.The immediate issue was how far to go in the current financial year asa contribution to the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Budget. Large-scale redundancies or premature retirement would be self-defeating inthis context, because they would cost more in the first year than theywould save on the current wage bill.    A short-term ban on recruitmentwas the only way of making immediate economies.    For the year as awhole the practical range of choice lay between reductions of 3 and 5 percent in the wage bill.    This should be seen against the strategic back-ground of a search for much bigger economies.    He intended tocirculate, by early June, a paper suggesting how cuts of 10, 15 or 20 percent might be found in the Civil Service as a whole.    Although some ofthis reduction would flow from the elimination of waste, such large cutswould also require the abolition of particular functions.    Meanwhile, theban on recruitment was a blunt instrument, and it would be necessary toallow for some minor exceptions to secure the continued recruitment ofpeople with scarce skills or in areas of acute staff shortage.    It was alsonecessary to bear in mind the reactions of the unions and to proceedwhere possible by agreement.In discussion it was argued that it was essential to make an early starton the search for long-term economies in Civil Service manpower. Theban on recruitment approved at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 10 May was thebest short-term measure available.    It was unfortunate that, despitethe Cabinet decision, advertisements for staff continued to appear inthe Press, and eteps should be taken to end this immediately.    The banshould continue until it was clear what other measures would be neededto secure a reduction in staff costs of at least 3 per cent.    Some offset1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwas necessary, to cover the cost of pay increases ranging up to 25 percent, and averaging about 16 per cent in the current year.    This was thebest possible climate in which to seek immediate reductions.Against this, it was argued that the Government should proceed verycarefully in the search for necessary economies.    The industrialrelations climate was very different from that of the early 1970s. TheCivil Service unions were now much stronger.    The moderates hadsucceeded In regaining control of some of the unions, and it would beimportant to avoid a return to militancy.    Premature action in the firstyear would forfeit the co-operation of the unions in the much biggerchanges which the Government intended.    Ministers should thereforeallow time for the fullest possible consultation consistent with theachievement of their objectives.    Until incoming Ministers had time toexamine the policies of their Departments, and consider their authorisedestablishments against this background, it would be premature to becomecommitted to a precise target for manpower reductions in the short term.There were some areas, particularly in the Ministry of Defence, wherelarge reductions had already been made, and in the prison service,where smaller reductions might be justified.    The overall objective wasto reduce the cost of bureaucracy.    But over-rigid manpower targetswere sometimes self-defeating.    Economies in some areas, forexample in the administration of social security benefits, might actuallyprevent the realisation of much bigger savings eg through the preventionof fraud.    Departmental Ministers needed a measure of discretion inoperating the agreed temporary ban on recruitment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had decided that the ban on Civil Service recruitment agreed attheir meeting on 10 May should be maintained for at least three monthsfrom now and should be reviewed at the end of that period.    It would beopen to Departmental Ministers to make exceptions to this ban on acase-by-case basis, on their own personal authority, where this wasessential in the interests of efficiency.    The Lord President of theCouncil should report progress on the implementation of the ban duringits currency.    The temporary ban on recruitment would be the firststep towards securing economies of at least 3 per cent in Governmentexpenditure on wage-related items.    If any Minister found itimpossible to achieve this it was open to him to suggest to the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, alternative ways of securing equivalent savings,but these would have to be in addition to any savings he was required tomake as part of the general review of public expenditure discussedunder Item 4.    The Lord President of the Council should inform theCivil Service unions of the Governments decision in general terms.He could tell them that the Government would be seeking similareconomies in the local authorities and from the administrative tail ofthe National Health Service.    While he could report back their reaction,there was no question of the Cabinet reopening the decision it had just2CONFIDENTIAL3 5
CONFIDENTIALtaken in the light of these consultations.    The Secretary of State for theEnvironment, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland,should make it clear to the local authority associations that they wouldbe expected to follow similar policies and that their performance wouldbe taken into account in the next Rate Support Grant negotiations.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office17 May 19793CONFIDENTIAL
