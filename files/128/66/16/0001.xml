CONFIDENTIAL1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthe Rhodesia Conference was now considering our full constitutionalproposals.    He had asked for a response by 8 October but it waspossible that Bishop Muzorewa would seek to obtain a politicaladvantage by announcing his acceptance earlier than this.Mr Ian Smith was returning to Salisbury this week where he mightcreate some difficulties.    The Patriotic Front leaders wouldprobably try to avoid reaching a decision on the constitutionalarrangements by raising the problem of transitional arrangements:this would be resisted.    It seemed likely that internationally ourconstitutional proposals would be generally regarded as reasonableeven by the Presidents of the Front Line States.    The problem oftransitional arrangements was much more difficult.    Mr Nkomoappeared to want to reach a settlement but Mr Mugabe1 s positionwas more doubtful.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad paid a useful visit to th^ United Nations General Assembly inNew York in the previous week.    He had had a difficult discussionwith the Soviet Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Gromyko, who hadnot been well briefed and had attacked the United Kingdom&apos;s proposedconstitutional proposals for Rhodesia apparently under the impressioithat the Rhodesia Conference had broken down.    He had also reactedstrongly to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s own speechabout the growth in Soviet military capability.    In New York he hadalso had discussions with the Spanish Foreign Minister,Senor Oreja Aguirre, on the future of Gibraltar and with theArgentine Foreign Minister, Brigadier Pastor, on the FalklandIslands.    In both cases he had emphasised our wish to make progresiprovided the wishes of the local inhabitants were respected. Someuseful progress had been made.Aid THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onboth political and humanitarian grounds there were strong reasonsfor us to make some contribution to the relief of the appalling faminewhich was developing in Cambodia.    Vietnam insisted on recognitionof their puppet regime in Cambodia before allowing relief agenciesto bring aid into the country but the Red Cross and United Nationsrelief agencies had found a way of meeting this requirement andpreventing the aid getting into the hands of Vietnamese and Cambodiantroops.    There was no money left in this year&apos;s aid programme buthe was proposing, in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to make  2. 5 million available for relief from the ContingencyReserve for next year&apos;s aid programme.    There was also a strongcase for making some aid available to Dominica.1CONFIDENTIAL196
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion it was suggested that we should gain credit ifwe put forward a proposal to our European Community partners tomake some aid available.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thetour in this country by the South African rugby team had got off to aquiet start in Exeter.    The next match at Camborne also seemedlikely not to give rise to trouble but difficulties might arise laterin the tour.ice:15thionsThe CabinetTook note.JNITYisice:15thaons2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat so far the timetable laid down by the Strasbourg EuropeanCouncil for consideration of our budgetary problem was beingmaintained.    The Council of Ministers (Finance) had met on17 September and would be considering the matter again on15 October.    It would also be the principal topic for the PrimeMinisters visit later that day to Rome for talks with the ItalianPrime Minister.    The recent realignment of currencies within theEuropean Monetary System had been achieved without too greatdifficulty.    We had not been invited to the discussions about thelatter but this was now recognised to have been a mistake and wasunlikely to happen again.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the Councilof Ministers (Energy) had been able to agree upon national oilimport targets for 1985 within the previously agreed global figurefor the Community.    This had been welcomed by the Americansat the subsequent meeting of Tokyo Summit Energy Ministers butthey were now becoming increasingly concerned about securingCongressional agreement to import quotas for the USA and wouldbe pressing Community countries, especially the Germans and theItalians, to restrict oil imports in the intervening years up to 1985.It was pointed out that the Italians had made their position clear tothe Americans at the Tokyo Summit.    We should not ourselvesintervene on behalf of the Americans.1CONFIDENTIAL1971
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthe European Court had recently condemned the national measurestaken by France to restrict imports of sheepmeat.    However evenbefore the judgment French Ministers had virtually said that theywould not comply and attempts by British exporters to send lamb toFrance had been frustrated because French importers had beenwarned by the French Government not to ask for import licences.We had respected the findings of the Court on our regime forimporting potatoes and in other cases: it would be unprecedentedfor a member State to persist in defying the European Court. Wewere also in dispute with the French over fishing off the south-westcoast.    The French Government were encouraging French boats tofish illegally in our waters and were apparently prepared to payany fines.    Two trawlers had already been arrested and there wouldprobably be more now that the French fishermen&apos;s co-operative hadagreed to pay compensation for loss of earnings to arrested boats.Although the French Government undoubtedly had internal politicaldifficulties it looked as though they were building up a case againstus on both sheepmeat and fisheries with a view to raising theseissues at the forthcoming European Council in Dublin.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered z memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food on liquid milk prices (C(79) 41).THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat there were long-standing pricing arrangements for liquidmilk which involved setting maximum wholesale and retail pricesin April and October each year for succeeding six-monthly periods.The proposed l^p increase in the maximum retail price would allowthe maximum wholesale price to be increased to maintain the realvalue of last year&apos;s producers net margin.    The present targetrate of profit for distributors would remain unchanged while theformula used to calculate distributors margins was being examinedby a firm of accountants.    If there was no increase in the retailprice at this time dairy farmers&apos; margins would be only  81 percow, substantially less than last year and the lowest for five years.The National Farmers&apos; Union, the Milk Marketing Board (MMB) andthe Dairy Federation knew the basis of the figures and would seethe reduction in their margins as a fundamental change in policy.This would have severe repercussion3.    The Manifesto hadcriticised the previous Government for seriously undermining theprofitability of agriculture.In discussion it was noted that in Scotland delay in previous retailprice increases meant distributors&apos; costs had not been made goodand in consequence the proposed increase in the retail price neededto be made earlier, with the possibility of a further temporaryincrease in February or March.    In Wales there was less room forswitching to other forms of agricultural output if dairy farmingbecame less profitable.    la Northern Ireland other forms of aidshould be considered as farmers benefit only slightly from anincrease in retail prices because little of their milk is sold inliquid form.1*. further discussion it was questioned whether the interests of themilk producers and the dairy   industry should override other policyconsiderations such as consumer interests.    Milk prices haddoubled in 4 years and the l^p increase now proposed, despiteassurances to the contrary in May, would represent a 22 per centincrease in the retail price in less than 6 months.    This would addto inflation and have serious repercussions on the wage roundbesides opening the Government to political attack.    Against thisit was argued that there would be substantial pressure from farminginterests for a price increase.    Profits from the various sectorsof agriculture varied considerably  but many farmers weredependent on their receipts from milk sales, especially in the moreremote areas, and they would regard a failure to increase the priceas contrary to the Governments policy for agriculture. Theirprotest would be strengthened because they were well aware of thecalculations on which the proposed price increase was based.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALA departure from the traditional methods of calculation would beseen by them as a deliberate reversal of policy.In continuing discussion it was suggested that a,further increase in theretail pride of milk would  educe sales and increase the quantity ofmilk going to manufacture.    There was of course already asubstantial butter surplus in the Community and the United Kingdomwould be adding to it.    This would not fit well with the attitude wewere adopting to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).Moreover higher milk prices in the United Kingdom would beattractive to foreign milk producers and would increase pressure onus to relax restrictions and allow imports of liquid milk to thefurther detriment of our dairy industry.    At the same time it wasnoted that other member countries of the European EconomicCommunity (EEC) were substantially increasing their subsidiesto agriculture.    If we cut back on our support we would worsenour relative position and the burden of the CAP.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, by a substantial majority, agreed that there should be noincrease in the retail pri^e of milk at present.    The question ofmilk prices needed to be looked at in the broader context of supportfor agriculture generally and against the background of the CAP andthe subsidies which other members of the EEC gave to theiragricultural industries.    It would also be necessary to considerfurther the question of distributors&apos; margins in the light of thereport on these being prepared for the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food.    The necessary review should involve allof the main economic Departments and the Secretary of theCabinet should arrange for it to be carried out.    The Cabinet notedthat the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had it in mindto bring a general paper on agricultural  policy to an early meetingof the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.5CONFIDENTIAL200
CONFIDENTIALVICE 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the\t to Lord President of the Council (C(79) 40) setting out two possibleg ways of implementing the Cabinets earlier decision to dispersea substantial number of Civil Service posts to Bootle.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there hadbeen no volunteers among Government Departments to go toBootle.    There were only two real options available. Thefirst would be to move 1,200 staff of the Health and SafetyExecutive (HSE) from London to Bootle, leaving less than 300staff in London.    To these could be added a further 100 stafffrom the Property Services Agency (PSA) and 300 from theHome Office Computer Staff.    This would provide some 1, 600jobs for Bootle, which could be regarded as discharging theGovernments commitments to move staff there.    The alternativewould be to build up to approximately the same total from smallnumbers drawn from several different Departments, including theMinistry of Agriculture and the Foreign and CommonwealthOffice.THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT(Lord Gowrie) said that his Secretary of State had gravereservations about the proposal to move so large a number ofHSE staff to Bootle.    The HSE was a policy-making Departmentwhich needed to have extensive contacts both in London and withBrussels.    It was responsible to an independent Commission,drawn from the Trade Union Congress and the Confederation ofBritish Industries, both of whom would see objection to the move.There was already a suspicion that the Executive had too muchautonomy, and this tendency would be increased if it were movedaway from London.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the difficulties which the Minister of Statehad outlined.    Nevertheless they were strongly of the view thatthe first of the two options described by the Lord President ofthe Council was to be preferred.    Accordingly, some 1,200 staffof the HSE should be moved to Bootle, together with 100 stafffrom the PSA and 300 from the Home Office.    The HSELaboratory should stay in London as previously planned, togetherwith a small number of Headquarters staff.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.6CONFIDENTIAL201
CONFIDENTIALcy AND 5* The Cabinet considered a minute from Sir Derek RaynerCENTRAL      to the Prime Minister, circulated under cover of a note by the nt Secretary of the Cabinet (C(7 9) 39).   This minute suggested waysin which Ministers might strengthen their control over themanagement of their Departments, in the search for greaterefficiency and the elimination of waste.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as she had told the CabinetearHer in the year, Sir Derek Rayner had been asked to under-take a number of studies in Departments of ways in which wastecould be eliminated.    He had reported to her on these studies,and made various recommendations for a more permanent systemof scrutinies.    She had been Tery impressed with the initialresults of some of the studies already carried out, and hadthought the Cabinet would be interested to hear at first handfrom those who had undertaken them.SIR DEREK RAYNER said that the administration of CentralGovernment cost about  6 billion a year, or more than thetotal yield of value added tax.    Large savings in theseadministrative costs could only be secured by good management.In his view it was the responsibility of every Minister toscrutinise the cost of his Department regularly. SeniorMinisters could not abdicate their personal responsibility forsuch costs.    They needed to reassure themselves regularlythat all the activities undertaken in their name were justifiedand were being carried out effectively.    This had to be donewithin the Department.    Outside critics did not know the rightquestions to ask and might meet resistance.    The work neededthe full support of Ministers, and this had been freely given inthe initial work which he had carried out.MR C S PONTING, Ministry of Defence, and Mr. N R WARNER,Department of Health and Social Security, then gave briefaccounts of the preliminary results of their studies, of methodsof food procurement for the armed services and of means ofpaying social security benefits.In discussion, considerable enthusiasm was expressed for theseinitial findings.    There was general agreement that similarstudies should be continued on a regular basis within eachDepartment, and that the Minister concerned should takepersonal responsibility for the work and for the subsequentimplementation of recommendations.    It was argued that theearlier Programme Analysis and Review system, intrcduced bythe previous Conservative Government in 1970, had lent itselfto over-bureaucratisation.    By contrast, the new system ofDepartmental &quot;scrutinies1 proposed by Sir Derek Rayner mademinimum demands on staff time.    It was however-essentialthat those carrying out the studies should have the full7CONFIDENTIAL202
CONFIDENTIALco-operation, not only of top management in the Department,but of the staff concerned with the functions under examination.Experience had already shown that staff at the 1 sharp end1 ofthe execution of policy were willing and able to help and thatmany fruitful ideas came from this source.   The attitude ofsome Staff Sides on the other hand had been unhelpful, and waysshould be sought of seeking their co-operation.    For thispurpose, the &quot;scrutiny1 operation should be distinguished asclearly as possible from any major manpower cuts which theCabinet might subsequently decide.    The emphasis should be onthe cost-effectiveness of continued operations.    The CentralDepartments (Treasury, Civil Service Department and CentralPolicy Review Staff) had some role to play, in co-ordinatingthe programme of scrutinies, in suggesting additional topicsfor study, and in seeing that lessons learnt in one Departmentwere made more generally available.    But the real work mustbe done within Departments by management working throughdepartmental officials specially selected for the purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet congratulated Sir Derek Rayner and his team on theresults obtained so far.    They agreed that the system of1 scrutinies&apos; proposed in his minute to her, circulated asC(79) 39, should continue.    Thsy invited all Ministers in chargeof Departments to send her, by 23 November, details of thestudies which they proposed to undertake in the next year.She would arrange for the complete programme of studies to becollated and to be circulated to Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and agreed toproceed accordingly.Cabinet Office4 October 19798CONFIDENTIAL20
