CONFIDENTIALvjTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week. It was noted that, if anagreement was reached by which proceedings on the Southern Rhodesiathe        Bill were taken in place of the Private Members1 Business scheduledfor Friday 9 November, that business would need to be reinstated nextweek; there would be some advantage if it could be reinstated onThursday 15 November.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he was concernedabout a suggestion that proceedings in the House of Commons on theSouthern Rhodesia Bill might extend until Monday 12 November, withche result that the Bill would not reach the House of Lords until late onthat day.    The House of Lords did not have the means of controlling thelength of a deb?.te which were available in the House of Commons, andit was important that proceedings in that House should start at thes, normal time or. Monday 12 November if Royal Assent by 14 Novemberwere to be assured.In discussion there was general agreement that proceedings in theHouse of Commons should be completed as soon as possible, both toensure the passage of the Bill by 14 November and to avoid uncertaintyover the weekend.    On the other hand a large namber of amendmentshad already been tabled and others were expected.    The Opposition hadsuggested that it might be preferable for Third Reading to be postponeduntil Monday 12 November on the understanding that the Bill wouldreceive a Third Reading by 7. 00 pm on that day.    Although theOpposition leaders could not guarantee the co-operation of their back-benchers, it would help to preserve goodwill if the Governmentsposition could be kept sufficiently flexible for such an arrangement to beconsidered if progress were unduly delayed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the aimshould be to take the Southern Rhodesia Bill through all its stages inthe House of Commons in a single sitting starting on Thursday8 November and continuing through Friday 9 November and thereafterfor as long as necessary, so that the debate in the House of Lordscould start no later than 2,30 pm on Monday 12 November. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, in consultation with the LordPresident of the Council, the Lord Privy Seal, the Chief Whip andherself, would review the position if untoward events made it necessaryto do so.CONFIDENTIAL1
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister1 s summing up of their discussion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that hisstatement in the House of Commons on 25 October had foreshadowed thepresentation to Parliament of a consultative document which would forma basis for discussion at a conference with Northern Ireland politicalleaders.    A draft had been prepared by a Ministerial Group chaired bythe Home Secretary (MISC 24) and it had subsequently been approved bythe Defenca and Oversea Policy Committee on Monday 5 November.The document was now being printed and would be circulated toMinisters for information during the following week;  it would bepublished early in the week beginning Monday 19 November, and a debatein the House of Commons would no doubt follow.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL257
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat it was still unclear whether the Patriotic Front would agree tothe transitional arrangements he had proposed.    The timing wasdelicate.    A break with the Front would be undesirable during theEnabling Bill&apos;s passage through the House of Commons ButBishop Muzorewa&apos;s delegation was becoming impatient.    If strongpressure were put on the Front by President Kaunda of Zambia, whohad just arrived on a self-imposed visit to London, it was possiblethat they might agree.    Mr Nkomo would probably like to do so, butMr Mugabe would probably be reluctant.    If arrangements had to goahead without the Front, a Governor would need to go to Rhodesiaearlier than otherwise, and elections would take place by about19 December.    In that situation there were reasonable prospectsthat friendly Governments would support us, but we were likely tohave to veto a hostile resolution in the United Nations SecurityCouncil.    There would be risks involved for British interests; butthe dangers of any other policy would be greater.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theoutlook in Iran was disturbing.    Although the occupation of theBritish Embassy had now ended, that of the United States Embassycontinued;  and following the fall of the Bazargan Government therewere fears not only for the hostages in the United States Embassybut also for the safety of the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires, whowas refusing to leave the Foreign Ministry.    If the Iranians nowapplied oil sanctions against the United States, or against the Westgenerally, a new oil crisis might develop.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, if UnitedStates vessels were not allowed to load Iranian oil, which shouldbecome clear within hours, the immediate effects on world suppliesand prices would be limited since only a small proportion of totalUnited States oil supplies were involved and stocks were high.But the position would deteriorate if the oil thus withheld were notmade available to others.    If British ships were not allowed to load,there would be a shortfall of about 5 per cent in United Kingdomsupplies.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL;1ITYSltureIovemberasslice:)19thsions,43, THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that earlierin the day the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee, Sub-Committeeon European Questions had met under his chairmansldp to considerthe line which the Minister of Agriculture should take at theforthcoming meeting on 12-13 November of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture).    The Sub-Committee had agreed on the Minister&apos;sline for the discussion about sheepmeat and about agriculturalstructure.    They had not, however, been able to agree on whether,in view of the continuing refusal of France to allow imports ofsheepmeat from the United Kingdom, he should block agreement toproposals dealing with the wine sector.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthe Community had been discussing improvements to the Community1 swine regime for more than two years.    France and Italy would bethe principal beneficiaries.    It was common practice in theAgriculture Council for Ministers to make concessions only in returnfor securing satisfaction on issues of concern to them.    The FrenchGovernment was coming under increasing pressure from theCommission over its illegal actions on sheepmeat and ourCommunity partners would not expect us to agree to the winepackage in these circumstances.    He was confident that his Italiancolleague would fully understand and would indeed do the same if hewere in a similar situation.    He was resisting strong pressure forthe United Kingdom to take illegal action against imports fromFrance, but he would be impossible to explain domestically why wehad agreed to a settlement on wine of benefit to France while Francewas still acting illegally on sheepmeat.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the wine proposals would help toreduce the surplus of wine and thus to cut the cost of the CommonAgricultural Policy.    This was an objective which the BritishGovernment supported.    To veto the package would therefore beagainst British interests as well as those of Italy whose supportwould be needed in the forthcoming budgetary discussions at theEuropean Council.    At the moment the rest of the Community wasunanimous in condemning the French action over sheepmeat: itwould be a mistake to run the risk of turning this into a purelyAnglo-French battle, and the United Kingdom would lose a greatdeal of sympathy from her other Community partners if theMinister of Agriculture exercised a veto on the wine package.What happened in the Agriculture Council would affect the generalatmosphere within the Community at a time when major Britishinterests were at stake over the Community Budget.In a brief discussion it was suggested that the best tactics would befor us to prolong the discussion, but to avoid having to exercise aveto, so as not to alienate the goodwill of the rest of the Community.CONFIDENTIAL259
CONFIDENTIALThe Minister of Agriculture should not agree to the wine proposals,but should if necessary say that he was under instructions to referback before any decision was taken.    If the French were to giveway on sheepmeat it would be more difficult to withhold agreementon wine, but even in these circumstances it might serve as a usefulquid pro quo for some movement by the French on the CommunityBudget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that the Minister ofAgriculture should not agree to the proposals on wine at theAgriculture Council on 12-13 November.    He should make it clearthat he was under instructions to report back to his colleaguesbefore the United Kingdom could give its agreement.    In the eventof the French abandoning their illegal action on sheepmeat, shewould be willing to consider urgently with the Ministers principallyconcerned v/hat the Governments attitude towards the wine packageshould then be.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food to be guided accordingly.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefNDlTURE       Secretary, Treasury, C(79) 54, reporting the results of hisjO discussions with other Ministers on outstanding public expenditureI issues following the Cabinet1 s last discussion on this subject. Theyalso had before them a minute dated 6 November from the Chiefjg Secretary, Treasury, to the Prime Minister about expenditure onace: housing, and a letter dated 31 October from the Chief Secretary,jgth Treasury, to the Secretary of State for Education and Science about6ions expenditure on education.4THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that, as requested bythe Cabinet, he had held separate discussions with the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Educationand Science, about their spending programmes in the last three yearsof the Survey period.    As a result, he had been able to reachagreement on modified figures for their piogrammes which wereset out in his paper.    The only remaining outstanding issues werethe level of agricultural support (which Cabinet would considerearly in December on the basis of a report from an Official Group),the finances of the British Gas Corporation (which would beconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy atits next meeting the following week), and the provision to be madefor Civil Service manpower, on which the Lord President of theCouncil would be bringing further proposals to the Cabinet shortly.In discussion, the figures agreed for the Environment andEducation programmes were confirmed.    It was noted that in eachcase, the Departmental Ministers had discretion to make furtherredispositions within the totals agreed with the Chief Secretary,Treasury.    It was also pointed out that the revised totals for publicexpenditure, annexed to C(79) 54, still assumed that the UnitedKingdom contribution to the Budget of the European Communitieswould increase beyond the level implied by a 1 per cent ceiling onValue Added Tax.    It was, however, argued that this was a prudentassumption to make at this stage.    There would be time to alterthe figures in the Public Expenditure White Paper in the light ofany decisions on the Community Budget taken at the meeting of theEuropean Council in Dublin at the end of November.In further discussion, it was suggested that the way in which Cabinettook decisions on major public expenditure issues needed furtherexamination.    At present many such decisions were rightly takenbilaterally between Treasury Ministers and spending Ministers.This saved much unnecessary and prolonged discussion in Cabinet.But as a result politically sensitive matters, such as the increasein prescription charges in 1980-81, were not always consideredcollectively despite their obvious importance.    This point shouldperhaps be reconsidered before the following year&apos;s Survey.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that withthe exception of outstanding issues on agriculture, gas prices andCivil Service numbers, the Cabinet had now completed itsconsideration of public expenditure in the years to 1983-84.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the figures now agreed for all thepublic expenditure programmes, as set out in the Annexto C(79) 54.2. Noted that the outstanding issues on gas,agriculture, and on Civil Service manpower would beresolved, and decisions on the European Budget taken,within the next few weeks.3. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, toprepare a draft of a White Paper on Public Expenditurein these years, for circulation to the Cabinet inDecember, and publication in January.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJSED 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum, C(79) 56, by theEg&apos; Chief Secretary, Treasury, setting out the position reached inSNT AND   discussion with the Ministers concerned about the financialrequirements of the nationalised industries in the years 1981-82 to1983-84.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his memorandumth set out briefly the final position reached in bilateral discussionswith the Ministers concerned, and in an annex set out the agreedfigures for all the industries concerned, with the exception of gas,on which (as the Cabinet had just noted) there were some outstandingissues to be considered by the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy at their next meeting.    The figures covered the netborrowing by the nationalised industries from all sources. Theywere necessarily tentative, since they were the net result of muchlarger flows on current and capital account.    The figures for steel,shipbuilding and railways might prove to be optimistic, in view ofthe trading prospects of those industries.in discussion, it was noted that the figures for the British NationalOil Corporation and the British Gas Corporation might be affectedby movements in the world oil price.    It was also pointed out thatthe changes now agreed had the effect of increasing the net lendingto the nationalised industries in 1981-82, while postponing reductionsuntil later years.    It was also reported that the figures for theScottish Electricity Boards had not been finally agreed and mightneed later adjustment.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the position reached on thefinancing forecasts for the nationalised industriesin the years up to 1983-84.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Scotlandto discuss with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the figures for the Scottish Electricity Boards.3. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to include the agreed figures for the nationalisedindustries in the forthcoming White Paper onPublic Expenditure, 1981-82 to 1983-84.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL&quot;j^TION       6. The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to the need to try toSAND correct the tendency of newspapers and broadcasting authorities -T EVENTS   not least the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) - to fail toobserve acceptable standards of accuracy and balance in theirreporting of news and current events.    Recent examples includedthe BBC report that morning that gas prices were to be increasedby 40 per cent; television reports of protests about cuts in publicexpenditure;  and a story in The Guardian of 7 November aboutclosure plans for branch railway lines.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthere was general agreement that the right approach was not forthe Government to mount a generalised attack on standards ofaccuracy and impartiality in reporting but for Departments to dealcase by case with each specific instance of inaccurate or unbalancedreporting as quickly as possible after it occurred. Ministersshould satisfy themselves that their Departments had adequatearrangemerts for vigilant monitoring of the Press and broadcastingmedia&apos;s coverage of matters for which they were responsible, andfor ensuring that the appropriate corrective action was taken ineach case.    The cumulative effect of such action would be to applyconstant pressure upon the media to observe acceptable standardsof accuracy and balance.    This was particularly important in thecase of the broadcasting authorities, not only because of theimmediacy of the reporting but also because they were underbinding formal obligations to comply with certain requirements asto balance and impartiality.    Various methods and techniques ofcorrective action were available;  the choice would depend oncircumstances in each case.    It was also worth remembering thatthe Governments supporters in Parliament were keen to be keptfully informed on Government policies and actions and to help inpresenting them to the public.    Ministers should therefore keep intouch with the Chairmen and members of Party Committees workingin their fields, and should give whichever assistance was appropriateto the Party organisation to enable it to provide helpful and timelybriefing material to Government backbenchers.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited all Ministers in charge of Departmentsto satisfy themselves that appropriate arrangementswere made to monitor Press, radio and televisioncoverage of the affairs of their Departments, and totake immediate steps to correct any cases of inaccuracyor imbalance in reporting as they occurred, informingthe Paymaster General in each case.9CONFIDENTIAL264
CONFIDENTIAL3. Agreed upon the importance of keeping theGovernment&apos;s supporters in Parliament, andparticularly the Chairmen of Conservative PartySubject Committees, fully briefed aboutdevelopments in Government policies.ROYCE       7. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that,following discussions in a Ministerial Group under the PrimeMinisters chairmanship (MISC 22) he had informed the NationalEnterprise Board of certain changes which the Governmentproposed to make in their relations with Rolls-Royce,    As a result,and as reported in the Press that morning, the Chairman andmembers of the National Enterprise Board had threatened to resignen bloc.    Such a move could be damaging to industrial relations,both in Rolls-Royce and at British Leyland, and it would on the wholebe preferable to avoid this outcome if possible,    Ways of doing sowere under consideration.    He would continue to keep the Cabinetinformed of developments.The Cabinet -Took note.ces 8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that worldoil prices were increasing rapidly, even in advance of theforthcoming meeting of the Organisation of Petroleum ExportingCountries (OPEC) in Caracas in December.    A number of othermajor producing countries had already announced increases, andthe British National Oil Corporation (3NOC) had increased itsprices in order to maintain previous relativities, and in order toavoid making a loss cn oil which it bought under existing contracts.There was no ground for complaining of or criticising that decision,which had been taken in accordance with agreed practice; it wasunfortunate, but unavoidable, that the British Government would beblamed by other consumer countries for the actions of BNOC.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office8 November 197910CONFIDENTIAL265

Thismorning you and I and the Financial Secretary discussed thesematters and then asked our officials to work out a detailedproposal.     I am glad to say that I can now accept the proposalwhich is set out below and I understand that it will also beacceptable to you.The Treasury position is that,  while we would question some ofthe arguments in paragraph 2 of your letter, we recognise that-an operating margin of  130 million a year  (with unit costs atthe 1978-79 level) may not be adequate to cover the non-transitional costs which are likely to exist in I98I-82 to1983-8^,  when pupil and teacher numbers are falling. Thereforeit might be too difficult  to achieve  the whole of the reductionin current&apos; expenditure on schools which I proposed to Cabinet(in Annex G of C(79)^2).    At the  same time  it may be possibleto slow down the increases in expenditure on non-advancedfurther education or  (in 1983-84 only)  on higher educationwhich are shown in the run of figures in paragraph 3 a? yourletter,  that  is to  substitute  savings on those sub-programmesm place of part of the  savings on schools.
