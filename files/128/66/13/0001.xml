SECRET1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C(79) 33) on thenext steps towards a Rhodesia settlement, in the light ofdevelopments at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetingin Lusaka.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaton arrival the atmosphere in Lusaka had been unfriendly andunpromising.    But an early talk with President Nyerere ofTanzania revealed that the Front Line Presidents had agreedamong themselves to leave the initiative to us.    It emerged laterthat because of their domestic difficulties Presidents Nyerere,Machel (Mozambique) and Khama (Botswana) were all anxious tosee a settlement.    The same was probably also true ofPresident Kaunda of Zambia, whose economic problems wereeven worse;  but he was inhibited by the presence in Zambia ofpowerful Patriotic Front forces under Nkomo.    The PrimeMinister1 s speech at the opening session had been well receivedand had laid the basis for later progress.    President Nyerere,President Moi of Kenya and the Commonwealth Secretary Generalhad played helpful roles;  and over the weekend agreement on asatisfactory communique passage had been reached in a caucuscomprising President Kaunda, President Nyerere, Mr Fraser ofAustralia, Mr Manley of Jamaica, General Adefope of Nigeria,the Prime Minister, the Secretary General and himself. Despitedifficulties caused by its premature disclosure by Mr Fraser, thistext had in the end been accepted by all the Heads of Delegations.It provided, if the Cabinet now agreed, for Britain to summon aConstitutional Conference.    We would invite two delegations ofequal size;  one would be led by Bishop Muzorewa and would includeother &quot;internal&quot; representatives, while the other would representboth the Nkomo and the Mugabe wings of the Patriotic Front.With the invitations we should circulate only an outline of ourproposals for an independence constitution, which would becomparable to those granted to other territories. Emissarieswould be sent to both parties in preparation for the Conference;and Bishop Muzorewa should be told the details of the constitutionwe had in mind, which would in many respects simply incorporateexisting arrangements.    Care would be taken to reassure whiteopinion in Rhodesia.    The Bishop could be expected to attend theConference; and the Patriotic Front would probably also do so,under pressure from the Front Line Presidents.    At theConference, agreement with the Patriotic Front might well not bereached, but if so they would appear in a bad light and we couldhope to carry moderate international opinion with us over theindependence arrangements we would then reach withBishop Muzorewa.    If agreement were reached with all the parties1SECRET165
SECRETat the Conference there would be even greater difficulties to beovercome as regards the transitional arrangements, includingthe elections to which it had been necessary to agree in the Lusakadocument as the natural corollary of a new constitution;  but thesewould be under British supervision and would be a price worthpaying in order to end the war.    The date of the ConstitutionalConference might have to be 11 September, to avoid a clash withthe Non-Aligned Conference in Havana.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the Lusaka document allCommonwealth Governments had accepted the primacy ofBritain1 s role.    It had also committed them to regarding acessation of hostilities and an end to sanctions as major objectives.There had been no reference at Lusaka to the recognition by theOrganisation of African Unity Summit of the Patriotic Front asthe sole representatives of the people of Rhodesia; andPresidents Kaunda and Nyerere had said privately that they wouldaccept whatever government the proposed elections produced,In discussion, there was general agreement that the course followedby the Prime Minister and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryat Lusaka had been highly successful;  and that the action nowproposed offered the best hope of further progress.    A number ofquestions were raised, particularly about the handling ofdifficulties which might arise in the period during and after theConstitutional Conference.    But it was accepted that our policycould only be followed on a step-by-step basis, and that theGovernment should avoid hypothetical public discussion about theirintentions in the event of failure to achieve their presentobjectives.    It was important to play for success and to be seento be doing so.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the agreement which had been reached in Lusakaand which was set out in Annex B of C(79) 33.    They also approvedthe proposals for the next steps set out in that paper.    She wouldarrange for the Press to be informed that the Cabinet had endorsedthe Lusaka document; that invitations to a ConstitutionalConference would be issued shortly; and that a further statementwould be made in the course of next week.    The strictestconfidentiality should be observed over the details of the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.2SECRET168
SECRET2.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thateconomic prospects were not cheerful, either in Britain orinternationally.    Our gross domestic product (GDP; was no higherthan a year ago.    The Retail Price Index for August would reflectBudget changes and was expected to show a year-on-year increaseof about 15 per cent.    The average level of wage settlements wasalso believed to have reached 15 per cent.    But there wei e signsthat control of the money supply was beginning to improve; therewas some hope of a fall in interest rates; and the exchange rate,having risen by almost 10 per cent since the Budget, had nowfallen back by about half that amount.    A difficult time lay ahead.But there were nc grounds for altering the Government&apos;s policy,which was beginning to evoke a degree of industrial and internationalconfidence.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe essential message which the Government and their supportersneeded to get across was that no-one had any right to expectincreased pay, even to offset inflation, unless they earned it. ThePaymaster-General was arranging for the Parliamentary Partyand others to be briefed in this sense.    Attention would need to bepaid to the position of those like old age pensioners who wereparticularly vulnerable to rises in the cost of living.The Cabinet -Took note.3SECRET
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE HOME SECRETARY said that disputes over the pay ofjustices&apos; clerks1 assistants might lead to some disruption of thework of Magistrates&apos; Courts.    This would be unfortunate, sincecourt delays were already a matter of concern in the context of lawand order.    But the difficulties involved should be manageable,provided that the Government could, as he anticipated, acquiescein the settlement which had already been reached as regards thepay of the justices1 clerks themselves.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office10 August 19794CONFIDENTIAL
