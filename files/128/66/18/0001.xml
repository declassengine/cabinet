CONFIDENTIAL1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a prayer to annul theParaffin (Maximum Retail Prices) (Revocation) Order 1979 hadbeen successful in the House of Commons the previous eveningbecause no objection had been raised to it.    This oversight gavean impression of incompetence which could lead to publiccriticism and undermine the confidence of the Governmentssupporters in the House.    The immediate consequences for theprice of paraffin were at this stage still uncertain but it wasessential that the situation should immediately be restored.A new Order should be laid that day;  it would have to differ fromthe original Order in detail but it must be technically sound, andthere should be no repetition of the oversight which had allowedthe prayer to succeed.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.in the The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.per on the     THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft White Paper on thenon Rules     Immigration Rules had received policy clearance from theMinisterial Committee on Home and Social Affairs on26 September.    After making a number of detailed changes tomeet points suggested in correspondence he had circulated thedraft to the Cabinet with his memorandum C(79) 45.   The mostdifficult problem related to husbands and fiances from the Indiansub-continent, where the operation of the marriage market hadled to widespread exploitation and abuse.    Husbands and fianceswere now virtually the only source of male primary immigration.In the year before the Labour Governments concession in 1974the number of husbands accepted for settlement from all countrieshad been about 3, 000;  after the concession it had increased toabout 7, 000;  and by 1978 it had grown to about 9, 500.    About halfof this number came from the New Commonwealth and Pakistan.The figures for fiances in the same year was 2, 290, most of themfrom the same countries.    The case for tighter control was over-whelming;  the problem was how it should be achieved.    To revokethe Labour Governments concession would not be sufficient. TheRules previously in force contained a safeguard for hardship cases,allowing a husband or fiance to settle in the United Kingdom, ifotherwise the woman would face difficulties caused by differencein race, language, customs or religion in her husband&apos;s country.The better course was to exclude the husbands or fiances ofmarriages whose main purpose appeared to be to achieve1CONFIDENTIALffiNTARY79
CONFIDENTIALsettlement;  other marriages or engagements might enable theman to qualify for entry provided that the woman was a citizenof the United Kingdom and Colonies and born in this country.This approach would protect the position of women who wantedto marry United States citizens or citizens of the OldCommonwealth, for whom there was strong public sympathy.It might be argued that this solution would prove isafiective ir, thelong term as more Asian women born in this country reachedmarriageable age; but Asian girls born here could increasingly beexpected to look for marriage partners in the United Kingdomrather than from the Indian sub-continent.    He acknowledged thathis proposals would be criticised on the grounds that theydiscriminated between the sexes.    It had been suggested thatsimilar restrictions should be applied to wives and fianceescom&quot;.ng ;?rom abroad; but to do so would require major legislation,would breach the statutory undertakings given in the previousConservative Governments Immigration Act of 1971, and wouldprovoke enormous hostility.    If the argument about sexdiscrimination were pressed, the Government would have toexplain frankly that the alternatives were to allow the existingabuse to continue, with the consequent abandonment of comrnit-ments in the Manifesto, or to depart from the long-establishedtradition that wives of United Kingdom citizens had a right tosettle in this country.In discussion, it was argued that the strength of feeling on theissue of sex discrimination should not be underestimated, andmight result in a loss of support among women voters. Therewas also a risk of an adverse judgment in the European Court.The effect of the proposed rules on the position of women bornabroad while their parents had been employed in the service ofthe Crown was a matter of particular concern.    It could also beargued that, at least in relation to fiances, the new Rules shouldapply equally to members of both sexes.    On the other hand, theposition of women born abroad could be protected by the exerciseof administrative discretion.    It was impossible, however, todistinguish between husbands and fiances without providing scopefor evasion which would bring the system into disrepute.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the White Paper on the Immigration Rulesattached to C(79) 45 should be published as soon as possible; theHome Secretary should discuss the timing and handling of aParliamentary debate with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and the Chief Whip in due course.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER said that there were strong feelings aboutthe lack of facilities at Westminster for United Kingdom Membersof the       of the European Parliament.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should raise the matter in the Services Committeet without delay;  if the Opposition pressed their objection to theautomatic provision of passes, the issue would have to beresolved by a vote.The Cabinet -3.    Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the British proposals for the transitional period had beentabled at the Lancaster House Conference on 22 October. Underthese the members of Bishop Muzorewa&apos;s Government would retaintheir ministerial titles but not exercise their functions;  and thepolice and armed forces would be responsible to the BritishGovernor.    The police commissioner and General Walls hadaccepted this, and he hoped that Bishop Muzorewa would also do so.The Patriotic Front would object to the shortness of the transitionand to the arrangements for the security forces; but they mightin the end prove flexible.    Meanwhile the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Luce,had paid useful visits to the Front Line Presidents, but it was notclear how far they would be willing to put pressure on the PatrioticFront.    A message of support had been received from the UnitedStates Secretary of State, Mr Vance, and support had also beenshown at the informal meeting of European Economic CommunityForeign Ministers at Ashford Castle on 20-21 October.    Not allsanctionb would lapse automatically if Section 2 of the SouthernRhodesia Act 1965 was not renewed in mid-November..    We mightif necessary retain the balance for a limited period until we couldreasonably argue in the Security Council that legality had beenrestored.    The minimum basis for that would be Bishop Muzorewa&apos;sacceptance of our transitional plans and the installation of theGovernor following dissolution of the Rhodesian Parliament.Legislation would be needed so that we could implement thetransition and the new constitution;  and contingent provision forthat had been made in the Governments parliamentary timetable.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat our policy on Rhodesia had received reasonable support fromthe other Foreign Ministers of the European EconomicCommunities (EEC) at their informal meeting during the previousweekend.    Our need for a decision on the United   Kingdom&apos;sbudgetary problem at the Dublin European Council had beengenerally recognised but there was no acceptance of the magnitudeof the solution we were seeking.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the French Government had now written to him, and the otherEEC Ministers of Agriculture and the Commission, announcing thelifting of their ban on imports of sheepmeat from the UnitedKingdom.    However they appeared to be insisting that the quantityof imports should reflect previous patterns of trade and that importswould be bought up and stored by the national French intervention4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALagency.    He was seeking early clarification from the French thatour lamb could now be freely marketed and would not be subject toimport levies.    He had recdmmended Commissioner Gundelach,who had rushed to welcome the French measure and sought to turnthe pressure on to us, that he ought to make similar enquiries.The Cabinet -Took note.DITURE-84sre:17thsions,4. The Cabinet resumed its discussion of the last three yearsof the Public Expenditure Survey period.    It had before it amemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(79) 42),summarising his proposals, together with a letter dated15 October from the Secretary of State for Education and Scienceto the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and his reply dated 16 October.It also considered a further memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, (C(79) 49), illustrating changes in levels of publicexpenditure over the previous six years.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had asked for the additionalinformation in C(79) 49 to be circulated to the Cabinet, in orderto emphasise that the reductions already agreed for 1980-81merely stabilised the level of public expenditure as comparedwith 1978-79 and 1979-80.    The tables also demonstrated thatthe previous Government had themselves been forced to reducepublic expenditure sharply - by 2. 5 per cent in 1976-77 and by6 per cent in 1977-78.     Moreover the cost of servicing thenational debt had risen considerably throughout the period of theprevious Administration.    Unless the proposals put forward bythe Chief Secretary could be broadly accepted, it would be verydifficult to make any further reductions in taxation during the lifeof the Government,The Cabinet then considered the remaining programmes.The Chief Secretary, Treasury*s, proposals, set out in Annex Gto his paper, were designed to allow the maintenance ofeducational standards in line with the Manifesto commitment.They would have held unit costs at the level of 1978-79, with theaddition of an allowance, already agreed for 1980-81, of about 130 million a year for the extra costs associated with fallingschool rolls.    Rolls would fall by about 13 per cent over theperiod, and the number of teachers by only 10 per cent. Therewas a tendency for unit costs to rise at times when rolls wereincreasing, but not to reduce again as rolls fell.    The changesCONFIDENTIAL226
CONFIDENTIALproposed were unlikely to lead to any additional closures of smallvillage schools.    The Cabinet had already taken the mostpolitically-sensitive decision on education, when it agreed totackle school meal charges and transport;  there was less reasonto object to the proposals now under consideration.    Against thisit was argued that the Secretary of State for Education and Sciencehad already offered savings of  145 million in 1981-82, leading tocuts of 6 or 7 per cent on the education programme at the end ofthe period.    The  130 million adjustment proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury was insufficient to deal with the dis-economies of reduced numbers and continuing overheads. Theeffect would be more mixed ability teaching, mixed age teaching,and a narrower range of options in sixth forms.    While totalschool rolls were falling, numbers at the upper end of the age-group, where costs were highest, were still rising.The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, proposals for non-advancedfurther education required a reduction to the 1977-78 level ofprovision in real terms by 1982-83.    This involved a reductionof 3 per cent on the current year in the number of places or in unitcosts.    Numbers in the relevant 16-18 age group seeking full-timecourses were falling and there was scope to accommodate themwithin existing schools.    Many unnecessary courses were beingprovided Sa further education.    The numbers of overseas studentsin this sector should be examined further.Against this it was argued that 65 per cent of the training in theseinstitutions was vocational, and a high proportion of those placeswent to technicians in training, frequently on day release. Itwas not possible to undertake this kind of education in schools;nor was it possible to transfer pupils back to schools in areaswhich had changed to a tertiary or sixth form college system.The cuts proposed would reverse the modest improvement in thissector agreed for 1980-81.    Whatever sum was eventually agreedshould be allocated in ways which would favour technical andvocational training.The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, proposals required reductionsof  20 million,  50 million and  45 million in the three years at atime when numbers were rising, despite static or falling partici-pation rates.    The problem of overseas students in this sectorhad already been tackled, although some small adjustments mightbe needed to allow for a small number of post-graduate overseasstudents.    The university and polytechnic sector deserved a lowerpriority than non-advanced further education in the technical field.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIt was pointed out that the proposal (in Annex H of the ChiefSecretary, Treasury1 s, paper) to drop the earnings-relatedsupplement (ERS) was highly controversial.    It would involvedropping, for the first time, a whole class of social securitybenefits.    It would require highly contentious primary legislation.Because contributions were also earnings-related, it wouldinvolve breaking a contractual arrangement. Relationshipswith the trade unions would be severely damaged.    The absenceof ERS would make it even harder to agree satisfactory terms inthe case of large-scale redundancies.Against this it was argued that the social security programmeswere the one area of inexorable growth within overall publicexpenditure.    The abolition of ERS was the only major changewhich would make any difference to this total.    The presentsystem tended to narrow the gap in income between those at workand those out of work, and this must ha /e some effect onincentives.    This was particularly true if ERS were consideredtogether with the present very generous redundancy terms onoffer in many recent plant closures.    One possibility would be totax all such benefits;  this was already under study.    But thepotential tax yield was not enough to compensate for the cost ofcontinuing with ERS.    Taxation of benefits would also requireadditional staff, although this problem should not be exaggerated.It might also be possible to increase the rate of earnings-relatedcontributions, which were merely a form of insurance premiumagainst unemployment and should be adjusted as the costs rose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thesCabinet noted that a continuing provision of about  130 millionper annum had been made in the programme to offset thediseconomies of reducing school rolls.    On this basis and subjectto any necessary adjustment between it and the non-advancedfurther education programme, the Cabinet were disposed toaccept the provision for school education proposed by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury and theSecretary of State for Education and Science should discuss thesematters further, including particularly the provision to be madefor non-advanced further education and for higher education, andseek to reach an agreement on revised figures to be reported tothe Cabinet at its next meeting.    In doing so, they should reflectthe Cabinet1 s preference for technical non-advanced furthereducation.   The Cabinet agreed that the option of dropping theearnings-related supplement should not be pursued at this stage,and should not be reflected in the second Public Expenditure WhitePaper (covering the years 1981-82 to 1983-84).    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should however arrange for a complete andconfidential review by officials of the whole complex of redundancypayments, earnings-related, sickness and unemployment benefits,and taxation of benefits, and of their effect on incentives. He7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALshould report back to the appropriate Cabinet Committee in duecourse-    The Cabinet would resume its discussion of theremaining outstanding issues raised in C(79) 42 at its nextmeeting.The Cabinet -Took note with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the other Ministers concerned toproceed accordingly.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, (C(79) 46) covering a draft of a White Paperon the Governments expenditure plans in 1980-81.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the draftWhite Paper embodied the decisions which the Cabinet had takenduring the summer about expenditure in 1980-81.    The draftwould be extended to include the two tables circulated withC(79) 49 and discussed under the previous item of the Agenda.He proposed to publish the White Paper on 31 October withoutany oral statement.    But if the Cabinet judged that its importancerequired an oral statement, 1 Novembei would be a better date.In discussion of the arrangements for publication, it was arguedthat the Opposition would probably wish to press for an oralstatement.    It would be best to concede this demand if it weremade, although this was not necessarily the best way of presentingthe Governments case.    There would almost certainly be an earlydebate about the White Paper in any case.    Arrangements hadalready been made to co-ordinate publicity at the time ofpublication, although individual Ministers would wish to make theirown arrangements for explaining the figures for their ownprogrammes.    In doing so, all Ministers should take the opportunityto stress that these were volume figures, and that the more thatwas spent on pay the less, inevitably, would be available for theother elements in the programme.In discussion of the draft, it was first suggested that theunemployment assumption stated in paragraph 39 should beremoved.    It would be necessary in due course to make thisfigure public, but this should not be done any earlier than wasstrictly necessary.    It was noted that a change to paragraph 16,on the Defence programme, had been agreed between officials.The reference to housing subsidies might need amendment, toavoid over-precision about the level of rent increases to be8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALexpected as a result of the Governments decisions. Areference might be needed to the overall effect of the changesin public expenditure upon the construction industry.In further discussion it was noted that, following discussion inthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, it had beenprovisionally agreed that further increases of 5 per cent inelectricity prices and 10 per cent in gas prices should beintroduced in October 1980 following increases in line with theretail price index in April 1980.    The figures in the &quot;White Paperwould be adjusted to allow for this.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, should arrange for the WhitePaper to be published on 1 November.    The Opposition shouldbe told that it was not the Governments intention to make anoral statement;  but if the Opposition pressed for one, theGovernment should be prepared to concede it. IndividualMinisters were free to explain their own programmes, but theirlines should be consistent with those taken by Treasury Minister sin presenting the Governments decisions and should be co-ordinatedin advance in the usual way.    The reference to the unemploymentassumption in paragraph 39 should be deleted.    The Secretary ofState for the Environment should agree with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on the wording of references to housing subsidies andto the construction industry, and should refer to her in the eventof further disagreement.    The Cabinet confirmed the agreementreached on gas and electricity prices.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChief Secretary, Treasury, and all other Ministersconcerned, to proceed accordingly.ORT      6.

CONFIDENTIAL7. THE PRIME MINISTER said that there would not be timegi for the Cabinet to discuss the paper (C(79) 48) by the ChancellorS of the Exchequer.    It would do so at its next meeting. Meanwhile,a cash limit for the National Coal Board had to be agreed urgently,before the pay negotiations with the National Union of Mineworkerswere resumed on 30 October.    The Secretary of State for Energyshould agree this cash limit with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,and inform her of the result.The Cabinet -Took note.8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that he would be making a statement in the House of Commonsthat afternoon about political developments in Northern Ireland.This followed discussions in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee.    In his statement, he would say that the Governmentintended to convene a conference of all parties in NorthernIreland about future constitutional arrangements. TheGovernment would issue a consultative document in advance. Itwould set out a number of ways in which progress might be madetowards resolving the present difficulties.    He hoped that theconference would meet by the end of November.    It wasimportant to persuade all the main parties to attend theconference if possible, though there were fears that at least onemight not do so.    It was therefore essential that all Ministers,in speeches both in Northern Ireland and in the rest of the country,should take every opportunity to stress the importance of theconference and to emphasise the need for participation by allthe main parties.The Cabinet -Took note,10CONFIDENTIAL231
CONFIDENTIAL9.        The Cabinet took note that the Chancellor of theExchequer had made a statement in the House of Commons on23 October announcing the abolition of all remaining exchangecontrols save those affecting Rhodesia (which would need to beretained so long as sanctions continued).    This was one of thosedecisions on which, because of their acute commercial sensitivity,it was necessary to ensure strict security, and it was thereforepossible for the Chancellor to consult only a very few colleaguesin advance; he had; however, arranged for the text of hisstatement to be circulated to all his Cabinet colleagues immediatelybefore it was made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that,although she recognised that some other members of the Cabinetmight have liked to have an opportunity of expressing their viewsbefore a decision was taken, it was the general view of the Cabinetthat it was right to continue to observe the well-established andinevitable practice that advance knowledge of certain decisions,notably in the defence and financial fields, had for overridingreasons of security to be confined to as few people, includingMinisters, as possible.The Cabinet -Took note.of      10.       THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was the last meetingof the Cabinet which Sir John Hunt would be attending. Shewished formally to place on record her own gratitude, and thatof the Cabinet, for the notable services which he had renderednot only to successive Cabinets but also to the country as a whole.He had held office for over six years, and the service which hehad given went well beyond the ordinary business of the Cabinet.She wished to put on record in particular his invaluable work insupport of Economic Summits.    He had been a wise and skilfuladviser and counsellor, and indeed friend, to members ofsuccessive Cabinets.     The Cabinet would wish to extend to himtheir best wishes for the future.In token of the Cabinet&apos;s gratitude and good wishes, the PrimeMinister, on the Cabinet1 s behalf, made a presentation toSir John Hunt, who expressed his gratitude both for what thePrime Minister had said and for the gifts presented to him.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of all that the PrimeMinister had said, and asked that it should berecorded in the Cabinet Minutes.Cabinet Office25 October 1979 11CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETntis THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 18th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 25 October 1979 at 9. 30 am35The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (C(79) 47) discussing proposalsfor the Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement for 1980-81and various related matters.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the issues involved had beendiscussed in a Ministerial Group (MISC 21) under his chairmanship.They had aimed so far as possible to reach agreed recommenda-tions to Cabinet colleagues and those listed in paragraphs 14 (i),(ii) and (v) of his paper were so agreed.    The main issues on whichthey had not been able to reach a common view were the size ofthe overall grant percentage, and the pay and price assumptionsthat should be employed in turning the already agreed volumefigures for 1980-81 into the cash limit for that year.    The grantpercentage was bound up with the problem of distribution wherethe Governments declared aim was to halt, and if possible reverse,the drift of grant away from the Shire counties.    Since the Grouphad decided that it was impracticable to alter the distribution iformula this year, this aim pointed to an RSG percentage towardsthe top end of the range of options under discussion. Theassumptions to be used to arrive at the cash limits for 1980-81presented considerable problems because there was an inevitablearea of uncertainty.    In particular they involved judgments aboutlevels of wage settlements up to the end of the financial year 1980-81,and so incorporated elements from both the current and the nextwage rounds.    The Group had considered advice from the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, that the best estimate of the likely rise inlocal authority costs - including both pay and prices but excludingthe tail end of outstanding comparability awards - was 14. 6 per cent.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had then argued that this inflationassumption should be shaded down, to encourage economy hy thelocal authorities.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s finalrecommendation therefore was that the Government should use anoverall figure of 13 per cent increase in costs in arriving at the1980-81 cash limit.    The Secretary of State for the Environment,on the other hand, had argued that a figure of 13 per cent would be1SECRET233
SECRETunrealistically low.    In his view local authorities1 pay settlementswere likely to be influenced by the current rate of price inflationof over 17 per cent and there was a danger that, if local authoritiesthought the Government was under-providing for inflation, theywould further increase the level of rates.    The Secretary of Statefor the Environment had therefore proposed the adoption of anuplift figure, after a degree of shading to induce efficiency, of16. 5 per cent.    The Cabinet would have to strike a balance betweenthese views.In discussion of the grant percentage, it was suggested that theoverall rise in local authority costs next year might well turn outto be near 20 per cent.    If the grant percentage remained at61 per cent the burden of this cost increase would fall more on thetaxpayer than the ratepayer.    A reduction in grant to 59 per centwould shift the burden to the ratepayer and induce economy in localauthority expenditure.    Against this it was argued that theGovernment had long held the view that the rating system wasunfair and that the burden of rates should be reduced as far aspossible.    Moreover it was important that the Government shouldnot give local authorities an alibi for large rate increases. Thevolume of local authority expenditure had been discussed at lengthwith the local authorities during the course of the summer, and itwas presentationally desirable that the Government should now offerto finance its share of that expenditure.    Otherwise it would beaccused of imposing a further volume cut by the back door. Theeffect of the grant percentage on the distribution of RSG, and itsconsequences for the Shire counties,   would also be of greatimportance tc the Governments supporters.    The only means,other than setting a suitable RSG percentage, of shifting more granttowards the Shire counties would lie in taking more away fromLondon, where the rate burdens were already much higher thanelsewhere in real terms.    If that were not acceptable, the onlygrant percentage that would show any improvement for the Shires,was 61 per cent.In discussion of the inflation assumptions, it was noted that theTreasury estimate of 14. 6 per cent had been calculated using thebest available estimates of the future movements of wages andprices to the end of 1980-81.    It was an average and was notinconsistent with a declining rate of inflation throughout the period.Some of the current climate of expectation for higher levels ofinflation arose from the assumed linkage between wage levels andthe annual rate of increase in the retail price index (RPI), which atpresent included the exceptional factor of the Budget VAT increases.The Government must not give credibility to such a link, and it hadto be borne in mind that the inflation assumption used in the RSGsettlement would eventually become public knowledge.    It was alsoimportant to bear in mind the links between local authority payand the National Health Service where there was no alternative to a2SECRET234
SECRETvolume squeeze if insufficient allowance were made for pay in thecash limits.    But, in the last resort a decision on the inflationfigure to set for so long a period ahead was a matter of judgment.In making that judgment it was important not to endorse a levelwhich would feed through into expectations throughout the wholeeconomy or relax the pressure for savings on the local authorities.On the other hand it was argued strongly that too low an assumptionmight, in the end, lead to higher wage settlements than might havebeen achieved if a more accurate estimate had been available.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegrant percentage and the assumed inflation rate had to be seen as asingle package.    The Cabinet were agreed that, for a wide varietyof reasons, including the implications for the Shire counties, thegrant percentage should be set at 61 per cent.    Although this washigher than the Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed, he hadindicated that he would accept such a decision provided that therelated cash limit was set on his preferred assumption of a13 per cent increase in costs.    Given that the inflation assumptionwas a matter very much within the Chancellor^ own responsibility,the Cabinet must support his judgment on it.    They were thusagreed that the RSG percentage for 1980-81 should be set at61 per cent and the cost increase, leading to the cash limit, at13 per cent.    They also approved the other detailed proposals inthe Home Secretary&apos;s paper.    For the time being the strictestsecrecy should be preserved over the Cabinefs decision.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.rCabinet Office26 October 1979
