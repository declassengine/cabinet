CONFIDENTIALusnee:14thsions,Z1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat after a slow start the Rhodesia Conference now had before ita full summary of the constitution we proposed.    This wascompatible with the existing constitution except on the PublicService Commissions and on white blocking power. BishopMuzorewa&apos;s delegation would probably agree to it, despite someproblems.    Whether the Patriotic Front leaders would also do sowas less clear.    Mr Nkomo seemed readier to settle thanMr Mugabe, although there were strong pressures on both. Ouraim was to reach provisional agreement on the constitution withintwo weeks.    After an adjournment the Conference would thentackle the even greater problem of transitional arrangements. Iffinal agreement could not be reached the British Government mighthave to state unilaterally what it was prepared to recommend toParliament and seek acceptance of this.Relations THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theouth Africa French and Irish Governments had both now banned tours by SouthAfrican rugby teams.    If the proposed tour of Britain went aheadus we were likely to face serious problems both in our internationalnee: relations and as regards public order.    The South African14th Government were considering using their influence to get the toursions, cancelled.    But they hoped we could in return say publicly that ourattitude would change in the future if further progress was madetowards multi-racialism in South African sport.    He would concertwith the Prime Minister a Foreign and Commonwealth Officestatement which might go some way in that direction while notignoring our obligations under the Gleneagles Agreement. Thisstatement could then be quoted in a further letter from theParliamentary Secretary, Department of the Environment, askingthe Rugby Union not to proceed with this particular tour.In a brief discussion it was noted that if the tour went ahead theexisting strain on police manpower would be significantly increased^Although this should not be over-emphasised in public, it couldusefully be mentioned in private contacts with Rugby Union leaders.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL183
CONFIDENTIALUNITYus &apos; -nces:14thsions,3 and18thsions,22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the European Economic Community (EEC) Commission had nowproduced their factual report on the United Kingdom budgetaryproblem which, although not as helpful as we had earlier hoped,nevertheless now produced incontrovertible evidence that we wouldbe the largest net contributor, making net payments of over 1, 000 million in 1980, a figure which was likely to increase infuture years unless remedial action was taken.    At the forthcomingmeeting of the Council of Ministers (Finance) on 17 September, theChancellor of the Exchequer would seek to deal with the argumentswhich our partners were advancing against us and would make itclear that our target was to reach a broad balance between ourcontribution and our receipts.    It would then be for theCommission to make proposals for solutions and work was in handto ensure that the Commission were informed what mechanism wefavoured.    Our Community partners were reluctant to do anythingabout the basic inequity of the present situation and it would beextremely difficult to secure a satisfactory agreement at theNovember meeting of the European Council in Dublin.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY furtherreported that, earlier that day, the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee, Sub-Committee on European Questions, had met toconsider the line which the Secretary of State for Energy shouldtake at the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (Energy)which would discuss the follow up to the decisions of the StrasbourgEuropean Council and the Tokyo Summit on oil import targets forthe years up to 1985.    With the development of North Sea oilproduction this presented no difficulty for the United Kingdom butwhat we said about our import requirement s would affect whatother EEC countries would need to do in order to comply with theCommunity target for 1985 of 475 million tons.    At one extremewe could merely rest on our notional commitment not to importmore than we did in 1977 but this would be manifestly unrealistic.At the other extreme we were being pressed by the Commission,on the basis of figures published by the last Government aboutlikely North Sea oil production, to 5ay that by 1985 we would benet exporters of 20 - 30 million tonnes.    The Sub-Committee haddecided that, in order to retain freedom over our future productionpolicies we should, at the Energy Council, not go beyond sayingthat we would be self sufficient in 1985.    This oould be reviewedwhen the future course of North Sea oil production became clearer.If agreement in the Council could not be reached on this basis weshould need to reconsider our position in the light of forthcomingdecisions on depletion policy and the possible scope for using thisor other energy issues to help our negotiations over theCommunity Budget.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE PRIME MINISTER said that at her meeting with thePrime Minister or the Irish Repuolic, Mr Lynch, on 5 September,it had been agreed that security co-operation against terrorismmust be substantially improved.    He had undertaken to study anumber of specific suggestions she had put forward.    These wouldbe the subject of a follow-up meeting in early October between hisForeign and Justice Ministers and the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland.    Meanwhile we had agreed not to make them public. Butmuch depended on how far the Dublin Government were actuallyprepared to go in increasing necessary co-operation.    The attitudeof Mr Lynch&apos;s deputy, Mr Colley, appeared to be less well-intentioned than his own.The CabinetTook note.&amp;trates&quot;ts&apos; staffbuspnce:114th[lsions,54. the lord chancellor said that he felt it necessary tobring to his colleagues&quot; attention the -serious situation arising for theadministration of justice in London from the continuation of thestrike at Magistrates&quot; Courts.    Many activities of the Courts werebeing seriously interrupted, and he feared that the situation mightsoon become intolerable.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, although he shared theLord Chancellor&quot;s concern at the potential effects of the strike, thesituation was better than might have been expected.

CONFIDENTIAL[qHING:a.termcIDITUREusnee:12thsiens,55. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(/9) 36) about the continued need to publish WhitePapers on Public Expenditure covering a five-year forward period.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinetshould distinguish between the internal need to plan on a five-yearbasis, and the need to publish the Governments provisional decisions.There was no doubt that for some purposes, Government needed tomake provisional allocations of resources for some years ahead.These should obviously be very tentative, and should err on the sideof caution.    Publication was another matter.    Figures for theimmediately-following financial year, on which the Government hadalready taken its decisions, had to be published in any case.    He nowproposed to include these in an early White Paper, which wouldprobably a)so include the short term economic forecasts requiredunder the Industry Act.    Material about later years could be publishedbefore the end of the year.    Some guidance was needed, for localauthorities and other public sector bodies, about the broad scale ofresources likely to be available in these later years. Publicationwould make clear the Governments commitment to reduce publicexpenditure over this period and would be in line with the practice ofsuccessive Governments.    To alter course now would invitesuspicion.    Moreover the new Parliamentary Select Committeeswould be looking for more information not less.   The degree ofdetail to be included in a White Paper about later years need not bedecided now, though in his view, it should at least include totals forthe main existing public expenditure programmes.    This would helpto indicate the Governments own view of priorities.In discussion, there was general agreement on the need to plan aheadon a five-year basis, at least for some purposes, provided that theincreasingly tentative nature of the figures for later years wasunderstood.    The necessity for a White Paper covering 1980-81 indetail was recognised and there was also broad support for thepublication of a second White Paper covering the period from 1981-82to 1983-84, in line with the practice of recent years.    This wasparticularly important in the first year of the Governments life,when there had been a significant change in planned levels of expendi-ture.    It was however suggested that the degree of detail about lateryears could be significantly reduced, particularly since sensitivepolitical issues were often involved.   There was a case for publishingonly a single global figure for the expenditure of local authorities.This would allow time for genuine consultation with the localauthorities about the allocation of their expenditure between thevarious services.    Against this, it was argued that the Governmentneeded to make clear the priority it was giving to Law and Orderprogrammes, and to indicate that, within a reduced education Budget,there would be no need to reduce standards or the level of expenditureon basic education.    It had not been the practice to consult with thelocal authorities about later years of expenditure.    The tentativenature of the figures, and the scope for local authority autonomy,could be made clear at the time of publication.CONFIDENTIAL186
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet      agreed that there should be an early White Paper aboutPublic Expenditure in 1980-81, followed by a less detailed oneabout expenditure in the years to 1983-84,   The second White Papershould publish totals for expenditure on the main programmes,together with as much detail as seemed appropriate for Law andOrder and Education.    The degree of detail given about other localauthority services should be kept to the necessary minimum. Thetentative nature of the figures for later years should be emphasised.The Cabinet would consider drafts of both White Papers in duecourse.    The case for continuing to publish White Papers coveringthe full five years should be reconsidered at the time of the 1980Public Expenditure Survey.Th^ Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.5CONFIDENTIAL18
SECRET6. The Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the ChancellorUTURE:       of the Exchequer a.nd the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(79) 35)SALS FOR     containing proposals for reductions in existing Public ExpenditureEARS plans for the years after 1980-81.1980-81THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the short andus medium term economic prospects were gloomy.    In the current year,ce: itwas proving difficult to finance the present public sector borrowing12th requirement, and interest rates were necessarily at a very high level,sions, The position might well be no easier in 1980-81 or subsequent years.5, Altliough the detailed forecasts were not yet ready, it was clear thathe would have great difficulty in cutting taxes in real terms, and itmight even be necessary to increase indirect taxation.    It wastherefore essential to stabilise the level of public expenditure. Hispaper demonstrated the size and distribution of growth in recentyears.    He had set out illustratively some of the changes which mightbe needed to reduce expenditure, by the end of the period, to thelevels of 1977-78.    Even then, public expenditure would have fallenby only 0. 5 per cent a year during the period, compared with a1 per cent per year increase in the previous five years.    This wasnot a structural change in public expenditure but a series ofrelatively minor adjustmeuts.    But because of the Governmentsalready-agreed political priorities, and of the difficulty of cuttingdemand-related programmes, the burden of adjustment fell heavilyon a limited number of Departments.    He therefore suggested thatbefore the Cabinet took final decisions, his proposals should bediscussed in detail between the Ministers concerned and the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, leading to a further discussion in Cabinetduring October.In discussion, there was general support for the objective ofstabilising expenditure at about the level of 1977-78.    It was amatter for regret that it had not proved possible to meet thisobjective in 1980-81, or to contemplate a reduction in the level ofexpenditure to that ruling during the period of the previousConservative Administration.    In the absence of any medium termeconomic forecasts, there was no precise economic rationale for atarget related to 1977-78, but it was already clear that reductions onat least this scale would be necessary to meet the Governmentsoverall objectives.    However, a policy of stabilisation, coupled withthe priorities already agreed, meant that large reductions would beneeded in certain programmes.    The political difficulties arisingfrom such reductions, for example, where they affected education ortransport, should not be underestimated.    For these reasons itmight be necessary to reconsider the absolute priority  ivan to theDefence programme and to Law and Order.    Against this view itwas argued that the level of Defence Budget proposed by theChancellor did not necessarily meet our obligations to the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation.    It was important both internationallyand at home to be seen to be honouring our commitments in this re specSECRET188
SECRETThe timing of any cuts should also be carefully considered. Someof them, like the changes already agreed in regional policy, built upslowly throughout the period.    There was a case for concentratingany further reductions at the beginning of the period, and avoidingthe need for difficult policy changes towards the end of the Parliament.Full account should be taken of the possibility of additional revenuefrom North Sea oil taxation.    Priority should be given to expenditurewhich would promote additional investment in wealth-creation. Itmight be necessary to reduce expenditure even faster than theChancellor proposed, in order to finance tax concessions which wouldhave the same effect.    All these points could be discussed in moredetail in bilateral conversations with Treasury Ministers.It was also argued that the depressive economic background describedby the Chancellor carried social as well as economic and politicalrisks.    The climate had deteriorated even in the three monthssince the Budget, as part of the general decline into world recession.The Government should avoid getting itself in to a position whereabrupt changes of policy might be needed.    Its present monetarystance assumed that the unions would adjust their pay claims in linewith what firms could afford to pay.    If they did not do so theconsequences would be even higher unemployment.    The Governmenthad to make this clear at every opportunity.    There was no sign thatthe majority of union leaders wanted a confrontation with theGovernment over pay this winter.    Some critics were arguing inpublic that the Governments monetary policy would force the economydeeper into recession.    But the dynamic effects of the Governmentspolicies had still to work through and there was as yet no sign of ageneral crisis of company liquidity.    Nevertheless the Governmentsroom for manoeuvre was severely limited.    It was essential to keepthe public sector borrowing requirement within bounds, and thisrequired expenditure cuts on the scale proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.    The only alternatives were higher interest rates,higher indirect or direct taxation, or a change in expenditurepriorities which would involve cutting the Defence Budget and otherprotected programmes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the general line proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer, both as to the aggregate level of expenditure in the yearsin question, and as to the broad order of priority between programmes.He and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should now conduct bilateralnegotiations with all the spending Ministers concerned, reporting theresults back to Cabinet during October, when there would be time forfurther Cabinet discussions.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to proceed accordingly.7SECRET89
CONFIDENTIALLISEDIESENT ANDNG REVIEW:1983-84es:3thns,and,thins7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(79) 37) about the financialrequirements of the nationalised industries in the years 1981-82to 1983-84.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the paperoutlined the nationalised industries&apos; bids for borrowing in theyears under review and outlined options for reducing thosebids.    The main thrust of his recommendations stemmedfrom a belief that the nationalised industries could and shouldmake an increasing contribution to the reduction of publicexpenditure and the public sector borrowing requirement(PSBR).    Table 2 of his paper showed his specific proposalsfor reductions industry by industry.    If they were adoptedin full it would be possible to look forward to a substantialnet repayment of debt by the nationalised industries startingin 1981 and increasing to  ^ billion in 1983-84. Theparticular proposals basically followed the logic of thedecisions about nationalised industry finances already taken bythe Cabinet in respect of 1980-81.    The core of the proposalsrested on cuts in investment plans, greater efficiency, upwardrevision of prices - particularly for gas - and the cancellationof specific projects such as the BAe 146 aircraft. Theproposals raised complex issues which he would propose todiscuss with those colleagues concerned in bilateral discussion.He hoped nevertheless that colleagues would now agree toendorse all the options set out in Table 2 of the paper, subjectto the outcome of bilateral discussions, and thereafter toinforming the nationalised industries that they would beresponsible for finding ways of keeping within the externalfinancing limits now contemplated.In discussion attention was drawn to the large number ofcomplicated policy issues which underlay the Chief Secretary,Treasury&apos;s, proposals.    Major decisions would be required,some of which would require collective discussion,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the general conclusions of C(79) 37 andwere content that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should nowenter into bilateral discussions of detail with the Ministersconcerned.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should reportback to Cabinet in October when any outstanding issues couldbe resolved.    Meanwhile the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy would be having early discussions, relevantto the present operation, on a range of issues including coaland energy pricing.8CONFIDENTIAL190
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^surnming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.ITHER 8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord[iON TO President of the Council (C(79) 38) reporting his discussion withlUCE THE Departmental Ministers about the scope for reduction in the sizeOF THE of the Civil Service and recommending a 10 per cent target for, SERVICE reductions by April 1982.ious THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the responserence: from Departmental Ministers to his request for staff saving9) 4th reductions had varied widely, from 15 per cent down to 0. 3 perfusions, cent.    In total, the reductions which Ministers thought feasibleite 6 amounted to 6 or 7 per cent.    Of this, 1. 5 per cent would befound by transferring work from the Civil Service to the privatesector.    The cash savings would be correspondingly lower.This response implied that the Cabinet felt it necessary tocontinue with some 95 per cent of the tasks which a previousSocialist Government had thought essential.    He found thisunacceptable.    Admittedly it would be difficult to reduce theService even by 6 or 7 per cent, and much harder to reach10 per cent reductions.    Higher figures than this were unlikelyto be practicable, at least in the short term.    But the Governmentwas committed to reducing the size of the bureaucracy and wouldbe discredited if it failed.    The necessary steps would have to bediscussed with individual Ministers.    But the Cabinet mightestablish in advance some general principles.    It a^as clearthat, to secure reductions of as much as 10 per cent, the bigemployers, notably the Ministry of Defence and the Chancellorof the Exchequers Departments, must reach this target them-selves.    Secondly, because some areas like Prisons would haveto be exempt from cuts, others must make correspondingly largerreductions.    Thirdly, transfers of work to private sector wereonly worth pursuing where there was a reasonable expectationthat the work could be done more cheaply.    The Cabinet shouldrecognise that the National Staff Side would be strongly opposedto reductions of the scale proposed, which was unlikely to beachieved without redundancies.    Industrial action was likely,and the Cabinet would have to consider preparations to withstandthis.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, iv was argued that the response to the LordPresident of the Council&apos;s request had been very disappointing.In a Civil Service which had grown so fast in recent years,there must be scope for economies of at least 10 per cent.However it was recalled that the Governments objective hadbeen to reduce the weight of bureaucracy.- especially as it boreupon the individual citizeru    This did not necessarily point tothe case for substantial cute in the Ministry of Defence, whichhad already reduced its efa.fi considerably in recent years.While there was certainly scope for some reduction in such alarge Department, the tasks were so complex, and sensitivethat this would take time.    The Ministry of Defence had alreadyset its own internal reviews in hand.    Other Departments, likethe Ministry of Agriculture, were co-operating with the CivilService Department in full-scale management reviews.Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s proposals would lead to further economies.Other Departments were able to make very substantial staffreductions, provided the Government was prepared to undertakecontentious legislation.    In other cases, there was room forsubstantial contracting-out of work to the private sector^ Thiswas often inherently a more flexible way of cariying out afluctuating work-load, and could lead to substantial savings inoverhead cuts such as pensions.    Whilst therefore theLord President of the Council&apos;s cziterion of cost saving wassupported it would be important to ensure that all relevant costswere brought into the comparison.    As to the RevenueDepartments it was argued that, at any rate for the years beforefull computerisation, large staff savings could probably only beachieved by exempting considerable numbers of people from tax,at a high cost.    Nevertheless, the search for economies shouldbe pressed in these Departments, too, because work done inopposition and the experience of other countries suggested thatwe employed a relatively high number of tax officials in relationto revenue yield.    More generally it was argued that strictcontrol of recruitment, with the direct involvement ofDepartmental Ministers concerned, was a very effective way ofsubjecting Departmental tasks to sciatiny.    There were howeverother areas, like the Prison service, where there was littlescope for staff reduction.    A review of sentencing policy, withmore emphasis on monetary   penalties, might help; but theprisons were so overcrowded that drastic action would soon beneeded.    In addition, the forthcoming report of the MayCommittee might lead to demands for additional staff, and wouldbe likely to create a very difficult situation on which the HomeSecretary would shortly be reporting to his colleagues.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the Lord President of the Council&apos;sproposals in paragraph 18 of C(79) 38.    It would however bepresentationally important to avoid any public commitment toa particular target at this stage.    In the light of this decisionall Departmental Ministers should re-examine their staf  levelswith the aim of securing savings of at least 10 per cent whereverpossible.    They should then discuss their proposals with theLord President of the Council, who would bring detailedproposals to the Cabinet at a later stage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council to proceedaccordingly.YNER        9. THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had now received aise most interesting report from Sir Derek Rayner about hisoperations to reduce waste, to improve efficiency and to identifyis unnecessary functions, in Government Departments.    She wouldice: circulate this to colleagues for discussion at a later meetingst which Sir Derek Rayner might be invited to attend. Colleaguessions, would see that Sir Derek Rayner required information from them1 j. by 23 November and she urged all Ministers in charge ofDepartments to co-operate fully in meeting this request. Thedevelopment of Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s activities offered theopportunity of ending the Programme Analysis ind Review (PAR)system and, unless any colleagues saw objection, PAR should bephased out as quickly as possible.In a brief discussion no member of the Cabinet indicated that hewished the PAR system to continue.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office13 September 197911CONFIDENTIAL193
