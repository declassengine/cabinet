CONFIDENTIALMENTARY1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.siaasence:14thlisions,12. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaton the previous day the United States Senate had added an amendment tothe Military Authorisation Bill calling for an immediate end tosanctions.    The Bill now had to go through the House of Represen-tatives where a vote was likely to be taken within the next two weeks.If the House of Representatives supported the Senate&apos;s view it wouldstill be open to President Carter to veto the Bill.    In this case a two-thirds majority of both Houses would be required to overturn his veto.It was too early to say whether this was likely to be obtainable.eesousnice:lisions,7THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therefusal of the Malaysians and Indonesians to take any more refugeesfrom Vietnam would have the result of increasing the pressure on HongKong.    The Governor, whom he had seen the previous day, was worriedabout the situation and would be seeing the Prime Minister that evening.The Thai Government had begun forcibly to expel refugees back acrossthe border and those who were returned in this way were being shot onarrival.    There was still doubt about whether the Taiwanese would acceptthe refugees on board of Roachbank:   contrary to earlier reports nomore than half of them were children of 15 and under.    Norse Viking,the other British ship currently carrying refugees, had left Hong Kongand was on the way to Osaka.    If the Japanese refused to accept therefugees on board we would be asked to do so.    The response to thePrime Minister&apos;s proposal for an international conference, which theSecretary General of the United Nations, Dr Waldheim, had welcomed,had been favourable, but the initial enthusiasm was now waning. TheUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Hartling, who hadbeen given the task of organising the conference, was reluctant to do soin the absence of assurances that those attending would be willing toaccept refugees.    The Minister of State, Foreign and CommonwealthOffice, Mr Blaker, was going to Geneva to see Mr Hartling to try andpersuade him to do something, and we would follow this up with afurther message to Dr Waldheim.    The United States Administrationwere getting concerned about the problem and President Carter wasintending to raise it with President Brezhnev of the Soviet Union inVienna.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that we werehaving great difficulty in restarting the initiative of the Five. TheSecurity Council was dn.* to meet to discuss Namibia the following dayand it was likely that the proposal for sanctions against South Africawould be revived.    We should be able to hold this situation for the timebeing.    But with the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance,heavily engaged on the Vienna Summit we were not getting as muchsupport from the Americans as we would have wished.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatother member states now wished to increase the Community&apos;s aid offerin the negotiations for a new Lome Convention.    We were continuing toresist this in view of the Government&apos;s general position on publicexpenditure.    The increase proposed might involve an additionalUnited Kingdom contribution of  12 million per annum over the nextfive year6.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) on 12 June there had been some difficulty in ensuring that theitem under which our budget problem would be discussed was adequatelyincluded in the agenda for the forthcoming European Council inStrasbourg.    This could be indicative of the entrenched position ofother member states especially the French.    It would however be forthe Heads of Government to determine the order in which the agendawas taken.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he would beattending a meeting of the Council of Ministers (Energy) on 18 June toprepare the ground for the discussion on energy at the EuropeanCouncil.    We did not want to go down the road of oil allocations.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIenBationriouslence:)2ndHons,i34. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (C(79) 20) setting out the linw heproposed to take on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) prices and onthe Green Pound in the 18 June meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture).THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thathis proposals, which had been considered by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on European Questions on 11 June, fell into two parts. OnCAP prices, he proposed to support the Commission^ proposals for ageneral price freeze, to accept token increases if necessary on minoritems if they were proposed by the Commission during the discussions,but to stand firm on commodities in serious surplus - pre-eminentlymilk and sugar - and to reject a milk levy that discriminatedunacceptably against United Kingdom producers.    The French werelikely to make a determined push for a general 2 per cent price increasein order to leave room for a reduction in German MonetaryCompensatory Amounts (MCAs), and might make a link between ourattitude on CAP prices and their willingness to make a move at the JuneEuropean Council towards our budget objectives.    Though we hadunreliable Italian support for a price freeze, and the Germans had saidthat they would not themselves press for a price increase, all the othermember states were likely to go along with the French desire. Therewere therefore tactical risks in our stance on the price freeze, butsince it was improbable that the negotiations would be concluded at nextweek&apos;s Agriculture Council we should not be the first to make anyconcessions.In discussion there was general support for the line proposed by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, although it was suggestedthat we should not accept a price increase for beef because it wouldrepresent a back-door stimulus to milk production and cause difficultieswith third country suppliers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet broadly endorsed the approach to the price-fixingnegotiations proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood.    Whilst it was accepted that he might need some measure offlexibility in the final stages of the negotiations, we should stand firmon a general freeze for the time being at least and should in particularnot take any steps which would weaken the Commission^ hand.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of theirdiscussion and invited the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that,on the Green Pound, he proposed an early devaluation of l\ per centplus a tactical bid for an additional devaluation of up to 5 per cent forpigmeat only.    Farmers had suffered a 13 per cent drop in their realincomes in 1978 and they faced steeply rising costs in the current year;bank borrowings were now of the order of  2, 000 million, 25 per centup on last year.    Without a further Green Pound devaluation farmincomes would fall by some 15 per cent this year, with disastrous effectson confidence and investment.    There was a crisis in the pig industry,where because of excessive MCAs on imports a number of processingplants had already closed.    The Government was committed to puttingBritish farmers on level competitive terms with the rest of theCommunity during the present Parliament.    A devaluation of the orderproposed was necessary to restore confidence and profitability toBritish agriculture, which was well placed because of its efficiency toimprove its export performance and thus yield benefits to the balance ofpayments.    Both the Commission and our partners assumed that wewould wish to secure a devaluation of the Green Pound during next week&apos;sCoiancil, and there was now general acceptance in the Community thatmember states should be free to make changes in their greencurrencies provided that they were moving in the direction of the commonprice level.In discussion there was support for a further immediate devaluation ofthe Green Pound.    Farm incomes had been severely affected in Scotlandand the North of England.    It was particularly important to maintainfarm incomes in Northern Ireland.    Stimulus to agricultural productionwas consistent with the Government&apos;s policy of giving encouragement tpcompetitive sectors of the economy.    A move of this kind would createconfidence among the rural community which would stand theGovernment in good stead in the future.    Against this, it was stronglyargued that a 7j per cent devaluation would add 2 per cent to the foodprice index and 0. 5 per cent to the Retail Price Index (RPI);  that theseincreases would come on top of the effects of the 5 per cent devaluationnegotiated by the last Government in March, of the l^p rise in the retailmilk price announced in May, and of the Value Added Tax and otherincreases flowing from the Budget.    The rate of inflation had gone upfrom 8 per cent to 17^ per cent in a year, which was already damagingto the Governments standing in the country;  taken together with otherprice increases, the effects of the proposed devaluation would fallparticularly severely on the housewife.    Moreover, the reduction infarm incomes last year was partly due to an exceptional fall in potatoprices.    Apart from the pig sector, for which the only final cure was achange in the way in which MCAs were calculated, many farmers had hada good year.    While therefore the Government could not allow anincrease in the RPI to be a determinant of policy, the inflationary effectsof the present proposals could not be set aside.    It was also suggestedthat a full 7j per cent devaluation now would leave little scope for4CONFIDENTIAL67
CONFIDENTIALfurther Green Pound devaluations in later years to compensate farmersfor rising costs, especially if the pound remained etrcng.    We shouldkeep some leeway in hana for next year, lest we found that the need tosatisfy our own farmers then would conflict with our desire to maintaina freeze on CAP prices for products in surplus.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that an immediate l\ per cent devaluationwould be excessive in relation to the needs of farmers on the one handand its effect on the housewife on the other.    We should therefore go fora Green Pound devaluation of not more than 5 per cent.    The Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food was also authorised to make a bid for anadditional 5 per cent devaluation for pigmeat.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of this part of their discussion and invitedthe Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to beguided accordingly.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C(79) 16) making recommendations about theproposals for Select Committees, set out in the First Report from theSelect Committee on Procedure (th&amp; Procedure Committee) for Session1977.78, and on the handling of the debate which was to take place in theHouse of Commons on Monday 2 5 June.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that therehad been a long-standing demand for more effective Parliamentaryscrutiny of Government.    Undertakings had been given in the Manifestoand in The Queen&apos;s Speech to provide an opportunity for the House ofCommons to come to a decision on the Procedure Committee&apos;sproposals.    There was widespread support for them in the House, anda Motion calling for an early substantive debate had attracted over 260signatures.    It did not follow that all those Members who had signedthe Motion would, support the proposals themselves, but the greatmajority would do so.    He believed that the proposals on the structureof Select Committees were right in principle:  they would for the firsttime bring the whole area of Government activity within the scope ofSelect Committees;  they were evolutionary in character and were, to alarge extent, a rationalisation of the existing structure which had grownup piecemeal over a number of years.    The proposals that SelectCommittees should have powers to order the attendance of Ministersand the production of papers, and to force a debate on the Floor of theHouse in the event of a refusal, were not acceptable, however. Hetherefore recommended that the Government should agree a structure of12 departmentally-related Select Committees but with a closer restricrtion on the number of investigative sub-committees (four instead ofseven);  and that there should be no change in their powers. SelectCommittees would continue to be able to invite the attendance ofMinisters, and to send for papers which would be provided subject toaccepted restrictions on such matters as national security, the privateaffairs of individuals, negotiations and specific cases where the Ministermight have an appellate or judicial function.    The ProcedureCommittee had themselves proposed a series of Motions for debatecovering the structure and powers of Select Committees.    It would bepreferable, however, for the Government to table their own Motionsgiving effect to their conclusions.    Any departure from the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s proposals would meet some opposition in the House, but ifthe Government responded favourably to the proposals for departmen-tally-related Select Committees, there would be a good chance ofresisting unacceptable amendments on powers.In discussion there was general support for the view that the Govern-ment should accept the principle of departmentally-related SelectCommittees, although the extra work which they would involve forMinisters and senior officials would be considerable and should beemphasised in the debate.    There were arguments for grouping some6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDepartments together.    On the other hand, there would be a clearer-cut relationship between Committees and Ministers if Committees dealtwith a single Minister and Department.    Moreover, the Governmentsposition in the debate would be stronger if it accepted the full proposalof 12 Committees.    The Procedure Committee themselves had proposedto group the Departments of Industry and Employment together;  this wasthe wrong combination and it would be better to link Industry and Tradeunder one Select Committee, and to have a separate Select Committeefor Employment.    Proposals for Select Committees for Scotland andWales should not be included in the Motions for debate on the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s report, but should be pursued separately as appropriate.Special considerations applied to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department andthe Law Officers&apos; Department.    It was essential to preserve theconstitutional independence of the judiciary and to protect from scrutinyby Select Committees such matters as judicial appointments, the LordChancellor&apos;s confidential comnntnications with the judiciary, and theexercise of the Law Officers&apos; discretion in the prosecution of criminalcases.    It would be preferable for the two Departments to be excludedcompletely from the Orders of Reference of the Select Committee onHome Affairs.    Members of Select Committees should be nominated ona Motion tabled by the Committee of Selection, as recommended by theProcedure Committee;  the Committee of Selection had now beenappointed for the Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the Procedure Committee&apos;s proposal for 12departmentally-related Select Committees, but with a single Committeecovering the Department of Industry and the Department of Trade and aseparate Committee for the Department of Employment.    The Orders ofReference of the Committee on Home Affairs should exclude the LordChancellor&apos;s Department and the Law Officers&apos; Department.    The SelectCommittee on the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administrationshould be retained.    The Committees&apos; powers to appoint investigativesub-committees should be restricted as proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster.    There should be no change in SelectCommittees1 powers relating to the attendance of Ministers and theproduction of papers, and any attempt to give the Select Committees newpowers should be resisted.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould arrange for a Motion to be tabled in the light of these conclusions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to proceedaccordingly. 1i!7CONFIDENTIAL70
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda (C(79) 17 and 18)by the Secretary of State for the Home Department about theLegislative Programme 1979-80.THE HOME SECRETARY said that The Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee had aimed to construct a programme meetingthe Governments main political objectives without over-burdeningParliament.    The suggested programme contained 43 main Bills anda total of nearly 70 Bills when Contingent, Scottish and SecondReading Committee Bills were added.    It included all the Bills thathad been promised in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    There were a consider?-able number of highly controversial Bills.    The Government couldexpect every form of delaying tactic on the part of the Opposition,and it might be necessary to use the guillotine more than in anyprevious Session.    From that point of view, the programmerepresented a heavy load and it might be necessary to considerdropping some Bills as the Session proceeded.In discussion, there was general agreement that no more Bills shouldbe added to the Programme.    Concern was expressed about thenumber of Bills which would require to be guillotined in the Commons,for which no comparable procedure was available in the Lords. Toachieve Royal Assent by the end of July controversial Bills wouldhave to reach the House of Lords no later than the end of May. Thepossibility of merging the Industrial Relations and EmploymentProtection Acts (Amendment) Bills would be explored.    The OffshoreInstallations Bill could be dropped.    Legislation on the Disposal ofPublic Assets would require early introduction to enable sales to bemade in the current financial year.    Proposals were made for thesubstitution of the long Companies No, 2 Bill by three short TradeBills, some of which could be introduced in the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the size of the Legislative Programme forthe coming Session must not be increased.    Subject to that condition,the Home Secretary might consider with the Secretary of State forTrade whether any variation in the Trade Bills could be authorised.The Telecommunications Authority Bill should be deferred until thenext Session.    It was essential that policy clearance should beobtained and the drafting of Bills in the programme begin as soon aspossible, with a view to introducing Bills for early Second Readingwhen Parliament reassembled in the autumn.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that theCabinet had agreed on 17 May that economies of at let^st 3 per centshould be secured in the present financial year on wage related itemsin central Government expenditure, and that, if any Minister foundit impossible to achieve this it was open to him to suggestalternative ways of securing equivalent savings.    In the light ofthis decision the Government had publicly committed itself to areduction of 3 per cent in the Cash Limits for staff-related costsin the Civil Service.    The time had now come to publish theselimits in detail.    Exemptions already agreed, eg. for the prisonservice, would reduce the overall average saving to 2.8 per cent.The Department of Health and Social Security had suggested thatinstead of reducing staff in its local offices it should redeploy them tofraud prevention duties which it was thought would yield substantiallybigger savings than the staff costs involved.    The Department ofEmployment would wish to follow suit if the Department of Healthand Social Security was allowed to follow this course and otherDepartments eg. Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise might beable to make similar claims.    To allow the Departments of Healthand Social Security and Employment to proceed in this way wouldbring the total saving on staff costs down to 2. 4 per cent, very closeto the previous Governments target of &apos;at least 2 per cent1. TheGovernment would look very foolish if, having promised a 3 per centreduction in staff costs, it fell seriously short of this target.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that, ashe had previously indicated to the Cabinet, he could secure more thanequivalent savings if he were allowed to increase the staff engaged inthe prevention of fraud.    This would both help to honour a Manifestocommitment and would yield even larger savings in subsequent years.In addition, there would be great difficulty in applying a 3 per centcut to the staff of local offices without danger to the punctual paymentof benefits.    The Governments objective should be to secure largenet savings in public expenditure, rather than to pursue economies inmanpower for their own sake.In discussion, it was argued that, important though fraud preventionwork was, to allow a full offset in the Department of Health andSocial Security would inevitably lead staffs in other Departments toseek comparable treatment.    Some staffs might even be tempted totake industrial action to secure this.    Moreover the work of the staffengaged in fraud prevention in the Department of Employment wa3closely linked to that of their counterparts in the Department ofHealth and Social Security and it was difficult to draw meaningfuldistinctions between them.    Against this, it was argued that theGovernment was committed, not only to savings in public expenditure,but to large reductions in the size of the Civil Service.    Its credibilitywould be put at risk if it fell seriously short of the announced3 per cent cut.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was important to come as close as possibleto the 3 per cent target ior reductions in staff-related costs in1979-80.    The Lord President of the Council, in consultation withthe Secretaries of State for Social Services and for Employment,and with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should therefore agree andpublish cash limits for the Department of Health and Social Securityand for the Department of Employment which would come as closeas possible to the required target.    The Cabinet&apos;s decision impliedno weakening in their resolve to act vigorously against fraud. Thisremained a major commitment to be pursued as resources permitted.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister, andinvited the Ministers concerned to be guidedaccordingly.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL8- THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that &apos;before the General Election the Shadow Cabinet had decided not to support afurther review and had informed the Labour Government of this.    In hisview that decision should now be confirmed as there was nothing useful to begained by a further Parliamentary inquiry and a good deal to be lost.Some African Governments would be critical and it would be better todefer any announcement until Lord Harlech, the Governments specialrepresentative in Africa, had left Nigeria.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said theCabinet would clearly prefer there to be no further inquiry. TheDirector of Public Prosecutions had, however, still to reach hisdecisions on whether any prosecutions should follow from his examina-tion of the Bingham Report.    An early announcement of a decision not tohold a further inquiry might therefore be criticised as showing unduefavouritism to fellow politicians, albeit of a different political Party,when relatively minor figures in the oil companies were still at risk.Moreover, the impact of an announcement on African opinion wasimportant and could affect the timing of any announcement. Thisfactor could be better judged when Lord Harlech had returned fromLagos and reported.    The Cabinet preferred therefore to defer finaldecisions until Lord Harlech&apos;s report was to hand.    In the meantimeany questions should be answered by saying that no decision had yetbeen made.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office14 June 197911CONFIDENTIAL
