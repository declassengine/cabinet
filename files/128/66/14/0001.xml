CONFIDENTIALI, The Cabinet&apos;s discussion a-id the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat invitations to the Constitutional Conference due to open inLondon on 10 September had been accepted by bothBishop Muzorewa and the Patriotic Front, although the latter hadrejected our constitutional outline.    Each side would be allowed adelegation of 12 members of its own choosing.    We were in touchwith President Nyerere of Tanzania and President Kaunda of3th Zambia, who were continuing to play a helpful role and agreed withons our policy of settling the constitution before considering theproblems of transition.    We were lobbying them and othersattending next week&apos;s Havana Conference of the Non-AlignedMovement against any action there which might undermine theagreement reached at the Commonwealth Heads of GovernmentMeeting in Lusaka.    Our emissary to the South African Governmenthad found them critical of our policy but not disposed to try towreck the Constitutional Conference.    The United States Governmentwas giving us full support.THE PRIME MINISTER, dimming up a short discussion, said thatwhile the chances of reaching agreement all round at theConstitutional Conference were not good we should be well placedto convince moderate international opinion that any breakdown wasthe fault of our opponents.    The decision to include Mr Ian Smithin Bishop Muzorewa&apos;s delegation had been a matter for the Bishopbut might not be altogether unwelcome to the Patriotic Front.Reactions to the Lusaka agreement among the Government1 ssupporters had not been unsatisfactory;  but steps should be takenby the Chief Whip to discourage potentially damaging contactsduting the London Conference between backbench Members ofParliament and members of Bishop Muzorewa&apos;s team.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had been surprised by thestatement attributed to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,Department of the Environment on 29 August about the possibilitythat the proposed South African rugby tour should be cancelled ongrounds connected with the Moscow Olympics.    It was extremelyimportant, in this as in all other contexts, for the PaymasterGeneral and herself to be informed in advance of Ministerialstatements liable to cause public controversy.    This was clearlylaid down in paragraph 95 of the memorandum on Procedure whichshe had circulated on 24 May (C(P)(79) 1).1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the problem ofovercrowding at Heathrow was becoming acute.    He would bebringing the question of a third London airport before Cabinet inthe autumn.    But it was meanwhile essential to take steps torelieve congestion by transferring certain services from Heathrowto Gatwick, as he had warned members of the Defence and OverseaPolicy Committee in a letter of 26 July.    He had now concludedwith regret that there was no acceptable alternative to sotransferring most services between London and Canada andbetween London and Spain and Portugal.    He would therefore soonbe announcing the start of the required process of due enquiry intothis proposal; the actual transfers would not take place until1980-81.    There would be a very hostile reaction from theCanadians, Spaniards and Portuguese, even though there was to beno discrimination between their airlines and the equivalent BritishAirways services.    He was satisfied that they could not legallycompel us to hold a public enquiry.    But they might well retaliateagainst British airlines.    It would also be necessary to refusepermission for any new airlines to use Heathrow.    This wascausing problems with the Chinese, who might raise the matterduring Prime Minister Hua&apos;s visit later in the year.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidour information suggested that the early drafts of the Commissionsreference paper on the financial imbalances within the Communitywould confirm that the United Kingdom would be by far the largestnet contributor to the Community Budget.    While its treatment ofmonetary compensatory amounts and certain forms of expenditurewas not entirely satisfactory, it was probably as favourable adocument from our point of view as could be expected.    It wasstill subject to discussion by the Commission.He further reported that the Minister of Transport had recentlywritten to colleagues about the results of his consultations on theimplementation of the European Economic Community regulationon the use of tachographs in commercial vehicles.    This would beunpopular but the judgment of the European Court left us with nochoice.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theway of implementation needed careful consideration and he wouldwish to have further discussions with the Minister of Transportand, if necessary, in the relevant Ministerial Committee.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that she was anxious that thereview of the future of Quangos should continue to be pressed aheadvigorously.    A lot of groundwork had been done but the momentumneeded to be maintained.    She had now appointed Sir Leo Pliatzkyto assist in carrying out the next stage of the review.    The intentionwas that, after a short period during which the collection of basicfacts was completed, he would choose the most promisingcandidates for detailed examination and report.    He would alsobe concerned with the future arrangements for ensuring the properaccountability of Quangos which might have to differ between typesof body.    All Ministers should ensure that Sir Leo Pliatskyreceived from their Departments the maximum degree ofco-operation in this work and that opportunities for reducingQuangos were taken wherever possible.    In any cases whereMinisters were already planning to abolish Quangos they should notdefer action while the review was in progress.    The aim of theexercise was not simply to reduce the number of Quangos but totackle the big spenders with a view to reducing staffs and total costs.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL173
CONFIDENTIALRATES&apos;     5.        THE HOME SECRETARY said that a settlement had beenSTAFF     reached in respect of the pay of the staff of Magistrates&apos; Courtsoutside Inner London but that within London the Court staff wererefusing to settle, claiming that their pay should be linked to thatof the Civil Service.    They had now begun industrial action insupport of this claim.    The Courts were managing to deal withpriority cases, but if the dispute continued a backlog wouldinevitably buildup.    There could also be increasing difficultyin other areas of the work of the Courts like the payment ofmaintenance allowances.    Nevertheless he could see no basis fortreating the Inner London staff on a different footing from thoseoutside London, and no option for the Government but to stand firm.He would keep colleagues informed of developments.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET6.        THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatnegotiations had been in progress with the industrial Civil Service&apos;cE pay       unions, on the basis agreed by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs. Theunions had accepted the size of the proposed increases, but wereunwilling to accept the proposed staging of their implementation,which had been chosen to be no more favourable than that givenearlier in the year to the non-industrial Civil Service. Anydeparture from that position could be repercussive for other groupse. g. teachers, as well as for the non-industrial Civil Service and hesaw no alternative but to stand firm.    Industrial action was nowthreatened and would no doubt be planned to exert as much pressureas possible on sensitive areas, such as the Defence programme.In discussion it was argued that the threatened industrial actionwould be damaging to the defence programme and that someflexibility in negotiations could be justified on this score. Morewidely it was argued that in these, as in other public sectornegotiations, the existence of a single national negotiationcould make it particularly difficult to reach an appropriatesettlement.    Local management had no part in the negotiations,nor any real incentive to communicate with their staff on therealities of wage bargaining.    Private industry was moving awayfrom the concept of centralised negotiation, to a more localapproach.    The Government, too, should consider whether greateruse of local negotiations might offer advantages in its own staffmanagement activities and in other public service areas, Hke theLondon magistrates courts, where it had statutory or financialresponsibilities.    The aim should be for the Government to confineits role, wherever possible, to the setting of a suitable frameworkwithin which individual managers could take their decisions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCaoinet were agreed that the Civil Service Department should stickto its guns in the negotiations on the pay of industrial civil servants.The discussion had however also raised wide ranging issues aboutnegotiating machinery in the public services and related questionsof cash limits.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council and other Ministers asappropriate should arrange for these to be considered by officialsof Departments concerned and should then submit a paper forconsideration by colleagues discussing the desirability of changesin the existing systems for settling the pay of suitable public sectorgroups, in the light of the Government&apos;s evolving policies for cashlimits.5SECRET175
SECRETThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Lord President of the Council to beguided accordingly.SECRET6
CONFIDENTIAL7.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thateconomic prospects were depressing both world wide   and alsoon a national level.    There were however some encouraging signsthat the Government&apos;s monetary policies were beginning to takeeffect.    It would be very important that all Ministers should helpto reinforce the message that pay settlements must be earned, andwere not for example an entitlement because prices had risen.He would himself be stressing in forthcoming speeches that theaction of some trade unions were destroying the jobs of theirmembers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that &quot;specific examples were particularly valuable in helping to get themessage across to the public, and wherever Ministers were awareof cases where jobs were being lost as a result of excessive paydemands, or of union intransigence, they should circulateinformation to colleagues, so that this could be used in Ministerialspeeches.The Cabinet -Took note of the summing up of their discussionby the Prime Minister, and invited all Ministersto be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office30 August 19797CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT17COPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 14th Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 30 August 1979 at 10. 30 amN The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Defence(C(79) 34) on Northern Ireland security.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe Government&apos;s aim was the defeat of terrorism and the extensionof normal policing.    The events of 27 August, involving the deathof 18 soldiers and the assassination of Lord Mountbatten, had ledthe Secretary of State for Defence and himself to bring forwardproposals for immediate action on two questions which had beenconcerning them since taking office.    These were how to improvethe direction and co-ordination of our security operations in theProvince;  and how to obtain more co-operation in security mattersfrom the Irish Republic.    On the first question their agreedproposal was for a new high-level Security Directorate in NorthernIreland.    This would be responsible to himself; would operate ona 24-hour basis; and would be designed to reconcile differenceswhich inevitably arose between the viewpoints and methods of theRoyal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and the Army.    RUC morale,manpower and effectiveness had been transformed since they hadregained primary responsibility for the prevention and detectionof all crime.    This was an important development which shouldnot be jeopardised since greater RUC strength offered the besthope of achieving the desired reduction of Army involvement in thesecurity field.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the paperwas based on agreement about the need to improve co-ordinationbetween the RUC and the Army; and about the key role of the headof the new Directorate.    The latter should be a man of seniorityand stature who was not a serving soldier nor a civil servant fromthe Northern Ireland Office.1SECRET
SECRETTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere was a mood of shame in the Republic following theMountbatten murders.    It was therefore a good moment for thePrime Minister to make a determined effort in talks with theIrish Prime Minister, Mr Lynch (who was much less unsympatheticto us than his likely successor), to bring home the importance ofco-operation in security matters.    A full list of ourrequirements in this area should be prepared and put tohim.    But the resources available to him were limited and weshould not be too optimistic about his likely response.    If it wasinadequate we should not hesitate to reveal publicly what we hadasked for.In discussion there was general agreement that our most importantneed was to seek greater co-operation from the Irish Governmentand to publicise the fact that we were doing so.    The two maindifficulties facing our security forces were the existence of safehavens in the Republic and the lack of intelligence from south ofthe border.    If the Irish Government proved unwilling to co-operate,we would need to consider such means as we had of bringingpressure to bear on them.    British public opinion might not beaverse to using pressure.    But it would be right first to try topersuade Mr Lynch of our common interest in defeating terrorism.As regards the proposed Security Directorate, some doubt was feltabout the danger of appointing too eminent a man to head it andgiving the matter too much publicity.    The Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland&apos;s position might appear to be undermined; publicopinion might regard organisational changes as an inadequateresponse to the present crisis;  and credit might be lost if the newsystem failed to produce measurable results.    The basic troubleseemed to be a difference in diagnosis between the Chief Constableand the RUC, who felt the situation to be slowly improving, and theGeneral Officer Commanding (GOC) and the Army who were lesssanguine;  and it would be difficult for the head of the Directorateto bridge this gap.    Against that it was urged that the newDirectorate, if properly presented with stress on its round-the-clock role, could serve to show that the Government were activelyseeking to improve the security effort rather than passivelyawaiting the next tragedy.In further discussion it was noted that the quality of the Army&apos;sleadership might be somewhat better than the RUCs; thatextensive further recruiting for the RUC might be no easier thanpolice recruiting in Britain;  but that in the Chief Constable&apos;s viewan adequately enlarged RUC could in time relieve the Army ofalmost all its security duties.    If however it proved impossibleto bring terrorism under control within the framework of theexisting legal system, it might in the end be necessary to modify2SECRET
SECRETthe system and perhaps even move towards the introduction ofmartial law in areas of particular terrorist activity. Thegrowing professionalism of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) andthe high level of casualties in the security forces were new factorsfor which radical counter-action might well be required.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that she should invite Mr Lynch for talks in Londonat the time of Lord Mountbatten&apos;s funeral.    She would arrange forthe invitation to be issued and announced forthwith.    The Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland and the Secretary of State for Defenceshould prepare a list of requirements to be put to him, whichwould be made public if he failed to respond.    The Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation with other Ministersas appropriate, should take all possible steps to ensure that throughthe media we maintained maximum psychological pressure on theIrish Government.    The Secretary of State for Northern Irelandshould arrange for an immediate announcement to be made aboutextra recruitment for the RUC.    The establishment of the newSecurity Directorate was agreed.    But a decision on how far topublicise it should not be taken until we knew who its head wouldbe.    This would be decided by the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland and the Secretary of State for Defence in consultation withherself.    Meanwhile the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandshould bring forward early proposals for a political initiative toincrease democratic participation in the processes of governmentin the Province; and he and the Secretary of State for Defenceshould, in consultation with the Law Officers, arrange for areview of the &quot;Yellow Card&quot; restrictions on the use of firearmsby members of the security forces.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussions and invitedthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland and theSecretary of State for Defence to be guidedaccordingly.Cabinet Office30 August 19793SECRET180
