CONFIDENTIALentarytheCommons1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.       It was notedthat the business might need to be revised if, following the statementto be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that afternoon, theOpposition requested an economic debate.    It would be difficult notto concede such a request, but it might be preferable to postpone adebate until the week beginning 26 November.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Patriotic Front had earlier that morning agreed to theBritish proposals for the transition to independence.    He wouldcirculate to the Cabinet details of the arrangements proposed,which had not been significantly modified since being tabled. TheBritish delegation was now circulating proposals for the cease-firearrangements;  negotiations on these might prove the most difficultof all.    It would have been unfortunate if, as had seemed possible;the Conference had broken down immediately after the passing of theEnabling Bill;  but in the event the Bill seemed to have had the effectof awakening the Front&apos;s leaders to the dangers of not reaching anagreed settlement.    No serious difficulties had yet arisen at theUnited Nations, where Britain&apos;s European allies had offeredwelcome support.The Cabinet -1.       Took note of and congratulated the PrimeMinister, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryand the Lord Privy Seal on the considerable progressmade towards a settlement of the Rhodesian problem.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETAR.Y said that,following the freeze on Iranian deposits in the United States,difficulties might arise if the United States Government sought torestrict or deny the Iranian authorities access to their depositswith American banks in London, which the United States Governmenti regarded as subject to American jurisdiction.    This could lead toIranian retaliation against British interests.    Urgent consnitation.would be needed with other European Economic CommunityGovernments facing a similar problem.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he was in touchwith the United States Secretary of the Treasury, Mr William Miller,The Americans were anxious for British support, but the questionwhether deposits in United States banks in London were subject tothe extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States was one whichcould be resolved only by the British courts;  the answer would1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpossibly depend on the terms upon which each deposit was made andaccepted;,    The Government did not have the power to preventBritish courts ordering United States banks in London to releasedepositors1 assets, and any move to take new powers in the mattermight have serious repercussions for the Euro-currency marketand for London&apos;s position as a financial centre.    The United StatesGovernments action could indeed have considerable implicatiors forthe role of the dollar as a reserve currency.In the course of a brief discussion it was recognised that theSecretary of State for Trade and the Attorney General would needto be ready to deal with questions on this subject which might beraised in Parliament during the current Second Reading of theProtection of Trading Interests Bill.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.ITY 3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, in the event, little progress had been made at the Councilof Ministers (Agriculture) on 12-13 November.    The Italians hadf not been ready to settle the wine package.    The French had note: removed their illegal restrictions on imports of sheepmeat but theyOth had shown concern about their position and, after further consultationons, with the Commission, it was likely that they would announce theirintention to respect the ruling of the European Court within the nextfew days.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, while wewere continuing to receive oil from Iran, the American embargo onIranian oil imports would affect 2.4 per cent of their requirementsof crude oil.    The United States was now preparing a new set ofproposals for demand restraint which they would present to ameeting of the International Energy Agency early in December andthis might well reopen the commitments which the EuropeanEconomic Community had entered into,THE PRIME MINISTER said she would be meeting the Presidentof the French Republic on 19 and 20 November.    Serious differencesstill remained between the French and ourselves over the UnitedKingdom&apos;s net contribution to the Community Budget; thesedifferences would not necessarily be entirely resolved during thecourse of the visit.    President Giscard had agreed to a joint FressConference at the end of the visit.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL273
SECRETNOMIC      4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Chancellor of thejj Exchequer would be making an announcement about monetary policyin the House of Commons that afternoon.    There had been muchPress speculatian about this.    The measures which the Chancellorof the Exchequer would announce were severe, but were essentialfor the maintenance of long-term confidence in the Governmentseconomic policies.    He needed the wholehearted support and helpof all Ministers in reassuring the Governments supporters inParliamentsTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the measureswhich he would announce that afternoon had been made inevitableby a series of unexpected developments.    The money supply figuresfor the previous month had been extremely disappointing.    The publicsector borrowing requirement (PSBR.), which was always higher inthe first half of the year than in the second, was now seriously outof line, and without corrective action was likely to exceed  9 billionin the year as a whole.    This was partly the result of industrialaction earlier in the year by Customs and Excise staff which haddelayed the receipt of Value Added Tax (VAT) and partly the resultof action by Post Office staff which had delayed the payment oftelephone bills to the extent of about  1 billion.    Other factors,including increased expenditure, had contributed to the deterioration.To fund borrowing on this scale required a high level of marketconfidence.    This had been shaken by a number of developments,including the poor money supply figures, and the poor trade figuresannounced the previous day.    The Retail Price Index to be announcedlater in the week would not help.    It was essential now to take strongmeasures to restore control over money supply, and this required asteep increase in the Bank of England Minimum Lending Rate (MLR).Market rates had already risen above 16 per cent, and theGovernment could not risk undershooting, if it was to be able to sellGovernment stock on the scale which would be necessary in the comingweeks.    He had therefore agreed with the Governor of the Bank ofEngland that MLR should be increased that day to 17 per cent. Hewould announce the same afternoon a package of supporting measures,including changes in National Savings, the rolling forward of thepresent monetary targets for a further six months to October 1980,and an extension of the existing controls on bank lending (the &quot;Corset&quot;)for a further six months.    He would also say that the Government wasconsidering the possibility of moving to a system of monetary basecontrol to replace the existing system.    He had considered whetherthere was any fiscal alternative to these tough monetary measures.It was too late to affect significantly the level of public expenditure inthe current year.    He had ruled out any changes in VAT or on otherindirect taxes because of their effect on the Retail Price Index andthus on wage demands.    The one fiscal measure open to him was tobring forward payments of Petroleum R.evenue Tax (PRT) by twomonths, yielding about  700 million extra in the current financial year,with a further  300 million in the following year.    This change wouldrequire legislation.    The combined effects of these measures shouldbe to allow the Government to fund the PSBR and restrain the growthin money supply,3SECRET o n 4
SECRETIn discussion, there was general support for the Chancellor of theExchequers proposals,    It was recognised that movements ininterest rates both at home and overseas, and the recent increasein the money supply, rendered these inevitable.    In presenting themeasures, it would be necessary to place them in the wider contextof rising world interest rates which in turn were, at least partly,a response to the inflationary pressures generated by movements inworld oil price So    It would also be important to emphasise the partplayed by industrial action earlier in the year in the temporaryincrease in the Governments borrowing requirement.In further discussion, it was suggested that these measures would notbring home to the British public the seriousness of the situation,,Many individuals would not feel a direct or immediate effect, althoughincreases in mortgage rates might ensue in due course. Meanwhile,consumer spending remained high, helped by the spread of creditcard facilities and the availability of bank loansc Consumerspending did not respond rapidly to increases in interest rates.There was a case for fiscal action which would bring the messagehome, although it was recognised that anything which increased thegeneral level of prices would have some damaging effect on wageclaims.    However, the measures would hit the company sectorrapidly and hard0    It would be especially serious for small firms.Company liquidity would be greatly reduced.    This might have someeffect in encouraging some companies to resist excessive wage claimsthough others might prefer to settle quickly and leave their financingproblems to be solved later.    In any event a sharp increase inbaJftkruptcies and redundancies must be expected next year. Thismade it the more important that the Government should have positivemeasures available to increase investment in wealth-creatingactivities.    Against this it was argued that industry had already beenrelieved of many burdens since the Government took office, and thescope for expenditure on additional incentives to industry was severelylimited.    They could be afforded only if further reductions were madein planned levels of expenditure, part of the benefit of which could goto reduce the PSBR and part to the creation of additional incentives.In the longer term, there was a case for re-examining the overalllevel of public expenditure once again, particularly the most rapidlygrowing programmes like social security which had hitherto beenregarded as untouchable.La further discussion, it was noted that the proposed increases inPRT would need careful presentation, and should if possible beexplained to the oil companies in advance.4SECRET
SECRETIn discussion of presentation, it was agreed that a balance must bestruck between explaining the seriousness of the situation, andavoiding excessive gloom and thus undermining confidence in theGovernments ability and determination to succeed with itseconomic strategy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet completely supported the measures which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would announce that afternoon.    The Governmentseectmnic  strategy would take some time to work through, and it wasimportant meanwhile jhat Ministers should do all that they could tomaintain confidence in the longer term prospects.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minis ter&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 November 19795SECRET276
