CONFIDENTIALIVERNMENTIJINESS1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since this was the firstformal Cabinet meeting of the new Administration, it would beappropriate to take note of and record the conclusions reached at aninformal meeting of Cabinet Ministers 0.1 8 May.The Prime Minister then summed up a brief discussion on thesepoints as follows:a. Police pay.    The rates of pay recommended by theEdmund-Davies Committee for implementation on1 November 1979 would be paid in full from 1 May. Thisdecision had been communicated to the Police Federations,and had been announced the previous day.    The Governmentwould pay its usual proportion of the additional cost to thelocal authorities through specific grants and the Rate SupportGrant.    This should not be regarded as a precedent for anyother groupa.b. Armed Forces pay.    The full military salaryrecommended in the eighth report of the Armed Forces PayRevievBody should be paid in full from 1 April 1979.    The Cabinetrecognised that this might mean a brief period of overlapbetween the rates for Brigadiers and the rates for MajorGenerals.    This was inevitable until a decision had been takenon the report of the Top Salaries Review Body.    The positionon Service doctors and dentists was unclear:  and she wouldresolve it in discussion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, immediately after the Cabinet meeting.The cash limit for the Defence Budget in 1979-80 would beincreased to allow for the cost of the new military salary.The Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for Defence wouldbring forward separately additional proposals for various minorimprovements in Service benefits, including a bounty formembers of the Territorial Army Volunteer Reserve.c. Devolution.    The Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would bring forwarda paper on Devolution for consideration by the Home AffairsCommittee at an early stage.d. Reduction in Government circulars.    The Cabinet setitself a target of reducing the issue of Government circularsto local authorities (both local government and healthauthorities) by two-thirds.    All such circulars should containan estimate of the cost in manpower and in money. Circularsaffecting local government should be cleared in advance withCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Department of the Environment and the estimates of costshould be agreed with the Treasury.    Any circulars affectingScotland or Wales should also be cleared with the Scottishand Welsh Offices as appropriate.    She had arranged for theHead of the Civil Service to monitor progress and to let herhave an initial report in four weeks&apos; time.e. Controls over local government.    The Secretary ofSte-te for the Environment, in consultation with the Secretariesof State for Scotland, Wales, Social Services, and Educationand Science, and the Minister of Transport, should carry outan early review of statutory controls by central Governmentover local government, with a view to early legislative actionto reduce them.f. Freeze on Civil Service manpower.    There would bean immediate freeze on recruitment to the Civil Service for aperiod.    The Cabinet recognised that there would have to becertain exceptions from the freeze in specific areas, with theapproval of the Departmental Ministers concerned. Duringthis period, Ministers would undertake an urgent examinationof functions to secure reductions in Civil Service manpower.The Lord President of the Council would bring forward to theCabinet urgently proposals to this end.g. Comparability Commission.    The Cabinet would needto consider urgently the future role of the Standing Commissionon Comparability established by the previous Government.She would arrange for a paper to be prepared as backgroundto this discussion.h. Price Commission.    The Secretary of State for Tradewould bring forward a paper about the future of the PriceCommission to the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy the following week.i. Pay negotiations - nationalised industries. ResponsibleMinister s should stand back so far as possible from paynegotiations, and should take responsibility for giving guidanceto the nationalised boards concerned in bilateral consultationwith colleagues most closely concerned.j. Reduction of waste.    In addition to the freeze on CivilService manpower and the reduction of circulars alreadymentioned, all Ministers in charge of Departments shouldmake it their personal responsibility to pursue the promotionof efficiency and the elimination of waste in their Departmentand through the reduction of qua si-autonomous non-governmental2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALorganisations for which they were responsible. Thiscampaign would be assisted by the appointment ofSir Derek Rayner to advise her on these matters. AllMinisters in charge of Departments should send her progressreports by 7 June recording the action taken up to that pointand proposals formulated for achieving economies.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of this summing up of theirdiscussion by the Prime Minister, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatearly decisions would be required on Rhodesia, and he would becirculating a paper for early consideration by the Defence andOversea Policy Committee.    He would te seeing his Communitycolleagues at an informal meeting in France during the comingweekend, and the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, on21 and 22 May.    Lord Boyd1 s report on the elections in Rhodesiashould be available on 16 May and there would be a need for a debatein Parliament.    The Government1 s objective, as set out in theManifesto, was not in doubt:  but we should aim to achieve it with theminimum damage to our other interests.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Namibia had taken a turn for the worse.    The SouthAfrican Government had rejected the United Nations1 proposal forsupervised elections, but the door was not entirely closed and ouraim should be to try to keep negotiations going.    The Governmentwere committed not to accept economic sanctions against South Africa,but we should do all we could to avoid getting into a position where wehad to veto alone.    We were in close touch with the other membersof the five member Contact Group about the handling of this problem.The Cabinet -Took note.UNITY 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidit was likely that the European Economic Community (EEC) wouldbe moderately quiescent until after the elections in Italy on 3 Juneand the direct elections to the European Parliament on 7-10 June.His forthcoming meeting with the other EEC Foreign Ministers wouldenable him to explain the Government1 s general approach to theCommunity.In a brief discussion the following points were made -a. The visit of Chancellor Schmidt would be used tounderline the Government1 s European commitment but tostress that if we were to carry public opinion on this weshould need German help over our legitimate interests onfisheries, the Community Budget and the CommonAgricultural Policy.4CONFIDENTIAL12
CONFIDENTIALb. An informal meeting of Agriculture Ministers early-next week would allow the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food to sound out the attitude of his colleagues towardsthe forthcoming negotiations on agricultural prices. Theactivities of his predecessor had created a disposition to lineup against the United Kingdom.c. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would be developingthe British case on the Community Budget at the Council ofMinisters (Finance) on 14 May.d. During the Election campaign the Government hadcommitted itself firmly to securing a satisfactory settlementon the Common Fisheries Policy and this had helped to winseveral seats in Scotland.    The way in which the originalmembers of the Community had rushed through the CommonFisheries Policy before our accession had been disgraceful,as our Community partners now recognised.    The Minister ofAgriculture and his Minister of State would be sounding outopinion within the Community and were hopeful that a sensiblesolution could be speedily found.    While they had not admittedas much in public, the Scottish fishery industry recognisedthat an exclusive 50-mile zone was not negotiable. Moreover,it was pointed out that the port of Lowestoft took 80 per centof its catch within 50 miles of other countries1 coastlines.On the other hand it was essential for us to have exclusivecontrol over what happened within 50 miles of the United Kingdomcoast.    The Government needel to settle this vital issuebefore the accession of Spain to the Community.The Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL13
CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(79) 1), to which was attached a draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft had been prepared byThe Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) andwas based on the assumption that the Session would continue untilthe autumn of 1980.    It was intended to be an action-oriented Speechconcentradng on what the Government would do, as distinct frommaking general statements of aspirations.    Departmental Ministershad made a number of suggestions; QL had done their best to meetthem, but it was important to avoid giving any unnecessary financialcommitments and to keep the length of the Speech within acceptablelimits.    The references to overseas aid, to the Price Commissionand to Scotland and Wales raised matters requiring furtherconsideration.In discussion, it was suggested that mention should be made of theStrategic Arms Limitation Talks on which the United StatesGovernment were anxious for our support.    The United Kingdomhad not hcwever been party to the negotiations and many of theGovernment&apos;s supporters in Parliament would be opposed to theoutcome.    On the other hand, to omit all reference might prejudicethe co-operation of the United States with us on certain other matters.It was agreed that a reference to the progress of disarmament shouldbe included, but drafted in suitably general terms.On overseas aid, it was suggested that the sentence should beamended to take account of the changes which were needed in thesize and shape of the programme and to avoid giving the impressionthat expenditure would remain at its present level.    The alternativeof omitting the sentence or of redrafting it in a way suggesting thataid would be limited would cause unnecessary concern in thedeveloping countries.    A reference should therefore be retained butthe sentence should be redrafted to avoid any impression that currentexpenditure levels would necessarily be maintained^.In further discussion it was argued that the reference to legislationon trade unions should be in terms consistent with the completion ofnormal consultations with the interests concerned.    The impressionshould not be given, however, that such discussions would deflectthe Government from introducing legislation that was needed. Thewords &quot;at the earliest opportunity&quot; should accordingly be omitted.It was pointed out that there was no reference to regional aid forindustry.    Although there should be no suggestion that expenditurewould be maintained at a particular level, the Government&apos;scommitment to regional policy, as indicated in the Manifesto andQUEEN&apos;SSCH ONOPENINGPARLIAMENT6CONFIDENTIAL14
CONFIDENTIALduring the Election campaign, should be reflected in. the Speech.Legislation on the Price Commission would be considered at a futuremeeting of Ministers;  the sentence referring to it should thereforebe omitted.    References should be included in The Queen&apos;s Speechto the repeal of both the Scotland Act and the Wales Act, and shouldbe in similar terms.    The reference to changes in House of Commonsprocedure should avoid any suggestion that separate Select Committeesshould be appointed to scrutinise the work of each GovernmentDepartment.    The timing of any debate on procedure would need tobe carefully considered and an early debate should not be promisedin the Speech.A number of drafting amendments were agreed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Speech, subject to the amendmentsagreed and to further consideration by the Ministers concerned ofthe points outstanding from the discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.7CONFIDENTIAL15
CONFIDENTIALLECTIVE 5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that she would be circulatingPONSIBILITY     the usual document giving guidance to Ministers on proceduralmatters.    There were a few points to which she wouxd be drawingthe attention of Ministers specifically.    It was important that theGovernment should work as a team from the very outset.    It wouldbe necessary to maintain the strictest standards of confidence inCabinet and between members of the Cabinet.    The principle ofcollective responsibility must prevail absolutely and should outlastthe office.    As Ministers maintained confidence among themselves,so they had a right to expect the same confidence to extend betweenMinisters and their senior officials.    Whatever were done aboutdeliberate open Government, there must be no unauthorised leakingof confidential information.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.Cabinet Office10 May 1979CONFIDENTIALjlJ
