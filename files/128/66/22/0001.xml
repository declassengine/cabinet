CONFIDENTIALNTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that itt, had been the Government&apos;s intention to introduce the Localn(j Government, Planning and Land Bill in the House of Lords. Thepressure on the Parliamentary timetable in both Houses was suchthat the Bill was unlikely to receive Royal Assent before the end ofthe Session if it had to be introduced in the House of Commons.The Opposition in the House of Commons were arguing that a Billof such importance should be introduced in the Commons and theywere threatening to disrupt Government business generally if thiswere not done.    There was no precedent for introducing a Bill ofthis kind in the House of Lords, but there would be no constitutionalimpropriety in doing so.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Opposition in the House ofLords would welcome the introduction of the Bill in that House andhad indicated that an Opposition attempt to disrupt business in theHouse of Commons must be expected in any event.    It was importantthat the Bill, which was one of the biggest in recent years, shouldbe enacted during the present Session.    Despite the prospect ofcriticism from the Opposition in the House of Commons, theGovernment could not afford to yield to pressure if the result wouldbe to put their legislative programme at serious risk.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Local Government Bill should be introducedin the House of Lords.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summingup of their discussion by the Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she would make a statement in theHouse of Commons on Monday, 26 November, announcing theGovernment&apos;s decision to reintroduce political honours, with anextension of the role of the Political Honours Scrutiny Committee.The Cabinet -2. Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat British proposals for arranging a cease-fire in Rhodesia hadbeen tabled at Lancaster House oh 16 November. Negotiationswere proceeding more slowly than he had hoped.    They had beencomplicated by two developments.    First, serious infiltration fromZambia into Rhodesia by Patriotic Front forces supportingMr Nkomo had provoked military r etaliation by the Rhodesiansinvolving loss of Zambian lives;  Britain was not responsible but wasbeing blamed by President Kaunda of Zambia, who was refusing toreceive messages sent to him by the Prime Minister; meanwhileseveral thousand demonstrators had surrounded the British HighCommission in Lusaka that morning but had now been dispersed bythe local security forces.    Second, the Patriotic Front leaderswere leaving London for a meeting of Front Line States inDar-es-Salaam on 23 November; the purpose of the meeting was notclear, but it might well lead to the introduction into the cease-firenegotiations of new demands, which could well delay the completionof an agreement.    Even if cease-fire arrangements were agreed,there was no certainty that they would actually bring all guerrillaactivity to an end; and if it continued the Rhodesian security forceswould be bound to respond to it.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatIslamic extremists in Pakistan had destroyed the United StatesEmbassy in Islamabad and the British Council premises inRawalpindi.    Although President Zia of Pakistan had been able torestore order, it seemed clear that the influence of Islamicextremism was spreading from Iran.    The seizure of the Great Mosquein Mecca, however, appeared to be an isolated event, without specialportent for the future, which was now beingdealt with by the SaudiArabian authorities.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the latest meeting in theseries of Anglo-French consultations had been held in London on19 and 20 November.    Although the atmosphere of the talks had beengood, she had not found President Giscard d&apos;Estaing co-operative overthe problem of the British contribution to the Community Budget.She had left him in no doubt that a partial solution at the DublinEuropean Council would not do.    President Giscard had sought toargue that we should abide by the rules in spite of the Frenchbehaviour over sheepmeat.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion the longer term value of these consultationswas stressed.    Whatever the differences over current issues, itwas important to build up the Anglo-French relationship, at officialas well as Ministerial level.    The closeness of Franco-Germanrelations had been achieved in this way.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,earlier in the week the European Economic Community (EEC)Foreign Ministers had been able to agree on a joint statementabout the situation in Iran which, although it had not achieved muchpublicity, had represented a firm expression of concern about thesituation and had been much appreciated by the United StatesGovernment.    EEC Ministers had also agreed a helpful statementabout Rhodesia which had in effect endorsed the British proposalsfor a cease-fire.    They had also agreed to a meeting with the ArabLeague in Tunisia with a view to restarting the Euro-Arab Dialogueand had given qualified support to the idea of a EuropeanDisarmament Conference.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the Commission had made proposals for deaHng with the milkand sugar surpluses in the EEC which did not take a helpful formfrom our point of view since they were likely to reduce our self-sufficiency in dairy products and cut United Kingdom sugarproduction by much more than that of other member states. Onsheepmeat, the French Minister of Agriculture had suggested abilateral meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(79) 57) by the LordPresident of the Council, to which was attached a list of reductions inCivil Service manpower firmly agreed with the Ministers concerned; alist of possible further reductions which would follow upon policydecisions yet to be taken;  and a draft of a statement to Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the first Hst(attached as Annex 1 to his paper) had now been fully agreed with thecolleagues concerned.    In some cases, they had not been able to specifythe reductions which would be made, but in all cases they had under-taken to secure the agreed level of reductions by one means or another.Further possible cuts had been identified, but they depended on a numberof major policy decisions, including some budgetary matters, whichcould not be taken immediately.    These were set out in Annex 2 to hispaper.    There was nothing to be gained from postponing an announce-ment; indeed there was great pressure from the Staff Side for astatement.    Annex 3 to his paper contained a draft statement,summarising the decisions reached in the present exercise, butemphasising that individual Departments would continue to keep theirmanpower needs under careful review.    The precise terms in whichreductions would be announced would be agreed in each case with theDepartmental Minister concerned, and it would then be for eachDepartmental Minister to see his Departmental Staff Side. Thereductions would take some time to have their full effect.    There was adanger that manpower numbers would rise meanwhile, particularly at thebeginning of 1980-81.    He sought the co-operation of all DepartmentalMinisters in containing this growth.In discussion the following points were made -a.       It was disappointing that the reductions agreed were notmore substantial.    Unnecessary functions were still beingperformed in Departments, and there remained unnecessaryduplication and co-ordination, and inefficiency even in theexecution of essential tasks.    The necessary machinery did notalways exist to allow Departmental Ministers to keep their staffnumbers under proper control, or to inform themselves of thefunctions of their own Departments.    This was a matter for eachindividual Minister, who would have to tackle the problem in hisown way.    Meanwhile, monitoring systems, of the kind proposedat the previous discussion by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, should be established in every Department,tailored to the needs of the Minister in charge.    The Minister ofState, Civil Service Department, had written to Departmentssuggesting ways in which this might be done and the resultsreported regularly to his Department.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. The reductions listed in Annex 1 of C(79) 57 were allconfirmed.    The way in which these would be presented, toParliament and to the Departmental Staff Sides, would be agreedin each case by the Minister concerned with the Minister of State,Civil Service Department.c. The potential further cuts listed in Annex 2 required majorand in some cases controversial decisions which would bepursued by the Departmental Ministers concerned, through theappropriate Cabinet Committees where necessary.    Some wouldrequire legislation, and the programme was already verycongested.    Some of the changes in the Revenue Departmentsassumed reductions in taxation which would be dependent uponfurther reductions in public expenditure.d. It was suggested that the draft statement in Annex 3 laidtoo much emphasis on the &quot;completion&quot; of the operation. Thesearch for efficiency and economy, and the elimination ofunnecessary functions, was a continuing task, which would becarried out by each Departmental Minister.    It was agreed,however, that the statement should not hold out the expectationof any further general statement.    The Government need notshrink from indicating in the statement that the cuts would varywidely in their incidence between Departments.    It would beconvenient to aggregate the figures for the smallestDepartments, like the Office of Arts and Libraries.e. Following the statement, the Lord President of the Counciland the Minister of State, Civil Service Department, would seethe National Staff Side;  Ministers should arrange to seeDepartmental Staff Sides immediately afterwards.    The timingof the statement remained to be settled, depending on theParliamentary business over the next few days;  and prematureapproaches to Staff Sides should be avoided.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetwas determined to continue in its search for efficiency and economy inthe Civil Service.    Departments who had not already set up suitablemonitoring systems, as agreed during the previous discussion, shoulddo so, in order to be able to make their contribution to the centralreturn.The Cabinet -1.       Approved the list of manpower reductionsattached as Annex 1 to C(79) 57.5CONFIDENTIAL284
CONFIDENTIAL2. Noted the list of potential further reductions inAnnex 2, observing that these would require policydecisions, and in some cases legislation, and thatproposals would be made to the appropriate CabinetCommittees in due course.3. Invited the Lord President of the Council torevise the text of his proposed statement, in thelight of points made in discussion, and to agree thetiming of his announcement with the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster.4. Invited all Ministers in charge ofDepartments to arrange for the Governmentsdecisions to be communicated to theirDepartmental Staff Sides immediately after theannouncement was made, avoiding any approach tothe Staff Sides until the timing had been decided.5. Confirmed their earlier decision that allMinisters should be invited to set up monitoringsystems of the kind described by the Secretary ofState for the Environment, adjusted as necessary tothe circumstances of their Departments, and toreport the results regularly to the Civil ServiceDepartment as proposed by the Minister of State,Civil Service Department.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Employment (C(79) 58), setting out his proposals on a number ofoutstanding points on his forthcoming BiU on Industrial Relations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that urgentdecisions were needed now if the proposed legislation were to be readyfor introduction on 6 December and to achieve its Second Reading beforeChristmas.    It would be a short Bill;  but it could have far-reachingimplications.The proposals before the Cabinet were for a. modifying the maternityprovisions so as to place the obligation on the mother to provide theadditional notification of intention to return to work only if theemployer so requested it and nine weeks after her confinement; andb. dropping the proposed exemption for firms with less than 20employees from the obligation to reinstate or re-engage the mother ifit was not reasonably practicable to do so.6CONFIDENTIAL285
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that it was desirable to make concessionsto small firms who were being badly hit by rising interest rates. Inparticular the proposal to drop the exemption for firms with less than20 employees could be very damaging.    There was an exceptionallystrong case for giving exemption to firms with up to four or fiveemployees who would be very vulnerable to any obligation to reinstatemothers and might go out of business as a result.    There was also acase for extending the proposed exemption for small firms in the firsttwo years of trading to all new employees in a firm.    This would be inline with practice on redundancy payments.    Limiting the exemption tonew firms in the first two years of trading could also lead to taxavoidance problems.    Against these points it was argued that themeasures proposed would substantially help small firms overall.There had been protests from both sides of industry at the proposedexemptions, which would create two classes of employees on apermanent basis.    There had been no consultation on the extension ofthe exemption to all new employees.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the majority of the Cabinet was in favour of the exemption of veryemail firms, with up to four or five employees.    There was also amajority in favour of extending the proposed exemption for small firmsin the first two years of trading to all new employees of small firms forthe first two years of their employment.    The Secretary of State for :Employment should arrange for amendments to be introduced at theCommittee Stage giving exemption both for very small firms and for newemployees of small firms.The proposal before the Cabinet was to repeal the statutory require-ments for dealing with union recognition disputes (Section 11-16 of theEmployment Protection Act 1975).    The Advisory, Conciliation andArbitration Service (AC AS) had found the existing statutory require-ments unworkable.    Modification of these to give ACAS greaterdiscretion would be very difficult.    There would be trades unionopposition but on balance repealing the provisions would be the lesserevil.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of State for Employmentsproposal that the statutory provisions dealing with recognition disputeshould be repealed.7CONFIDENTIAL2M
CONFIDENTIALThe proposal before the Cabinet was for the repeal of the whole ofSchedule 11 of the Employment Protection Act 1975.    The Fair WagesResolution would not be dealt with in the Bill but could be consideredlater in the light of debate on the Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the whole of Schedule 11 should be repealed and thatthe Fair Wages Resolution should be considered separately at a laterstage.The proposal before the Cabinet was to afford a legal defence againstSLADE-type recruiting activities by removing immunity from civilaction where industrial action is called or threatened by persons notemployed by the employer in dispute for the purpose of coercing hisemployees into joining a particular trade union.    A provision in theseterms was still being developed, and might be put forward as part ofthe trades union immunities provision or as an amendment to the Billat the Committee Stage.    Alternatively it could be put forward as aseparate Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet attached considerable importance to legislating to deal withSLADE-type situations.    The Secretary of State for Employmentshould make every effort to include a suitable pro\wsion in the Bill, ifnecessary by amendment at Committee Stage.    The possibility ofputting forward the proposal in a separate Bill should, however, beretained as a fall-back position.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that it wasintended that only those changes in immunities relating to picketingand SLADE-type recruitment tactics would be included in the presentBill.    The Confederation of British Industry&apos;s own review of immunitieswould not be concluded until next summer and the House of Lordsjudgment in the case of Express Newspapers versus MacShane wasunlikely to be handed down until December.    When available, however,this judgment was likely to overturn the Court of Appeal.    In thecircumstances he proposed to say on Second Reading that theGovernment were reviewing the law on immunities in the light of theHouse of Lords judgment and would take whatever action seemednecessary to restore the legal position either by way of an amendmentto the Bill or later in a separate Bill.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that problems relating to immunities wouldbecome more acute as time went on.    Given the likelihood that theHouse of Lords would overturn the Court of Appeal judgment inExpress Newspapers versus MacShane there was a strong caee forpreparing draft legislation now.    Against this it was argued that itwould be a mistake to risk legislation without first considering theHouse of Lords judgment and consulting on the proposals. Uncertaintyabout future measures on immunities might act as a brake on unionactivities.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the Bill should include changes on immunityrelating to picketing and SLADE-type recruitment tactics.    There wasmuch to be said for concentrating the legislation on this subject in thefirst Session of the present Parliament, and further provision onimmunities should therefore be prepared so that, in the light of theHouse of Lords judgment, action could be taken to restore the positionand make other required changes in immunities either by amendment tothe Bill in Committee, or in a later separate Bill.The proposal before the Cabinet was that the scope of the protectionafforded to those who objected to union membership on conscientiousgrounds in closed shop situations should be defined as &quot;on grounds ofconscience &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that &quot;conscience&quot; might be interpretednarrowly by the courts given past judgments on conscientious objectorsin war.    The alternative favoured by the Cabinet in earlier discussionsof &quot;deeply held personal conviction&quot; was wider in scope but somewhatimprecise.    A combination of both phrases would be likely to overcomethe problem of narrow interpretation, though it might also be open toobjection as being too wide.THE HOME SECRETARY, who took the chair for the rest of this item,said that the Cabinet agreed that the best form of words would be &quot;ongrounds of conscience or other deeply held personal conviction&quot;.The proposal before the Cabinet was that the provision for a right ofappeal for those excluded or expelled from union membership should belimited to circumstances of the closed shop, as originally proposed inthe Manifesto.THE HOME SECRETARY, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the proposal by the Secretary of State forE mpl oy me nt.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY, summing up the whole discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Bill amended in the light of their discussionshould be introduced in December and be given a Second Reading beforeChristmas if at all possible.    The Bill was central to the Manifesto andshould be given high priority.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the HomeSecretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Approved the proposals in the memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Employment, subject to thecomments and revisions suggested in discussion.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Employment and the Chief Whip, to use hisbest endeavours to get the Bill a Second Readingbefore the Christmas Recess.Cabinet Office22 November 197910CONFIDENTIAL289
