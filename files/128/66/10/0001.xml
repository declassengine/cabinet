CONFIDENTIALj^ARY   L The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was now intendedthat the House should reassemble after the Summer Recess onMonday, 22 October.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the proposed date for Parliamentsreturn from the Summer Recess had been advanced from 29 Octoberto enable the House of Commons to make earlier progress with theimportant Bills which should by then be ready for introduction. Billscould not be read a second time until they had been before the Housefor two weekends; the earlier date for reassembly after the Recesswould enable a number of Bills to receive their Second Readings inthe first half of November.    This was essential if the Governmentsprogramme were not to be put at risk, and if the advantages of thelong Session were not to be lost.    Ministers sponsoring Bills shouldensure that instructions were sent to Parliamentary Counsel in goodtime to enable this objective to be met.The Cabinet -Took note.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat President CarterS major speech on energy policy representedan important advance, provided he could carry the policies outlinedes therein, on the promises he had made at the Tokyo Summit.    It alsoseemed to have led to some improvement in his domestic popularity.The contrived mass resignation of his senior advJsers had the air ofa political gimmick.    Mr Vance, Dr Brown and Dr Brzezinski hadalready been reappointed.    Mr Schlesinger might not be.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatParliament had now been informed of the Governments decision onVietnamese refugees.    He would be attending the Geneva Conferenceon 20 July.    Both Vietnam and the Soviet Union would also berepresented there and might try to blame the United States for thepresent refugee problem as being a consequence of the Vietnam war.Western speakers would be able to rebut this firmly.    But it mighthave some effect on Asian attitudes.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdesi&apos;ious:e:79) 7thfusionsTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatduring Bishop Muzorewa&apos;s visit to London the Prime Minister hadmade clear to him both that we were trying to help him and thatthere would have to be some movement on the constitutional front.The next steps on Rhodesia would be considered by the Defence andOversea Policy Committee on 23 July.    Meanwhile Kenya&apos;sstatement on the Muzorewa Government had been helpful thoughheavily qualified;  and it might not be to our disadvantage that seriousquarrels on other issues had developed at the current Organisation ofAfrican Unity Summit in Monrovia.tarTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that his own visit to Gibraltar, whereSpanish restrictions were having an increasingly serious effect, hadnow been followed by the visit to London of Senor Calvo Sotelo, theleader of the Spanish team negotiating for Spain&apos;s entry into theEuropean Economic Community.    A paper on our policy on theGibraltar problem was being prepared for Ministerial consideration.The CabinetTook note.BJNITY 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidIS that the Prime Minister and he had had a meeting earlier in the weekwith Baron Biesheuvel, M Marjolin and Mr Edmund Dell, who hadHWise Men      been appointed by the European Council to consider adjustments tothe machinery and procedure of the Community institutionsparticularly in the light of enlargement.    It seemed unlikely thatthey would make any radical proposals.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said he had representedthe Government at the inaugural session of the directly electedEuropean Parliament in Strasbourg on 17-18 July.    This had beenan uneventful occasion apart from interjections by theReverend Ian Paisley.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdousAice:19thBsionsTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council ofMinisters (Finance) on 16 July had had a characteristicallyunproductive discussion based on reports from subordinatecommittees about the economic situation.    It now appeared that thereview of the intervention mechanism of the European MonetarySystem (EMS) would take place in October rather than in September.He had been able to lift the United Kingdom reserve on the Regulationto grant interest rate subsidies to Italy and the Irish Republic. Ithad been agreed that if and when the United Kingdom also participatedin the exchange rate mechanism of EMS, our entitlement to interestrate subsidies would be decided upon by the Council in accordancewith the same criteria as had been adopted in the case of Italy andthe Irish Republic.    The sums involved were not large in relationto our -iet budgetary contribution and oui* readiness to settle thislong-standing argument had been much appreciated by the Irish.We had continued to insist that the Commissions reference paperon the budgetary problem should be ready for discussion in Septemberso that consideration of possible solutions - the second phase of theprocedure decided upon by the European Council in Strasbourg - couldbegin in October.    It now appeared that work on possible remediesby the Commission and other member States was proceeding fasterthan had been at first thought and, if we were to inject our own viewsat the appropriate time, it would be necessary to accelerate thetimetable originally envisaged by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee.IDITUREiouserence:19thRsionsIn a brief discussion the importance of losing no chance to influencethe Commission and other member States over the gravity of the Budgelproblem was stressed.    We would need to be clear both on ourobjectives and on what were the most appropriate modalities. Weshould talk both to our partners and to the Commission.The Cabinet -Took note.4.

SECRETjccument IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 38CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 10ih Coada-Bioas Minute 4Thursday 19 July 1979 at 10. 30 amc The Cabinet resumed its discussion of public expenditure on theenditure basis of two memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer: one(C(79) 30) set out the consequences of failure to achieve the1S  6. 5 billion cut which he had proposed in expenditure for 1980-81;ice: the other (C(79) 31) covered the report of a group of Ministers9th (MISC 11) established to review the proposed reductions in Departmental^sions expenditure programmes.    The Cabinet also had before them previous5 papers on public expenditure (C(79) 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that decisions wereneeded before the Recess on the levels of expenditure in 1980-81,including finance for the nationalised industries. Substantialreductions would be needed.    The Gross Domestic Product (GDP)had grown by less than 1 per cent a year in the previous 5 years andhalf of this growth had come from North Sea oil; there was littleprospect of significant growth in the coming year; pay increases inthe private sector were accelerating; there was a substantial tradedeficit; the money supply was growing by 13 per cent annually; andthe latest oil price increases would have a deflationary effect on theworld economy as well as on Britain.    The decisions taken at thetime of the Budget held the level of expenditure in 1979-80 unchangedfrom that of 1978-79.    The programmes announced by the previousGovernment would have increased expenditure in 1979-80 by some2 per cent to 3 per cent over 1978-79 and in 1980-81 by some !5 per cent over 1978-79 on the false assumption of a growth rate ofbetween 2 per cent and 3 per cent a year in GDP.    The cuts imposedin 1976 at the time of the International Monetary Fund ( IMF) loanwould have been more than reversed by these plans.    If they hadcontinued unaltered the plans would have involved expenditure of afurther  5 billion in 1980-81 as compared to this year, to be financedout of a stagnant GDP.    The situation was made worse by the rateof increase of pay in the public sector, which was forecast to rise1SECRET111
SECRETby 18 per cent, amounting to a further  4. 5 billion in cash terms.To offset all this, it was necessary to make reductiors of  6. 5 billionin expenditure plans for 1980-81 in order to maintain the public sectorborrowing requirement ( PSBR) in that year at  9 billion.    He hadproposed that  750 million of this should be found from the ContingencyReserve,  500 million from the borrowing of the nationalisedindustries and further reductions in Civil Service manpower and yeta further  500 millicn from the disposal of assets.    This left 4.75 billion to be found from Departmental programmes. TheMinisterial Group (MT.SC 11) had set itself this target.    It haddiscussed the plans with all the major spending Ministers. Theresults were set out in Annex B of their report, circulated with hispaper C(79) 31.   They recommended cuts totalling about  4 billion,leaving him still  800 million short of the target which was necessaryto avoid the risk of higher interest rates or higher taxation. However,it was necessary to reconcile these economic objectives with what waspolitically practicable.    The group had also raised the question ofpresentation: those cuts which fell in the local authority area couldbe announced separately, or they could be presented as a singleglobal cut, within which the local authorities would be free to varytheir expenditure.    However, legislative changes would be necessaryin any case, and some indication of the Governments wishes wouldbe inevitable.In discussion, it was suggested that the forecasts made insufficientallowance for the potential increased revenue from North Sea oil.Oil price increases this year meant that the oil companies would bedeclaring very large profits, and these would be bound to rise further.The British Government, like other host Governments, should insiston increasing its share of the total &apos;take&apos; when oi3 prices rose fasterin real terms than oil company&apos;s costs.    Some changes in the taxregime had already been made in the last Budget.    On the other handit was important not to discourage the development of smaller fieldsand the forecast already allowed for the Budget tax changes and themost recent increases in oil prices.    The effect of any furtherchanges in the tax regime in 1980-81 would not be very large. Theeffects on the PSBR would be more than offset by the deflationaryeffect of further oil price increases, working through the Britisheconomy through its effects on our overseas trade.    In any case,there were other claimants than public expenditure on any additionalrevenue receipts.    It was important to keep the PSBR down to thelowest practicable level in order to relieve interest rates.    It wasalso essential to finance other tax reforms, for example in the structureof corporation tax and capital gains tax, to which the Government wascommitted by its Manifesto.    In addition, various &quot;accelerator&apos;schemes, which could cost another  500 million by way of tax forgone,were already under study.    The forecasts already assumed indexation2SECRET
SECRETof excise duties.    There was no real scope for other major taxincreases.    And no room for further real reductions in personaltaxation unless public expenditure could be reduced further.The Cabinet then considered the expenditure reductions proposed inAnnex B of the report circulated with C(79) 31.MISC 11 recommended a reduction of  115 million, compared with abid for an increase of  13 million.    In favour of the reduction, itwas argued that the Defence Budget had risen by 4* 6 per cent fromthe previous year&apos;s outturn and that the additional bid represented afurther increase of 4.7 per cent to 1980-81.    The MISC 11 suggestionwould still allow for an increase in Defence expenditure of 6 per centover the two years taken together, which in real terms more thanmet the commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).The Ministry of Defence was very staff intensive, particularly in theRoyal Dock Yards and Ordnance Factories, and there should be roomfor substantial savings.    By comparison, the cuts being sought inother, politically much more sensitive programmes, were far moredamaging.    Other North Atlantic Treaty Organisation members(especially Germany) had failed to meet their commitment toincrease defence expenditure by 3 per cent.    The terms of theagreement in NATO allowed for exemption for countries in economicdifficulties.Against this, it was argued that the present Government was committed,both domestically and internationally, to increasing the level ofdefence expenditure.    Internationally, it was important to persuadeother NATO members to increase the total NATO defence effort, andto do so it was necessary that the United Kingdom should itself beseen to meet the obligations which it had urged on others.Domestically, it was desirable that the Government should be ableto show an increase in the defence budget, compared with the plansinherited from its predecessors.In further discussion, there was general agreement that, in view ofthe large reductions in expenditure demanded of other Departments,the Defence Budget should be reduced by  115 million as proposed byMISC 11.    It would be important however to present this decision inthe least damaging way.3SECRET
SECRETIt was agreed that the aid programme should be reduced by 115 million, and that the provision for other Foreigr andCommonwealth programmes should be reduced by  13 million,noting that in the latter case the reductions would not necessarilyfall in the areas suggested by MISC 11.No reductions were possible to these figures at this stage though theyunderlined the necessity of the successful outcome to the negotiationsnow under way.Savings of  43 million were agreed; it was noted that the 20 million originally proposed to be found from a reduction oncapital grants might be met by alternative savings, including disposalsof agricultural land.    Any shortfall in the share of the Scottish andWelsh Agriculture Departments would be made good by the Mirastryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.Net savings of  5 million were agreed on the understanding that,provided the savings were achieved, the Forestry Commission wouldbe allowed to retain for their own purposes up to half of the proceedsof any assets they might sell.Savings of  187 million were agreed.Savings of  17 million were agreed, although it was noted that themakeup would be different from that considered by MISC 11.It was noted that a recalculation of interest rate subsidies, madenecessary by rising interest rates, involved an addition of  170 million.If interest rates fell so would the amount of finance required. TheSecretary of State for Trade should examine whether a higher proportior.of the credit made available by Export Credits Guarantee Departmentcould be financed by the banks.4SECRET114
SECRETSavings of  513 million were agreed.Savings of  7 million were agreed; it was noted that there mightlater be a call on the Contingency Reserve to meet additionalexpenditure on energy conservation and to finance research anddevelopment, particularly in the nuclear field.Savings of  250 million were agreed.MISC 11 had prcposed reductions of  1, 264 million in the housingprogramme,  54 million in the budget of the Property ServicesAgency (PSA) and  285 million in the other Department of theEnvironment services.    The Secretary of State for the Environmenthad offered reductions of  621 million in the housing programme,the full cuts asked for on the PSA and  212 million on other DOEservices.    The original figures on housing had been derived froma list of cuts considered by the Government when in Opposition. Itwas argued that since these figures contained errors which had beendiscovered since then, the reductions to be sought should be reduced.Against this, it was argued that the Opposition cuts had no formalstatus, and that the proposals of MISC 11 were justified in their ownrights.    Council house rents were, in general, much too low. Inreal terms they were still below the level of 1973-74.    The benefitsof housing subsidies were in many cases going to the wrong people.An increase in rents would encourage the large scale sale of councilhouses to which the Government was committed.    The forecastsalready assumed that rents would rise in line with the price inflationin 1980-81.    The MISC 11 proposal involved a further  1 per weekincrease.    But the Government had no power to insist on this. Totake such powers would involve repeating the mistakes of the 1972Housing Finance Act, and might lead, to another confrontation of thekind that developed at Clay Cross at that time.    In 1972, theGovernment had been able to offer a new rent rebate scheme as aninducement.    This time such a possibility was not open though thesubstantial discounts being made available when council houses weresold might serve a similar purpose.    This was in any case adifficult time to increase rents, with a serious impact on the retailprice index, and would be likely to add to the pressure for excessivepay increases.5SECRET
SECRETIt had been proposed to reduce the provision of  1, 285 million fornew council house building by  440 million.    A further cut in thisprogramme might be preferable to an increase in council house rents,provided it did not hit the provision of special accommodation fordisabled people and other priority groups.    Other cuts in theprogrammes of the Department of the Environment, and of theProperty Services Agency, might prove possible.    The Secretary ofState had urgently reviewed the DOE programme as a whole and wasready to offer a further  200 million.    But substantial real cuts wereneeded.    Many of those proposed earlier did no more than recogniseshortfalls in expenditure which would have occurred anyway. Therewere also substantial additional bids for expenditure on housing-related programmes which would need further consideration.MISC 11 she-old re-examine the total DOE/FSA programmes withthese points in mind and with a view to making the maximum possiblesavings.OfficeAdditional expenditure of  24 million was approved.cellor&apos;stmentReductions of  4 million were approved.ationcienceThe Chief Secretary had originally asked for reductions of 860 million.    MISC 11 had recommended cuts of  547 million,against which the Secretary of State for Education had suggestedcuts totalling  517 million.    These proposals involved substantialreductions in peripheral expenditures on education programmes, inorder to avoid attacking educational standards too severely. Theywould involve, however, considerable reductions in the moneysavailable for school meals, for school transport, and for nurseryeducation.    It was proposed to give local authorities discretion tomake charges in these areas and to give them discretion to allocatethe available funds as they thought best.    Such legislation would behighly contentious and difficult to carry.    It would be severelycriticised, particularly by Members for rural constituencies whichwould be badly hit.    There was little doubt that most of the Shirecounties, though not all local authorities in urban areas, would wish,or have little option but, to take full advantage of these opportunitiesto increase charges.    For example, school transport might cost 2.50 or  3 per week for each child, yielding savings of  40 million.SECRET116
SECRETCharges for nursery education would yield half the savingsenvisaged in this area of  70 million, at a cost of perhaps  4 perchild per week.    Authorities would be given discretion to abandonthe present school meals service, substituting some cheaper formof refreshment at lunch time.    In addition,  20 million would befound from increasing the parental contribution for university andfurther education.    This might prove the most unacceptable of allthe proposed cuts.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now reached a number of decisions.    It would resumeits discussion of public expenditure on Monday 23 July, when itwould consider the outstanding items starting with the educationprogrammes on which it had not been possible to complete its work.The Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for MISC U to meetagain urgently before then to re-examine the programmes of theDepartment of the Environment,    No general announcement aboutthe reductions in public expenditure would be made before theRecess.    It would however be necessary to reach agreement onwhat might be said to the local auth orities about their expenditurein 1980-81 during the summer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office19 July 19797SECRET
