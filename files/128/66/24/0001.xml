CONFIDENTIAL1DENTIALITY      1. THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to the appearanceBINET in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that morning of extracts from the record ofMENTS the Ministerial discussion about the future nuclear powerprogramme.    She would consider the implications of such leaksfor the form and circulation of Cabinet and Cabinet Committeepapers and minutes and the need for fresh guidance on the subject.The Cabinet -Took note.IAMENTARY        2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inIRS the House of Commons during the following week.Government,-g and Landisice:22ndusions,1THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatduring business Questions on the previous Thursday the Leaderof the Opposition had pressed the Government to reconsider thedecision to introduce the Local Government, Planning and LandBill in the House of Lords.    Formal representations hadsubsequently been made to him through the usual channels, and hehad indicated to the shadow Leader of the House, Mr Foot, thathe would bring the matter back to Cabinet.    The Oppositionconsidered that a serious constitutional point was at stake and haddrawn attention to a statement by the then Leader of the House, ina debate on a Procedure Committee report in November 1971, tothe effect that there were many Bills, the vast majority, which bytheir very nature, political or financial, must start in the Houseof Commons.    The Opposition were clearly determined to obstructbusiness if the Government did not give way, and the consequencesfor the legislative programme could be more serious than thedislocation which would result from a decision not to proceed withthe Bill in the House of Lords and to introduce a similar Bill inthe House of Commons.In discussion, it was argued that the Government should not acceptthat a constitutional principle was involved.    The Opposition^claim might well have only limited support within the Labour Partyin the House of Commons, and it was likely to attract littleattention outside Parliament.    It was essentially a political devicedesigned to provide a justification for obstructing Governmentbusiness, and the Government should resist it accordingly. Ifthey did not do so, there would be a serious risk that they wouldeventually have to abandon one of the major Bills in theirprogramme which had been drawn up on the assumption that one ormore such Bills would be introduced in the House of Lords. Theextent to which the Opposition would press a campaign of1CONFIDENTIAL299
CONFIDENTIALdisruption was uncertain, but if they were intent on such acampaign they would press it regardless of the Governmentsdecision on this Bill.    There was little to be gained from devicessuch as proceeding simultaneously in both Houses by means of a(No. 2) Bill, or dividing the Bill in such a way that the morecontroversial provisions were removed and introduced as aseparate Bill in the House of Commons while the remainder madeprogress in the House of Lords.Support was, however, expressed for the view that the decidingfactor should be the practical consequences for the Governmentsprogramme as a whole.    It was important that the ZimbabweIndependence Bill should not be subject to delay, and important,too, that the Employment and Housing Bills, both shortly to beintroduced in the House of Commons, should have a securepassage;  other important legislation was still in preparation;and it would be unfortunate to jeopardise the good progress whichhad been made with Bills that were already proceeding throughCommittee.    The Local Government, Planning and Land Billcould be taken through the Commons in the period after theChristmas recess.    Problems would undoubtedly arise in theHouse of Lords, not least for Ministers concerned with other Billswhich would also be before the House when the Bill reached itsCommittee stage, and an extended session would probably have tobe accepted for both Houses; but the consequences for theGovernments business generally were likely to be less seriousthan the effect of sustained obstruction in the Commons. Ifobstruction were to take place, the Government should always bein a position to demonstrate the correctness of their own actionsand thus to place the blame for delay on a factious Opposition.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thestatement made in 1971 should have been drawn to the Cabinetsattention when they had previously discussed the matter on22 November (CC(79) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 1).    The Cabinetaccepted that a decision not to proceed with the Local Government,Planning and Land Bill in the House of Lords would increase thecongestion in that House later in the session and might require thesession to be extended;  but they now agreed that the Governmentsinterests as a whole would be best served by minimising theopportunities for the Opposition to claim justification for obstructingGovernment business.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould therefore announce during business Questions that afternoonthat the Government did not now intend to proceed with the Bill inthe House of Lords and that they would introduce a similar Bill inthe House of Commons in due course.    The opportunity should betaken to incorporate in the Bill as introduced in that House as manyas possible of the amendments which would otherwise have beenmade in Committee.     When informing the Opposition of theGovernments decision he should seek assurances about their2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALattitude to the progress of this and other Bills in the House ofCommons, and an agreement that they would not raise objectionsto the introduction of other substantial Government Bills in theHouse of Lords.    Bills which were still in the course ofpreparation or awaiting introduction should be reviewed to identifythese which might be suitable for that purpose.    The fact that aBill such as the Broadcasting Bill might include financial provisionsshould not itself be an obstacle, since there was a well-estabHshedprocedure under which the Commons financial privilege could beprotected by means of a privilege amendment.    The Governmentsagreement to introduce the Local Government, Planning and LandBill in the House of Commons should be presented as a concessionto Parliamentary feeling in relation to that Bill and not as anacknowledgment of any general principle affecting the types ofBills which would be suitable for introduction in the House of Lords.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to be guidedaccordingly.3CONFIDENTIAL301
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Patriotic Front had now agreed to the proposed ceasefire arrange-ments.    The Cabinet wholeheartedly congratulated him on the achieve-ment of this further progress in the negotiations to bring first legalityand then independence to Rhodesia,    He warned, however, that therecould still be serious difficulties over the implementation of thearrangements, on which negotiations were continuing.    He would havepreferred if possible to avoid appointing and sending out the Governoruntil they were complete.    But momentum needed to be kept up, inorder to ensure the irreversibility of the process and to sustain theSalisbury delegation^ confidence.    It would therefore be necessary toannounce the Governor&apos;s appointment on 7 December and to make clearthat he would arrive in Salisbury on the morning of 11 December. Thiswould be a calculated risk.    The Salisbury and Patriotic Frontdelegations might well put divergent interpretations on what had beenagreed.    Recrimination might then be unavoidable;  and the ceasefiremight break down because, as had been made clear to the Front&apos;sleaders, although there would be progressive disengagement inRhodesia if the Patriotic Front forces assembled in accordance withthe agreement, the Rhodesian security forces would have to be usedby the Governor to keep the peace if the Front&apos;s forces failed toassemble adequately as the agreement required.    That could lead tothe British Governor, who would have been appointed as an appropriateperson to preside over an agreed settlement, facing the very differentcontext oi the war continuing, for which a different appointment wouldhave been more suitable.    The recall of the Governor, leaving hisDeputy in charge, might then have to be considered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the course of action proposed by the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary, despite the real risks involved, and renewedtheir warm congratulations on his achievement.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therewas concern about the steps against Iran which the United States mightnow take to secure the release of the hostages in Tehran or toretaliate if they were killed.    British interests were liable to beaffected, and indeed had already been by American action in thebanking field (about which the Chancellor of the Exche quer had beeninformed but not consulted in advance as the Americans claimed).He expected to see the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance,on 12 December and would seek both to dissuade him from any actionwhich might, for example, endanger the international monetary system^4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALand to pervnade him that, if the Americans were looking for supportfor any further actions they might feel bound to take, they would do wellto inform those to whom they would look for such support of the actionsthey had in mind, so that those concerned had opportunities to considertheir own reactions and to make comments and suggestions.    The UnitedStates badly needed friends at such a juncture, and it was highlydesirable that Britain should give all the support she could; but sheshould not b^ ? sked to support action without knowing what it was to be.An urgent ic.fr--departmental src/iy was being made of the possibilitiesas well as tb0 dangers which might be involved.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theresignation of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, Mr Lynch,was likely to have adverse consequences for British interests. Publiccomment      shouM, however, be confined to expressions of personalregret and observations to the effect that the choice of a successor was adomestic matter for the Irish.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theLord Privy Seal would later mat day refer in Parliament to the factthat Britain was withdrawing recognition from the Pol Pot regime,which no longer met our criteria for recognition since, quite apartfrom its unsavoury character, it no longer controlled any significantpart of the country.    This step was unwelcome to China; and to themembers of the Association of South East Asian Nations, particularlySingapore.    But the Lord Privy Seal would make clear that it did notimply approval of the occupation of Cambodia by the Vietnamese, norrecognition of their puppet regime;  and serious damage to Britishinterests was not anticipated.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL303
CONFIDENTIALUNITY 4.        THE PRIME MINISTER, reporting on the European Council inrS Dublin on 29-30 November, said that the French President and theGerman Chancellor had combined to take a restrictive view on thealleviation of our net budgetary contribution.    In contrast thean Benelux countries and the Italians had been more helpful towards us.It was an advantage that the Italians would assume the Presidency onNovember     1 January 1980, and it would be for the Italian Prime Minister,Signor Cossiga, to decide when the European Council should resumeits discussion of the subject.    She had not felt it right to refuse theus proposal to have another meeting in the face of the evident wish of oursee: smaller partners to be helpful.    The United Kingdom had lost nothing23rd thereby;  the offer to improve the 1975 financial mechanism so as tosions, reduce the United Kingdom1 s gross contribution by some  350 million3 was unlikely to be withdrawn and there was now a prospect of securingsome improvement in our receipts from the Community Budget.There would now need to be intensive discussions with Communitypartners and the European Commission: there would be no point ina further meeting unless it was clear in advance that there were goodprospects of agreement.    A reduction of  350 million or even 500 million in the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution would not beenough.    A bigger immediate reduction was necessary, together withpromises that the structure of the Budget would be improved duringthe next few years.    The intervening time before the next Councilshould also be used to work out what steps the United Kingdom mighttake if a reasonable settlement could not then be secured. Whetherin these circumstances to withhold part of the United Kingdomcontribution to the Community Budget, and whether to engage insystematic obstruction within the Community, were matters on whichthe Cabinet would need to take a decision in due course. MeanwhileMinisters should continue to deal with other Community business onits merits.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and she hadaccepted no linkages.    Where progress could be made without detri-ment to British interests, Ministers were free to negotiate accordingly.Discussion on the more controversial issues should be spun out, andnothing of importance should be given away in advance of the nextEuropean Council.    It was a major objective of policy to secure asatisfactory settlement of the budget question.    In all considerationsof this matter, however, it was important not to lose sight of the widerpolitical issues that would accompany a weakening of the Communitycaused by failure to agree: particularly in present world conditions,it was only the Soviet Union which would benefit from that.In a brief discussion, the following points were made:-a.      It was important not to lose sight of the cost ofmaintaining British troops in the Federal Republic of Germany,and the benefits which Germany derived therefrom.    It wasparadoxical that the Federal Republic had closer links withFrance, which had opted out of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (NATO), than with the United Kingdom.6CONFIDENTIAL304
CONFIDENTIALb. At the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers(Energy) there had been sustained pressure from France andGermany for us to provide better access to North Sea oil.At the moment, the rest of the Community enjoyed theconsiderable advantage of buying oil from us at prices farbelow the spot market level.c. At the recent meetiag of the Council of Ministers(Fisheries) some usoiui progress had been made.d. It seemed likely that the European Parliament wouldreject the draft Community Budget for 1980.    The Governmentsattitude on this matter would be considered shortly by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee, Sub-Committee onEuropean Questions.The Cabinet -Took note.7CONFIDENTIAL395
CONFIDENTIALULTURE        5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(79) 59), enclosing a report by the Official Group on Britishus Agriculture (MISC 23) and inviting the Cabinet to take decisions on anee: devaluation of the Green Pound, an increase in the maximum retail)l6th price of milk, and the Public Expenditure Survey (PES) provisionisions, for capital grants to agriculture in the years to 1983-84.    They alsoe3 had before them a letter dated 3 December 1979 from the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food to the Chancellor of the Exchequerabout retail milk prices in relation to production and distributioncosts.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat farmers&apos; net income had fallen severely in real terms over thelast few years.    Real incomes in 1978, ihe worst year for farmingunder the previous. Labour Government, had been 83 per cent oftheir 1975 level.    The forecast for 1979 was that they would be68 per cent of their 1975 level, and if no action were taken on theGreen Pound or on retail milk prices the figure for 1980 would be47 per cent.   He proposed that he should seek a 5 per centdevaluation of the Green Pound at the European Economic Community(EEC) Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on Monday 10 December, andthat the maximum retail price of milk should be increased by ijrp perpint from the beginning of January.    These proposals would stillleave farmers&apos; net income in 1980 in real terms slightly below its1979 level and 20 per cent below its 1978 level.    To restore farmers&apos;net income to its 1978 level would require a Green Pound devaluationof 12 per cent and an increase of 2^p per pint in the maximum retailprice of milk.As to capital grants, an increase was necessary in order to encouragefarmers to invest in the face of competition from farmers in the restof the EEC who received much more support from their Governments.Tm match the incentives available in the rest of the EEC apart fromDenmark, existing grant levels would need to be doubled.    He wasnot asking colleagues to go this far, but proposed an increase in thePES provision from  160 million to  190 million in 1982-83, at1979 survey prices.In discussion the following main points were made:-a. There was general agreement that the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food should seek a 5 per centdevaluation of the Green Pound at the EEC Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) on Monday 10 December.b. The reduction of  60 million in capital grants in 1982-83proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and theconsequential cuts in other years of the PES period, werethe only reductions in public expenditure on agriculture nowproposed.    The Minimum Lending Rate was at 17 per cent8CONFIDENTIAL306
CONFIDENTIALbecause public expenditure was still too high and it was notacceptable to exempt agriculture from making a contributionto the necessary reductions.    On the other hand, it wasargued that the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, proposal, whichwould entail a 50 per cent cut in grant rates from1 January 1980, would be very damaging to confidence in theindustry.    If savings had to be found from capital grants theyshould be sought in more selective ways and not through&quot;across the board&quot; cuts.    It was doubtful, for example, ifgrant assistance should continue to be given to grain storageprojects, whereas the case for continued grants for drainageschemes remained strong.c. It was generally agreed that an increase was justified inthe maximum retail price o  milk and that this increase shouldbe either lp or l^p per pint. To choose lp rather than l^p,however, would almost certainly necessitate a larger increaselater in 1980. January would be a bad month for the increasebecause of price increases which were already in the pipeline,notably the i.iicx&apos;ease in mortgage rates.d. The present system of milk distribution, with its highlevel of doorstep deliveries, was very costly.    Changes inthe system could result in milk being available more cheaplyin the shops, without necessarily denying the possibility ofretaining doorstep deliveries for those who preferred and wereprepared to pay a little extra to get their milk that way. TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had commissioneda firm of accountants to study milk distributors&apos; margins.This was not a full examination of the milk distribution system,but the accountants&apos; report would be a useful input into futurediscussion of that system.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food&apos;sproposal to seek a 5 per cent devaluation of the Green Pound. Theyagreed that the PES provision for farm capital grants should bereduced by  35-440 million in 1983-84 with consequential changes inexpenditure in the other years of the PES period.    In achieving thesesavings greater stress should be placed on increased selectivity inthe scheme than on reducing the rates of grant.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Agriculture Ministers should agree thesavings to be made in each year and the changes in the grant schemeneeded to achieve them, and report their conclusions to her. TheCabinet also agreed to an increase of l^p per pint in the maximumretail price of milk, with effect from a date which she would agreewith the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, but whichwould not be earlier than 1 February 1980,    The question of theretail distribution system for milk would need to be looked at againwhen the accountants&quot; report on distributors&apos; margins was available.9CONFIDENTIAL307
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food to seek a 5 per cent devaluation of the GreenPound at the EEC Council of Ministers (Agriculture)on Monday 10 December 1979*3. Agreed that the PES Provision for farm capitalgrants for 1983-84 should be reduced by  35- 40 millionat 1979 survey prices, and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood to ren.ch agreement, in consultation as necessary withthe other Agriculture Ministers, on the exact amount of thereduction, the method by which it should be achieved, andthe consequences for the PES provision for farm capitalgrants in the earlier years of the PES period.4. Agreed that the maximum retail price of milk shouldbe increased by l^p per pint with effect from a date notearlier than 1 February, 1980, and invited the Prime Ministerto agree the precise timing of the increase with the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.Cabinet Office6 December 197910CONFIDENTIAL308
