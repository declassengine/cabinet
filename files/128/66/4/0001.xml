CONFIDENTIALINIS1, THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that Bishop Muzorewa had nowcompleted the formation of his government.    The fact thatMr David Smith had agreed to stay on as Minister of Finance was agood sign, as was the inclusion of Chief Ndinweni in the Cabinet.Lord Harlech&apos;s appointment as emissary had been generally wellreceived in Africa.    But there was trouble with the Nigerians overwhat they chose to interpret as positive moves towards recognitionof the new Rhodesian government.    So far this had taken the form ofan embargo on tenders from British firms for some NigerianGovernment contracts.The Cabinet -Took note.&amp;NITY        2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported that the MinisterialConference on 24-26 May between the Community and the African,Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries to negotiate a new LomeConvention had ended without agreement but there had been littleacrimony.    The main reason for failure had been that the ACPcountries regarded the Community&apos;s aid offer as inadequate.    It washoped that discussions might be resumed at the end of June.The Cabinet -Took note.rcs3.

CONFIDENTIAL&quot;NTIALITY      4. THE PRIME MINISTER referred to newspaper reports thatu day alleging that the Government were considering extending thenumber of &quot;waiting days&quot; before sickness and unemploymentbenefits could be paid.    Leaks of this kind were extremelydamaging.    It was the personal responsibility of Ministers incharge of Departments to see that their departmental arrangementsfor maintaining security were effective.    It was particularlyimportant to ensure the confidentiality of documents relating topublic expenditure and finance.    They should receive appropriatehigh classification and the related handling procedures shouldalways be strictly observed.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL50
CONFIDENTIAL5t        The Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C(79) 13) setting out the results of his discussions withdepartmental Ministers about cuts in expenditure in the currentfinancial year.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that, as agreed atCabinet on 17 May, he had proposed to his colleagues reductions inexpenditure totalling  1, 365 million in the published expenditure plansfor 1979-80, with a further  1, 200 million to come from disposal of jpublic sector assets.    Bilateral discussions with his colleagues hadsecured agreement on almost all of the proposed reductions.    He andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had decided not to propose increasesin prescription and dental charges, or further increases in schoolmeal charges in the current year.    There was an unresolved issueover the a:&apos;d programme.    There was a potential charge to theContingency Reserve in respect of the Northern Ireland meat industryemployment scheme.    Otherwise, he commended the proposedreductions to the Cabinet.In discussion, there was general support for most of the reductionsproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    It was however arguedthat the savings on energy programmes came largely from additionalprice increases.    While a second electricity price increase in theyear was inevitable to meet increased costs, there was no justificationfor increasing gas prices to the domestic customer a second time,thus adding to the inevitable pressure on the Retail Price Indexwhich would follow from the Chancellor&apos;s Budget measures.Alternative savings should be found within the energy programme,perhaps by postponing capital investment in the electricity industry.It was also suggested that, while an additional  22 million savingswould be required on the education budget to make good the decisionnot to increase school meal charges further, this should, if possible,be done by seeking reductions in expenditure rather than by raisingfees to students.    An appropriate proportion of the cuts should fall onthe arts budget, which had increased ateeply in recent years.    Even atthis late stage in the academic year, it should be possible to find furthersavings in expenditure on uoireraities, polytechnics and colleges offurther education.   The savings in the programmes of the Foreign andCommonwealth Office, should bs increased from  40 million to  50 millionnotwithstanding the political difficulty of reducing the aid programmefurther juat before the Commonwealth Conference * Additionalexpenditure of  100 million of the JJefence budget was welcome and inline with the Cabinets priorities, but it was, not sufficient to meet thefull commitments inherited fronx the, previous Government, and&apos;significant economies in the Defence programme would still be a^ededto keep witkin the. increased Defence budget.In further discussion, it was suggested that great care was needed inproceeding with the disposal of public sector assets in the wayproposed.    The immediate nead was for large sales, whose proceedscould be taken into account in 1979-80, thus helping with theimmediate budgetary problem.    The Chancellor of the ExchequerCONFIDENTIAL51
CONFIDENTIALwould need to take credit for the figures in his Budget Statement.But he should do so in a way which would not reveal the Governmentsasking price or prejudice the prospects of sales.    The object was tomop up surplus purchasing power at home, and for this reason theassets should be sold to domestic buyers wherever possible. Theyshould also be disposed of in a way which would secure the widestpossible spread of ownership, and pave the way to successful disposalof an equity interest in some of the nationalised industries in duecourse.    All these issues need very careful Ministerial handling,and it would be desirable to establish a special Ministerial groupfor the purpose.ITHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the ,Cabinet broadly endorsed the proposals put forward by the ChiefSecretary   Treasury.    The Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs should find an additional  10   million savingsin his programmes.    The Secretary of State for Education and Science,together with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, should findsavings of  22 million in the education, arts and science budget, to makegood the loss of revenue from increased school meal charges, and shouldagree the savings urgently with the Chief Secretary, ^Treasury. Asagreed under item 3, the Secretary of State forSocial Services should seek alternative savings of  40 million in caseit were decided not to increase &apos;waiting days&apos;.    Domestic gas pricesshould not be increased a second time in 1979-80, and the Secretaryof State for Energy should find alternative savings of  12 million tomake good this loss of revenue.    The Cabinet confirmed theallocation of an additional  100 million to the Defence budget in 1979-80.They noted that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland might wishto make a claim on the Contingency Reserve in respect of the meatindustry employment scheme, depending on circumstances later in theyear.    She would herself arrange for the establishment of a sub-committee of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, underthe Chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to consider thewhole question of disposal of public sector assets and to keep theoperation under regular review.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALjier action(reduce theOF THESERVICEbrence:79) 2ndelusions,6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (C(79) 12) about proposals toreduce the size of the Civil Service in the longer term.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that his paperwas designed to secure a wide range of options for laterconsideration and decision.    The identification of these longterm options would require the wholehearted co-operation of allDepartmental Ministers.    Meanwhile, in the short term, it wasimportant to keep to a minimum the exemptions to the temporaryban on recruitment agreed by Cabinet on 10 May (CC(79) 1stConclusions, Minute 1);  otherwise there would be no chance ofsecuring the 3 per cent reduction in manpower-related expenditurewhich the Cabinet had then agreed.In discussion, there was general agreement that the Cabinet neededa very wide range of options from which to choose. Ministersshould take a close personal interest in the search for economiesand should not allow Departments to rule out too readily ongrounds of apparent impracticability any changes which wouldinvolve significant reductions in staff.     Consultation with theCivil Service Trade Unions would clearly be needed. TheLord President of the Council would be opening discussions withsenior union representatives next week in order to set the stagefor the operation as a whole.    Departments should not involvetheir own staff sides in discussions until this had been done.When they did meet their unions Ministers should make it clearthat the exercise was to be taken seriously and that they wouldnot be deflected from their objectives by union opposition. Atthe same time, the unions should be given a real chance toco-operate, and could be assured that final decisions would not betaken without full consultation.    To avoid over-reaction   by theunions it should be made clear that at this stage the Cabinet wasonly identifying options, many of which would be rejected.While it was important to secure as many savings as possible by1982, longer-term reductions need not be ruled out. Changesin the present policy on dispersal of the Civil Service would helpwin the co-operation of the unions:  but this should be consideredas a separate matter, and a paper should be brought to theappropriate Ministerial Committee as soon as possible.    It shouldbe possible to secure big savings in the staff of the PropertyServices Agency, and the Secretary of State for the Environmentwould shortly be seeking the co-operation of his Ministerialcustomers for this purpose.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion said that theCabinet approved the proposals put forward by the Lord Presidentof the Council.    The target date for the comp^tion of the staffreductions should be 1 April 1982.    Departmental Ministersshould submit statements on the lines set out in paragraph 3 ofC(79) 12, to the Lord President of the Council by the end of July.The Lord President of the Council should have early informaldiscussions with the National Staff Side to explain theGovernments intentions and  so far as possible to secure theirco-operation.    Departmental Ministers should then arrange forany necessary consultation with their own Departmental StaffSides in order to explore options in more detail.    But it should bemade clear at this stage that no final decisions would be taken bythe Cabinet until later in the year.    Options presenting seriouspolicy problems should be considered by the appropriate CabinetCommittees as necessary.    The Lord President of the Councilshould then submit firm proposals covering the whole of theCivil Service and related bodies to the Cabinet for decision inSeptember.    On the question of short term reductions, Ministersshould report to the Lord President of the Council by 5 June onany exemptions they had authorised to the temporary ban onrecruitment, but it was important that these should be kept to anabsolute minimum.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Cwuacil and other Ministersconcerned to proceed accordingly.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(79) 15) on Refugees from Vietnam.THE HOME SECRETARY said that his paper had been writtenbefoie the decision to admit the 900 refugees abrard the MV Sibonga.Since 1975 the United Kingdom had accepted over 1, 900 Indo-i Chinese people for resettlement.    The previous Administrationhad agreed in January to admit a further 1, 500 Vietnameserefugees, Ufa whom 250 had come from each of Malaysia andThailand and 400 from Hong Kong, out of an agreed quota of1, 000.    There was careful selection of those to be admitted,taking account of genuine desire to live in the United Kingdom,knowledge of English and the possession of skills.    Many of therefugees, however, did not want to come to Britain.    The exercisewas proceeding sensibly and could be viewed separately from theproblem of the boat people.    As regards the MV Sibonga refugees,arrangements were now being made by the voluntary organisationsto receive those who wished to come.    There would be some costES FROMM6CONFIDENTIAL54
CONFIDENTIALto the Exchequer, which would be a claim on the ContingencyReserve.    If it were necessary to go beyond MY Sibonga andMV Roach Bank, now off Taiwan, it would be necessary to takeover army camps and to incur very considerable expenditure.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that under the 1910 BrusselsConvention on Assistance and Salvage at Sea, implemented inUnited Kingdom law by the Maritime Conventions Act 1911,Masters of ships were obliged to rescue people in peril at sea.The draftsmen of this and subsequent Conventions did not havethe situation of refugees principally in mind.    It was customaryinternational law that rescued people should be put ashore at thenext scheduled port, or the nearest convenient port;  and thecountry concerned was required to admit them.    The nextscheduled port for the MV Sibonga had been Hong Kong.    In thecase of the MV Roach Bank it was a port in Taiwan;  Hong Kongwas the next subsequent port.    If Taiwan refused to take therefugees Hong Kong would have no legal obligation to accept them.In discussion it was stressed that we should use every means topersuade Taiwan to honour its obligations to the 290 refugeesaboard the MV Roach Bank, 80 per cent of whom were said to bechildren.    Failing this, a quick decision would be needed onwhether to admit them to the United Kingdom, taking account ofpublic feelings on the matter.    Any decision not to acceptrefugees rescued by United Kingdom ships, who were notresettled elsewhere, would affect British shipping interests inFar Eastern waters.    The shipping industry itself seemedhowever to be reaching the conclusion that British ships shouldkeep clear of Vietnamese waters as far as possible. Certainlywe could not take more than a strictly limited number ofVietnamese refugees given the number of immigrants alreadyhere and the density of our population.    As regards financialarrangements, it would be appropriate to use the ContingencyReserve to meet additional costs arising from the reception ofthe refugees from the Sibonga and, if necessary, the Roach Bank,but there must be no open-ended commitment.    In view of thepotential size of the exodus from Vietnam, urgent considerationby the United Nations of the refugee problem was vital.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thequota of 1, 500 Vietnamese refugees agreed by the previousAdministration should stand;   some of the refugees from theMV Sibonga and, if necessary, MV Roach Bank should besubsumed within that total so far as practicable.     There could beno automatic acceptance in this country of refugees landed inHong Kong by United Kingdom registered vessels;  nor should anygeneral undertaking be given to accept refugees rescued byUnited Kingdom ships who were not resettled elsewhere. Casesshould be looked at on their merits where that was necessary.CONFIDENTIAL55
CONFIDENTIALNo announcement of policy on these points need be made; ifquestioned, it should be made clear that the United Kingdomwould abide by international law.    She would send a telegramto the United Nation&quot; Secretary-General, urging him in thestrongest terms to convene an early conference of Member Statesto consider the problem of Vietnamese refugees.    The greatestpossible pressure should be maintained on the Taiwan Governmentto persuade them to accept the refugees from the MV Roach Bank.If this proved unsuccessful the Cabinet had authorised her todecide, in consultation with the Home Secretary and the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary, whether these refugees should beaccepted in the United Kingdom.    Any extra cost falling onGovernment Departments as a result of dealing with theadditional numbers of refugees immediately in prospect shouldbe met out of the Contingency Reserve.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that theoil supply position remained tight, and would be likely todeteriorate further following the decision of the United StatesGovernment the previous day to subsidise oil imports.    It seemedunlikely however that any drastic action to reduce consumptionwould be necessary during the course of the summer. HisDepartment were working closely with the oil companies. Theaim would be to ensure that adequate stocks were built up fornext winter.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office31 May 19798CONFIDENTIAL58
SECRETIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 4th Conclusions, Minute 3COPY NO35Thursday 31 May 1979 at 10.30 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services (C(79) 14) about the treatment of the shortfallin the rates of short term social security benefits which hadoccurred in the November 1978 uprating and the prospects forshortening the time between announcing changes in benefits andtheir implementation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FCSR SOCIAL SERVICES said that on24 May Cabinet had agreed (CC(79) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 4)that the shortfall in the rates for long term benefits paid fromNovember 1978, which had underestimated the rise in earningsin the preceding 12 months by 1.9 per cent, should be made goodwhen this year&apos;s upratings were made.    But they had asked him toconsider further his proposal that the shortfall in short term benefits -sickness and unemployment benefits - should be treated in the sameway.    If this shortfall were not made up the savings would be about 10 million in 1979-80 and about  30 million in 1980-81. Againstthis gain had to be set the risk of charges of bad faith arising fromthe commitments which had been made during the election campaign.These undertakings had related only to pensioners but thesignificance of this distinction might not have sunk in. Likelyreaction had to be considered also in the context of the unpopularityof his other proposal to extend from three to six the number of&apos;waiting days1 before people could claim sickness or unemploymentbenefits.    This change could save about  40 million in 1979-80.To go also for the smaller saving by not making up the shortfall toshort term beneficiaries would exacerbate the hardship whichextending the waiting days would cause, especially for the unemployedwith large families.    He recommended that long and short termbeneficiaries should be treated alike by making up the shortfall inboth cases.    As regards the prospects for shortening the timebetween announcing improvements in benefits and their implementa-tion the possibility of bringing forward implementation could in hisview be ruled out as impracticable and too costly.    The other optionwould be to defer announcement beyond the Budget.    But given thelate start this year any further delay would jeopardise the timelypayment of the new rates.    Even on the present timetable there was1SECRET
SECRETa risk that some recipients would not receive the improved rates ofbenefits until after the due date.    In his view the new rates shouldbe announced at the time of the Budget.    Work was in hand to speedup implementation in the longer term but significant progress couldnot be expected in. less than two years.In discussion it was argued that the Government were not committedto making up the shortfall on short term benefits.    Not to do sowould be a positive contribution to widening the financial gap betweenthose in work and those out of work and discouraging the &quot;why work&quot;syndrome.    A reduction in public expenditure of  10 million in1979-80 and  30 million in 1980-81 was worthwhile.    Saving in thisarea would be less unpopular than the proposal to increase thenumber of waiting days for sickness and unemployment benefits.Such a proposal might well be defeated in Parliament as similarproposals had been in the past.    Its implications required widerconsideration than had so far been possible between the Ministersmost closely concerned before Cabinet could reach a decision.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet&apos;s provisional judgment was that the shortfall in short termpayments should not be made good and that the number of waitingdays before sickness and unemployment benefits could be claimedshould not be increased.    Equivalent savings would however have tobe found in the Social Services budget.    The Secretary of State forSocial Services should discuss these matters further with theSecretary of State for Employment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.If possible they should agree on a package which met the Cabinet1 swishes.    Any difficulties should be reported to the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy (E) at their meeting on 1 June.As to the possibility of reducing the period between announcementsof changes in social security rates and their implementation theCabinet accepted that nothing could be done this year.    But theyattached importance to achieving such a reduction in the future andinvited the Secretary of State for Social Services to consider furtherand report on how improvements to that end could be accelerated.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Cffice31 May 19792SECRET58
