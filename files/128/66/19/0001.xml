CONFIDENTIAL[nt/RY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2.        The Cabinefs discussion is recorded separately.3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the successful visit of PrimeMinister Hua Guofeng of China, which was still in progress, waspolitically significant given China&apos;s size and potential and her changingattitude towards the West.    He had proved open and friendly in manner,with clear if predictable views on most international issues.Immediate commercial results were not expected;  decisions on possibleorders would no doubt be considered after the Chinese delegation hadreturned to China.    But our position on Harrier sales had been madeclear, and the Chinese had shown close and informed interest in a widerange of British industries.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that reportswhich had appeared in the United States of a nuclear explosion in the areaof Southern Africa were unfortunate.    The implication was, of course,that South Africa had exploded a nuclear bomb, at a time when a build-upof international criticism of the South Africans at this juncture coulddamage our interests, eg in Rhodesia and Namibia.    This was the moreunfortunate in that, to the best of our knowledge, there was not enoughevidence to conclude that any nuclear explosion had in fact occurred.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL2H8
SECRET4.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Federal GermanChancellor, at her   meeting with him in Bonn the previous day, hadshown understanding for our objectives on the Community budget, andwould not himself be an obstacle to our achieving them;  but he had givenher a clear warning that ether member states, including some of thesmaller countries who were doing exceptionally well out of the existingbudgetary arrangements, would argue that we should not now expect torenegotiate yet again the terms on which we had entered the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC).    We should clearly have a battle to geteven the major part of what we expected by way of relief to our netbudget contribution during the financial year 1980-81.In a brief discussion it was suggested that we had a particularly difficultnegotiating hand to play:  we had to strike a balance between a desirabledemonstration of the strength of domestic public opinion in support of theGovernments position and inviting a very adverse reaction from thatpublic opinion if at the European Council at Dublin we achievedsomething lesr than our full negotiating objectives.    It had beennecessary and right to take a strcng position, in order to ensure thatother member states were a wire of the political importance for theGovernment of dealing satisfactorily with the issue.    The underlyingtruth was that our membership of the EEC was at stake in theGovernment1 s insistence upon a result that was reasonable and fair,though, if the matter ever came to that point, the advantages as well asthe disadvantages of our membership would need to be very carefullyweighed.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that ata meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) earlier in the week theCommission had been encouraged to bring forward new proposals on theCommon Fisheries Policy and the French had now agreed to have furtherbilateral talks.    These developments were helpful.    At a subsequentinformal meeting with Ministers only, Commissioner Gundelach hadoutlined his plans for dealing with the cash crisis facing the CommonAgricultural Policy.    Most Ministers had agreed that there was a crisis,but they had reservations about the Commission^ plans to cut quotas forsugar and to impose a levy on milk producers.    As to sheepmeat, theCommission had now informed the French Government that, unless theytook measures to open their market for sheepmeat in compliance withthe judgment of the European Court, before the end of the week, afurther case would be taken to the Court.    No progress had been madetowards agreeing upon a Community sheepmeat regime.In a brief discussion it was suggested that, if the French continued to actillegally, this would give us an extra card to play in the negotiations onthe budget.    On the other hand, it could create difficulties over the2SECRETQ
SECRETimplementation of the Court&apos;s ruling on tachographs, where for themoment there did not seem to be very widespread support for thethreatened industrial action.The Cabinet -Took note.SECRET3
CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(79) 48) setting out the cash limits proposed for thenationalised industries in the financial year 1980-81.    They alsoconsidered letters and minutes from the Secretary of State for Energy(25 October, 30 October and 31 October) about the cash limits for theNational Coal Board, for the electricity industry for England and Wales,and for the British Gas Corporation, and from the Secretary of State forScotland dated 31 October about the cash limits for the ScottishElectricity Boards.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that, since the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s paper had been circulated, provisional agreementhad been reached in correspondence on cash limits for the energyindustries, in line with decisions taken in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy,    The cash limits proposed were derived from thepublic expenditure and pricing decisions already taken by Ministers,from the industries&apos; own forecasts of revenue, and from the Treasury&apos;sinternal economic forecasts.    The inflation assumptions on which theyrested were broadly compatible with those adopted by the Cabinet for theRate Support Grant (RSG).    The cash limits were, however, of adifferent character from those which applied to local authority or centralgovernment expenditure.    They were limits on the provision of externalfinance, which was the difference between the finance generated from theindustries&apos; internal resources and their total financial requirements.They thus differed from other cash limits, and the Chancellor of theExchequer considered that it would be more sensible to refer to them infuture as &quot;external financing limits&quot; rather than &quot;cashlimits1&apos;as suggestedby the Nationalised Industries Chairrnen&apos;s Group.     The Chairmen&apos;s Group hadalso suggested (in a letter which was annexed to the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s paper) a single global cash limit for all the nationalisedindustries.    He proposed to reject this approach, which would diffusefinancial responsibility and control.    The other points in the Group&apos;sletter should be explored in discussion with the Chairmen, but it shouldbe made clear to them that the Government had already agreed thelimits to apply to 1980-81.     If the Cabinet endorsed the figures nowproposed, he suggested that the sponsor Ministers should discuss theindividual figures with the Chairmen concerned, and that the completeset of limits should be published in the middle of November, at the sametime as the Government announced its decisions on the RSG.In discussion there was general support for the approach to cash limitsfor the nationalised industries set out in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s paper.    It was, however, suggested that the particularfigures proposed for British Rail and the National Bus Company weretoo low, and would lead to politically unacceptable fare increases.There were also difficulties over the figure for British Airways whichrequired further examination.    The limits proposed for the BritishSteel Corporation and for the Post Office had been agreed, but theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCabinet should recognise that difficult decisions on plant closures andon pricing would be needed to keep within them.    It was also suggestedthat the allowances made for wage costs might in some cases beunrealistically low.    If insistence on such low limits led to strike action,the result might be that the industries would be forced   inescapably intoeven larger breaches of their cash limits than they would if theyconceded a slightly more generous wage settlement.    Against this, itwas argued that the Cabinet had already approved the main lines onwhich cash limits should be set for the nationalised industries, and thatthe figures concerned had, with minor exceptions, been agreed with theresponsible Ministers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet now approved the cash limits set out in Annex A to C(79) 48, asmodified and supplemented in later correspondence, with the exceptionof those for British Rail, the National Bus Company, and the BritishAirways Board.    The Cabinet saw force in the arguments advanced bythe Ministers concerned for higher cash limits for those industries thanthose proposed by the Treasury, and noted that the Chief Secretary,Treasury, was prepared to consider sympathetically appropriateadjustments.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Ministersconcerned should agree revised figures accordingly in the next few days.The Cabinet were in agreement that the sponsor Ministers should informthe Chairmen of the industries of the Cabinet1 s decisions;  that theChancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for the approved limits tobe published on or about the date of the Governments announcementabout the RSG;  that the date of publication should be discussed andagreed among the Ministers responsible for nationalised industries andthose responsible for the RSG;  and that the Chancellor of the Exchequershould then reply to the Nationalised Industries Chairmen&apos;s Group on thelines suggested in paragraph 12 of his paper.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.CONFIDENTIAL5
CONFIDENTIAL6,        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that asubstantial majority of the workforce appeared to have voted for themanagement1 s restructuring plans in the recent ballot.    The Governmentwould now come under strong pressure to provide the necessary financeto carry through the plans0    There was already i.215 million providedin the Public Expenditure Survey for this purpose, out of the original 1, 000 million set aside for British Leyland;  but the managementwas expected to seek a further  200 million for the restructuring plans.Sir Michael Edwardes had made it clear that he would not ask for thismoney if the restructuring plan was not substantially supported in theballot, and was being scrupulously fair m making it clear that theGovernment was not committed to provide this money. Ministersshould avoid giving ai^y impression in public that the result of theballot necessarily made provision of the additional finance certain.One important factor to which Ministers would need to have regardwould be the attitude of the workforce in the &amp;%j.7 3nt wage negotiations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatMinisters would need to consider the future of British Leyland shortly,and the Secretary of State for Industry should bring forward proposalswhen he was ready.The Cabinet -Took note.6CONFIDENTIAL243
CONFIDENTIAL7.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(79) 50), the Lord President of the Council (C(79) 55),the Secretary of State for Energy (C(79) 53), and the Minister ofTransport (C(79) 52), about the future of Vehicle Excise Duty (VED).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his memorandum,and the attached report by officials, set out the arguments for andagainst the abolition of VED.    Although there were a number ofsubsidiary arguments, the main question was whether a decision todispense with a tax which raised a considerable amount of revenue,whose loss would have to be and could only be replaced by increasingthe petrol duty, would be justified in order to achieve savings of littlemore than 1, 000 staff.    VED was already bringing in some 875 million per annum, and if this were revalorised for only one year&apos;sinflation, the income would be in excess of  1, 000 million.    To recoupthe same revtJiue from an addition to petrol duty would add 19jp now,and a further 6^p later to match the yiwld of a revalorised VED.    In hisview increases in petrol duty would be less publicly acceptable thanincreases in VED, particularly since motorists would still face theinconvenience of registration   with an annual fee of say  5, even if VEDwere abolished.    There were other disadvantages, too:  in particular,the disabled, who were currently exempt from VED, would lose abenefit and would demand concessionary petrol prices in lieu.    In hisview it was inconceivable that the Government should give up theflexibility afforded by such a large independent source of tax, inexchange for administrative savings which might amount to onlv about 15 million per annum.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the staff savingsassociated with abolition would make a major contribution to thetargets for reductions in the Civil Service.    The VED was an unpopulartax, whose abolition would be widely welcomed, and evasion was high.The disadvantages of abolition were not as great as was suggested, andhe would favour that course.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he would favourabolition on energy-saving grounds.    The pump price of petrol in theUnited Kingdom was the lowest in Europe, and an increase in petrolprice of 19p, to compensate for the loss of VED, would result insignificant fuel savings without altering the burden of motoringtaxation.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that in Opposition the Governmenthad taken up a clear position against the abolition of VED.    If the taxwas retained, it would still be possible to achieve substantial, thoughlesser, savings in manpower in the Civil Service, by simplification ofVED, and by arranging for part of the work to be done by the Post Office.He would favour retention of the tax, coupled with efforts to achieve thestaff savings which he had mentioned.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that in view of the clear policy stance adoptedin Opposition, on which supporters had relied during the Election,strong arguments would be needed to justify a change ot view now. V..Although VED was an unpopular tax, the retention of registration, with a 5 fee, combined with a higher petrol price, would considerablydiminish the attraction of abolition to the motorist.    There was roomfor argument about the effect on the rural motorist, but there wasundoubtedly a strong belief among residents of rural areas that a changeof this kind would be to their disadvantage.    There was evidence tosuggest that the change would be particularly disadvantageous forresidents of the Highlands of Scotland.    The financial consequences forthe disabled, and the argument that some supplementary help for thisgroup would be needed in petrol tax was increased, was already a sourceof pressure from the relevant groups.In discussion it was suggested that, if it was decided to retain the VED,no firm announcement need be made until the next Budget statement, andthat questions meanwhile would be deflected by saying that the future ofthe tax was still under review.    On the other hand it would be desirableto make progress on the changes to achieve staff savings, and thiswould involve consultation with Staff Sides and with the Post Office. Itseemed unlikely that news of the decision could be held back until theBudget, and it might therefore be preferable to end any uncertainty atan earlier date.    In considering the possibility of moving from fourmonths to six months licences, it was suggested that some usersmight well prefer to be able to tax a vehicle for the summer period, andleave it untaxed for the winter.    Any move to six-monthly licencesshould be arranged with this factor in mind.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that strongarguments were needed to justify a major change in taxation policy.The Cabinet had concluded that VED should be retained.    The Ministerof Transport should seek vigorously to achieve all possible savings inthe staff employed on this work by simplifying the tax, and bytransferring of work to the Post Office, on the lines suggested in hismemorandum.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should considerfurther the question of an announcement, and its timing, and shouldreport his conclusions to the Cabinet at an early date.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport to be guided accordingly.8CONFIDENTIAL245

SECRETSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79)19th Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 1 November 1979 at 10. 00 amTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatBishop Muzorewa had now accepted our proposals for the transition toindependence.    It was a major concession for him to have agreed to theRhodesian Parliament being dissolved, and to himself and his Ministersceasing to exercise their functions during the election period. Nomore could be expected.    The Patriotic Front remained opposed,formally to the whole of our proposals, particularly strongly to theshortness of the transitional period and to the role proposed for theexisting police force.    It might be possible for them to be brought toovercome their objections;  but it was possible that Mr Mugabe and(more reluctantly) Mr Nkomo would walk out of the Lancaster HouseConference.    In these circumstances the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary intended to table our proposals in definitive form on2 November and to call for the Front1 s reply by 5 November.    Only ifthey agreed would the Conference move on to consider arrangements fora ceasefire, which would be the most difficult problem of all.    If theFront withdrew, we would carry out our transitional plan in agreementwith Bishop Muzorewa.    We could not then expect much generalinternational support.    But at least some of our European EconomicCommunity partners should be with us; the United States Congresswould certainly be sympathetic;  and it was to be hoped - though it wasnot certain - that the United States Government would also support us.Meanwhile urgent action needed to be taken in Parliament here, giventhat Section 2 of the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965 (and thereby sanctionson indirect trade with Rhodesia) would lapse on 15 November. Arenewal of the Section 2 sanctions could be passed through the House ofCommons only on the basis of Opposition support (and perhaps not at allin the House of Lords):  given the views of many of the Governmentssupporters and the willingness of Bishop Muzorewa to accept theGovernments proposals, that course would not be politically tolerable.An interim Enabling BiU would need to be passed before 15 November,under which the British Government could by Order appoint theGovernor, promulgate the new Constitution and briefly maintainSECRET247
SECRETsanctions on direct trade with Rhodesia in order to protect our positionat the United Nations until legality was restored following theGovernor1 s arrival.    Later in November a second Bill would benecessary under which independence would be conferred at the end ofthe transitional period.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s poHcy andproposals.    The Parliamentary and public handling of these proposals,which were likely to be very controversial, would be difficult andcontentious, and would require the utmost care and attention.    She andthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Lord Privy Seal wouldoffer to brief the Leader of the Opposition and Shadow Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary on Privy Counsellor terms at a meeting on2 November.    On 5 November Rhodesia would be considered by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee;  and the GovernmentsParliamentary supporters should be briefed.    Notice of the EnablingBill would be given on that same day;  the Bill would then be tabled on6 November and arrangements made for a Second Reading debate on8 November.    This would entail a change of Parliamentary businessfrom that proposed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster earlierin the meeting, and therefore a revised business statement.    Despite thetightness of the timetable, it should be possible for the Bill to beconsidered by the House of Lords on 12 November and receive the RoyalAssent by 14 November.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office2 November 1979SECRET248
CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THEPROPEB.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT35COPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(?9) 19th Conclusions, Minute 8Thursday 1 November 1979 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of the0 Council (C(79) 51) reporting the results of the discussions which he andhis Minister of State, together with the Minister of State, Treasury(Lord Cockfield), had had with Departmental Ministers on the proposalto save at least 10 per cent on staff costs.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Cabinet had agreedin principle to seek savings of up to 10 per cent, on the understandingthat this would require savings of at least this size from the largestDepartments in order to achieve the overall total.    The results of theh discussions with Departmental Ministers, which were summarised inis. his paper, had been disappointing.    Firm offers of staff savingsamounted to barely 6 per cent or about  250 million a year.    This wasa gross figure, and the net savings would be rather smaller.    Some ofthe options would require legislation;  others - not allowed for in the6 per cent - required difficult policy decisions still to be taken. Thedecision which the Cabinet had just taken on Vehicle Excise Duty wouldmake it still more difficult to reach the target of 10 per cent.    He wasconvinced that many Departments could improve on the offers they hadmade.    But this would take time.    Meanwhile, the Government wascommitted to make an announcement in the autumn about the next stepsin its review of manpower.    On the basis of decisions already taken oroffers made, it would only be possible to announce that some 6 per centhad been achieved.    That would be regarded by many of theGovernments supporters as inadequate.    It would therefore benecessary to make it clear that this was only an interim report, andthat the search for savings would continue.    It would be possible tooffer a further report at a later date - say, next spring;  but it would beunwise to offer a hostage to fortune by suggesting any specific aewtarget which might, in the event, be incapable of achievement.In discussion there was general agreement that the Cabinet neededclearer information about the position already reached in bilateraldiscussions.    It was obvious that some major decisions remained to be1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtaken, including those listed in Annex 4 to the Lord President of theCouncil&apos;s paper, and that it would be unwise to take credit for these atsuch an early stage.     There were a number of other smaller decisions,not separately listed but still included in the figures in Annex 3 to thepaper, which could well prove very difficult to carry through. Forexample, the overall savings attributed to the Department of Health andSocial Security would require the replacement of the wheelchair service by cashgrants which would be highly controversial.    Some of the. savings in theRevenue Departments assumed the abolition of existing tax concessions,and might be equally difficult to obtain.     Others depended on expensivebudgetary decisions which could not yet be taken.    The total staff savingsshown might require up to  1 billion of tax revenue to be forgone. Someof the savings shown for other Departments were the consequence ofpolicy decisions which ought to be considered and presented in their ownright on policy grounds, ftotfor their effects on Civil Service manpower.For example, the decision to make employers responsible for the firstsix weeks of sick pay was part of the Governments general strategy onincentives, ar?d should not be justified on the grounds of the manpowereconomies which would result.     On the other hand, there were savings inthe list which might be criticised as likely to have damagingconsequences:  for example, the reduction in the Statistical Service ofthe Customs and Excise, though the Secretary of State for Trade wasconfident that this particular saving could be made without damage to theusefulness of the trade figures.    It was also suggested that the figuresin the paper, because they concentrated solely on reductions in man-power, might give a misleading impression of the future size of theCivil Service.    There were potential increases in staff which might benecessary and justifiable in their own right but would reduce the netsavings in staff numbers.    For example, the Home Office wouldprobably need to recruit additional staff to license &quot;citizens1 band&quot; radio,but could cover the additional cost from licence fees.    The Departmentof Energy were taking over functions from the British National OilCorporation which could be better discharged within Government andwould protect the yield from Petroleum Revenue Tax, but the staff couldnot be found within existing complements.    Some flexibility was there-fore desirable.Much bigger savings were expected from current reviews in a number ofDepartments.    The Ministry of Defence, which had already reduced itsnumbers by 10 per cent in the past few years, at a time when the rest ofthe Civil Service had increased by 14 per cent, had set in hand a numberof major reviews of organisation which might yield substantial furthersavings.    But the results of these would not be known until the spring.Meanwhile, the Chiefs of Staff were seriously worried at the impositionof any arbitrary cuts which might impair the efficiency of the ArmedServices.    Similarly, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,in the first weeks of the new Government, had set in hand a completemanagement review of hie Department.    But this would not be completeduntil the following year and meanwhile it might be premature to score anysavings in that area.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn further discussion it was suggested that the operations carried out bythe Lord President of the Council had concentrated on the elimination ofexisting functions.     This was an important task, but equally largesavings might be had from improving the efficiency with which existingfunctions were carried out.    For example, in the Department of theEnvironment, the staff in post when the Government took office had beenabout 97. 5 per cent of the authorised complement.    Staff in post hadalready been reduced to 95 per cent of complement total, and by1 April 1980, the figure should be 89 per cent.    This had been achievedby tight control of recruitment and replacement of staff, exercised underthe close and regular personal supervision of the Secretary of State forthe Environment himself.    Only in this way could Ministerial attentionbe focused on the whole range of Departmental activities. Thisapproach required an information system tailored to the circumstancesof each individual Department.    Each Minister should normally be ableto arrange thi? within the resources of his own Department, but wherethis was not possible (for example, in the case of the smallDepartments responsible to the Lord Chancellor) the Civil ServiceDepartment might be asked to assist.    It was also suggested thatSir Derek Rayner and his team might help Ministers in the pursuit ofeconomies of this kind, though it was also pointed out thatSir Derek Rayner operated by drawing on staff from the Departmentsconcerned, and that the Cabinet had already approved the way in whichhis work should be carried further.In further discussion it was argued that the Staff Side would need someearly reassurance that the Government had now reached final decisions.In some cases, Departments had more than met their objectives, but theStaff Side would fear that, because other Departments had not done so,still further cuts were in prospect.    If it came to be felt that the cutsalready offered were only the first of a series of rounds of cuts, therewas a real danger of militant action.    Against this, it was argued thatthe eearch for staff savings was a continuing exercise.    As alreadydemonstrated, it was part of good departmental management.    The bestapproach might be to announce the firm decisions which the Governmentwould be able to take in the next few weeks, and not to suggest that therewas to be a further cuts exercise, but to make it clear that the review offunctions and the improvement of efficiency would be a part of thecontinuing process of good management in every Department. TheCabinet would wish to consider the text of any general statement of thiskind.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed that Government should not take credit for manpower reductionsdepending on decisions which had not yet been taken.    A number of majoroutstanding issues remained to be settled, either within the responsibleDepartments, or by the appropriate Committees of the Cabinet.    As afirst step, the Lord President of the Council should bring before Cabinet3CONFIDENTIAL251
CONFIDENTIALtwo revised lists, the first to show a complete and comprehensiveaccount of savings offered and agreed by Departmental Ministers, wheredecisions had been taken or could be taken without further ado, and thesecond showing those which still required policy decisions.    Each listshould identify those savings or decisions which required legislation.At the same time he should circulate a text of the announcement he mightmake at the conclusion of the present manpower exercise, reflecting theline suggested in discussion.    A co-ordinated approach to Staff Sideswould be required.    Until this had been agreed, Ministers should notreply to their individual Departmental Staff Sides.    It was known that themanpower exercise was being discussed in Cabinet that day;  if therewere questions, Ministers should make it clear that no decisions had beentaken on particular proposals to reduce staffs.    All Ministers shouldtake steps to set up monitoring systems of the kind described by theSecretary of State for the Environment, so as to allow them to exercisecloser scrutiny on a continuing and regular basis of the recruitment andreplacement of staff.    In case of difficulty, they should seek the supportof the Civil Service Department.    The results of that scrutiny inDepartments should be regularly reported to the Civil ServiceDepartment, whose task it would be to co-ordinate Departmental returnsand report to the Lord President of the Council and the Prime Minister.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited the LordPresident of the Council and other Ministers toproceed accordingly.Cabinet Office2 November 19794CONFIDENTIAL252
