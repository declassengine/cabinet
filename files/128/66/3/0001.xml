Excessive secrecy-had attached to such matters in the past.    She intended to reply thatshe had established four Standing Committees of the Cabinet - theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee, the Economic StrategyCommittee, the Home and Social Affairs Committee and theLegislation Committee - and to give the names of their Chairmen.She would say that attendance at these Committees would varyaccording to the subject under discussion;  and that, where appropriate,Sub-Committees of the Standing Committees would be established.She would make it clear, however, that membership and terms ofreference of the Standing Committees and their Sub-Committeeswould remain confidential.The Cabinet -Took note.tEIGNrAIRSitegic Armsdtation Talksviouserence:79) 2ndelusion tute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thathe had had valuable talks with the United States Secretary of State,Mr Vance, who had personally given him a positive assurance aboutthe effect of the non-circumvention provision in the Strategic ArmsLimitation Talks (SALT) II Agreement on any requirements we mighthave for maintaining the effectiveness of the British deterrent.This assurance was confidential at this stage but if asked about thispoint in the House, the Prime Minister might safely say that wewere confident that our interests would be safeguarded.thernicaTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPresident Carter of the United States would shortly have to makea determination about whether the Muzorewa Government compliedwith the conditions of the Case-Javits Amendment.    It was likelythat he would say that it did not, but that he would keep the positionunder review.    It was however doubtful whether this would satisfythe Senate.    We were about to embark on a round of consultationsin Southern Africa.    The immediate problem was to take steps toCONFIDENTIAL39
CONFIDENTIALavoid mandatory sanctions in relation to Namibia and the ParliamentaryUnder-Secretary of State, Mr Luce, would shortly be going out to thearea where he would visit Windhoek and also make contact with theSouth West African People&apos;s Organisation.    A senior Foreign andCommonwealth Office official would go to Salisbury in order tomaintain close contacts with the Muzorewa Government, but thiswould not involve recognition or full diplomatic representation. Healso intended that a political emissary should leave shortly for widerconsultations with African Governments on the question of our policytowards the Muzorewa Government.    He expected to be able toannounce the name of this emissary next week.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE HOME SECRETARY drew attention to the problem presentedby refugees from Vietnam.    There were already some 32, 000 incamps in Hong Kong, many of whom we might be obliged to acceptin the United Kingdom.    We were committed by a decision of theprevious Government to accept in the United Kingdom any refugeesrescued at sea by British ships.    There were already 1,800 refugeesin this country and they involved a heavy pressure on our resources.Although the voluntary bodies were said to be optimistic about theirability to handle the problem it was likely to represent an increasingburden on local authorities, who would have to provide facilities forEnglish teaching and other amenities.    He would prepare a paperon the problem for consideration by his colleagues at an earlymeeting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe immediate issue was what should be done about the 900 refugeeson a British ship which was at present stationed off Hong Kong. Thesolution would probably be to take them into Hong Kong.    It washowever sssential that the general question should be raised urgentlyin the appropriate international forum as a matter on which actionshould be taken by the international community as a whole. Whilewe should not discourage British ships from rescuing Vietnameserefugees in trouble in the sea, we could not accept that this involvedus automatically in a commitment to take those rescued for settlementin the United Kingdom.    In answer to questions we should take theline that while we were ready to fulfil our obligations, we regardedthe matter as essentially one for the international community as awhole and were taking steps to raise it internationally.    The Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary should pursue this.    The Home Secretaryshould circulate a paper, as suggested, for consideration by theCabinet.2CONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidhe would be representing the Government on Monday,    28 May, forthe signature in Athens of the Treaty for the accession of Greece tothe European Communities.    The Sub-Committee on EuropeanQuestions of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had met theprevious day and would be sugggesting how Ministers could put overthe problem of our budget contribution in any contacts with othermember States.THE PRIME MINISTER said that during her recent meeting withMr Roy Jenkins, the President of the Commission, she had stressedthe importance of the budget problem.    Mr Jenkins had agreed thatthe Commission would help with the presentation of an agreedstatement of the facts and, if asked by the European Council, wouldaccept a remit to come up with possible solutions.In a brief discussion the tactical advantage in having recommendationsfor remedial action coming from the Commission was stressed.There was evidence that for the first time the Germans were nowready to acknowledge that we had a real problem.    The French werestill being difficult even about the presentation of the issue to theforthcoming European Council meeting in Strasbourg and this wouldneed to be pursued at the forthcoming meeting between the PrimeMinister and President Giscard.The CabinetTook note.CON FJ DENTJ AL41
CONFIDENTIALUTYriNGS4. The Cabinets discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.3j5	W OF	C	JDITURE8	IA.MMESB	UD	nee:	2nd	sions,5. The Cabinet considered two memoranda by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury (C(79) 10 and 11) about the reductions whichwould be needed in the expenditure plans inherited from theprevious Government for the years up to 1983-84.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Governmentsobjective was to reduce expenditure, by the end of the presentParliament, to the level reached in 1977-78.    This required verysubstantial cuts in the plans established by the previous AdministrationThe Cabinet would require a wide range of options within which toexercise its political choice.    The paper was designed to secure a jreport from officials, which Cabinet could consider later in thesummer, setting out options which would allow the target to bereached.There was wide agreement with this general approach although anumber of reservations were expressed about particular programmes.For example, a wider range of expenditures in Northern Ireland, thanin Great Britain, had a law and order content.    The Social Securityprogramme was largely demand-determined.    In the agricultureprogramme, there were a number of items which were eitherdefence-related or financed by the European Community budget.There might also be particular difficulty about making cuts in theeducational programme on the scale suggested, notwithstanding thereduction in the school population.    Equally however there wereelements within the law and order programme, eg the fire service,where cuts could and would be sought.    In each case, however, itwas essential that Ministers should be presented with a wide rangeof political choices when they came to take final decisions in thesummer.In further discussion, it was suggested that the cutr considered bythe Party when in Opposition (C(79) 10) had not always been workedout in sufficient detail for lack of information.    While taking theminto account therefore Ministers should work within the frameworkset by the Chief Secretary1 s paper (C(79) 11).    The initial processof identifying potential cuts would inevitably involve looking at someoptions that would turn out to be unreal and which it would be unwiseto deploy in consultation with local authority associations and othersoutside central Government.    Ministers faced with the need for suchconsultations should first seek to identify such unreal options and toagree with the Treasury, and other colleagues where necessary, thatthey should not be put forward in the consultative process. Similarconsiderations might apply to the nationalised industries.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn continued discussion, it was suggested that when Ministers cameto consider the complete report in the summer, they would need tolook at both the gross and net expenditure effects of reductions inpublic sector spending.    The presentation of public expenditurestatistics, and the monitoring information available to Ministers,also needed further attention.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a wide range of options should be deployed whenMinisters took final decisions on long term public expenditure planslater in the summer.    Meanwhile, no further long term commitmentsshould be entered into.    Departmental Ministers should arrange fortheir officials to identify options on the scale proposed in the ChiefSecretary1 s paper C(79) 11.    The reductions did not apply to theDefence or law and order programmes, for which some increasesmight be necessary:  nevertheless, every effort should be made toreduce waste in these services.    The approach to savings in theNational Health Service would be governed by the commitments madeduring the election campaign.   The full range of identified optionsshould be reported to the Treasury and brought together for considera-tion by the Cabinet at the end of June.    Ministers concerned withlocal authorities and other non-central Government bodies shouldfirst consider the options internally and in consultation as necessarywith the Treasury and other colleagues, with a view to eliminatingunreal options before entering into wider consultations:  the resultsof their consultations would nevertheless also need to be availableby the end of June.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should arrangefor a report to be made on the same time-scale about the potentialfor reducing borrowing by the nationalised industries.    After theBudget, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, should consider urgently the scope for improved presenta-tion of public expenditure statistics, both at the time of Ministerialdecisions and for internal control purposes during the course of thefinancial year.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minipter&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office24 May 19795CONFIDENTIAL43
ISCONFIDENTIALB)CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 24 May 1979 at 10. 30 am35DCIAL- CURITYPRATINGSThe Cabinot considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services (C(79) 9) seeking decisions on the policy fordetermining social security upratings due to take place inNovember 1979.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatexisting legislation required the Government to increase pensionsand other long term benefits in line with the increase in earningsor prices, whichever was the greater.    He now proposed that thisstatutory commitment should be limited, like other benefits, touprating in line with prices.    The Government&apos;s objective should befor pensioners to share in rising standards of living but the presentstatutory obligation was simply not sustainable on a year by yearbasis.    Firm forecasts for the November uprating in the currentyear would not be available until Budget time.    It was possiblethat the price forecast increase might be higher than earnings. Hispreference nevertheless was to legislate in the current session tobreak the earnings link.    A decision was also needed on the shortfallbetween the forecast used for the last uprating and the actual move-ment in earnings and prices.    The previous Administration hadannounced that they would take account of this at the next uprating.The Government had said that it would honour that commitment. Itwas, however, necessary to decide whether the increases due thisyear should be added to the existing level of benefits and the shortfallthen added to that sum or whether, as he preferred because it seemedthe most straightforward procedure, to add the shortfall to the existingrates before this year&apos;s uprating was made.    The latter course wouldcost about  10 million more.    He proposed that Child Benefit shouldbe left at  4 per week;  the premium paid to one parent families shouldbe increased from  2 to  2.50;  and Mobility Allowance be increasedfrom  10   to  12,    The Government were committed by theirManifesto to continue the Christmas bonus and he proposed that theyshould announce, as part of the uprating statement, that a  10 bonusshould be paid to the same categories as last year.    Given thecommitment to continue the bonus he proposed legislation to providefor this and for changes in the sum to be paid to be made by Order,1CONFIDENTIAL44
CONFIDENTIALThe overall package he proposed was extremely modest in publicexpenditure terms, but his proposals on breaking the links withearnings for long term benefits and for no increase to Child Benefitwould be controversial and bitterly opposed.In discussion there was general agreement that there should be earlylegislation to end the link between the uprating of long term benefits andearnings.    On the question of making up the shortfall in last year&apos;suprating it was argued that the Government&apos;s commitment related onlyto pensions and that it was not necessary to treat short term benefitsin the same way.    A saving of about  10 million could be made ifmaking up the shortfall were restricted to long term benefits; thiswould help to meet the costs of the other improvements proposed.Against this it was argued that a discriminatory approach would be verycontroversial and would reduce the real standard of living of those onshort term benefits.In further discussion there was a general welcome for the proposals onChild Benefit, on the premium payaDle to one-parent families, and onthe Mobility Allowance.    Although the previous Administration had notpaid the Christmas bonus every year it was argued strongly that theGovernments Manifesto commitment to continue the bonus meant puttingit on a permanent basis and legislating to that end.    Attention was alsodrawn to the desirability, if it proved practicable and the cost wasacceptable, of reducing the time-lag between announcing changes inbenefits and their implementation.    The inadequacies of the RetailPrice Index (RPI) as a measure of price changes were also noted,particularly its failure to reflect changes in direct taxation.    It would bedesirable for the legislation on uprating benefits to define price increasesin such a way as to cover alternatives to the RPI, currently underconsideration by officials.THE PP.IME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that there should be early legislation to limit thestatutory commitment to uprating long term benefits in line wilh prices.This decision should be announced at the time of the Budget.    It wasabsolutely essential that it did not become known before then and everycare should be taken to keep knowledge of the decision to the smallestpossible circle.    Great care was also necessary to avoid prematuredisclosure of likely price movements:  or subsequently praying thesein aid in defence of the scheme in a way which would encourageinflationary wage demands.    The Cabinet also agreed that long termbenefits should be increased by the established shortfall in the fore-casts used for last year&apos;s upratings.    This shortfall should be addedto existing levels of benefit before the current year&apos;s increase wasapplied to them.    The Cabinet saw merit in not increasing short termbenefits by the shortfall;  the Secretary of State for Social Servicesshould prepare a memorandum on this point for early consideration bycolleagues.    He should report also on the prospects for shortening thetime between announcement of changes in benefits and their implementa-tion.    In preparing legislation on uprating the Secretary of State for2CONFIDENTIAL45
CONFIDENTIALSocial Services should take account of the need to accommodatepossible future changes in the indices used for the purpose. TheCabinet also agreed that Child Benefit generally should be held at 4;  that the premium for one-parent families should be increasedto  2. 50;  and that the Mobility Allowance should be increased to 12.    In addition they agreed that their commitment to continue theChristmas bonus should be interpreted as meaning that it would bepaid on a continuing basis and not simply this year.    The Secretaryof State for Social Services should prepare legislation accordinglywhich would provide for the amount of the bonus, but not the range ofbeneficiaries, to be determined by Order.    Any further questions onpolicy relating to the bonus should be considered by the MinisterialCommittee on Home and Social Affairs.    The total additional costsof the decisions on upratings should be met in 1979-*80 from theContingency Reserve.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesshould consult further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer aboutthe possibility of the bonus being met in future years out of theNational Insurance Fund.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invitedthe Secretary of State for Social Services to beguided accordingly.Cabinet Office24 May 19793CONFIDENTIAL46
