CONFIDENTIAL1, THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had been concerned tojjy    read an article in the previous weekend&apos;s Sunday Telegraph whichpurported to quote verbatim remarks made by a number of seniorMinisters.    If the remarks were accurately reported they were inbreach of the coaventions of public life.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that thearticle had been a matter of serious concern to many members of theCabinet.    If such reports were repeated they would destroy all trustbetween Ministerial colleagues and undermine the basis of CabinetGovernment.    She had emphasised at the Cabinet&apos;s first meeting theimportance of maintaining the strictest standards of confidence inCabinet and between members of the Cabinet:  Ministers should remindthemselves of the minutes of that meeting and of the relevant paragraphsof Questions of Procedure for Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.KRY  2.        The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week and of the businessproposed for the remainder of the period up to Friday 27 July.    It wasintended that the House should rise for the Summer Recess on 27 Julyand return on Monday 29 October.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he intended to speak early in thedebate on capital punishment which was to take place on Thursday19 July.    In doing so he would be departing from the practice of hispredecessors, who had spoken at the end of previous debates on thissubject.    Unlike them however he would not be seeking to influence theHouse towards a particular conclusion.    He would set out as fairly g.spossible the considerations which should affect the decision in principleand the questions which would arise in drafting new legislation.Finally he would say that, having again considered the arguments, hewould himself vote against the Motion to restore capital punishment,but that if it were carried he and his Department would do everythingpossible to give effect to the wishes of the House and to ensure that anysubsequent Bill was soundly drafted.    The debate would take place onthe very general Early Day Motion which had been tabled in the name ofMr Eldon Griffiths and others;  it would be open to amendment but itssponsors would probably try to persuade other Members against tablingamendments or pressing them to a division.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1,       Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that in his view it wasessential for the Competition Bill to receive its Second Reading beforethe House of Commons rose for the Summer Recess, in order to get thecontroversy over the abolition of the Price Commission out of the way.It would be damaging to the Governments position to defer SecondReading until the autumn at a time when the Retail Price Index would bereaching a peak and the autumn round of pay negotiations at a criticalstage.    An early Second Reading would also provide constitutionaljustification for the disbanding of the Commission which was now goingahead.In discussion it was suggested that a debate on the Second Reading of theCompetition Bill could take the place of the proposed debate on regionalpolicy on 25 July.    The arrangements for that debate and for laying thenecessary Orders presented serious difficulty in relation to the forth-coming debate in Scottish Grand Committee on unemployment inScotland, and further problems would arise at the same time from theGovernments decisions on dispersal and from redundancies in theshipbuilding industry.    It was suggested that the announcement of theGovernments new regional policies could be deferred for    some weakswithout forgoing the expected savings provided the transitional period ofone year was shortened, and that the debate on the Orders could bedeferred until the autumn.    On the other hand it was argued that theannouncement must be made in the House of Comrions;  that any delayin making it could damage business confidence;  and that since theproposals were already being negotiated in Brussels an early announce-ment was needed to anticipate any possible leak from that source. Tljedateof the summer adjournment ought not to be postponed since the Housewould then have to sit while the Prime Minister and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary were at the Commonwealth Heads ofGovernment Meeting in Lusaka. .THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that arrangements should be made for the CompetitionBill to receive its Second Reading before the Summer Recess and thatthe date of the summer adjournment should not be postponed. Shewould consider with the Ministers principally concerned how thebusiness for the last few days before the Recess might be rearrangedfor this purpose.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatduring his visit to London the Secretary General of the United Nations,Dr Waldheim, would be informed of the satisfactory appointment ofSir James Murray as the Five Western Powers&apos; special envoy to discusswith the South African Government the difficult search for a settlementon Namibia.    On Rhodesia, the Organisation of African Unity meetingin Monrovia had adopted an unhelpful resolution which had, however,stopped short of recognising the Patriotic Front as the sole represen-tatives of the people of the territory.    Meanwhile Bishop Muzorewa&apos;sWashington talks with United States leaders seemed to have gone fairlywell, although he had been non-committal on political changes. Duringhis impending London visit we would be speaking to him along the lineswhich the Governments spokesman had taken in Parliament on 10 July.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted what the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had said.A question had been raised about the likelihood and nature of Nigerianaction against British interests in the Rhodesian context, with particularreference to the position of British Petroleum (BP) since this mightaffect the Governments plans for disposing of BP assets:  this would beconsidered by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.    It had alsobeen suggested that private legal proceedings might be taken againstBishop Muzorewa during his visit to London:  the Attorney Generalwould be urgently consulted about the possibility of this and whether inthat event it would be appropriate to issue a nolle prosequi.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said the Defenceand Oversea Policy Committee had concluded that on humanitariangrounds we should agree to take over a phased period of three years afurther 10, 000 Vietnamese refugees, who would include any picked up byour ships at sea but would otherwise come only from Hong Kong; andthat  5 million should be made available from the overseas aid budget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Committee&apos;s conclusion.    We should not announceour decision until next week, and should meanwhile tell Dr WaldheimCONFIDENTIAL&quot;
CONFIDENTIALonly that we hoped to be able to agree to the quota proposed by theHigh Commissioner for Refugees.    The announcement need not refer tothe fact that the refugees&apos; arrival would be phased, although the HomeSecretary would need to make clear (perhaps in answer to an arrangedSupplementary Question) that they could obviously not all arrive at once.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said theIrish had now assumed the Presidency of the Community for the oomingsix months.    He had visited Dublin the previous day for talks with theTaoiseach and the Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs.    He had stressedthat, if the Irish wished to make a success of their Presidency, theywould need to resolve our problems over the budget.    He had assuredthem that we were not trying to solve our problems at the expense ofthe Irish Republic.    The Lord President of the Council would berepresenting the Government at the inaugural session of the EuropeanParliament on 18 July.In a brief discussion it was reported that, as a result of discussionsbetween the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Commissioner Ortoli, itmight be possible at the forthcoming Council of Ministers (Finance) tofind an adequate way to protect our interests in connection with thepayment of interest rate subsidies to Italy and the Irish Republic underthe European Monetary System.    The Council was not expected todiscuss the United Kingdom budget problem butCommissioner Tugendhat had been urged to ensure chat theCommission^ factual analysis was available in time for discussion atthe September meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL

SECRETgffiNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 37CABINETureLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(79) 9th Conclusions Minute 5Thursday 12 July 1979 at 10. 30 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(79) 27) about the Economic Background to the PublicExpenditure decisions; three memoranda by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, one of which (C(79) 26) covered a report by officials onthe scope for reductions in public expenditure in the years 1980-81 to1983-84, one covered a report by officials on the investment andfinancing programmes of the nationalised industries for the same years(C(79) 28), and one (C(79) 25) contained his own recommendations forreductions in public expenditure; together with a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Education and Science (C(79) 29) about thescope for reductions in the Education Programme;  and a minutedated 10 July from the Secretary of State for the Environment to thePrime Minister, reporting on discussions with the Local AuthorityAssociations about reductions in public expenditure in those years.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, since comingto office, he had made a careful reappraisal of the country&apos;s economicprospects.    Our performance was deteriorating, and all theindicators were pointing in the wrong direction.    Inflation seemedlikely to rise fast, and this made it essential to maintain control overborrowing and the money supply.    The recent oil price increasesmade the situation worse.    The shape, though not the size, of theproblem was in line with what the Party had expected before theElection.    They had agreed then that there was no escape throughrelaxing the money supply and the borrowing requirement. Thiswould merely lead to greater inflation after a short-lived period offalse security.    Similarly, the tax cuts were crucial to the strategyand should not be forgone.    The forecast public sector borrowingrequirement (PSBR) for 1980-81 was made much higher by the likelyimpact of comparability settlements in the public sector and it wasnecessary to seek off-setting reductions.    All of this had led him andthe Chief Secretary to propose reductions of  6. 5 billion on theinherited plans for that year.    This implied a reduction of only1SECRET102
SECRET 1.5 billion (or about 2 per cent) on the current year&apos;s spendinglevels.    It would reduce expenditure, not to the target level of theout-turn of 1977-78, but about half way to that point, while leavingpublic expenditure at a constant share of about 42 per cent of thegross domestic product (GDP).    All this was necessary merely torecover lost ground.    The proposed levels for 1980-81 would notpermit any significant reduction in the level of taxation in the nextBudget, apart from the indexation of personal allowances, and itwould require the revalorisation of specific duties.    But it wouldreduce the PSBR from 4. 4 to 4.2 per cent of GDP, which was anessential step in the right direction.In discussion, it was suggested that the Government faced the mostserious dilemma in economic policy of any post-war Government.Inflation was rising fast, against the background of a strong pound,inflows of foreign currency, and a growing money supply.    This madeit essential to reduce the level of public expenditure and at least tostabilise the present level of taxation if not reduce it.    Against this,it was argued that the Government&apos;s strategy, as developed inOpposition and exemplified in the first Budget, had been overtakenby events.    Expenditure cuts on the scale now proposed, at a timewhen economic activity was declining and unemployment mounting,were no longer feasible or justified.    Massive redundancies werein prospect in many major public and private industries. TheCabinet should take into account the employment consequences ofthe cuts proposed, which might even wipe out many of the savingsby increased social security expenditure.    The policy might be wrongin other respects too:  by maintaining a high level of interest rates,which merely induced additional inflows into sterling, it deterredinvestment and increased industrial costs.    However, the real rateof return on new investment was still negative, and it was this whichmade it so difficult to sell more gilt edged stock and thus reduce thegrowth in the money supply.    Moreover, the strong inflows ofcurrency were not solely the result of interest rate differentials,but reflected confidence in the Government&apos;s economic policies.In further discussion, it was argued that the overall political effectsof the cuts proposed would be seriously damaging to the Government,both in the country and in the House of Commons.    They would beseen as inconsistent with many of the Manifesto pledges to improvestandards of service.  Many of the measures proposed would requirelegislation which would be very difficult to carry through the Houseof Commons.    It was quite possible that the cuts would be much morepolitically damaging than the alternative of holding or even increasingthe level of personal taxation.    It was further argued that there wereinsufficient positive measures to accompany the proposed reductions.The public needed to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Measures2SECRET
SECRETto encourage wealth creation, for example by support for smallbusinesses, needed to be included to offset some of the cuts, whichwould seriously reduce the level of Government support for industry.A number of so-called &quot;accelerator1 schemes of a positive kind werealready being studied urgently: these should be considered in thesame context as the expenditure cuts.In continued discussion, it was argued that the economic forecastson which the cuts were based were necessarily very imprecise.The reductions which Departments had been asked to consider hadalready been increased three times since the Budget.    This madeit very difficult for Ministers in the front line of negotiations to goback and ask for more.    Past experience suggested that Governmentsoften over- reacted to such predictions, and it was important to avoidmaking irreversible policy changes which could be politically verydamaging.It was also argued that, even if the overall size of the reductions wasabout right, the internal balance was wrong, and the speed of changetoo groat.    It might be better to spread out the reductions over alonger period.    The impact of the cuts varied greatly betweenDepartments.    There should be no serious difficulty in achieving thetargets in the programmes for the Departments of Trade, Transportor Employment.    But in the Defence Budget, where the baseline hadchanged since the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper had been circulated, thecuts he proposed would make it impossible to achieve the 3 per centgrowth rate in Defence expenditure which our NATO commitmentsrequired.    To abandon those now would be strategically andpolitically damaging, and would undo the morale-building effects ofthe Government&apos;s earlier Defence Budget decisions. However,because Defence and similar areas of public expenditure were largelyexempt from cuts, the reductions required in other programmeswere correspondingly larger.    Moreover, many of the proposedreductions were based upon analysis carried out in Opposition, whenaccess to full information was necessarily limited.    In many localauthority services, the Government was in no position to impose itswill.    In the Education programme, the cuts were so substantial,and would require such major legislative changes, that there was nopractical way of making them in the time available.Against this, it was argued strongly that no-one had faulted theChancellor&apos;s analysis of the economic prospects.    No Cabinet couldafford to gamble on the possibility that things would turn out betterthan expected.    The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals were unpalatablein political terms.    But no viable alternatives had been put forward.Without large cuts in public expenditure, or damaging increases inpersonal taxe,tion, the Government could not bring the growth in3SECRET
SECRETmoney supply under control.    The present level of public expenditurwas being sustained only at the expense of the wealth- creatingsectors of the community, with consequent damage to the level ofinvestment and the prospects for growth in the longer term.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that the Cabinet wouldresume its discussion of public expenditure at its next meeting, andshould seek to reach decisions before the Summer Recess on thelevel of expenditure for 1980-81.    She would arrange for a smallgroup of Ministers to discuss with the spending Departments themajor changes proposed by the Chief Secretary, reach agreementon as many of them as possible, and report back to the Cabinet atits next meeting.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should preparea paper for the next meeting, explaining the consequences of failureto meet the target reductions proposed by the Chief Secretary.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister, andinvited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theother Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office13 July 19794SECRET1
