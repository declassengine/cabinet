(1+7) 1+TH CONCLUSIONS.  MINUTE 1&apos; Confidential Annex(8th January, 1947   -   10 a.m.)INDIAConstitutionalposition.,Previouslef ersnce:::. (LG) 108thConclusions)The Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Prime Minister (C. P. (1+7)  1)  covering a revised draft of a statement of policy regarding the transferof power in India.THE PRIME MINISTER said that this revised draft had been prepared &quot;by the India and BurmaCommittee in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 31st December.      Since then there had beendevelopments in the  political position in Ind.ia*Congress had decided to accept the interpretationplaced by His Majesty&apos;s Government on the cabinet mission&apos;s statement of 16th May;    and the muslim league were now to consider whether,  in view of thisdecision,  they would collaborate in the work: of theConstituent Assembly.      There was therefore no occasion for the immediate issue of the statement    for thepurpose of overcoming a definite refusal by the muslim League to co-operate in the framing of a constitution.      But, while the Cabinet had felt thatthe  primary object of such a statement would be to force the two Indian Parties to face the realities ofthe situation,  the Viceroy had attached primary importance to the announcement of a definite plan fora phased withdrawal of British authority from India andit was likely that for this purpose he would still wishan early statement to be made.      On the method of transferring power&apos; in India,  however, there was adivergence of view between the Viceroy and the membersof the India and Burma Committee.      The Viceroyconceived this as a withdrawal,  planned on the linesof a military evacuation from hostile territory;    andit was on this account that he hac attached such great   .importance to his original plan of withdrawingProvince by Province,      The India and Burma Committee,on the other hand, considered that our aim should be tosecure a friendly transfer of power from British to indian authorities, with an increasing&quot; acquiescenceby the Viceroy and British officials in the wishes ofthe Indian Governments.      It was even probable that,if discussions could be opened on a friendly basisabout the means of transfex^ring power, we should beasked to give continuing assistance in various formsto the Indian Governments.      If,  however,  the wholeprocess was viewed as a military operation of withdrawal,it was possible that these questions would never be
discussed in a friendly spirit with the Indian governments and that an atmosphere of hostility would he created fromthe outset.      The difference between Ministers and the.Viceroy was, fundamentally,  one of approach;    and it seemed unlikely that the Viceroy&apos;s attitude could &quot;be changed bymeans of instructions conveyed by telegram.      It would be preferable that he should be asked to return to London forfurther personal talks With Ministers.In discussion there was general agreement with theviews expressed by the Prime Minister.      It was important that the senior European officers in the Indian Service shouldalso understand the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s government towards the forthcoming transfer of power in India;    andefforts must be made,  through the Viceroy, to ensure that theyapproached this difficult task in the proper spirit*      similar considerations applied to European officers of the Indian Army;and the earliest  possible opportunity should be taken of discussing with Indian leaders who would in future beresponsible for the control of the Indian Array,  the basis onwhich the Commander-in-Chief and some senior European officersmight be expected to continue to serve after the transfer of power.      THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that,  from his point ofview, it was most important that all possible efforts shouldbe made to hold the Indian Army together and to make adequate provision for the future defence of India.In further discussion the following points were also made:-(a)      THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS recalled that at their discussion on 3&apos;i st December the Cabinet had agreed that Dominion Governments should be informed of our intentions in this matter at the earliest possible stage.As it was not now intended to make the proposed statement ofpolicy at an early date,  lie doubted whether    it would be wise to communicate the text to Dominion Governments at the presenttime.      He would,  however, wish to give them some generalinformation about our intentions.(b)      It was agreed that the final sentence of paragraph 11+of the draft statement annexed to C.P.(ii8) 1   should be deleted.      It was further agreed that in the preceding sentence of this paragraph the emphasis on British interests in thedevelopment of Indian industry was open to misrepresentation,and that the sentence should be redrafted so as to lay greater emphasis on the fact that the commercial connection betweenthe United Kingdom and India had been,  and would continue to .be,  of mutual advantage to both countries.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that the issue of the statement ofpolicy annexed to CP. (h-7)  1   should be deferred for the time being;(2) Approved the amendments of the draft statementnoted in paragraph (b)  above;    and asked that ministers wishing to suggest any further amendments of drafting should communicatetheir suggestions to the Prime Minister;
(3) Took note that the prime Minister, inconsultation with the jeerotcry of Statefor India, would arrange for the Viceroy toreturn to London for further discussions wiMinisters;(d) Took note that the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs would consult the PrimeMinister about the nature of the generalinformation to ho communicated to DominionGovernments at the present stage shout our intentions regarding the transfer of power in IndiavCabinet Office,  S.W.1*
