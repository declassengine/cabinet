(47)  21 ST CONCLUSIONS, minute confidential Annex(13th February, 194710 a.m.)INDIAConstitutionalPosition,(previous reference:CM. (47) 4thConclusions,Minute 1 )THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at their meeting on 8th January the Cabinet had agreed to defer for the time being the issue of the proposed statement of policy declaring the Government1sintention to transfer power in India in the courseof 1948.      He had been keeping a close watch on thedevelopment of the constitutional position in India,in consultation with members of the India and BurmaCommittee;    and they were satisfied that the time had now come to make a final effort,  by the issueof this statement,  to compel the two political parties in India to face the realities of thesituation and collaborate in framing a newconstitution.      They therefore recommended that thestatement should be issued in the course of thefollowing week.changes of wording had beenideVariousin the draft statement which had previously beenconsidered by the Cabinet (CP. (47) 1).      these were of minor importance only.      There was, however,one change of  substance which required the approvalof the Cabinet,, viz.  that the date to be given forthe transfer of power in India should be &quot;June 1948&quot;rather than &quot;the middle of 1948&quot;.      He was satisfiedthat the statement would not &quot;be fully effectiveunless a definite date were given.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA saidthat, while he concurred in this recommendation, hethought it right to warn the Cabinet that it mightnot be possible for the transfer of power to beeffected smoothly by June,  1948.      Even though thework of the Constituent Assembly proceeded withoutfurther delay,   it might well&quot; be that by June, 1948there would be no Central Government to which power could be transferred.It was the view of the Cabinet thatthis consideration did not outweigh the advantages,for the purposes of the present statement,  of
specifying a definite date.      It would do no harmif in the event the date had to be postponedbecause the Indians themselves were not ready toaccept the transfer of power.The Cabinet -(1)   Agreed that the proposed statementof policy should indicate theGovernments intention to transferpower in India in June, 1948.(2)    Authorised the Prime Liinister toarrange for the statement to bemade in both Houses of parliament in the course of the following week.C ab ine; t Off ice,  S.
