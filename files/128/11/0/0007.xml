C.M.(47) 80th Conclusions

(14th October, 1947 - 3.0 p.m.)

Marraige of H.R.H. The Princess Elizabeth.

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that it had been suggested to him by the Marquess of Salisbury that it would be fitting if arrangements could be made for the House of Lords as a whole to give a present to H.R.H. The Princess Elizabeth on the occasion of Her marriage to Lieutenant Phillip Mountbatten, R.N. He would be glad to have the views of his colleagues on this suggestion.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that on no previous occasion had either House of Parliament given a wedding present to a Member of The Royal family. It would certainly create embarrasment in the House of Commons if a wedding present were given to The Princess from the House of Lords. He would much prefer that no such presentation should be made, and he thought that the Marquess of Salisbury should be discouraged from pursuing his suggestion. He could be told that the Government had considered the possibility of presents from the two Houses of Parliament but had found that there were no precedents for such a course.

The Cabinet endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister.
