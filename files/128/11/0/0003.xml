(h7) 32:giving the views of the Secretary ofState on the relative merits of thefour main solutions which had been putforward,  and suggesting that the aim off our Delegates,  in the forthcoming discussions,  should be to explore with both parties the various possibilities,explain theiculties which eachpresented, and try to lead them in thedirection of a reasonable scheme of partition as being the best and moiequitable solution.itTHE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he had considered very carefully,  in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion on 15th January, how he should,handle the forthcoming discussions with representativesof the Arabs and the Jews.      He. himself was notopposed in principle to a solution by way of partition;    hut he was impressed hy the difficultyof imposing any solution against the active opposition of either community in Palestine,      If it came to thepoint of using force against the Arabs, he was not sure how this would be accepted by public opinion in this country.      And he was certain that suchaction would create a &quot;situation&quot; in Palestine whichwould be brought to the notice of the security council as likely to endanger world, peace,,      he considered, therefore, that a further effort shouldbe made by negotiation to bring the two partiessomewhat nearer together.      If this attempt failedthe question would have to he brought in some form
before the United Nations.      He hoped,, however,  that theCabinet would not attempt to decide, before the negotiationsbegan, what recommendation they would make to the united nations if they failed, in this last attempt to secure .an agreed settlement.      And he thought it would be a mistakefor the Cabinet to commit themselves to support of anyparticular solution before Ministers entered upon thenegotiations.THE COLONIAL SECRETARY agreed that the cabinet should not now be asked to decide what policy should befollowed if the conversations broke down.      He hoped that theCabinet would leave the negotiators as much latitude aspossible.      Their object should be to move both the Jews andthe Arabs from their present irreconcilable positions.,  in thehope that as a result there would emerge some conclusionwhich we could put forward with some hope that It would notbe wholly unacceptable to either of the two parties,.,He himself felt that such a solution must bealong the lines of Partition.      He could not see any prospectof agreement on any other line.      It had been argued thatPartition could not give a viable State to both Jew and ;-.rab,but he was not convinced of this.      There should be no greatdifficulty in making the Jewish share reasonably viable,while the Arab share might become viable if it were linked with Trans-Jordan.      It had also been argued that Partitionwould alienate the Arab world.      He was not convinced thatthis would necessarily follow.      The Arab States were boundto us by economic and strategic interests;   . and, while someArab countries would no doubt oppose Partition, he was &quot;by nomeans certain that they would, all be united in that policy for long.      Trans-Jordan,  for instance, might favourPartition,   since she stood herself to gain .from it,while there were some indications that Ihn Saud might not be wholly opposed, to it.THE MINISTER OP FUEL AND POWER said that he -was infavour of partition.      This policy would.,  among other things,have the advantage that it would be acceptable to the UnitedStates.      If it was necessary to choose between the friendship of the Jews and of the Arab world,  he felt that ona long view the friendship of the Jews was more valuable tous than that of the Arabs.      Recent experiences in egypt and. India should warn us that,  if a unitary State with an arab majority were established in Palestine, it would notnecessarily remain friendly towards us or willing to allow usto maintain a strategic base in Palestine.In subsequent discussion Ministers agreed that,failing an agreed settlement,   any solution of this problem would have to come before the United Nations.      The general assembly was not due to meet until September;    and,  although a special meeting could no doubt be called, earlier,  the atmosphere would probably be more favourable at the Septembermeeting.      On the other hand,  if the forthcoming discussionsproduced no agreement,  it was doubtful whether the internal situation in Palestine could be held until September.
Discussion in the United- Nations, whether at theGeneral Assembly or in the Trusteeship Council, was bound tobe embarrassing.      There would be much, discussion of thevarious promises that had been made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, not all of which were easy to reconcile with one another, and critics would dwell on the long history of out failure to find a  solution of the problem by ourselvesoSome Ministers felt that, if we were unable to secure an agreed settlement)  there would be much to be. said forleaving it to the United Nations to find a solution^      Onthe other hand, we could not  lightly talcs such a course, whichmight mean that we should he unable to secure the military facilities in Palestine which were necessary to our strategic position in the Middle East.As regards oil supplies, the two ports at whichthe pipe-lines terminated or would terminate were Haifa andGaza.      According to the Jewish ideas of Partition,  both wouldbe in the Jewish area,  though it might be arranged that Gasashould be in the Arab area.        For the use of Middle East oil.however, we depended, not only on the security of the portswhere the pipe-lines terminated,  but on the friendship of thecountries in which oil was produced and through, which thepipe-lines passed.      Apart from Persia,  all these countries were Arab countries^The Cabinet*s conclusion was that it would be a mistake to decide at this stage what policy should befollowed if the forthcoming conversations broke down.During the conversations, Ministers should try their utmost to move the two parties from their present irreconcilablepositions.      The Cabinet should be kept informed of theprogress of the discussions;    and they should,  in particular,be consulted further before any indication was given to eitherArabs or Jews that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be preparedto support any particular solution of the problem.Cabinet Office,  S.W.1.
