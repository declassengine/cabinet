C.M.(47) 96rii CONCLUSIONS(l8th December, 1947 - 10 a.m.)THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had been asked boadvise on the precedence of; H.R.H. The Dike of Edinburgh,     He had come to the conclusion (in which the Master of the Rolls concurred)that the Duke of Edinburgh was not entitled to sit on the Cloth ofEstate and in the order of precedence would rank after the Duke lastcreated.     If it was desired that His Royal Highness should have, bylegal right, the precedence of a Royal Duke, legislation would berequired;    and a provision on this point might perhaps be included inthe Princess Elizabeth&apos;s and the Duke of Edinburgn!s Annuities Bill.On the other hand, His Majesty might think it unnecessary to have thispoint dealt with by legislation.     Queen Victoria had accorded theappropriate precedence to Prince Albert by her own decision, v/ithoutlegislation.The Lord Chancellor undertook to send to the Prime Minister:the opinions which he had given on the point of law involved.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be inexpedient to include any provision on this point in the AnnuitiesBill;    and it would be preferable if His Majesty felt able to dealwith the matter without legislation.Ce.binet Office, b.*7. 1.
