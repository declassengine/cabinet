2 7HO CIRCULATION RECORDCM. (47)  23RD CONCLUSIONS(18th February, 1947   -   11.0 a.m.]CE3S THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that  at theAESTHCabinet&apos;s meeting on 7th November he had undertakenty-fir stthday to make further enquiries about the arrangementsvious for celebrating the twenty-first birthday oference:.(46) 95th Princess Elizabeth.elusions;When this matter had been mentioned&apos;previously, the Cabinet had been under theimpression that Princess Elizabeth could beregarded as having come of age on her eighteenthbirthday, by virtue of the Regency Act, 1943, andthat on this account it would be inappropriate totake formal cognisance of her twenty-first birthday.He was now advised, however, that the Act of 1943merely enabled the heir apparent or presumptiveto act as a Counsellor of State from age 18 and did not  tlter the fact; that the heir to the Throne,like any other subject, did not become of full ageuntil 21.The Prime Minister added that he had been unable to find any precedent for any formal recognition, either by Parliament or by bhe Government,of the coming of age of the heir to the Throne.He raised the matter again, however, because he understood that the South African Government were proposing to make a present to Princess Elizabeth,on the occasion of her twenty-first birthday.-1-
6jA short discussion followed;, from, whichit appeared that it was the view of the Cabinetthat the Government should not -e stablish a newprecedent by taking any formal act in recognitionof Princess Elizabeth&apos;s coming of age.      It followed that there should be no resolution by parliamentnor any present from His Majesty&apos;s Government.This need not, however, preclude the prime minister from sending a telegram conveying the Government&apos;scongratulations to Princess Slizahetb. on theoccasion of her twenty-first birthday.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.
