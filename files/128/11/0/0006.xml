(h7)  23RD CONCLUSIONS,  MINUTE confidential Annex(18th February,   1 9U7 - 11  a.nu )IAstitutionalition.&apos;eviouserence:.(k7) 21stelusions,ute h)THE P- r, if -m   tv T -r tat -j-INISTER recalled that at their meeting on 13th February the Cabinet had agreed thathe should make at an early date the proposed statementof policy declaring the Government&apos; s intention totransfer power in India by June,  19^4-8;     and he had arranged that this  statement should he made toParliament on Thursday,  20th February.      During the lasttwo days,  however,  representations had been receivedfrom the Viceroy urging that the Government should notat this stage make any declaration of their intentionto transfer power by a specified date.      The Viceroysuggested instead an  alternative plan under which british authority would be progressively withdrawn inIndia,  the Secretary of State Services being firstwithdrawn and the British troops thereafter,   and the governors of the Provinces would be placed in aposition comparable to that of Governors-General inDominions.      This plan contemplated that an announcement should be made in June,  19U/7,  that power would be finally transferred to Indian hands at the end of19d8.The Viceroy&apos;s representations  had beenconsidered by the India and Burma Committee, who were satisfied that his alternative plan was  impracticable.It would necessitate a new interim constitution forIndia during the period in which British power wasbeing withdrawn,  and. it took no account of theParliamentary and legislative difficulties which sucha proposal would involve in this country.      Moreover,it assumed that the Interim Government could beinformed in confidence of the date proposed for theultimate transfer of  power;      and the Committee were satisfied that,  once this partial disclosure had beenmade, -rumours of the impending British withdrawal were likely to spread throughout India.Quite apart,  however,  from the impracticabilityof the Viceroy&apos;s alternative plan,  the most disturbingelement in the situation,his attitude towards thedate for the transfer of essential feature of the was the complete change indefini tobeen the he hadannouncement of a power. This hadproposals whichoriginally submitted to Ministers in December,  194b;unable to accept hi;and,  although Ministers had feltwhich it was theevolved in theirform in policy\ put forward, thediscussions hadplan  in thewhole of thebeen built round this central proposal for the early announcement of a definite date for the transfer of power.      Throughout these conversations the Viceroy-1
had been insistent on the need for such an announcement,  andhe hod assured Ministers that this view was supported by theCommander-in-chief,  the Governors of the Provinces and his official advisers.      He had then given it as his considered opinion that we should not in any event be able to carry onour administration in India after 31st March,  1948, becauseof the extent to which the European element in the IndianServices and Armed Forces hod decreased and the naturaltendency of the Indian members to look increasingly towardsthe Indian political leaders rather than the british administration for their future advancement.-      In his latestrepresentations,  however,  the Viceroy had stressed the risk that an early announcement of our intention to transfer power by a specified date might create a serious situation in India:that,  instead of forcing the two political parties to face the realities of the situation and collaborate together in framinga new constitution,  it might encourage in each a tendency to seize what power it could and thus inflame communal feelingto an extent which might lead to widespread disorder.      He had reported that the Commander-in-chief and the Governors of bengal, Punjab and the United Provinces all now took apessimistic view of the situation;    and he recommended that weshould not at this stage make any declaration of our intentionto transfer power by a specified date.Dominion Governments hod been informed of the proposed declaration towards the end of the previous week.      strong representations had now been received from the Prime Ministerof South Africa,  urging that we should maintain British rule inIndia until communal differences hod been resolved and a unitary Government established.      No comments had yet beenreceived from any of the other Dominions.Ministers were thus faced with a very difficult decision.      If they decided to proceed with the policy on whichthey had previously agreed,  they would hove to do so in the face of the latest advice of the Viceroy and. others holdingresponsible office in India - though,  in weighing the viewsnow expressed by the Provincial Governors,  it must be rememberedthat they had not been informed of the precise terms of thedeclaration which His Majesty&apos;s Government proposed to make and it was not altogether clear to what proposition of theViceroy their latest views were related.      On the other hand,the main object of making the proposed declaration hod alwaysbeen to force the two political parties in India to  cometogether and act with a due sense of their responsibility forIndia&apos;s future;    and it was still the view of the India and burma Committee that for this purpose it was essential to specify a definite dote for the transfer of power.      Adeclaration without a date would not convince Indian politiciansthat we were sincere in our intention to transfer power in thenear future;    and we should be suspected,  as earlierGovernments had been,  of making communal differences an excuse for continuing British rule in India.      Finally,  the PrimeMinister informed the Cabinet that the proposed declaration was to be accompanied by an announcement that a new Viceroyhad been appointed who would proceed forthwith to India for the specific purpose of arranging for the transfer of power.This change of Viceroy was an essential element in this finalattempt to induce a spirit of co-operation between the twopolitical parties in India.      The now Viceroy had accepted this mission on the understanding that a definite date for the
transfer of power would be determined and announced before he went out to India;    and&quot; it was very doubtful whether he would still be willing to undertake this exceptionally difficult dutyif it -were now decided that no definite term should be set tohis mission.In all the circumstances the Prime Minister recommendedthat the Cabinet should reaffirm their decision in favour of announcing the Governments intention to transfer power inIndia by June,  19U8,  and that the statement of policy should,he made,   as previously proposed,  on 20th February.In the discussion which followed a number of Ministersspoke in support of the Prime Minister&apos;s recommendation. other points made in the discussion were as follows:-(a)      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS said thathe had serious misgivings about the form of paragraph 7 of theproposed statement.      This contemplated the possibility that by June,  19U8, no responsible authority would have emerged inIndia to which power could, be transferred;    and he was gravelyconcerned at the implication that, whatever happened, we should leave India by the prescribed date even if this meant that thecountry would be plunged, into chaos.      He would thereforeprefer to substitute,  for the last sentence of this paragraph,words to  the effect that His Majesty&apos;s Government,  in view oftheir definite intention to transfer power in India,  had appointed a new Viceroy &quot;with an instruction that arrangements must be made for the constitution of a responsible alternativeGovernment and for the transfer of power within a period, notexceeding two years from the dote of his appointment51.In reply to this suggestion,   it was pointed out thatthe succeeding paragraphs of the proposed statement made clear the Government*s desire to transfer power to a responsibleIndian Government;    and paragraph 10 referred to the alternativepossibilities which would be open  if no central Government forthe whole of British India had been established by theprescribed date.      The statement did not envisage the possibilityof our leaving India without any Government at all.      On theother hand,  the formula  proposed by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs would be thought to imply that,   if the newViceroy failed to secure the establishment of a centralGovernment, we should continue to maintain British rule inIndia.After further discussion,  it was agreed that paragraph 7 of the draft statement should be amended so as to read:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government desire to hand over their responsibility to  authorities established by a constitution  approved by all parties in&quot;India,in accordance with the plan of the Cabinet Mission,but unfortunately there is at present no clear prospect that such a constitution and such authorities will emerge.      The present state of uncertainty is fraughtwith danger and cannot be indefinitely prolonged.His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to make it clear thatit is their definite intention to effect the transference of power to responsible Indian hand-S bya dote not later than June,  191+8.&quot;
It was the view of the Cabinet that the insertion ofthe words underlined should remove any risk of the misunderstandingfeared by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.(b) THE MINISTER OP DEFENCE said that he was sorry thatthe Government had felt compelled to depart from the policywhich they had laid down,  in the telegram (CABIN 22)  sent tothe Cabinet Mission in India on 6th June,  194-6, that we should retain British control in India until there was a responsibleIndian Government to which powers in respect of British india could, be transferred.      The course of the discussions since december had,  however,  compelled him to the conclusion that theGovernment had no alternative but to prescribe a definite date for the transfer of power in India.      Like other Ministers,  hehad been specially influenced by the Viceroy&apos;s warning that weshould not in any event be able to carry on our administrationefficiently after March,  1948, by reason of the progressiveweakening of the European element in the Indian Services.If the proposed declaration was in fact likely to produce astate of disorder in India,  it was difficult to understand, theViceroy&apos;s latest suggestion of postponing that situation until a date by which,  on his own evidence, we should be less ableto deal with it.      The Minister therefore considered that theCabinet had now no alternative but to proceed with the policy on which they had-previously agreed.      This was,  however,  a grave decision to take.      He hoped that the Secretary of Statefor India would arrange for an immediate study to be made ofthe consequences which might follow if we were compelled totransfer power otherwise than to a central Government.(c) The question was raised whether it would be practicable to defer for a time the announcement of a definitedate for the transfer of power.      As it had been decided toappoint a new Viceroy,  it would be natural to allow him toproceed to India and make his own assessment of the situationbefore a final decision was taken.As against this,  it was pointed out that the newViceroy was unwilling to accept appointment on that basis.Moreover,  Congress were still awaiting a reply to their request that,  as the Muslim League would not join in the work of theConstituent Assembly,  the Muslim Ministers should be asked to resign from the Interim Government.      If the proposed declaration of policy were made at once,  a decision on this request could be deferred until it was known whether thedeclaration had the effect of bringing the parties together.This was a strong argument against postponing the issue ofthe declaration.(d) THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that,   if theproposed declaration were made,  the Cabinet should decide,particularly in view of the latest warnings of possibledisorders in India,  whether additional shipping should beprovided over the next few months to enable Europeans toleave India and what guidance should be given to the Presidentof the European Association on the question whether Europeansshould be encouraged to leave,  and discouraged from proceeding to,  India.
It was the view of the Cabinet that no encouragementshould be given at this  stage to the idea that there would bea mass evacuation of Europeans from India as soon, as thedeclaration of policy, was mode.      The Secretary of State forIndia might ask the Minister of Transport to take unobtrusivesteps to increase the shipping facilities available for personswishing to leave India over the next few months.      It would,however, be inadvisable that any statement should be made atthis stage about the desirability of Europeans leaving,  orproceeding to, India.The Cabinet -(1) Reaffirmed their decision that the proposed statement of policy on India should indicate the Government1s intention to transfer power in India &quot;by June,  191+8.(2)  Agreed that the statement of policy(incorporating the amendment noted inparagraph (a)  above)  should be made in bothHouses of Parliament on 20th February;    and took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the appointment of the newViceroy to be announced in the same statement.(3)  Took note that the Prime Minister would communicate the text of the proposed statement&apos;,before it was made,  to the Leaders of theOpposition Parties.(u) Authorised the Secretary of State for Indiato take unobtrusive steps to ensure that increased shipping facilities were availablefor Europeans wishing to leave India overthe next few months.Cabinet Office,  8.W.1.
