These werethe three vital props of our defensive position:they were all inter-dependent and if any onewere lost the whole structure would he imperilled.Further,  these were the fundamental principlesox our dunaffect)-hisfensive strategyThey would be?d by any technical changes in thenature and use of weapons.      Equally,  they remained unaffected whatever assumption wasmade about the potential enemy.
It was essential to our defence thatwe should be able to fight from the Middle Eastin war.      It followed that we must maintain ourfoothold there in peace,  for without that weshould he unable to develop with sufficient speeda strong military position there in war.      this did not mean that large forces must be stationedthere in peace:    we must,  however,  retain therebases and other facilities which,   though lightlymanned in peace,  could be used for the rapiddeployment of greater force against a threat ofwar.      The importance of our ability to moveforces rapidly to check a threat of aggressionhad been strikingly demonstrated by the recentdespatch of a force to Basra.      In future weshould not be able to use India as a base forsuch deployment of force:    it was the more essential,  therefore, that we should retain other-bases in the Middle East for this purpose.Palestine was of special importancein this general scheme of defence.       In war,Egypt would be our   key  position in the middle east;     and it was  necessary that we should holdPalestine as a screen for the defence of Egypt.In peace,  since we had undertaken to withdraw from Egypt, we must be able to use Palestine asa base for the mobile reserve of troops whichmust be kept ready to meet any emergency throughoutt h e M i d die S a s t.In reply to specific questions put tohim by Ministers, THE CHIEF OP THE AIR STAFF madethe foliow ing f further statements ; -(a)    The facilities afforded by our Treatyof Alliance with Trans Jordan would not alone&apos; suffice to meet our military requirements in this area.It would be necessary to retain those facilitieseven though we secured full military facilitiest h r o u gh o u t Palestine..(b )    If Palestine were  divided into an arab State,  a Jewish State and a Jerusalem Enclaveunder British administration,   the military facilitierequired by the Chiefs of Staff could not besecured within the Jerusalem Enclave alone.      nor would it be sufficient to secure military facilities from either the Arab or the jewish state:     it would be necessary,   in order to securefull use of the ports,  airfields and communications,to obtain military facilities by treaty arrangements with both States.(c)    So long as the necessary military facilities were obtained throughout Palestine,it was immaterial from the military angle whetherPalestine was divided into two independent states or became a single Independent State.
(d) The military situation would,  ofcourse, he greatly eased if a political solutioncould he found which was acceptable&quot; to &quot;bothcommunities and brought to an end the existingstate of tension in Palestine.      If, however,  oneof the two communities had&apos; to he antagonised,   itwas preferable, from the purely military angle,that a solution should he found which did not involve the continuing hostility of the Arahsjfor in that event our difficulties would not heconfined to Palestine out would extend  throughoutthe whole of the Middle East.(e) The strategic policy for the middle east outlined on behalf of the Chiefs of staff was not wholly dependent on preserving the friendship of Spain,, Italy, Greece and othercountries bordering the northern seaboard of theMediterranean.      Our line of communication throughthe Mediterranean would still be of substantialvalue to us,  even though some of these countries were hostile, provided that the countries on thesouthern, shore of the Mediterranean, were not alsohostile.THE PRIME MINISTER thanked theChiefs of Staff for this expression of theirviews on the strategic importance of palestine and of our position in the Middle East.Cabinet Office,  S.&apos;7. 1.15th January,  1947.

(47) 6TH CONCLUSIONS, MINUTE confidential Annex(15th January,  1947 - 10.30 a.m. )PALESTINE The Cabinet had before  them two memoranda by the Foreign Secretary:-(previous reference: CP. (47) 28:    on the question whether itCM.(46) 101 st would be legally possible for His Majesty&apos; conclusions, Government to impose a solution of the minute 2) Palestine problem,  either by way of partition or by the introduction of aPolitical system of Provincial Autonomy, withoutImplications first obtaining the sanction of the Unitedof Future Nations.policyCP. (47) 30:    reviewing three alternativepolicies for Palestine and discussing theline to be taken on the resumption of thePalestine Conference.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY explained thatthe first of these memoranda had been prepared bythe legal advisers of  the Foreign Office and theColonial Office and that both the Lord chancellor and the Attorney-General were in agreement withthe conclusions reached.      These were that, before putting into effect a Partition solution,&apos; we shouldbe legally obliged to obtain the approval of theUnited Nations;    that we should not, from thestrictly legal point of view,  be obliged to obtainsu&amp;h previous approval for the introduction of theProvincial Autonomy plan;    but that it would be politically inexpedient to attempt to introduceeither solution without first bringing the matter before the United Nations.The Colonial Office had not been consulted in the- preparation of the secondmemorandum.      The Foreign Secretary said that hewas sorry that he had not been able to find time forsuch consultation;    and he also apologised to hiscolleagues for circulating this paper on the morning of the Cabinet&apos;s meeting.      He had thought,however, that it might assist the Cabinet in their discussion to have before them a paper whichfocussed,  as this was designed to do,  the main issues for discussion.
The Foreign Secretary recalled thevarious stages in the consideration of  the palestine problem since the latter part of the late war.The Coalition Government had then favoured Partitionas a solution;    and it was possible that this mighthave been carried into effect without greatdifficulty if&quot; it had been imposed shortly beforethe end of the weir.      This opportunity had, however,been lost.      When the present Government assumedoffice,  their first endeavour had been to breakaway from the terms of the white paper of 1939.They had sought Arab acquiescence in  the continuanceof Jewish immigration at the rate of 1,500 a month;and they had aimed to get the Palestine problemreviewed afresh against the background of Jewishsufferings in Europe.      At that time there was reason to believe that the Jews would have beencontent with immigration at the rate of h,000 amonth.      This policy was making some progress whenPresident Truman intervened with his demand for theimmediate admission of 100,000 Jews to Palestine.This encouraged Jewish ambitions and led to theappointment of the Anglo-American Committee ofEnquiry.      When that Committee reported,  HisMajesty&apos;s Government had been ready to givesympathetic consideration to its recommendations,if they were taken as a whole;    but they had found it necessary to stand firm against president truman&apos;s desire that immediate effect should be&apos;given to the recommendation in favour of the admission of 100,000 Jews to Palestine in advanceof full consideration of the remaining recommendationsof  the report.      Thus,  the approaches which HisMajesty&apos;s Government had originally made towards asolution of this problem had been deflected by president Truman&apos;s intervention.      The position had also been made more difficult by the decision of theLabour Party,  at their Annual Conference,  to endorse the Zionist demand for the creation of anindependent Jewish State in Palestine.     We had now to contend with the further complication thatwe must find a solution which was likely to be endorsed by the United Nations.      Even if we didnot ourselves think it necessary to seek theapproval of the United Nations, he had no doubtthat the matter would be referred to the united nations by some Government which disliked thesolution which we adopted.      It was his opinion thata solution by way of partition would not command the support of a two-thirds majority in the united nations.      If we- advocated par Li Lion,  we were likelyto find ourselves with no effective  support exceptfrom the United States.      As against such a solution,the Arab States would advocate their plan for anindependent unitary state,  which they would defendas being in accordance with established democratic principles;    and it was his view,  based on hispractical experience of discussions in the Assembly,that there would be a wide measure of support forthe fundamental principles to which the Arabs would
appeal in support of their plan.      On the other hand,hc- believed that there was a reasonable prospect ofsecuring majority support in the United Nations fora solution on the general lines of the provincial autonomy plan,  especially if it could be adjusted tomeet some of the objections which had been raisedagainst it by both Arabs and Jews.If we attempted to impose a solution,in pursuance of our powers as Mandatory, without reference to the United Nations, there would, be widespread disorder in Palestine.      One or other ofthe interested Governments would regard this as constituting a &quot;situation&quot; endangering world peace and would bring the matter before the security council.      This would create for us difficultieseven greater than those which we should have to meetif v/e ourselves brought the problem before theGeneral Assembly.He had at one stage hoped that a solution might be found on the basis of a &quot;transitional period&quot;during which Palestine would remain, under Mandate,as a bi-national unitary State but provision wouldbe made that either of two provinces (Arab and Jewish)would have a right of secession after a fixed periodof years.      He had bulieved that,   if such a system could, be established,  the two communities mightduring the transition period come to see theadvantages of collaboration and that pressure forthe creation of a separate Jewish State wouldsubside.      He was told, however,  that the lack offinality in this solution would result in continuingdisorder,  to an extent which might cause a breakdown of our administration in Palestine.      Nevertheless,he would still like to explore the possibilities ofsuch a solution when the Palestine Conference was resumed.There was no doubt that the situation would be eased if other countries could be persuaded to admit a number of Jewish immigrants from Europe.He had. for some&quot; time been pressing the United states administration to make  such a gesture;    and he was glad to see that President Truman had now includedin his Message to Congress a proposal for a specialimmigration quota for displaced persons,  includingJews.      H.M. Ambassador in Washington had beenasked to enquire how soon Congress might beexpected to pass the necessary legislation,      Itwould be most helpful if this lead could befollowed by other countries,  including the british dominions.      Hitherto we had had no success inthe efforts which we had made to persua.de DominionGovernments to accept a proportion of these refugees.In conclusion,  the Foreign secretary said that he did not expect the Cabinet at theirpresent meeting to reach final conclusions on this difficult issue.      He would, however, be glad tohave the advantage of hearing the views of hiscolleague s.
-2. &quot;2 THE SECRETARY OR STATE FOR THE colonies said that he would like more time to consider theproposals in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s latestmemorandum (CP. (47) 30).   -He informed the Cabinet of negotiations with had taken place with the Jewish Agency sincethe Zionist Congress at Basle.      The Congress had decided that the Executive of the Jewish agency should not take part in the London Conferenceunless &quot;a change should take place In thesituation&quot;.      Mr.   Ben Gurion, when he had sub-sequent ly visited London,  had pressed that HisMajesty&apos;s Government should take some action,  forinstance as to the rate of immigration to palestine, which would constitute a change inthe situation.      He had told Mr.  Ben Gurion thatno fresh policy could he announced before  theConference, hut he had succeeded in arrangingwith him that  the responsible members of theExecutive would in fact assemble privately inLondon at the time of the Conference,  so thatthey would he available for informal discussionswhile it was going on.The Colonial Secretary said that representatives sent by the Palestine Arab higher committee would attend the Conference.      This was satisfactory,  though the persons chosen were not as widely representative or as suitable personallyas might have been hoped.The High Commissioner for palestine was anxious tha-t the Government should realise the urgency of finding a solution;    theadministration and the military forces  in Palestinewere working under great strain and early actionto relieve this was,   in his view,  essential.      TheHigh Commissioner^ own opinion was that,  despite the difficulties involved by the need for obtaining the approval of the United Nations,some form of partition provided the onlypr a c t i c ah 1 e solution.The Secretary of State said that he himself was more and more inclined to share thisview, which he felt sure would also command more general acceptance in this country than, any .other solution.      He appreciated that there wouldbe difficulties in the United Nations, but these would also arise over any other possible solution.If the scheme were not accepted by the Assembly,the responsibility would then be on the assembly to find a better solution.He himself could see no solution onthe lines of the Arab plan for a unitary State,for illegal immigration of Jews would continue andthe present state of tension would be perpetuated;and we should still remain responsible for law andorder.
Nor did he favour the plan for provincial Autonomy.       The Jews would not accept as satisfactory any scheme which did not providefor a Jewish national State,  whose nationals wouldhave a Jewish nationality.      He would circulate tothe Cabinet a memorandum setting out other difficulties which the High Commissioner saw inthis scheme.As regards Partition much woulddenend on the boundaries drawn and on the size of the areas  given to the two communities.The Cabinet first considered., whether asolution on the lines of Partition was likely to command the support of a two-thirds majority ofthe United Nations.It was  explained that the Charter itselfdid not provide that a two-thirds majority shouldbe required for an issue of this kind.       it was,however,   open to any member State to propose thatan important Issue should be determined by a two-thirds majority,   and this proposal was certain tobe made in respect of the Palestine issue.      Whileit was  true that for this point of procedure onlya simple majority was required,   it would always bedifficult to secure even a simple majority againsta proposal that an important issue should bedecided by a two-thirds majority,THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that theArab States would certainly oppose Partition;    andhe believed that the Soviet Government and theSlav group would also oppose it, partly becauseof a desir-e-to..-suppnj?t,, the Arabs against us,  andpartly because they would expect us,  in the eventof Partition,  to secure military facilities by-Treaty with the two independent States.       Itwas unlikely that- the United States would be ableto secure the support of China for a Partitionsolution;    and India was also likely to vote against it.       In these circumstances he saw no prospectof obtaining a two-thirds majority in favour of partition.In discussion the view was expressed that,    if the Soviet Government must be expectedto vote against Partition for the second reasongiven, by the Foreign Secretary,  there could beno assurance that they would support thealternative of Provincial Autonomy.      THE foreign secretary thought,  however,   that in certaincircumstances  the Arab States might suppor tsuch a solution and that some of the Slew/ states might also be persuaded to support it.-a-
The vlew was also expressed,  in discussion,  that if all the arguments in favourof Partition were  set forth in the discussions atthe Assembly,  and the disadvantages of thealternative courses were fully explained,  thepossibility could not be wholly excluded that,  bya combination of  skilful debating and tacticalmanoeuvring of the interested States, the necessarymajority in support of this solution could beobtained.THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER stressed the urgency of finding some early solution whichwould terminate the existing conditions of disorder in Palestine&apos;      He suggested that the Cabinet should first consider what was the best  solution on the merits arid should then discuss  separately thepractical prospects of carrying that solution intoeffect.      His own view was that,  on the merits,  thebest solution war. Partition.      Events had shown thatJews and Arabs could not,  and would not, work together in Palestine.       It was also clear that the zionists wore determined to insist on the right of jews to enter as immigrants,  subject only to thecontrol of a purely Jewish authority,  some purelyJewish area in Palestine, however small it mightbe.      That determination in effect ruled out allsolutions other than partition.      If the cabinet were agreed ttu t partition was the right solution,he could not believe it impossible to find, ways andmaens of carrying that solution into effect.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH endorsed theviews expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.It was essential that an  early solution should befound.      If it were not,  the consequences would be continuing disorder in Palestine, which we shouldbe caviled upon to repress by force, a.nd a generaloutbreak of anti-Semitism.      This was a. situationwhich this Government could not contemplate.      he considered that partition was the right  solution;and he could not believe that it would be rejected by the United Nations if it were supported by theUnited Kingdom and the British Dominions,  by theUnited States, and,   as seemed probable, by some atleast of the Governments of Western Europe.      At themoment responsible Jews were ready to acceptPartition as a solution.      This,  therefore,  was the&apos;moment at which to put it forward.      For it must beremembered that,  for the Jews,  partition was a compromise solution;    and that, because of the delayswhich had occurred in dealing with this problem,Jewish leadership was already passing into lessmoderate hands.       if we failed to seize this opportunity,  it was likely that the leadership ofthe Jews would pass to men who would advocate more extreme  solutions and more violent courses.
-  The Minister also challenged the viewthat,  from the angle of our strategic interest,it must he cur objective to avoid estranging theArab States.      In his view,  a friendly Jewish state in Palestine would give us a safer military basethan any we should  find in an Arab State.      TheJews were under the continuing influence of countriesfriendly to ourselves.      If, however,  India-andother Muslim countries passed under Russianinfluence, for how long could we expect to retain a secure military base in an Arab Palestine?THE MINISTER 01s DEFENCE said that hetoo would favour partition as a solution if itwere possible to get both Arabs and Jews to accept it.      He differed,  however, from the Minister ofHealth on the  strategic  issues involved.      If it came to a choice between antagonising Arabs orJews,  he thought there could be no doubt that fromthe point of view of our own strategic  interest itwould be more disadvantageous to us to Incur the continuing hostility of the Arab States.      For inthat event the- Soviet Government would undoubtedlysupport  them, with the  intention of undermining theposition of the British Commonwealth and the UnitedStates in the Persian Gulf area.      ne thought It most  important that,  throughout their discussions,the Cabinet should keep it in mine that it wasto the  strategic advantage of Russia to win theArabs over to their side.      Our first task must be.to  try to find a solution which would do justice to both Arabs and Jews.      If, however,  that proved impossible we should look to our own strategic interests;    and from that angle there could be nodoubt that  it was vital to us to retain the goodwill of the Arab world.THE MINISTER OF FUEL Aim POWER saidthat  it was also important that we should not follow a course of action which would alienate the UnitedDtates.      They too had important interests at stake in  the Middle East;    ana it had btei our policy to try to induce them to shoulder increasedresponsibilities,  together with us,  in that area.Their  support would, however, bo- given to asolution by way of partition.For his part, he had always hoped inthe past that the Jews in Palestine would follow apolicy of assimilation.&apos;     No progress had beenmade,  however,   in that direction:    and it was nowquite clear that the Jews were determined tosecure a political State, however,  small,  of theirown.      To attempt to establish,  against thatdetermination,  a unitary State in Palestine which provided no outlet for the aspirations of Zionismcould only result In continued and increasingdisorders In Palestine which would bring great
discredit on the Mandatory Power.      his conclusion was,  therefore,  that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should advocate Partition and shouldstrive to get that solution endorsed by theUn i t e d Nat ions.The Cabinet -;: Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.C ab ine t Office ,  3.
