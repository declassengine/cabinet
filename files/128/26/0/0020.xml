Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that in his Statement on Business hewould announce that Parliament would adjourn for the Easter recessfrom 2nd to 14th April, and that the Chancellor of the exchequer would open his Budget when Parliament re-assembled on 14th April.Germany.Arrest of former Nazis.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 15thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the German Federal Chan-cellor had indicated privately to the United States and French repre-sentatives in Germany that he approved the action taken by theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in arresting Werner Naumannand his associates, and that the evidence seized at the time of theirarrest was sufficient to justify the institution of criminal proceedings against them in the German courts. It might therefore be assumed that Dr. Adenauer would before long make a public announcementof his intention to bring proceedings against these men.Commonwealth 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a report to theEconomic Cabinet on the course of the economic discussions which the ForeignConference. Secretary and he had held during their recent mission to Washington.Mission of The Chancellor said that the United States Government wereMinisters to not at present prepared to play their part in bringing into operationWashington. the proposals, evolved at the Commonwealth Economic Conference,(Previous for a collective approach to a multilateral system of trade and pay-Reference: ments. Though impressed with the extent of the recovery achievedC.C. (53) 15th Dy tne sterling area, they doubted whether its economy was yetConclusions, sufficiently strong or flexible to sustain the risks involved in makingMinute 12.)&apos; sterling convertible, and they had indicated that in their view the time was not yet opportune for putting these proposals into effect. More-over, for their part, they were not disposed at this early stage of their administration to ask Congress to approve the drastic measureswhich would be required in support of our proposals. Despite this,there was little doubt that we had been right in making this earlyapproach to the new American Administration. The members ofthe Administration had not yet formulated their economic policies;and, as a result of these discussions, they had agreed to undertake atonce an urgent review of the means by which the United States could best assist in the expansion of world trade and, in particular, of thequestion how their own overseas surplus was to be financed in future.This review was to be handled under the auspices of the NationalAdvisory Council, and Mr. Lewis Douglas was to play a leading partin it. United Kingdom Ministers had urged them in the discussions to seek a solution of their particular problem by encouraging a greaterflow of trade into the United States and generally by adopting &quot; goodcreditor &quot; policies. It must, however, be recognised that the new administration would find serious physical and political difficulties in following this course. They had yet to measure their strength with congress, and it was most unlikely that they would attempt to intro-duce before the autumn any measures of this kind which requiredapproval by the legislature. The most that we could hope for duringthe summer would be such alleviations of customs procedures as could be arranged by administrative action. It was evident that in american thinking the reduction of restrictions on world trade shouldprecede any movement towards greater convertibility of currencies;and, before encouraging us to proceed with plans for even a limitedconvertibility of sterling, they would first wish to be satisfied that the pattern of world trade was likely to be such as would support aconvertible pound. The discussions had certainly left them with a clearer impression of the size of the sterling area and its importance in world trade. It would probably be not less than six months before they had completed their review of world economic problems; andnot until then could we expect them either to endorse the proposals
Persia. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the new American Adminl,-(Previous stration. had been persuaded to give unequivocal support for our reference: latest proposals for the settlement of the oil dispute with Persia.C.C. (53) 14th They semed more ready than their predecessors had been to showConclusions, firmness in negotiations with the Persian Government on this problem.Minute 1.) The American Administration were, however, seriously concerned at the prospect that a substantial quantity of Persian oil might be shipped by small companies and placed on the market at prices belowthe world price fixed by the major oil companies. They believedthat more tankers were now available for such use, and they con-sidered that the risk was more serious than the Anglo-Iranian oil company had hitherto been willing to admit. The Foreign secretary said that he was arranging for the Departments concerned to re-assessthis risk and to consider what steps could be taken to avert it.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:CC.(53)T7thConclusions.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that as a result of his discussions in Washington full agreement had been reached regarding the basis on which an Anglo-American team was to conduct the next stage of the defence negotiations with Egypt. President Eisenhower had,however, insisted that the Americans could join in these negotiationsonly at the invitation of both the Governments concerned, and the egyptians had now rejected the suggestion that they should be invitedformulated at the Commonwealth Economic Conference or toproduce for our consideration alternative proposals of their own.Meanwhile the Secretary of the United States Treasury had asked for a considered statement of the means by which sterling areatrade with the United States could be expanded. The Chancellor saidthat he was preparing, in consultation with the President of the Boardof Trade, a memorandum setting out the specific steps which theUnited States Government might take to this end and he hoped tobe able to send this to the Secretary of the United States treasury in two or three weeks&apos; time.An even more immediate task was to consider what statement should be made, at the meeting of the Council of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) on 23rd March, regard-ing the results of this approach to the United States Government.It would be inexpedient formally to disclose to the Council detailsof the proposals evolved at the Commonwealth Economic Confer-ence for a limited convertibility of sterling. It should suffice to explain the general objectives of our proposed approach to a multilateralsystem of trade and payments. As things now stood, we must clearlyoffer to co-operate in extending the European Payments Union fora further period, and seek to persuade the European governments to join us in working out proposals for a wider system of international trade and payments to which the European countries could move byagreement when the United States were ready to welcome a develop-ment on those lines.The Foreign Secretary endorsed this statement by the Chancellor.He stressed, in particular, the need for caution in basing any plans on the assumption that the United States Administration would feel able in the near future to seek the assent of Congress to any major change in external economic policy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this report on the economic discussions in washington.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to circulate, for consideration at a meetinglater in the week, a more detailed statement of the line which they proposed to take at the forthcoming meetingof the Council of O.E.E.C.
Hoto participate in them. It was clear from the latest telegrams from cairo that the Egyptian Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary hadon this point been over-ruled by the other members of the EgyptianCabinet, and this might indicate that some change was taking placein the balance of power within the Egyptian Government. Unlessthe United States Government were prepared to press the Egyptiansto reconsider their attitude and this was unlikely a fresh deadlockseemed inevitable; for the Egyptians&apos; unwillingness to invite the americans to participate in the talks derived from their view that,before any discussions were opened about the future organisationof the defence of the Middle East as a whole, agreement must first bereached on the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, which was an issue concerning only the Governments of Egypt and the UnitedKingdom. As we were not prepared to discuss that issue in isolation,there was at present no basis on which negotiations could begin.In discussion it was agreed that, if there was no early prospect ofresuming the negotiations, it would not be reasonable to ask Field-Marshal Sir William Slim to defer his departure for Australia. no final decision could, however, be taken on this point until it was known whether the United States Government were prepared to take any fresh initiative to secure an invitation to join in the negotiations.The Cabinet-    &apos;Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Sudan. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that an unsatisfactory situation(Previous had now arisen over the nomination of the Sudanese representativesReference: on the Governor-general&apos;s Commission for the Sudan. One of theC.C. (53) 12th Sudanese political Parties had, it seemed, again been persuaded to conclusions, reflect Egyptian views which were not acceptable to us. He was minute l.) concerned at the extent to which the Egyptians seemed able to bringinfluence to bear on the Sudanese political Parties.The Foreign Secretary said that in all the circumstances hethought it would be useful if-the Minister of State made an earlyvisit to the Sudan. The Governor-General would doubtless be glad of this opportunity of personal discussion with one of Her Majesty&apos;ministers.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Royal Air 7.   The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of a state-Force, ment which he was proposing to make in the House of Commons thatLoss of Bomber afternoon on the circumstances in which a bomber aircraft of theAircraft over Royal Air Force, on a training flight from Yorkshire to Berlin, hadGermany. been shot down by Russian fighters on the borders of the eastern and Western Zones of Germany. In the concluding sentence of this statement the Prime Minister proposed to say that should Sovietaircraft stray into the British Zone of Germany &quot; every effort will bemade to warn them and to avoid loss of life.&quot; In discussion some doubt was expressed about the expediency of implying, as thissentence did, that in the last resort we might fire on a Soviet aircraft which persisted, despite warnings, in flying over the British Zone.It was suggested that, if our statement implied this, it would be twistedby the Soviet Government to suit their purpose. On the other hand it was argued that, whatever statement was made, the Soviet Govern-ment would misrepresent it if it suited their purpose to do so.After discussion it was agreed that the final sentence of this state-,ment should be amended to read: &quot; Should Soviet aircraft stray into our Zone, every effort will be made to warn them and, by following the procedures normally used by nations at peace, to avoid loss of life.&quot;
8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof State (C. (53) 96) and the Colonial Secretary (C. (53) 98) on thequestion whether the offer of the Hungarian Government to exchangeMr. Edgar Sanders for Lee ment should be entertained now that the death sentence imposed on Lee ment had been commuted to one of imprisonment for life.The Colonial Secretary said that the High Commissioner for theFederation of Malaya was strongly opposed to the exchange because it would make an unfortunate impression on public opinion in malaya and would be construed by the terrorists as proof of the power and prestige of the Soviet bloc. Moreover, Lee ment could not be released from imprisonment without a further exercise of clemency, which the sultan of Perak was unlikely to be willing to make without formalintervention by the High Commissioner which might lead to a consti-tutional crisis. For these reasons he hoped that the Hungarian offer would be rejected.The Foreign Secretary said that he was convinced by thearguments against the proposed exchange.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reject the offer of the hungarian Government to exchange Mr. Edgar Sandersfor Lee ment.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would take an early opportunity of announcing this decision in the House ofCommons.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 103) recommending further action in the dispute with Saudi Arabia about the territories of the Trucial Sheikdoms.The Foreign Secretary said that it was now clear that the saudi arabian Government would reject the offer of arbitration which wehad made on 5th January and they might bring the dispute to theUnited Nations. He therefore thought that we should not wait onevents, but should take full advantage of the military superioritywhich we had built up in the Trucial States. We should resume our freedom of action, which was at present circumscribed by the status quo Agreement of 1951 and the Buraimi Stand-Still Agreement of1952, and seal off the Buraimi Oasis with the object of forcing the saudi official, Turki, to depart, or at least of rendering him harmless.As soon as preparations for this action were completed, we should inform the Saudi Arabian Government that, while our offer ofarbitration remained open, we reserved our freedom of action incertain areas. At the same time we should place forces in positionto control key points and take steps to isolate Turki in Buraimi and make his position untenable. We should tell the United StatesGovernment of our intentions shortly before military action wastaken, and should explain to them the reasons for that action.. Theywere unlikely to sympathise with our attitude or to support us if the saudi Arabian Government brought the dispute to the united nations.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Forces comprising 100 Trucial levies, 300 Aden levies,12 R.A.F. armoured cars and some air support were now available,and these were considered strong enough to undertake the taskassigned to them. The Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, had beenasked to state the earliest date at which these vforces could be in readiness.(b) The Governments of the older Commonwealth countries hadbeen informed of our previous intentions and should be warned ofthe action we now proposed to take.   The Foreign Secretary offered
to discuss with the Commonwealth Secretary the question whether asimilar warning should be conveyed to the Government of Pakistan.The Cabinet (1) Approved the action proposed by the Foreign Secretary inC. (53) 103.(2) Instructed the Chiefs of Staff to let the Foreign Secretaryknow the earliest date at which the forces would be readyto move, so that he might inform the United StatesGovernment.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform theGovernments of the older Commonwealth countries, and invited him to discuss with the Foreign Secretary whethersimilar information should also be given to the Govern-ment of Pakistan.Mr. S. S. 10.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States authori-Siiverman, M.P. ties had refused to grant Mr. S. S. Silverman, M.P., a visa to enableProposed visit him to visit the United States for the purpose of pressing for theto United reprieve of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were under sentence of states. death for espionage. The Foreign Secretary had asked, while he wasin Washington, whether the United States Government would be willing to reverse this decision. He had been told that the decision must stand, unless he was willing to say that Mr. Silverman&apos;s visit wasvital to the maintenance of good relations between the United.Statesand the United Kingdom. He was not prepared to say this. he therefore proposed to announce, in reply to Questions in the Houseof Commons, that the United States Government were not preparedto modify their decision.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Flood 11.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the damage. Minister of Housing and Local Government (C. (53) 101) on theprevious        extent of the expenditure on the repair of the flood damage to be reference:      borne by local authorities, and a memorandum by the Home SecretaryC.C. (53) 19th   (C. (53) 104) covering the draft of a statement on these matters which conclusions,    he proposed to make in the House of Commons on 18th March.Minute 2.) jne Home Secretary said that there were certain passages in hisdraft statement on which the Departments concerned had not reached agreement, and he sought decisions on these from the Cabinet. Heand the Minister of Agriculture were anxious that the special pro-vision which would have to be made for the rehabilitation of the land should include expenditure on crops sown before the floods, orchardsthat had been destroyed, the cost of fences to replace destroyedhedges and of repairs to fences. This damage could not be coveredby the Lord Mayors&apos; Fund. The draft also showed alternative methods of dealing with expenditure by local authorities. The first alternative paragraph 13 made a less comprehensive promise ofreimbursement by the Government than the second alternative. Therewas nothing in the draft statement about the particular problems ofScotland, and he would like to be able to add a paragraph suggestedby the Secretary of State for Scotland to the effect that special assistance would be given to enable timber which could not be dealtwith by local sawmills to be carried to sawmills further south.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cost of repairingthe flood damage had now reached very large proportions and theExchequer was facing an expenditure on this of  30 to  40 millions.It had been represented to.him that this country had not suffered adisaster of this magnitude for centuries past; and, if the circumstance were in fact so. unusual, he presumed that the Government must
adopt a generous standard in providing financial help for the work ofrehabilitation. He felt, however, that in considering the reimburse-ment of local authorities it was unnecessary at this stage to go so faras the second alternative paragraph 13 of the draft statement. he recognised that, when the time came to make a general settlement with the local authorities, some further expenditure by the Exchequermight be necessary, but he thought it would be wrong to promisethis in advance. He agreed with the other proposals made by theHome Secretary and with the suggestion that special assistance shouldbe given towards the transport of timber in Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft statement attached to the memorandumby the Home Secretary (C. (53) 104), subject to the deletion of the square brackets in paragraphs 9 and 10,and of the second alternative paragraph 13, and to theinclusion of a statement on special assistance for thetransport of timber in Scotland.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment the remaining points raised in his memorandum c. (53) 101.Farm Price 12.   The Minister of Agriculture reported the progress made inReview. the negotiations with the farmers on the Farm Price Review.   He(Previous        said that the price of eggs would be one of the major issues in the reference:      negotiations, but he did not ask the Cabinet to depart from theC.C. (53) 18th   average minimum price of 45. already authorised.   On the fixed-Conclusions,    price commodities, the farmers had been offered a total award of minute 7.)        14-6 millions against the total of  16-9 millions authorised by theCabinet.   This included the offer of an additional %d. a gallon on milk: and, although the farmers were pressing for %d., he did not ask for authority to raise his offer of \d.  On meat he had offered3s. a cwt. The farmers wanted 45. a cwt. but again he thought it wise to resist any increase on the 35.  The Cabinet had previously agreedthat an essential part of any agreement should be a reduction in theprice of wool.   The farmers were opposed to any reduction.   Theexisting price of wool could be retained without any additional costto the Exchequer.   He recommended that the Cabinet should authorise him to agree that there would be no reduction in the priceof wool.In discussion the point was made that the effect of the final settlement on the cost-of-living index should be carefully watched and every possible step taken to avoid any substantial or sudden increase.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to continue negotia-tions with the farmers on the Farm Price Review on thefollowing basis:  (i) That there should be no advance on the support price for eggs of 45. a dozen.(ii) That there should be no advance on the offer of\d. a gallon on milk.(iii) That there should be no advance on the offer of 35.a cwt. on meat.(iv) That the existing price of wool should be retained.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to consult with the Minister ofLabour before increasing, as a result of the Farm PriceH Review, any retail food prices which would affect thecost-of-living index.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th March, 1953.
