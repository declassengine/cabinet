Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week following the end of the summer recess. All the Bills mentioned in the Queen&apos;s Speech would havebeen completed before the recess, and very little legislative business would be left over for completion in the autumn before the Proroga-tion. Parliament would be prorogued during the week beginning26th October.  The new Session would be opened on 3rd November.The Cabinet also discussed the arrangements for the generaldebates to be held on the two remaining days before the summer recess.The Cabinet. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister had(Previous approved the arrangements on which they had provisionally agreed,Reference: at their meeting on 23rd July, for the conduct of Cabinet businessC.C.

(53)218)  commenting  on  recent  suggestions  that(Previous responsibility for the affairs of Malta and the Gold Coast should be reference: transferred from the Colonial Office to the Commonwealth RelationsC.C. (53) 26th Office.Conclusions,Minute 5.)Malta. The Colonial Secretary recalled the difficulties which had arisen(Previous over the claim of the Maltese that their Prime Minister should be reference : accorded at the Coronation privileges comparable with those extendedC.C (53) 32nd to the Prime Ministers of Southern Rhodesia and Northern Ireland.Conclusions, Although care had been taken to explain at that time that the con-Minute 2.) cessions made were based on Malta&apos;s unique position as the GeorgeCross Island, the Prime Minister of Malta had submitted before leaving London a memorandum claiming that the United KingdomGovernment should recognise Malta&apos;s constitutional status by trans-ferring responsibility for her affairs to the Commonwealth relations office. It would clearly be most inexpedient to grant this request;for there was no early, prospect of Malta&apos;s achieving financial andeconomic independence and, even if she did, she was not of sufficientsize and importance to warrant the status of a fully independentmember of the Commonwealth. If responsibility for her affairs were transferred to the Commonwealth Relations Office meieiy on tnebasis of her political independence in the conduct of domestic affairs,this would create an awkward precedent for the future when a similarstage of development was reached by the Gold Coast and other colonial territories. At the same time, he was satisfied that the maltese, as a European people boasting a civilisation older than ourown, would not tolerate for long their inclusion in the same con-stitutional category as the peoples of the African Colonies. he therefore proposed that steps should be taken to assimilate theconstitutional status of Malta to that of the Channel Islands and the isle of Man. On that basis Malta would be placed under the chargeof the Privy Council, and the Home Secretary could be the memberof the Council charged with the responsibility for handling therelations of the United Kingdom Government with Malta.The Home Secretary said that he would be prepared to accept this responsibility on the basis indicated in paragraph 6 of C. (53) 218.
In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Before assenting to this proposal the Cabinet should besatisfied that it was consistent with a considered long-term patternfor the development of Commonwealth relations. The position ofthe Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, as Dependencies of theCrown in relation with the Privy Council, was founded on history.If we were to make an entirely new use of that relationship as a meansof resolving current difficulties with Malta, we must be sure that thiswas a constitutional status to which other small Colonial dependenciescould aspire without distorting the general pattern of commonwealth relations.(b) There was support for the view that this might be found infuture to be a suitable status for Colonial territories which acquiredindependence within the Commonwealth but were too small to qualify for full Commonwealth membership. With a view to future developments, however, it would probably be wise to lay moreemphasis on the jurisdiction of the Privy Council than on that of aparticular Minister on this occasion the Home Secretary. Forwhile the Home Secretary might appropriately handle the affairs of malta, it would be much less suitable that he should in future begiven such charge of the affairs of more distant Colonies, e.g.,Mauritius, which might become eligible for a comparable constitu-tional status.(c) Responsibility for Malta&apos;s affairs would involve an admin-istrative burden much heavier than that arising from the HomeSecretary&apos;s duties in respect of the Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan. An assessment should be made of the additional administrative work which would be thrown on the Home Office as a result of this transfer of responsibility and of the means by which these new duties would be carried out.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that means should be sought of assimilat-ing the constitutional position of Malta to that of theChannel Islands and the Isle of Man, on the general lines indicated in paragraph 6 of C. (53) 218.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and the Commonwealth Secre-tary, for further study to be made of the points noted inparagraphs (a)-(c) above, with a view to framing specificplans for giving effect to the proposal outlined inConclusion (1) above.(3) Took note that, when these studies were complete, theChancellor of the Exchequer would consult with thePrime Minister before any communication was made tothe Government of Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that, when proposals for constitu-tional reform had recently been debated in the Colonial Legislatureof the Gold Coast, the suggestion had been made that responsibilityfor the affairs of the Gold Coast should also be transferred to theCommonwealth Relations Office in the final transition stage before independence was reached. He believed that it would be a mistake to make this transfer of responsibility before the Gold Coast had reached the stage of complete self-government. He considered thatin the interim stage responsibility for the further constitutional development of the Colony should continue to rest with the ColonialOffice.In discussion there was full support for the view expressed bythe Colonial Secretary on this point.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed in principle that responsibility for the affairs of theGold Coast should continue to rest with the ColonialGold Coast.(previous reference:C.C.

3SS7Secretary during the interim stage before the Colonyachieved complete self-government; and invited theColonial Secretary to consider how this decision could best be conveyed to the Gold Coast Government whenthey formally presented their proposals for further constitutional change.Tariff Policy. 4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Common-Japan and the wealth Secretary (C. (53) 213), the Chancellor of the ExchequerG.A.T.T. (C. (53)215) and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 221)(Previous on the attitude to be adopted by the President of the Board of TradeReference: at the Eighth Session of the contracting parties to the GeneralC.C. (53) 3lst Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) on the report of theConclusions, Intersessional Committee on Japan&apos;s application to accede to the minute 6.) Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while there was still some difference of view among Ministers on the course whichwe should pursue if Japan were allowed to accede to the G.A.T.T.,there was general agreement that her accession would be damaging to our interests, and particularly to our export trade. He therefore suggested that at the September session of the contracting partieshe should seek to have the issue deferred for a further period.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could assent to thissuggestion on the understanding that the arguments in favour of delay were so presented as to avoid prejudicing in any way theGovernments ultimate freedom of choice between relying on. the safeguards in Article XXIII of the Agreement or resorting to ArticleXXXV in the event of Japan&apos;s accession.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade, at theforthcoming session of the contracting parties to theG.A.T.T., to refrain from supporting Japan&apos;s accession ordefining in advance our attitude towards it, but to seek tohave the issue deferred for a further period.Judges&apos;Salaries.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 217) on the remuneration of the judges of the High Court.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Cabinet had invited him to submit proposals for improving the Judges&apos; remunera-tion by an increase in gross salary coupled with a tax-free allowance for travelling expenses. The Lord Chancellor and the Secretary ofState for Scotland had agreed with him, upon closer examination,that it would be wise to drop the proposal for a tax-free allowance and to rely solely on an increase of  3,000 in gross salaries, repre-senting for the majority of Judges a net increase of  841 over the netvalue of their salaries at the time when the present Bill was intro-duced. It was also proposed that circuit allowances should be reviewed. If the Cabinet were now to authorise the drafting of aBill on the basis of his proposals, a final decision could be deferred until a draft Bill was before them and they had to decide whetherthis matter should be mentioned in the Queen&apos;s Speech.The Lord Chancellor welcomed the Chancellors proposalswhich, so far as he was able to judge, should satisfy the Judges andprove acceptable to Government supporters.The Secretary of State for Scotland also supported the proposals.
The following points were made in discussion:  (a) There was a case for granting the Judges a measure of retrospection in the application of their proposed higher salaries,possibly to the beginning of the current financial year.It was agreed that the draft Bill should provisionally providefor such retrospection in order that the Cabinet might have a further opportunity of considering the point.(b) The Chief Whip urged that the Governmenfs revised pro-posals should be explained in good time to Government supporters in the House of Commons with a view to enlisting their support forthem.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (53) 217 and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to submit for their considera-tion the draft of the Bill which would be required to carrythem out.Armed Forces. 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theOfficers&apos; Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 206) recommending that, insteadRetired Pay. 0f proceeding with the earlier proposal to restore to Service officers(Previous who retired between the two wars the 9i per cent, cut imposed in reference: 1935 upon the 1919 pension rates, the Departments concerned shouldC.C. (53) 38th give further study to a scheme whereby, without any means test, an conclusions, immediate increase of 10 per cent, would be given on all retired payMinute 1.)      and pensions awarded up to 1945 where this was more favourable than any increase already provided under existing Pensions Increasemeasures.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on balance, he remained opposed to making any concession in this matter but, if hiscolleagues thought it essential to make some concession, he would prefer his suggested alternative scheme to the earlier proposal, whichwould not in his view satisfy the Service officers concerned and was likely to have far-reaching repercussions in other directions. Clearly,a statement could not now be made before the summer recess and departments might, therefore, be instructed to undertake an examina-tion of his alternative proposal.The Minister of Defence said that he had no objection to further examination of the chancellors alternative proposal, which appearedto be more generous than his own, provided that it remained opento the Cabinet to consider his proposal again if the Chancellofsscheme should prove, on closer examination, to be either impracticable-able or too costly.In discussion it was suggested that a valid distinction could bemade between retired Service officers and retired civil servants andthat some difference in their treatment in the matter of pensionscould be justified. On the other side it was argued that, although this might be so, concessions made at the present time to retiredService officers could not fail to strengthen the claims of retired civilservants, and police pensioners, and possibly other pensioners, for similar concessions.The Cabinet - Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the.scheme outlined in C. (53) 206 to be further examined bythe Departments concerned and to report the results of this examination.
7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 216) on the subject of trans-shipment and transaction controls in East-West trade.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that the cabinet had agreed on 10th February that the United Kingdom delegation to the Paris Group should indicate that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared to consider the introduction of transaction controls in east-West trade, provided that all other countries within the Groupintroduced:  (i) trans-shipment controls;(ii) controls over the trading activities of their own nationalsequivalent to our suggested transaction controls.The report by the Security Export Controls Working Party annexed to his memorandum showed that these two conditions were capableof being broadly fulfilled, although the transit authorisation schemewhich would be introduced by the Netherlands, Western Germanyand France might not be as effective in practice as full trans-shipmentcontrols. There was little doubt that introduction of these furthercontrols would prevent an appreciable proportion of the breachesto which the present control of strategic exports to Russia and the satellites was subject. On the other hand; it would be difficult to resist pressure for extending the new controls to the Colonies, whichwould involve legislation in the United Kingdom Parliament, andthe present hardly seemed an opportune time for intensifyingmeasures aimed at the Soviet bloc. He therefore recommended thatour representatives at the August meeting of the Paris Group should seek to secure deferment of a final decision on this question untilour current review of East-West trade had been completed.The general view of the Cabinet was that, while our representa-tives with the Paris Group should seek to secure deferment of a finaldecision on this question, as recommended by the President of theBoard of Trade, they should make abundantly clear our firmendorsement of the policy of controlling the export of strategic goods to Soviet Russia and its satellites and our readiness in principle totake such further measures as might from time to time be opportuneto carry out this policy.The Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give instruc-tions accordingly to our representatives with the paris group.East-west trade.(previous reference :C.C.
