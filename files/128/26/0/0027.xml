Income Tax. 1.   The Prime Minister drew attention to the criticisms whichScilly Islands. were being directed against the proposal, announced in the budget statement, to enforce the collection of income tax on incomes earned in the Scilly Islands. This proposal seemed likely to involve theGovernment in political difficulties quite disproportionate to theamount of revenue which it would yield. The economy of the ScillyIslands had been built up on the basis that income tax was not payablethere, and the residents had planned their lives on that basis. the sudden reversal of fortune which this proposal would involve forthem could be represented as a harsh and precipitate act of govern-ment. Would it not have been more reasonable to give them longernotice of this change, or even to introduce it by degrees?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was no logicalground for maintaining this immunity, which was not enjoyed byresidents in any of the other small islands round the coasts ofEngland, Wales and Scotland except the handful of people living onLundy Island. The flower-growers in the Scilly Islands were enjoyingon this account a prosperity which was envied by their competitorson the mainland; and, with the advent of air travel, the exceptionallyfavourable position of the islanders was attracting increased attention.It was estimated that the change would yield an additional annualrevenue of  100,000 from a population of only a little over twothousand. Under his present proposal they would be given somenotice of the change, for they would not be required to begin payingincome tax until the financial year 1954-55. But he was willing toconsider whether a longer period of notice would be justified.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whetherit would be expedient to postpone for somewhat longer theintroduction of income tax into the Scilly Islands, so thatresidents might have longer notice of the change.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Opposition had suggested that time should be found on20th April to debate the orders imposing control over British shipping in the China trade. It was agreed that, in view of the stage reached in the armistice talks in Korea, it would be preferable that this debate should be postponed; and the Opposition might be asked to agreethat it should be deferred until after the Foreign Affairs debate whichwas to take place in the week beginning 27th April.The Cabinet agreed that every effort should be made to completeduring the following week the discussion of the Lords amendments to the Transport Bill, even though this might involve one or morelate sittings.Housing Policy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 7thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (53) 125) seeking decisions on the main issues ofprinciple which had emerged from the discussions of the CabinetCommittee on Housing Policy.&apos; The Lord Privy Seal said that there were two main questions for decision:  (i) Did the Cabinet adhere to the decision of principle, whichthey had taken in October, that rent control should be relaxed forthe purpose of encouraging the owners of house-property to carry outessential repairs?44078-4 B 2
(ii) If so, should a Bill for this purpose be introduced during thepresent session?It would be possible to find time this session for only one suchmeasure, but the Secretary of State for Scotland thought it essentialthat the separate Scottish Bill which would be required should been acted at the same time as, or very soon after, the English Bill.The Minister of Housing said that the proposal to relax rent control had to be viewed as part of the Governments housing policy as a whole. This had two main aspects-the building of new houses and the repair (or ultimate demolition) of old houses. With the help of his colleagues he was well on the way to mastering the firstproblem. The number of new houses completed in the first threemonths of 1953, which would be announced on 2nd May, was 69,500,compared with 53,500 in the corresponding period of 1952. this represented a rate of increase of about 60,000 a year; and, althoughit would be unwise to say so publicly at this stage, there was a reason-able prospect that the Government would attain this year their objective of building 300,000 houses in a year. When this objectivehad been achieved, the emphasis should be transferred from thebuilding of new houses to the repair or demolition of old houses.Of the 13-1 million houses and fiats in Great Britain, about1\ million were owned by landlords. Of the 6% million of these inEngland and Wales, no less than 4 - million were over 65 years old.The condition of these houses and flats varied widely and the action required in respect of them was of four main kinds: (1) conversions;(ii) improvements; (iii) ordinary repairs; and (iv) the makinghabitable of dilapidated and condemned houses which could not be dispensed with for a number of years. The first, second and fourthof these would be covered by &quot; Operation Rescue,&quot; which would forman essential part of the Governments &quot; grand design &quot; for housing and would be the subject of separate legislation in the 1953-54 session.The proposal to relax rent control was concerned only with (iii) above,viz., ordinary repairs.The wide variations in existing rents in England and Wales made it impossible to allow rents to be raised by a flat percentage increase.Instead, it was proposed to relate the permitted rent increase to thestatutory deduction (in respect of repairs) from the gross value ofthe house for rating purposes. Rents would be allowed to increase by \\ times this statutory deduction; but, in order to prevent disproportionately-portionate increases, a maximum would be imposed equal to twice the gross value of the house for rating purposes. In Scotland, on theother hand, the only practicable method was a fiat percentage increase and the Secretary of State had in mind one of 40 per cent.Arrangements on these lines would result in rent increases ranging from Is. to 6s. a week for a substantial proportion of the occupiers of houses and flats subject to rent restriction. It should be notedthat many local authorities had already felt obliged to raise the rents of their houses by amounts ranging from 4s. to 7s. a week.Rent increases of privately-owned houses would be subject to two conditions. First, the landlord would be required to declare that the house was in &quot; good and tenantable repair,&quot; the tenanthaving a right of appeal against the landlords declaration to this effect. Secondly, in England and Wales the landlord would haveto show that, since 1st January, 1953, he had incurred expenditureon repairs to the house at an annual rate not less than twice thestatutory deduction. One incidental advantage of imposing theseconditions would be that rent increases would take place piecemeal,thereby reducing the risk of rent strikes or mass appeals.If the Cabinet approved the general plan, but decided againstlegislation to relax rent control in the current session, he would recommend early publication of a White Paper explaining fully allthe aspects of the Governments housing policy.  Legislation in the
Atomic Energy        4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterOrganisation.    (C. (53) 124) covering an interim report from the Committee(Previous        appointed, under the Chairmanship of Lord Waverley, to deviseReference:      means of transferring responsibility for atomic research and produc-C.C. (53) 2nd    tion from the Ministry of Supply to a non-departmental organisation.Conclusions,    The Committee had reported that they were satisfied that it would minute 9.) &apos;    be feasible to devise a practical plan for this purpose; but that they wished to visit the plants and establishments concerned and, as this might give rise to publicity, suggested that the Government might wish to announce publicly at this stage that it had been decided inprinciple to make the transfer.current session would then be confined to a Rating and ValuationBill, and the remaining measures to implement the government&apos;s policy would be reserved for introduction in the new session.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed fully withthe broad outlines of the Minister^ proposals. These should be presented as a comprehensive plan to deal with a major social andeconomic problem. The continued drain on the Exchequer in respectof the housing subsidy constituted one of the most serious remainingthreats to the stability of sterling, but some relaxation of rent control was an essential preliminary to any reduction of the subsidy. Fromhis point of view it was desirable that legislation for this purpose should be enacted at the earliest possible date.The Minister of Works said that it would take some little time tocomplete the Governments &quot; grand design &quot; for housing, which vitallyaffected the future of the building industry. He would-prefer that,in the meantime, there should be no announcement of the Govern-ments intention to relax rent control.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in spite of the rent increases which would flow from these proposals, the Governmentstood to gain rather than lose by attempting the early solution ofthis grave and long-standing problem, and that the proposals, ifpresented and, so far as possible, carried through as a single operation^&apos;seemed likely to be broadly acceptable to responsible opinion in the country.The Prime Minister said that the Ministers plan appeared to be generally acceptable on the basis that legislation to relax rent control would not be introduced in advance of the publication of a compre-hensive White Paper fully explaining the Governments policy as awhole. It would be convenient if the Lord Privy Seats Committee,with the Chief Whip, would consider the procedure, tactics and timing of the plan in relation to the Parliamentary situation.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision that rent control should be relaxedfor the1 purpose of encouraging the owners of house-property to carry out essential repairs.(2) Gave general approval to the schemes of relaxation proposedby the Minister of Housing and Secretary of State forScotland and summarised in C. (53) 125.(3) Agreed that these proposals should be publicly presented ina White Paper in their setting as a part of the compre-hensive housing policy outlined by the Minister of housing in the discussion.(4) Invited the Cabinet Committee on Housing Policy, with theChief Whip, to consider the questions of procedure, tacticsand timing in relation to the Parliamentary situation,, andto report further to the Cabinet as necessary.
The Paymaster-General and The Minister of Supply supported this proposal for an early announcement of the decision of principle which the Cabinet had taken on 14th January. One newspaper hadalready made an unauthorised disclosure about the activities of LordWaverl ey&apos;s Committee, and this was a further reason for an earlyofficial announcement. Before this was made, however, the Oppo-sition Leaders in the House of Commons should be informedprivately and told that it had always been, and still was, the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to consult with them as soon as the final report ofLord Waverley&apos;s Committee had been received.The Minister of Supply said that paragraph 3 (/) of the report annexed to C. (53) 124 should not be taken to prejudge the questionwhether establishments engaged in research and production work on atomic weapons should be transferred from the Ministry of supply to the new organisation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not preparedto accept, without further discussion, the proposal that the Govern-ment should now announce the decision which they had taken on14th January.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (53) 124 at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,J6th April, 1953.
