Korea. 1.   The Lord President said that the armistice in Korea had(Previous       come into force on 27th July and the Assembly of the United NationsReference:      was to meet on 17th August to settle the composition of the PoliticalC.C. (53) 45th   Conference.   He hoped that before the Assembly met agreementConclusions.    would have been reached on this point between the members of the minute 4.)      United Nations mainly concerned.   Our view had been that thePolitical Conference should not be confined to the main antagonistsonly, but should include other countries, e.g., India, in the hope thatit might further a general settlement of Far Eastern problems.  Thefinal composition was a matter for the Assembly of the united nations; but it was certainly our view that we should be representedand this could be made Clear in answers to Parliamentary Questions.The Lord President said that, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;conclusion of 23rd July, he had urged upon the United states secretary of State the disadvantages of publishing in presentcircumstances the declaration on the consequences which mightensue from a breach of the armistice. Mr. Dulles had suggested adifferent procedure which would have gone some way to mitigatingthe ill-effects of the declaration. He had suggested that, in the reportto the United Nations by the Unified Command covering thearmistice documents, a passage should be introduced explaining the origin of the declaration and stating that it had been drawn up beforethe South Koreans had raised objections to the armistice. Thepassage would then make it clear that the purpose of the declaration was to secure peace and would go on to give a warning (in fact toSyngman Rhee) that the declaration would only come into play inthe event of unprovoked aggression on the Communist side. TheAmerican draft, however, did not, in his view, give full effect to thissuggestion (Washington telegram No. 1609) and he had therefore proposed an amended wording (Foreign Office telegram No. 3016)which he hoped Mr. Dulles would accept.In discussion the Cabinet endorsed the terms of the draft pro-posed by the Lord President. It was pointed out that the declaration would not become known for about a week. In the meantime it was desirable that the Opposition leaders in the House of commons should be told in confidence what was now proposed. This could bedone after the debate on Foreign Affairs in the House of Lords.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of these statements by the Lord President.(2) Invited the Lord President to inform the Opposition leaders in the House of Commons, in confidence, of the mannerin which the warning declaration was to be made public.Germany. 2.   The Lord President said that the German Federal Republic(Previous had adopted Deutschland fiber Alles as their National Anthem. in reference: Germany this was now played on suitable occasions when BritishC.C.

Public 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theExpenditure. Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 166) covering the report of a(Previous special Committee of Ministers which had been set up to considerReference: what further measures could be put in hand with a view to securingC.C.(53) 15th further reductions in Government expenditure in the years ahead;Conclusions, and another memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerMinute 5.) (C. (53) 211) assessing the current economic situation and calling forrigorous economy in the preparation of the estimates for the forth-coming year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was becoming increasingly difficult to find ways of easing the burden of public expenditure. Reductions in the rate of food subsidies had broughtwelcome relief, but he could no longer look forward to the same degree of relief from that quarter. The burden of defence expendi-ture was the subject of current discussion between himself and theMinister of Defence and the Service Ministers, and he hoped thattogether they would arrive at an understanding which would give usadequate security and some saving in expenditure. The results ofthese discussions would come before the Cabinet at a later stage.The National Health Service and provision for old age were the subjects of enquiry by two independent Committees, which would report in due course. Housing policy in general would be the subjectOf more detailed discussion in the Cabinet when the Minister of housing had been able to prepare a draft White Paper. On educa-tion it was difficult to see any great curtailment of expenditure,without reducing the number of teachers. He suggested that theCabinet might have some preliminary discussion of these mainsubjects.Colonial The Colonial Secretary said that the Cabinet should be awareExpenditure.    that Malaya faced a serious budget deficit, which might well costFood Prices. 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum by(Previous the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food (C. (53)Reference: 174) proposing certain increases in the prices of butter, margarineC.C.(53)38th and cooking fat (including lard). They also had before.... them a conclusions, memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the MinisterMinute 2.) of Food (C. (53) 200) recommending that the retail price of sugarshould be increased by \d. a pound from 6th September.The Minister of Food said that the object of the proposed increases was to keep the food subsidies within the limit of the  220millions announced in the Budget. If a decision were delayed untiiafter the Parliamentary recess, larger price increases would have tobe made in order to achieve this object. He therefore proposed thatall the increases should be brought into operation from 6th Sep-tember. The effect of the increase in the retail price of sugar andin the price of butter, margarine and cooking fat (including lard)would be to raise the cost-of-living index by -54 of a point. Asagainst this, the price of milk would fall in November by -\d. a pint.The Minister of Labour said that he had been anxious that thereshould be no increase in food prices while critical negotiations on wages claims were in progress; but, as the effect of these increases would not be felt before October, he was prepared to accept theproposals.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Food to increase the retail priceof sugar by \d. a pound from 6th September, and to bring into effect from the same date the increases in the prices of butter, margarine and cooking fat (including lard) proposedin C. (53) 174.
the Exchequer about  18 millions. The Government of Kenyawould also want help to meet its budget deficit, though not on thesame scale. The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed that he was making allowances for these contingencies.Housing Policy. The Minister of Housing said that in the six months ending on 5th August 145,000 new houses had been built. This compared with110,000 in the corresponding period of 1952 and 92,000 in 1951. Itwas possible therefore that the ultimate target of 300,000 houses would be reached in the current year. One notable feature of thisyear&apos;s expanding programme was that it included 50,000 unsubsidisedhouses and he hoped that in 1954 this would be increased to 80,000or even 100,000. This necessitated a curtailment of local authority housing programmes, if the total load of the housing programme wasnot to exceed the availability of materials.The Minister said that he was circulating to the Cabinet the first draft of a White Paper on housing policy which would embody his proposals for the decontrol of rent and for the repair of obsolescentproperty. Work on the elaboration of his proposals could go onduring August and September, and he did not look for final cabinet decisions before October. If it were then decided to proceed withthis plan, the White Paper could be published just before the pro-rogation of Parliament and discussed during the Debate on the address. For the time being the decision on timing could be reserved, and it was most important that there should be no leakage of the Governments intentions. He would prepare an alternativestatement of policy for use if it were decided not to launch the full programme at this stage.The Minister of Works said that he could not agree with thestatement in paragraph 6 of C. (53) 211 that there were indications that the load on the building industry as a whole would reach a level which it would be difficult to maintain. The productivity of thebuilding industry had increased greatly, as evidenced by the fact that20 per cent, more cement and 15 per cent, more bricks were being used by the same labour force. He estimated that, so long as house-building (by local authorities and private individuals) did not exceed the target of 300,000, the building industry would be able in 1954,with the materials now in prospect, to achieve an expansion of 6 or7 per cent, in other programmes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that these reports by theMinister of Housing and the Minister of Works were very encouraging-ing. They would doubtless keep in mind the danger to the economy of exceeding the limit set to the housing programme and of acceptinga greater load on the building industry than the supply of materialsmade desirable.Education. The Minister of Education said that there was little she could do to cut down the cost of education without major changes in policy.She was already doing her utmost to secure administrative economies.Any raising of the minimum school starting age would have to bemade compulsory, since on a voluntary basis almost all children would start at the lowest age. The lowering of the school leaving agewould meet with serious political opposition and would not in prac-tice lead to any great reduction in the number of teachers unless the excessive size of some classes were maintained. The charging of feeswould be a departure from traditional policy. It would seemparticularly anomalous that the Government should first increasechildren&apos;s allowances and then take some part of them back byforcing parents to pay for compulsory schooling: fees would alsomean the imposition of a means test and considerable administrativeexpense.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Paymaster-General questioned whether the large rise in expenditure in 1963-64 could be accounted for by the fact that the
children now entering school would by that date be receivinguniversity and technical education. The forecast for expenditure onUniversities in 1963-64 was in fact only  12 millions above the figure for 1955-56, whereas the expenditure on schools was up by  56millions in the same period.(b) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster asked whetherexcessive grants were not being made to University students. Inreply The Minister of Education said that a severe income test wasapplied in these cases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at some later stage,but not before the new Valuation Bill, it might be profitable to discussthe transfer of an increased proportion of the cost of education tothe rates. In the meantime the Minister of Education would con-concentrate upon administrative economies and bring forward sugges-tions whenever possible for economies in other fields.Subsidies. The Minister of Food said that the food subsidies could not bereduced much further without cutting into the subsidies paid to homeproducers. At present the Exchequer made about  14 millions profiton imported meat and  11 millions profit on imported bacon andthese profits went towards the agricultural subsidies. The subsidiespaid for bread ( 45 millions), milk ( 40 millions) and welfare schemes( 46 millions) could be progressively reduced, but not without some increase in the cost of living.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the economic policy Committees should keep the food subsidies under continuous review and should report later to the Cabinet. The reduction of subsidies up to date had played a striking part in the freeing of the economy.The President of the Board of Trade drew attention to the factthat excessive demands for Government expenditure were beingmade both on capital and on current account. He was convincedthat, taken together, they were more than the economy could bearand were only being made at the expense of our overseas tradingposition. So long as they continued at the present rate he did notthink that industry could achieve the necessary export targets, but he recognised that no major reduction could be made without major changes in policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the cabinet should take note of the two memoranda before them (C. (53) 166 andC. (53) 211). He was glad to have the assurances of the Minister of housing and the Minister of Works that they understood the dangers to the economy of overloading the building industry and exceeding the housing programme;&apos; He would discuss further with the Ministerof Education administrative economies and the prospects of futuresavings by changes in long-term policy. The Economic PolicyCommittee should keep the food subsidies under continuous review.He would bear in mind the demands on the Exchequer in relation to capital account for loans from the Exchequer or for guarantees forloans raised on the market. He asked that all Ministers should give instructions that the estimates for the services for which they were responsible for the forthcoming year were to be prepared on thebasis of the most rigorous economy. If that were done and if hecould reach some satisfactory agreement on the level of defence expenditure, he hoped that the position could be held in 1954. Thesituation after 1954, however, contained elements of great danger.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusions and recommendations in para-graph 17 of C. (53) 166.(2) Took note of the economic situation, as set out in C. (53) 211,and invited all Ministers in charge of Departments toprepare their estimates for 1954 on the basis of the mostrigorous economy.
Opening ofParliament.Facilities for television.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 38thConclusions,Minute 6.)5, The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Sealand the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (53) 204) covering a memo-randum outlining the considerations which would have to be takeninto account in deciding whether facilities should be given fortelevising the Opening of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that there were strong arguments against granting such facilities at any time, and there would be par-ticular difficulty in doing so in the coming autumn. informal soundings would have to be taken in both Houses of Parliament, a.ndthese could not be carried out in the short time remaining beforeParliament rose for the summer recess. In any event he believedthat television of the Opening of Parliament for the 1953-54 session would seem something of an anti-climax after the television of the coronation.In discussion it was argued that there was no true comparison between the Opening of Parliament and the Coronation; for theformer was essentially a political occasion and there would beparticular objection to the televising of The Queen&apos;s Speech. Thepoint was also made that any facilities granted for television wouldhave.to be extended to the newsreel companies, and that there wouldbe great difficulty in finding room for both television and newsreelcameras, even in the Royal Gallery.It was the general view of the Cabinet that no encouragementshould be given to the idea that any facilities could be granted fortelevising the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet Agreed that no further action should be taken on thesuggestion that facilities should be given for televising theOpening of Parliament.Recognition of post Office staff associations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 45thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the timing of anannouncement of Government policy on the recognition of certainStaff Associations in the Post Office.The Postmaster-General said that, although he would not press for an immediate announcement, he would greatly prefer it in viewof the Governments earlier undertakings and of the risk that, if anannouncement were made in -the recess, they would be accused ofdeliberately depriving Parliament of the opportunity for a discussion.Lord Listowel had put down a Question on the matter for answer inthe House of Lords that afternoon.The Minister of Labour said that Mr. Marlowe, M.P., who led the small group of Government supporters which had recently tableda Motion in favour of granting recognition to the EngineeringOfficers (Telecommunications) Association (E.O.T.A.) had informed him that the purpose of the Motion was to demonstrate its sponsors&apos;reluctance to abandon their previous attitude on this matter ratherthan to embarrass the Government. From the point of view ofindustrial relations generally, there was no reason for deferring anannouncement.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, as the policy of non-recognition had to be announced sooner or later, it would be prefer-able to announce it before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess. In order, however, to preclude the possibility that theOpposition might seek to embarrass the Government by raising thematter in Committee of Supply in the House of Commons on30th July, the announcement in both Houses should be deferred until that date. It would still be open to Mr. Marlowe, M.P., to raisethe matter on the adjournment on 31st July.
ProvisionalLegislativeProgramme :1953-54Session.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (53) 210) seeking approval of a provisional legislative programme for the 1953-54 Session.The Lord Privy Seal said that final decisions on the main Bills tobe included in the programme need not be taken until the Cabinetcame to consider the contents of The Queen&apos;s Speech. meanwhile it was desirable to provide a reasonably firm foundation for the workof the Parliamentary draftsmen. Apart from the Housing, Lease-hold and Town and Country Planning Bills, the programme con-tained little which seemed likely to engender serious controversy between the Parties: on the other hand, it contained several valuablemeasures for example, the proposed Bills on Food and Drugs and safety in Mines and Quarries. His paper made no reference to two other possible and controversial subjects for legislation, namelyHouse of Lords Reform and University Franchise.The Lord President said that his Committee had made some progress with their consideration of possible reform of the composi-tion and powers of the House of Lords before their deliberationswere interrupted by his being placed in charge of the Foreign Office.He would circulate a memorandum showing the point which hadbeen reached in the Committee&apos;s discussion of their problem.The Home Secretary said that it now seemed that restoration ofthe University franchise might prove to be impracticable if pluralvoting was ruled out; and the Universities might have to be left tomake their contribution to Parliament in the House of Lords.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet ought toconsider these two matters further before reaching final decisions onthe legislative programme for the next Session. Meanwhile ListsA-D annexed to C. (53) 210 would provide a suitable basis for thework of the Parliamentary draftsmen. A final decision about theinclusion- of the Housing Bill could clearly not be taken until theCabinet had before them the draft of a White Paper setting out infull the Governments proposed future housing policy..&apos; The following further points were made in the discussion:  (a) If the Government approved the Waverley Report (C. (53)208) and decided to transfer responsibility for atomic energy fromThe Cabinet proceeded to consider a. draft of the proposed announcement, copies of which were handed round at the meeting.It was agreed that this draft could with advantage be shortened and various drafting amendments were suggested. It Was further sug-gested that the oral statement in the House of Commons could bekept quite brief, if an undertaking were given to circulate in theOfficial Report the full text of the longer statement made by thePostmaster-General in the House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governments policy on this matter shouldbe announced in reply to Questions in both Houses ofParliament on Thursday, 30th July, and invited the lord president and the Postmaster-General to ask LordListowel to defer his Question accordingly.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister of Labour and the Postmaster-General, in con-sultation, to revise the draft statement in the light of the cabinets discussion and to settle the final draft with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary andthe Lord Privy Seal.
8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Lord President (C. (53) 203 and 209) regarding thelegislation which would need to be passed before the United kingdom could accede to the International Convention on Genocide.The Home Secretary said that he had arranged for a draft of thenecessary legislation to be prepared, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 4th September, 1952, and copies of this had been cir-culated with his memorandum. He had, however, set out in para-graph 3 of C. (53) 203 the objections which could be raised to legislation of this kind. He invited the Cabinet to decide whether,despite these objections, the Bill should be passed in order that we might be in a position to accede to the Convention.In discussion it was pointed out that, although 42 countries had already acceded to the Convention, the United States had not yetdone so and there was now some doubt whether they would. In theHouse of Commons there was a small group of Members who were interested in this Convention, and it was possible that they mightwork up some public feeling in favour of it. On the other hand itmight be thought inexpedient at a time when the Royal Commissionon Capital Punishment was about to present its Report, to bring forward legislation creating a new offence carrying the death penalty.It was suggested that we might at least defer further action until itwas clear whether the United States intended to accede to theConvention.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the draft Bill annexed to C. (53) 203.(2) Agreed to defer fpr the time being their decision on thequestion whether legislation should be introduced for thepurpose of enabling the United Kingdom to accede to theInternational Convention on Genocide.international convention onGenocide.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 78thConclusions,Minute 7.)House of 9.   The Home Secretary said that he and the Secretary of StateCommons. for Scotland had received formal notice from the four BoundaryRedistribution Commissions constituted under the House of Commons (redistribution-of Seats. tion of Seats) Act, 1949, of their intention to undertake at an earlydate a first general review of Parliamentary constituencies under theAct. Section 2 (4) of the Act required the Commissions to give notice in the London, Edinburgh and Belfast Gazettes of their intention to begin a review and in the ordinary course he would have thought it helpful to Members generally if he were to announce thatthe Ministry of Supply to a non-Departmental organisation, a place would have to be sought in the programme for the Atomic EnergyBill at present included in List E. ;..(b) It was agreed that the proposed Copyright Bill should beadded to List E.The Cabinet  -  .(1) Approved Lists A to D annexed to C. (53) 210 as theprovisional legislative programme for the 1953-54Session.(2) Invited the Lord President and the Home Secretary to bring before the Cabinet during the course. of the summer recess proposals regarding House of Lords reform andUniversity Franchise respectively.
the review was about to begin. The review was expected to take several months to complete and the results were not likely to beready to be laid before Parliament until the early part of 1954.The Lord Privy Seal pointed out that the decision to undertake a review of constituencies was entirely a decision of the boundary commissions themselves. A Government statement at this timemight have the effect of stimulating speculation on the questionwhether the Government might intend to seek an early dissolution of Parliament.It was the view of the Cabinet that some form of announcement on this subject should be made in the House of Commons before the adjournment for the summer recess but that this announcement should be as unobtrusive as possible.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the forthcomingreview of Parliamentary constituencies to be announced in the House of Commons before the summer-recess bymeans of a reply to a written Question.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate for the Cabinet&apos;sinformation a memorandum explaining the basis and character of the Boundary Commissions&apos; forthcomingreview of constituencies.10. The Colonial Secretary said that he had had occasion toconsider the title to be given to the Chief Minister in Barbados.There were difficulties about the title &quot; Prime Minister &quot; which hadbeen proposed: it seemed specially undesirable that this title shouldbe assumed in a Colony which might in future become part of a west indian Federation. This title should be reserved for the chief minister of the Federation. He was therefore disposed to suggestthat the title &quot; Premier &quot; should be adopted. This would be in line with the titles used under the federal constitutions in force in canada and Australia.In discussion there was general agreement with the colonial secretary&apos;s view.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange that the chief minister of Barbados should be known as &quot; Premier&quot;rather than &quot;. Prime Minister.&quot;Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1953.Barbados.constitutional reform.
