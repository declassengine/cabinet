Korea. 4.   The Prime Minister referred to the slow progress of the(Previous  &apos;... armistice talks in Korea and the. growing impression that the united reference:  :..&apos; States authorities were adopting an unduly stiff attitude towards theC.C. (53) 24th &quot; proposals put forward by the Chinese.  In this connection he drewConclusions,   ,special attention to a message from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in minute 10.)-    Washington (Washington telegram No. 1052 of 18th May) from whichit appeared that the opposition to some of the Chinese proposals had come mainly from Syngman Rhee, the President of the South KoreanRepublic.  This message stressed the fact that South Korean troops\ now outnumbered the United Nations fprces in Korea and that&apos; i      objections raised by Syngman Rhee must be given due weight.      - *, .

This would give the B.B.C. some priority,but would fix a definite time for the start of commercial television.On the immediate question of temporary television services forthe Coronation,- the Committee had agreed that in the time nowremaining it would not be possible for the B.B.C. to provide such&apos; a service for North-East Scotland.   I     &apos;   &apos;   ,.;-.)/&apos;&apos;-&apos; The Cabinets discussion1 turned mainly on the followingv &quot;y:\points:- &apos;   ^&apos; (a) The programme proposed would give the B.B.C. a sub-stantial advantage over its commercial competitors.  Was this to be&apos;   ,     &apos;        justified by reference to the shortage of labour and materials for&apos; the/construction of these stations? . Or were the Government to argue* that the B.B.C; should be given this advantage as/a matter of policy?&apos; - &apos;   . It was suggested in, discussion that, while&apos; this, policy had. originally been based almost wholly on the shortage of physical-      resources, Government spokesmen in the earlier debates had gone: somewhat further towards the view that the B.B.C. ought as a matterready to enter into a formal multilateral agreement if that were thegeneral wish of the European Defence Community Governments., The proposed extension of the duration of the North Atlantic treaty would form the subject of a separate declaration, the text of whichwas contained in Annex II to his memorandum.The Cabinet- ,*      ,(1) Agreed that the draft Agreement contained in Annex I toC. (53) 158 should be circulated to the Interim Commissionof the European Defence Community. *      -(2) Approved the draft Joint Declaration contained in Annex IIto C. (53) 158.
&apos;    ,   - 55 , . :;    C.C. 32 (53)   &apos;of policy to retain some initial advantage over the commercial-companies. It had been clearly/stated in paragraph 11 of the White -, Paper on Broadcasting (Cmd. .8550 of 1952) that the B.B.C. shouldhave first call on the available labour, and materials until they haddischarged their obligation to provide an adequate service through-out the United Kingdom as a whole.. The principle implicit in thisparagraph, was that all areas in the country should have access toone television programme before some areas had.access to two. .The Postmaster-General said that the, two lines of argument werenot in fact in conflict. For, while the B.B.C. would need 18 months in which to extend their service throughout the&apos;country, the radioindustry would need the same period before they could provide the equipment required to. enable alternative television programmes tobe received in particular areas.        &apos;   &apos; &quot;        -&apos;.On this point the Cabinet agreed that special care should betaken to see that the wording of the Governmenfs hew. announce-ment on policy was consistent with the statements made by Govern-    -ment spokesmen in the earlier debates., &apos;  &apos;&quot; (b) When should the&apos; announcement be made? There was much to be said for postponing it until well after the Coronation. Thearguments - for an earlier announcement were that the TelevisionAdvisory Committee were due to present early in June a technicalreport which would provoke enquiries about the policy for futured development of broadcasting services and that the B.B.C. were -anxious themselves to publish a statement of their future plans,, adraft of which had been circulated under cover of the Postmaster-Generafs memorandum C. (53) 157.The Cabinet agreed that the Goverhmenfs statement of future policy could not be allowed to lag behind these&apos;other statements.And Ministers certainly needed further time in which to consider some of the points raised by the statement which the B.B.C. wishedto issue. In these circumstances they agreed that the Governmenfsstatement should be made towards the end of June, and that publica-tion of the report of the Television Advisory Committee, and of theB.B.C.&apos;s statement of their future plans, should be deferred until then.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that some of the develop-ments foreshadowed in the proposed statement by the B.B.C. mightinterfere with the,plans of the Services, who were relying on the useof certain frequency channels for communications vital to the defenceof this country. Further consideration should be given to this aspect of the matter before the B.B.C. were authorised to make a public announcement on the lines now proposed.The Cabinet  , ...     . -(1) Agreed that the B.B-G. should be allowed to proceed, from 1st July, 1953, with the construction of the five low-powertelevision stations which they proposed to erect in GreatBritain and with the. construction of two smaller stations in the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands; and that commercial television companies should be free Jo go into operation 18 months after that date.&apos;(2) Agreed that this decision should not be announced until theend of June, and, invited the Postmaster-General to .,arrange that publication of the&apos;report of the TelevisionAdvisory Committee, and of the B.B.C.&apos;s proposed state-ment of their future plans, should be deferred until then.&apos; (3) Invited the Chancellor of. the Exchequer to arrange for his committee,- with the addition of the Commonwealth-   Secretary, to consider in the light of their discussion the precise terms in which the Governmenfs decision should,   be announced. . -
(4); Invited the same Committee, with the addition of ,the&apos;  /Secretary, of. State  for  Air,  to cpnsider  the draft.&apos; V (C (53) 157) of a public/statement by-the; B.B.C. on the&apos;W future   development   of   broadcasting   services,   withparticular reference to the needs of the Services for certainfrequency, channels for communications essential to the&apos;.-    defence of the United Kingdom. .Recognition of post office staff,Associations.(Previous  ,Reference:C.C. (52) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet - had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (53), 155) containing proposals for disposing of the claims to recognition of certain &quot; breakaway &quot; unions in &quot;thePost Office. .- : &apos;   . - /.-The Postmaster-General said&quot; that the proposals summarised inparagraph 7 of his memorandum were consistent with the unanimousrecommendations in the report of the Terrington Committee and withthe principles which had been enunciated by the Home Secretary inthe House of Commons on 5th July, 1951, and were reproduced in; paragraph 2 (hi) of his&apos; memorandum.   Refusal to- recognise theEngineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association (E.O.T.A.)&apos; was&apos; in his view fully justified on the merits. The &quot; Listowel formula &quot;^entitled a union whose membership covered 40 per cent, of . the organised staff of the grades Concerned to be considered for recogni-tion but not necessarily to be recognised.. For,the reasons set outin paragraph 3 of his memorandum he did not consider that E.O.TA.fulfilled the conditions laid down by the Home Secretary, which he/ regarded as1 adequately safeguarding the needs of justice and thepublic interest.. : ;.The Minister of Labour emphasised the. importance of this issuefrom the point of view of industrial.relations generally. , E.O.T.A&apos;s.., sole claim to recognition lay in the number of its members, and he.couldnot agree.that this should be,the sole determining factor. TheAssociation had little claim oh the strict merits of their case, whichhad not been supported either by the. Terringtoh Committee or by1 Sir Richard Lloyd Roberts, who had acted as independent arbitratorin.the dispute. A decision by the Government to recognise E.O.T.A.would stimulate claims to recognition by other splinter unions whichbe stoutly opposed by the leaders of those-major unions on whosecontinuing co-operation the Government relied., At the same time he thought it neither desirable nor necessary for the Government to commit themselves to any elaborate public statement of policy onthe matters at issue. The disputes in the Post Office should besettled so far. as possible on the basis of their particular merits.. . . The Home Secretary said that, in the preparation of guidance onthis subject for the use of Conservative candidates at the last Election,1 care had been taken to emphasise that, in the view of the conservative party, 40 per cent, membership did no more than entitle a union to beconsidered for recognition. If the principles which he had enunciatedin the House of Commons on 5th July, 1951; were accepted, any union with 40 per cent, membership.would have to show that it fulfilled thethree conditions which he had.laid down.. &apos;       &apos;vThe Chancellor of the Exchequer deprecated any hasty &quot;announce-ment on this&apos; matter. The extent to which the Conservative Party waspledged ,.tb recognition.&apos; of these &quot; breakawayunions made itdesirable that opinion in the Party should be mobilised in support of .whatever policy the Government might now decide to adopt. It might also, be necessary to reconsider the wordmg on this point of theexisting Treasury pamphlet,on &quot; Staff relations in the Civil Service&quot;which certainly implied that recognition would normally be accorded- to a union - with 40 per cent, ^membership:   &apos;   ,      &apos; &apos;  .... The Cabinet, were informed that the Postmaster-General, hadalready discussed the matter with the Conservative Par&apos;ty&apos;s LabourCommittee, only five members of which had voted against supporting&apos;
&apos; 57 &apos;       .;; .CC. 32 (53)his proposals. It was agreed, however, that further discussions shouldbe held with other Government supporters&apos;before any announcement was made., - . -    *.       ,; &quot; - - /&apos;        (     ,    ,. The Secretary of State for Air said, that, before the principlesenunciated by the Home Secretary and quoted in paragraph .2 (Hi)of C. (53) 155 were adopted as the basis for the Governments.policyin this matter, consideration would have to be given to their bearing on&apos; a, claim to recognition at present being advanced, by the Aero-,nautical Engineers Association, in whose case the conditions for recognition laid down by&apos;the &quot;Home Secretary appeared prima facieto be fulfilled. ;   - ,        &apos; ,    ,,&apos; &apos;;&apos;.-&apos; ; . &apos;, &apos;The Prime Minister said that the balance of advantage lay on the ,side of the arguments advanced by the Minister of Labour. At thesame time,it was clearly desirable that, before any public,indicationwas given of the Governments policy in respect of the Post Officeunions,. there should be further discussions with government supporters in the House of Commons in order to ensure their support for the Governments policy.     . r ,   ,.        . ,The Cabinet  -       &apos; .;&apos;,    ....i,;: &apos;.- &apos;&quot;&apos;.. &quot;(1) Invited the Chief Whip&apos;to arrange for the Minister ofLabour and the Postmaster-general to meet members of;       ,the 1922 Committee and of the Conservative Party&apos;s/   i   Labour Committee in order that they might explain thereasons for the Governments intention not to accordrecognition&apos; to &quot; breakaway &quot; unions in the Post Office,(2) Agreed to resume their discussion when the results of that, meeting were available.&apos; - ,      , / ,Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th May,.1953.
