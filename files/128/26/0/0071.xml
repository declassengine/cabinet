5X7Armed Forces.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 70thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the strong feelingwhich had been aroused in the House of Commons by the announce-ment of the Govermnenfs decision on the retired pay of certainService officers, the Cabinet should consider what further action was now required in this matter.The Minister of Defence said that he adhered to the view thatsooner or later the Government would find it necessary to make some concession.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at the PrimeMinisters request, he had looked further into two aspects of thematter. First, it was clear that the Labour Party, during their period in onice, had alike in public statements and in their pensions increase measures confined the scope of pension con-cessions to cases of hardship and had consistently refused to meet theclaim of these retired Service officers. In their Pensions Increase act of 1952 and in their decision on the claim of these retired service officers the present Government were following this precedent.Secondly, these Service officers had derived advantage from the 1935stabilisation to the extent of some 3 per cent, to 4 per cent, during theperiod from 1935 to 1939, but this advantage had thereafter been morethan offset by subsequent rises in the cost of living. The cabinet should also be aware that the deputation on behalf of senior retiredCivil Servants which had been received by the Financial Secretary on23rd November had made it clear that they would not be content withrestoration of the cut resulting from the stabilisation of pensions but would continue to press for adjustment of pensions to the current costof living.If, however, his colleagues agreed with him that the strength of feeling in Parliament made some action imperative, he would be readyto explain the Governmenfs attitude privately to government supporters in the House of Commons. Such an explanation should, inhis view, be on the lines that the Government recognised the strengthof the Service officers&apos; claim and very much hoped that the time would come when it could be met; that this would have to be accompaniedby corresponding concessions to Civil Servants, which would involve legislation and a total outlay of some  400,000 a year; and that theeconomic situation ruled out the making of any such concessions atthe present time in view of the risk of repercussions.The Chief Whip said that, although no less than 76 of the 111Members who had put their names to the motion criticising the government&apos;s decision on this matter were Labour Members, opinionon the subject amongst Conservative back-benchers was extremelystrong and the narrowness of the Governmenfs present majoritymade it very desirable that early steps should be taken to explain thereasons for the Governmenfs decision to its critics on the Govern-ment side of the House.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that if the Governmentwere to weaken on this issue at this juncture they would lay them-selves open to the charge that they were sacrificing what they had publicly declared to be in the national interest and would be exposingthemselves to further dangerous pressures. No time should be lost,therefore, in making it clear publicly that for the present at any ratethere was no question of the Governmenfs altering their policy,though that policy did not exclude the possibility that the issue mightbe reviewed after an interval if circumstances should then make it practicable to meet the claim.There was general support for this view and for the suggestionthat it would be opportune to remind Government supporters that,in spite of the apparent improvement in the country&apos;s position, thecountry&apos;s fortunes&quot; remained precariously balanced.   In explaining
Parliament. 2.   The Lord Privy Seal recalled that the Second Reading of theBusiness in the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill was to have been taken in the House of house of        Commons in the week beginning 30th November.   He now thoughtCommons.      it would be unwise to proceed with this Bill while the temper of theHouse remained disturbed by the Governments decision on theretired pay of certain Service officers.   He therefore proposed that other business should be substituted for this in the following week.The Cabinet Agreed that Parliamentary proceedings on the Judges&apos;Remuneration Bill should be postponed for the time being.Uganda 3.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of uganda protectorate.    was still dissatisfied with the revised plan, approved by the Cabinet(Previous        on 23rd November, for dealing with the Kabaka of Buganda Province.Reference:      The Governor feared that the local situation would get out of handCC.

The Colonial Secretary said that the alternativeprocedures which he had suggested had been devised with a view to avoiding the appearance of arbitrary and high-handed action; but, inview of the Governors advice, he had come reluctantly to the con-clusion that the only practicable course was to authorise theGovernor, if the required assurances were not at once forthcoming,to complete without delay the processes necessary for terminating the kabaka&apos;s influence in the territory.In discussion it was suggested that the Government would beopen to criticism if they appeared to have deprived the Kabaka ofan opportunity of making personal representations to the colonial secretary. It was pointed out in reply that this opportunity couldnot in practice be afforded before the Kabaka was deposed once ithad been admitted that it would be wrong to invite him to london with the intention that he should not be allowed to return to Uganda,the issue to Government supporters effective use might also be madeof the evidence available that the support which Opposition members were now giving to the claims of these Service officers was likelyto be followed by the fullest possible exploitation of any concessions which the Government might be forced to make.The Minister of National Insurance confirmed that, while he recognised the strength of the Service officers&apos; claim in principle, thepresent would be a particularly unfortunate time for meeting it, asthe British Legion were inaugurating a campaign on behalf of wardisability pensioners and the claims of old age pensioners alwaystended to be pressed at this time of the year.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that informal guidance would be given forthwith to the Press to the effect that the Government adheredfirmly to the decision on this matter which had been announced in both Houses of Parliament on the previous,day.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to explain the Governments attitude on thematter to Government supporters, on the general lines suggested in discussion, at a meeting of the 1922Committee to be held on the following day.

This pointed to the conclusionthat he must be deposed and removed from the territory before making any personal appeal to the Colonial Secretary; but, once that had been done, there would be nothing to prevent him from coming to this country and pleading his cause in person. There was little doubt that Parliamentary difficulties of handling the situation wouldbe increased if the Kabaka were allowed to visit London before afinal decision had been taken about his future.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should authorise theGovernor of Uganda to complete locally, if it became neces-sary to take this course, the processes of deposing the kabaka of the Buganda Province and expelling him fromthe Uganda Protectorate.
