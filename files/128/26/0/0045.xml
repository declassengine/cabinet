The Cabinet. 2.   The Cabinet discussed their arrangements for the month of(Previous        August.  They agreed provisionally that, apart from any emergencyReference:      meetings which might have to be summoned to settle urgent matters,C.C. (53) 1st     business requiring Cabinet decision should be disposed of at meetingsConclusions,     to be held on 10th August at 3 pun. and on 25th August at 11 a.m.Minute 4.)       They further agreed that meetings of Cabinet Committees should be avoided in August, and that any urgent business which wouldordinarily be dealt with by Cabinet Committees should, during thattime, be referred to the Cabinet. -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would obtain thePrime Ministers views on these provisional plans in order that final decisions might be taken during the following week.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C,C. (53) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Lord President said that he had now reconsidered thequestion of the duration of an agreement with Egypt. He thought weshould still try to reach agreement on the basis of the formulapreviously approved by the Cabinet, namely:  &quot; Any agreement with Egypt to remain in force until thecountries members of the Arab Security Pact are organised (withthe assistance and participation of other friendly Powers) in a manner to ensure their effective defence against external aggres-sion. It shall, in any case, remain in force for an initial periodof five years, after which date either party shall be entitled to request discussion of its revision on the grounds that the con-dition of principle referred to above has been fulfilled.&quot;Failing that, he thought we should accept an agreement for a periodof ten years. By the end of that time the situation might have changed radically, and the Americans might well have come to play a bigger part in the Middle East and be readier to lend us their support. The Prime Minister would be agreeable to a ten-year agree-ment. General Robertson could, however, be instructed to refer backbefore finally accepting it.The Minister of Defence expressed support for the principle ofa ten-year agreement.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that he was anxious about the possible repercussions of anagreement limited to ten years upon the future of the Suez Canal,which had hitherto been closely linked with our military base inEgypt. It was very desirable that if possible the negotiations aboutthe Canal, which were proceeding separately, should be brought toa satisfactory conclusion before we became finally committed to amilitary agreement which was strictly limited in duration.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If it should become necessary to accept the principle of aten-year agreement, every effort should be made to include in it some provision for its continuance on the expiry of the ten years, or atleast for consultation between the two Governments about thearrangements to be made for the continued maintenance of the base.44591-2B 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week. They agreed that,House of in the debate on defence on 29th July, the Government spokesmenCommons.      should be the Lord Privy Seal or another member of the cabinet and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Defence.It was proposed that on 31st July Parliament should adjourn forthe summer recess until 20th October.
(b) It would be desirable to give General Robertson discretion to settle on a satisfactory form of a ten-year agreement without refef-ring home if he should consider this necessary to avoid a breakdown in the negotiations.The Cabinet Agreed that our negotiators in Cairo should be instructedto seek agreement in the first instance to the formulapreviously approved by the Cabinet, but should beauthorised, if this proved unobtainable, to accept a ten-year agreement containing provision for consultation betweenthe parties, before the expiry of the period, on the means of ensuring the future security of the base.Korea.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Lord President recalled that in 1952 the Governmentscontributing forces to the United Nations Command in Korea had undertaken that, if an armistice were concluded, they would sub-scribe to a public declaration to the effect that, if it were broken, aserious situation would arise in which it might not be possible to confine hostilities to Korea. Circumstances had changed since then;and the issue of such a warning to the Chinese Communists was much less appropriate now, when there seemed to be a much greaterrisk that the terms of an armistice would be broken by the SouthKoreans. Despite this the United States Government were stillanxious that the declaration should be made on the conclusion of an armistice. While he was in Washington he had made it clear that he doubted the wisdom of publishing this declaration in present circum-stances, and similar views had been expressed to the Americans onbehalf of the Canadian Government. The latest American suggestion was that the declaration should be included among the documents which the United Nations Command would have to submit to theUnited Nations on the conclusion of the armistice: it was hopedthat by this means it could be placed on record without receivingundue publicity. It seemed very doubtful, however, whether thisdevice would be effective in avoiding publicity for the declaration.A possible alternative was to convey the warning to the Chinese Com-munist Government, as an official communication, and leave it tothem to publish it if they so desired. We were, however, bound by our earlier agreement to subscribe to a public declaration in these terms and, while he was prepared to send a strong personal message to the United States Secretary of State deprecating this course, he doubted whether we could avoid it if the United States Governmentpersisted in their present attitude.In discussion the view was strongly expressed that it would be most inexpedient to issue such a public warning to the chinese communists in present circumstances. It seemed much more likely that responsibility for a breach of the armistice conditions, if itoccurred, would lie with the South Koreans rather than with the Com-munists. The publication of the declaration would certainly causeacute controversy in this country. It was the view of the Cabinetthat the circumstances were now so different from those obtainingin 1952 that we should be fully justified in claiming release from theundertaking then given to subscribe to this declaration.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, for an official communi-cation to be sent to the United States Government urging that in the changed circumstances this declaration shouldnot be published.

The Lord President said that, when he spoke in the ForeignTripartite       Affairs debate in the House of Lords in the following week, he wouldMeeting:. .      like to be able to answer the criticism that in the Washington talks(Previous        he had abandoned the Pfirhe Ministers original conception of a reference:      FOur-PoWer Meeting Of Heads of Governments with no fixed agenda.G.C.

He therefore wishedto make it plain that he had put forward in Washington the project for a Four-Power Meeting originally favoured by the Prime Minister,and that it was Only when it became plain that this project was not acceptable to the United States aiid French Governments that he had agreed to the alternative plan of a meeting of Foreign Ministers withan agenda confined to Germany and Austria.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would himselfhave preferred, and the Prime Minister had wished, that this line should be taken by,,the Government spokesmen in the House ofCbmmbhs. deoatfe. He had, hpweyer, been advisedagainst this onthe ground that it would give offence to the United&apos;States and french governments.Trre L&apos;drd President Said that it was, thought that the UnitedStates and French GOverhhients would He.less likely to object to thisdisclosure of their views how that it had become necessary in orderto correct a misapprehension about bur own attitud&apos;e.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel arid Power andthe Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (53) 199) dn the prospects for coal production and consumption; and a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (53) 207)oh the effect of open-cast working upon agricultural interests.-2 B 3
ym :;,   -v;;, 56Deep-miaed The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and production. Power said that the main immediate problem was the shortage oflarge coal. This was caused partly by the exhaustion of the richerseams, but mainly by increased mechanisation. Small coal was notpopular either with householders or with the railways; but it was clear that, if the supplies available were not to be wasted, house-holders must be induced to install modern grates and the railwaysmust make increased use of briquettes. Electricity, on the otherhand, used nothing but small coal and consumed over thirty-fivemillion tons a year: it might, therefore, be sound to increase invest-ment in electricity.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) Mechanisation, though it increased the total output of coal,produced a smaller proportion of large coal. Might it not be better to produce.a smaller total output with a larger proportion of large coal? In reply it was pointed out that curtailment of mechanisationwould be a reactionary move inconsistent with the general trend ofindustrial development. The proper remedy was to persuade con-sumers to use a higher proportion of small coal.(b) Householders might be reluctant to buy improved grates orother fuel savers without some special inducement. The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that inducements could not be given in theform of taxation reliefs. He was, however, prepared to consider other methods of providing the required incentive.(c) The existing locomotives of the British railways were not suitable for burning small coal. It would be a long time before theselocomotives were replaced by diesel engines or by engines capable ofburning small coal. In the meantime, however, diesel engines werebeing used for shunting, and they could be used on a certain numberof lines where there was a high density of passenger traffic. On otherlines they would not be an economic proposition. Electrification,also, entailed a high capital outlay for a small saving of coal. &apos;(d) The output of the miners per man-shift was disappointing,and it would be wise to consider whether a system of bonuses for good attendance would provide a better incentive. Past experiencesuggested that any large increase in miners&apos; earnings simply led to alarger degree of absenteeism.(e) The National Coal Board could look to the Government for support if they required increased capital investment and if they wished to attract foreign mining engineers to overcome the existingshortage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, summing up this part of thediscussion, said that determined efforts must be made to bring intobetter balance the supply and demand for coal of various types, andit was evident that further study and action should be directed to thefollowing points:  (i) Discouragement of wasteful coal consumption by house-holders including more markedly differentiated prices for large and small coal, promotion (preferably by means other than tax reliefs ordirect subsidies) of the sale of grates and other appliances adapted for burning small coal, and discouragement of the use of electricityfor space-heating.&apos; (ii) Increase of facilities for the briquetting of small coal, includ-ing the importation of special machinery from Switzerland.(iii) Further capital investment in the coal industry.(iv) Adjustment of the wages structure so as to provide furtherincentives for output by relating bonus payments more directly toattendance.(v) Greater vigour and initiative in the management of the coalindustry, including the recruitment of skilled mining engineers fromabroad.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power to
3 if,;take into consideration the points made in the cabinets discussion, and to submit a further interim report on theprogress made under the various heads enumerated bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer in summing up thediscussion.Open-cast The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and production. Power said that the output of cpal from open-cast methods washampered by the difficulty and delay in obtaining authority to useselected sites. Open-cast output must not fall below ten million tonsa year, and in achieving this target there was no doubt that somegood agricultural land would have to be sacrificed. So far it had beenfound possible to avoid using the very best type of agricultural landfor this purpose: some land, for example, in East Lothian had beenexempted from open-cast mining by the Cabinefs decision in 1952.The Minister of Agriculture said that he did not wish to challengethe need to win some coal by open-cast methods, but he did feelthat, even in our present coal shortage, the taking of good land for thispurpose was inconsistent with the campaign for a substantial increasein agricultural production.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, on the basis thatsome open-cast mining was essential to the national economy, theMinisters concerned should try to agree upon plans and procedure for open-cast mining which would do the least harm to agricultural interests.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power to concert with the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Scotland a forward plan for open-cast miningwhich would do the least harm to agricultural interests;and to include the results of this consultation in the reportcalled for in Conclusion (1) above.television development.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 41stConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Post-master-General (C. (53) 201) suggesting the general line to be adoptedin the White Paper on Television which was to be presented in theautumn.The Postmaster-General said that it now appeared from thereport by the Television Advisory Committee that for a number ofyears there would be room only for one more national network for television. That being so, a single private company operating a chain of half a dozen or so high-power stations would in effect be a privatemonopoly in advertising on television and this was clearly unaccept-able. A number of low-power stations under separate ownershipwas not a practical alternative. Advertisers were used to a national press and would be less interested in local coverage, and the result would be that by degrees operators would be driven to havingnational &quot; hook-ups&quot; leading to a private monopoly. In thesecircumstances it seemed to him that the most practical course wouldbe to set up a public corporation which would be responsible forprogrammes but would finance itself from advertisements, at least85 per cent, of which would be in the hands of private enterprise.The initial capital for this corporation would have to be found bythe Treasury, or on Treasury guarantee, but the revenue would comefrom private enterprise. A scheme on these lines would removemuch of the moral opposition to sponsored television and would avoid the need for a great number of irksome restrictions, includingthe proposed ban on references to religion and politics. It wouldalso solve the difficulty of deciding which of the numerous applicantsshould be granted a licence to operate a television station:   This
scheme could be considered as experimental in the. sense that it wouldnot preclude further developments on freer lines when additionalfrequencies became available, probably in about five years.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he saw theadvantages of the scheme outlined by the Postmaster-General, buthe thought it would be preferable that the capital for the public corporation should be found by private enterprise. The Govern-ment could still secure a controlling interest in the corporation byappointing a majority of the Board. A scheme of this kind was likely to satisfy the Government supporters and win over some ofthe present opponents of sponsored television.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Feeling in the House of Commons would preclude droppingthe idea of competitive television altogether, and any suggestion fora single private company would not satisfy opinion in the House ofLords. A scheme on the lines suggested by the Postmaster-Generalseemed therefore to offer the best hope of an acceptable solution.The modifications of the scheme suggested by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster could be further examined together with anyother modifications, such as a suggestion that the public utilitycompany should confine its activities to running the transmitters.(b) It was too early to prophesy now whether a scheme on thelines suggested by the Postmaster-General would satisfy government supporters when they came to consider it in the autumn, and it was inany case expected that the new White Paper would present a numberof alternatives without a firm recommendation to adopt any one ofthem.Summing up the discussion, The Chancellor of the exchequer said that the Postmaster-General should now draft a White Paper, inconsultation with other Ministers concerned, setting forth the various possibilities and the advantages and disadvantages of each. Theseexplanations should be in sufficient detail to show that a thorough examination had been made, but they need not go to the length ofspecifying the details of licences which might be issued, &amp;c. Whenthe Cabinet considered this White Paper, they could decide which ofthe various courses they favoured. The Postmaster-General would find it useful to have the assistance of the Minister of Pensions, in his personal capacity, in drafting the White Paper.The Cabinet Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Pensions and other ministers concerned, to draft a White Paper on TelevisionPolicy on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer, and to submit it to the Cabinet in due course.Recognition of        9.   The Minister of Labour said that he and the Postmaster-Post Office Staff General had now explained at a full meeting of the 1922 CommitteeAssociations,    the reasons for the Governments intention to withhold recognition(Previous        from &quot; breakaway &quot; unions in the Post Office.   Although a smallReference:      number of Government supporters continued to be opposed to theC.C. (53) 41st    Governments policy in this matter and a larger number felt uneasyConclusions,     about departing from pledges which the Party had given when in minute 6.)      Opposition, it was clear that the great majority would acquiesce inthe course which the Government proposed to follow.   So far as hewas concerned, however, there was no need for an early announce-ment of the Governments policy.The Postmaster-General said that he would much prefer thatthe Governments policy should be made known in reply to Questions
Privileges olInternationa!Organisations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 19thConclusions,Minute 6.)InternationalSugar Council.10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (C. (53) 202) about the International Sugar Councilto be established under the proposed new International sugar agreement.The Minister of Food said that it would be advantageous to us if London were chosen as the seat of the proposed International SugarCouncil, and this would be facilitated if we were to indicate the extentof the privileges and immunities which we should be prepared to grant to the Council. He therefore sought authority to inform the Con-ferencenow in session in London that, if the Council&apos;s seat were tobe in London, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would take the necessarylegislative measures to grant the Council the privileges listed inparagraph 4 of C. (53) 202. The proposed exclusion of employees ofthe Council who were citizens of the United Kingdom and Coloniesfrom the exemption from income tax in respect of their emolumentswould not extend to citizens of other Commonwealth countries who might also be citizens of the United Kingdom.The Solicitor-General said that, as a corollary to the Ministersproposal, we should try to secure the amendment of Article 39 (6) ofthe draft new International Sugar Agreement to conform with themore restricted privileges and immunities which we contemplatedgranting if the Council were located in London.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in paragraph 5 ofC. (53) 202.already down for answer in the House of Lords on 28th July and inthe House of Commons on 29th.   In any case an early announcement, was very desirable from the point of view of staff relations in thePost Office.The Secretary of State for Air said that, so far as concerned theclaim for recognition by the Aeronautical Engineers Association(A.E.A.), deferment of any announcement was likely to be advantageous.The Chief Whip said that, from the Parliamentary point of view,delay was unlikely to bring the Government any advantage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a final decision by theGovernment to withhold recognition from Post Office Unions whosemembership covered 40 per cent, of the organised staff of the gradesconcerned presented him with serious difficulties from the point ofview of staff relations in the Civil Service generally, besides involving a departure by the Party from its declared attitude. For these reasonshe would have much preferred that any announcement should be postponed until after the summer recess; but in the circumstances hewas ready to try to reach agreement with those of his colleagues con-cerned upon a form of statement which could be made in parliament in the following week.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would dis-cuss with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister of Labour, the Secretary of State for Air and thePostmaster-General what form of statement of the Govern-menfs policy on this matter could be made in reply to questions for answer in both Houses of Parliament duringthe following week.
11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (53) 205) seeking authority to issue a white paper, in the terms of the draft attached to his memorandum,announcing the Governments intention to ratify the Instrument forthe Amendment of the Constitution of the International LabourOrganisation adopted at the recent 36th Session of the InternationalLabour Conference.The Minister of Labour explained that the main purpose of theamendment was to increase by two the number of States of chief industrial Importance entitled to appoint Government members ofthe Governing Body of the Organisation, in order to accommodateGermany and Japan (which had resumed membership of the Organi-sation in 1951) without displacing any of the existing States of chief industrial Importance.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the names of the eight existingStates Members of Chief Industrial Importance should be given in thesecond paragraph of the draft White Paper.The Cabinet-Subject to the Lord Privy seal&apos;s suggestion, approved thedraft White Paper annexed to C. (53) 205 and authorised theMinister of Labour to publish it.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1953.international labour organisation.(previous reference:CC.
