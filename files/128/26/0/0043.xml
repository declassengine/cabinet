Treaty withLibya.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 40thConclusions,Minute 6.)4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime Ministerof Libya, subject to final agreement on the amount of the financialassistance which he was to receive, was prepared to make a treaty withthe United Kingdom valid for 20 years. This treaty would largelysatisfy our requirements for air facilities and for training areas. Itensured a substantial amount of accommodation for our troops and satisfactory jurisdictional privileges. The conclusion of this agreement would have a beneficial effect throughout the Arab world and wouldbe a valuable precedent for similar negotiations with Arab countries inthe future. The outstanding difficulty was the demand of the LibyanPrime Minister for financial assistance to cover the whole of his budgetdeficit and to fill an estimated gap in his development programme.The budget deficit amounted to  2 - 9 millions but the Chancellor of theExchequer was not prepared to offer more than  2-5 millions, or at most  2-75 millions, towards this sum. As regards the development programme, it was by no means certain that the money estimated tobe needed annually could in fact be spent. He proposed, however,to offer a sum of  -75 million a year for five years for development plans. He hoped that these financial offers would lead to theconclusion of the agreement.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to try to con-clude an agreement with the Libyan Prime Minister by offering the sum of  2-5, or at most  2-75, millionstowards his budget deficit, and the sum of  -75 million perannum for five years towards the Libyan development plan.Persian Gulf. 5.   The Minister of State said that, in accordance with theTrucial Cabinefs decision of 13th July, the Lord President had made aSheikhdoms.     further attempt to persuade the United States authorities to commend(Previous        to Ibn Saud the proposal outlined in Foreign Office telegramReference:      No. 2662 of 2nd,.July to Washington.  This attempt had met with noC.C.(53)42nd   success; and the Lord President thought it most unlikely that theConclusions,     Americans could be dissuaded from putting to Ibn Saud the suggestionMinute 3.)       that, pending the results of the proposed arbitration, British and&apos; Saudi forces should remain in the area under the supervision of acommission of three charged with the responsibility of seeing that neither side secured any unfair advantage. The Minister of State was reluctant to accept this situation, which would leave Turki undisturbedand would give no assurance to the Trucial Sheikhs that we were determined to protect them against Saudi expansion. - The possible courses open to us were: (i) to make it clear to President Eisenhowerthat, if he put his proposal forward, we should have to reject it;(ii) to press our own proposal once again, though the Lord Presidentadvised that there was no chance of its being accepted; .(iii) to urge the President to return a non-committal reply to King Ibn Saud,merely saying that he was satisfied that we had no aggressive inten-tions; or (iv) to suggest some modifications of the President&apos;proposal, e.g., that neither side should send reinforcements to the area,and that Turki himself should be the Saudi representative on the corn-mission, so as to avoid bringing an additional Saudi into Buraimi.He himself was inclined to favour the third of these courses.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) When the policy which had produced this situation had first been decided upon, it had been the firm view of the Cabinet that itmust be vigorously pursued to its conclusion and that we shouldresist any attempts by the Americans to weaken it. On the other hand,it now seemed likely that it would be impossible to dislodge Turkiwithout resort to force.(b) The American attitude was no doubt dictated by their economic and commercial interests in the area and it was unlikelythat they would modify their present proposals. Their proposals,though appearing reasonable, would involve us in a serious loss of prestige amongst the Trucial Sheikhs; and the result of the proposedarbitration was much less likely to be favourable to us if Saudi forcesremained in Buraimi during the arbitration proceedings.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as there was a con-siderable feeling in the Cabinet that we might damage our interestsby accepting the terms of the reply which President Eisenhower pro-posed to send to Ibn Saud, it would be better to defer a decision inthe matter until the Lord President himself had returned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to ask that President Eisen-hower should delay his reply to Ibn Saud until after theLord Presidents return.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question after theLord Presidents return.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th July, 1953.
