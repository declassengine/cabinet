61C.C. 8The Coronation.Form ofCoronationOath.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister said that since the CabineVs discussionof 5th February the argument had been developed, in articles pub-lished in the Press, that previous Governments had acted withsomething less than strict constitutional propriety in advising that theform of the Coronation Oath could be amended without specificstatutory authority. It now seemed possible that there might be some public controversy over this, and he therefore suggested that the LordChancellor might look into it further.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider further, and reportto the Cabinet, what changes could properly be made in theform of the Coronation Oath without the authority of a freshstatutory provision.Coal Prices. 2.   The Cabinet resumed then discussion of the proposal that(Previous a 10 per cent, increase in the price of coal should be made as soon as reference: the current wages claim by.trie miners had been settled. They had .C. (53) 7th before them a further memorandum (C. (53) 49) in which the MinisterConclusions, of Labour outlined a modified version of the plan which his Parlia-Minute 8.)      mentary Secretary had put before the Cabinet at their last meeting.The Minister now proposed that, when the National Coal Board askedfor approval of this price increase, the Government should reply thatthey could not authorise it until they were satisfied that the miningindustry would not be able to produce enough additional coal in 1953to enable the Board to balance its budget. Ministers should then holda meeting with representatives of the National Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers at which they would explain theserious economic consequences which would follow if increased costs were automatically passed on to the consumer in the form of increased prices, and would suggest that an increase of coal prices should be deferred for three months in the hope that during that time the miningindustry could give evidence of its ability to secure an increase in productivity sufficient to enable the Coal Board to balance its budget.If at the end of this period it was clear that the necessary increase in output was likely to be achieved, the Government would considerfinancing the Board&apos;s deficit until the end of the year. If, however,the two sides of the industry felt that this task was beyond their capacity, the Government would have no option but to authorise atonce the 10 per cent, increase in coal prices for which the board had asked.The Minister of Labour said that he was gravely concerned at therisk of successive applications for wage increases in 1953. He was most anxious on this account to avoid any substantial increase in thecost of living. Responsible employers feared that, if applications for wage increases could be based on increases in the cost of living, theywould have to be conceded either in negotiation or at arbitration. Asubstantial increase in the price of coal was bound to lead to increased costs throughout the national economy. Internally it would help tobring about the increase in the cost of living which he was most anxious to avoid. And in our external trade it would handicapexporters at a time when the Government were asking for a sub-stantial expansion of exports. It was to avoid these consequencesthat he had put forward the modified proposals outlined in C. (53) 49.He had there assumed that a 5 per cent, increase in productivity inthe mining industry, representing an additional 12 million tons of deep-mined coal, would extinguish the Coal Board&apos;s estimated deficit for 1953. Since his memorandum was circulated, he had learned thatthe whole of the deficit could not be extinguished without a muchgreater increase in productivity; and, that being so, he recognised43722-4 b 2
that some increase might have to be made in the price of coal in thecourse of 1953. This, however, would not affect the principle of his proposal, viz., that the whole of the increased wages costs should notbe automatically reflected in increased prices.In discussion Ministers recognised the risk that the proposed increase of coal prices would disturb the stability of the national economy and cause an inflationary spiral of rising costs and wages.By increasing costs and thereby provoking widespread applicationsfor wage increases, this increase in coal prices might eventually impose on the national economy a burden quite disproportionate to theincreased revenue which it would secure for the Coal Board. It was unfortunate that this additional burden should be imposed on Britishindustry at a time when it was facing increased competition in itsexport markets. Moreover, it was undesirable that the miningindustry should be left under the impression that increased wages would always be reflected automatically in increased prices : if it wereassumed that increased costs could always be passed on to the con-sumer, management had no incentive to discourage wage increases orto find means of meeting some proportion of its increased costs bygreater efficiency.On the other side the following arguments were advanced:  (a) It was pointed out that the increase in productivity requiredto extinguish the whole of the Coal Board&apos;s estimated deficit for 1953would be something over 15 per cent. It was unrealistic to suppose that increased productivity of this order could be achieved in 1953,and it would be disingenuous to enter upon discussions with the two sides of the industry on the basis that the whole of the estimated deficitcould be made good by increased output.(b) it was not necessary to make the gesture proposed by theMinister of Labour in order to secure the goodwill of the industry.The miners&apos; leaders now recognised the need for increased produc-tivity and had already promised to co-operate fully with the coal board in renewed efforts to increase output. Even so, the effect ofany increase in productivity would not be felt for some little time andwas not likely to have any substantial effect on the Coal Board&apos;s deficit in 1953.(c) It was easy to exaggerate the effect of the proposed increasein coal prices. It was arguable that inland prices were now too low:on average they were about 255. less than the prices which our coalcould command in overseas markets. Similarly, the export price ofsteel was,now  13 lOs. a ton higher than the domestic price. Andthe proposed increase in the cost of coal would add very little,probably not more than Id. in the  , to the export prices of our manu-factured goods.(d) It would be dangerous to depart from the principle that the nationalised industries should pay their way. If the increased costs incurred by the Coal Board were not fully covered by receipts, theBoard would be receiving a concealed subsidy from the taxpayer.Experience between the wars had shown the danger of granting any temporary subsidy to the coalmining industry: once the Govern-ment set foot on that path it would be very difficult to turn back.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasthe preponderant view in the Cabinet that a substantial proportionof the Coal Board&apos;s estimated deficit for 1953 would have to be covered by an increase in coal prices and that the precise amount ofthe increase would have to be determined within a fairly short time after the settlement of the current wages claim. There might, how-ever, be advantage in inviting the two sides of the mining industry to aim at extinguishing some part of the estimated deficit by increased productivity, and in postponing a settlement of the precise amountof the price increase for not more than a month, so that a figurecould be settled in consultation with them which took account of theestimated effects of increased output during the year.
public expenditure.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 6thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 47) reporting the results of thefirst meeting of the group of Ministers appointed by the Cabinetto review proposals for reducing Government expenditure. Thismemorandum referred only to reductions which might be made inthe coming financial year. A further report was to be made later onthe possibility of making more substantial reductions in subsequent years.In the course of a preliminary discussion on the general characterof the reductions proposed, The Minister of Labour said that hewas apprehensive about the proposal to increase food prices in thecoming year. For the reasons which he had indicated in the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion on coal prices, recorded in the preceding Minute,he was most anxious to avoid any substantial rise in the cost-of-living index figure. There was no doubt that higher food prices were a powerful stimulus to applications for wage increases.The President of the Board of Trade, on the other hand, doubted whether the proposed reductions in Government expenditure were sufficiently drastic. If the cost of the defence programme were included, supply expenditure as a whole was still rising substantially;and, so long as that continued, there was little prospect of any reduc-tion in the burden of taxation on industry. Without some such relief,British industry could not carry out the re-equipment which was essential if it was to preserve its competitive position in the export markets of the world. He himself believed that substantial reductions in Government expenditure would have to be made by cuts in thehousing subsidy and by further reductions of the food subsidies. Werethe Government justified in spending  61 millions a year in subsidisingrents for people who were often able to afford motor-cars and tele-vision sets? And could we afford the  63 millions of food subsidieswhich were still being spent outside the various welfare schemes?For example,  38 millions a year was still being spent on subsidisingthe cost of milk for adults; and a further  25 millions on subsidisingmiscellaneous food-stuffs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the proposalswhich he had submitted to the Cabinet, he had tried to steer a middle course between the views of those who urged drastic reductions ofexpenditure in order to secure some mitigation of taxation and thosewho feared that increased prices would provoke an inflationary succes-sion of wage increases. He believed that in the coming financialyear in would not be possible to do more than prevent any increasein the total of supply expenditure apart from the cost of the defence programme. More drastic reductions must be attempted in thefollowing year, but these would involve major changes of policy on defence, housing and social services. Arrangements had already beenmade to review existing policy under these heads, and the results ofthose reviews would be taken into account in framing the estimates for the financial year 1954-55.43722-4b 3The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that some increase in coal prices shouldbe authorised soon after the settlement of the currentwages claim by the miners.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power,the Minister of Labour and the President of the Boardof Trade to discuss whether a detailed plan could be formulated on the lines which the Prime Minister had suggested in summing up the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Agreed to take final decisions on this question at their meeting on 12th February.
The Cabinet then discussed the particular recommendations made in C. (53) 47: -(a) Fats and Milk. Savings totalling  18 millions were proposedby adjustments in the prices of butter, margarine, cooking fat and milk. The Cabinet agreed that these should not be included in theEstimates but should await the introduction of the Budget. Theywould involve only a small rise in the cost-of4iving index; but, inview of the anxieties expressed by the Minister of Labour, they couldbe reviewed again before the Budget.The Cabinet (I) Approved in principle savings of  18 millions on butter,margarine, cooking fat and milk; and agreed that, subjectto reconsideration nearer the time, these savings shouldbe announced in the Budget.(b) Sugar. There was general support for the view that no immediate saving need be made on sugar.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that no increase in the price of sugar should be madefor the time being.(c) Meat. The Cabinet were informed that a saving of 8 millions could probably be made in the course of the year by changes in the prices of different qualities of meat which would attract little public attention.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Minister of Food to aim at a saving of 8 millions by rearranging price schedules of meat as hethought appropriate in the course of the year.(d) Further Savings in Food Subsidies. The Chancellor of theExchequer and The Minister of Food pointed out that the removalof food subsidies had already made a very large contribution towardsthe reduction of Government expenditure and that it would be wise to proceed cautiously with any further substantial cuts. In particular,it was necessary to estimate carefully the effect of further cuts insubsidies, especially for milk, on the Governments agricultural policy.The possibility of further changes in food subsidies could, however,be further examined.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for his committee to examine the possibility of making further changes in food subsidies.(e) Prescription Charge. Some Ministers felt that, as there was considerable abuse in the issue of prescriptions under the national health Service, it would be right to introduce stricter control by imposing a charge of Is- Od. on each individual prescription. It was argued, on the other hand, that it would be unwise to introduce an interim measure in advance of the enquiry into the cost of the national health Service which the Cabinet had already approved; that thiswould be a substantial modification of the principle of Is. Od. pay-ment for prescriptions which Parliament had accepted with consider-able reluctance only a year previously; and that it was an unfortunateseason of the year in which to introduce this change, especially asthe floods had brought with them a considerable increase of illness.It was argued that doctors would find it impossible to operate thesystem favoured by the Secretary of State for Scotland by which thecharge of Is. Od. would be made for prescriptions for each individualcomplaint rather than for each individual prescription.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence and the Minister of Labour (C. (53) 46) proposing that national Service should be extended for a further five years beyond31st December, 1953; that the liability for service of National Service-men who had completed 3  years in the Reserve should be limitedto one of recall in a major emergency for a further five years; andthat in future Class Z and G Reservists should be liable up to theage of 45 to recall only in the initial stages of an emergency. &quot;In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Failure to continue the National Service Act, or any immediate attempt to reduce the period of service, would shake theconfidence of our Allies in the North Atlantic community. It wouldbe open to the Government at any time during the extended periodof the National Service Act to vary the numbers to be called up orthe length of service.(b) In presenting the Governments proposals to Parliament, itshould be brought out that the liability to recall of National Service-men who had completed 3J years in the Reserve and of the Class Zand G Reservists would be an alleviation of their present obligations.This point should be borne in mind in the drafting of the defence white Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in the memorandum by theMinister of Defence and the Minister of Labour(C. (53) 46).(2) Agreed that these proposals should be announced in theDefence White Paper.NationalService.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 86thConclusions,Minute 4.)East/West 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theTrade. Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade(Previous (C. (53) 48) reporting the result of the further consideration which reference: they had given, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision ofC.C.&apos;(53) 5th 27th January, to the problem of closing the existing gap in the arrange-Conclusions, ments for controlling the export of strategic goods to countries in minute 9.) the Soviet bloc and China.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, for the reasonsindicated in this memorandum, it was now proposed that at theforthcoming meeting of the Paris Group the United Kingdom Delega-tion should invite the Group to review the possibilities of improvingexisting controls and to examine the effectiveness of the financial controls imposed by some other countries. Our delegation should indicate that the United Kingdom Government were preparedto consider the introduction of transaction controls if all the othercountries in the Group introduced (i) transhipment controls and(ii) controls over the trading activities of their own nationals equiva-lent to the transaction controls which we would be prepared to apply.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that any increase in the prescription charge shouldbe postponed for the time being.(/) Strategic Materials. There was general support for theproposed reduction in the programme of stockpiling strategic materials.The Cabinet-(6) Agreed that a saving of  9 millions should be made in theprogramme of stockpiling strategic materials.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would consult withthe Colonial Secretary before any undertaking was given to applytranshipment controls in Singapore or Hong Kong.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations set out in paragraph 20 ofC. (53) 48 and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of Trade to give instructionsaccordingly to the United Kingdom Delegation at the forth-coming meeting of the Paris Group.Tariff Policy. 6.   The President of the Board of Trade said that at the Inter-Japan and the   sessional Committee of the Contracting Parties to the GeneralG.A.T.T.        Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) which was considering(Previous        Japan&apos;s application for accession to the Agreement, the United King-Reference:      dom Delegation had found no support for the proposals which theC.C. (53) 4th    Cabinet had approved on 22nd January.   The Secretariat of theConclusions,    G.A.T.T. had, however, produced an alternative solution which,Minute 6.)       though on the same general lines as our own, would require a countrydesiring to discriminate against Japan to obtain the permission ofthe Contracting Parties.  Subject to the Cabinets approval he pro-posed to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation to do their utmost to secure that this proposal by the Secretariat should be so amended as to dispense with the requirement of approval by the ContractingParties.   If this attempt failed, they should agree that the original proposal of the Secretariat should be reported to Governments.  If,however, there was no sufficient support for the Secretariats proposal,our Delegation should then try to persuade the Intersessional Com-mittee to submit a report setting out for the consideration of governments the various solutions which had been suggested.In a short discussion the following points were made:  (a) Determined efforts should be made to induce the UnitedStates Government to indicate their views before the proceedings ofthe Intersessional Committee were concluded.(b) It would be preferable that the procedure envisaged shouldbe linked with Article 19 rather than Article 23 of the G.A.T.T.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the proposals made by thePresident of the Board of Trade and of the two points raised in the discussion; and invited the President of the Board ofTrade to send instructions accordingly to the UnitedKingdom Delegation at the Intersessional Committee of theG.A.T.T.EconomicConference.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 7thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The President of the Board of Trade said that he had dis-cussed further with the Minister of State what guidance should begiven to firms which asked whether they should send representatives to the international economic conference which the Chinese Com-munist Government were proposing to hold in Peking in the spring.He now proposed that the advice should be that, although it was thepolicy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to encourage legitimate trading with China, they did not consider that this objective would befurthered by attendance at the Peking Conference, which seemed tobe but one of a series of moves in a political warfare campaign directed by the Communists against the interests of the United Kingdom andits friends. British firms which thought that their prospects ofsecuring trade would be advanced by sending representatives to theconference should be told that the Government would prefer them
not to send representatives to it, and should also be warned that, if their representatives did go, they should be on their guard against thepitfalls which would certainly be laid for them and should keep them-selves free from any continuing international organisation which mightbe set up. It was also suggested that the Foreign Office should inform friendly Governments of the action that we were taking, andexpress the hope that they would take a similar line.The Cabinet Agreed that British firms which asked whether they should send representatives to the Peking Economic conference should be advised on the lines proposed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th February, 1953.
