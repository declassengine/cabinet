Atomic Energy.       I.   The Prime Minister said that, when the Lord PresidentParliamentary   assumed the responsibilities for atomic energy outlined in the recentQuestions.       White Paper (Cmd. 8986), the Minister of Works would answer onhis behalf Questions in the House of Commons affecting thoseresponsibilities.   This arrangement could not, however, be broughtinto effect until the responsibilities were formally transferred on1st January, 1954.   In the meantime the Minister of Supply would continue to answer in the Commons all Questions on atomic energy&apos; matters save those affecting foreign policy or external relations, which,he hoped, would normally be answered by the Foreign Secretary.Exchange of The Prime Minister recalled that, in pursuance of the Cabinefsinformation request of 19th October, Lord Cherwell had circulated a written report with the United (C. (53) 303) on the results of the visits to Australia and the UnitedStates. States which he had undertaken earlier in the autumn.  He had since(Previous        received a further report from Lord Cherwell indicating that the reference:      Americans had now agreed to exchange information with us and withCC.

Their agreement would be regularised by an amendement of minute 1.)       the existing modus vivendi for the exchange of information betweenthe United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, and the approvalof the Congressional Committee and of the President had already been secured. The public announcement of this change would refer simply to an extension of co-operation and would not specify the exact natureof the new agreement.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister.Royal Visit toAustralia andNew Zealand.(previous reference:CC. (52) 60thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in accordance with precedent,it was proposed that each House of Parliament should present ahumble Address to Her Majesty on the occasion of her departure on her visit to Australia and New Zealand. The motions for theseAddresses would be moved in both Houses on 19th November. Theterms of the proposed Addresses were read to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Agreed that Addresses in the terms proposed should be moved on 19th November, by the Prime Minister in theHouse of Commons and by the Lord President in the Houseof Lords.Trieste. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Italian and Yugoslav(Previous        Governments now seemed to be taking a somewhat less inflexibleReference:      attitude towards the possibility of a Five-Power Conference on Trieste.CC. (53) 65th   The Yugoslavs had indicated that they were ready to attend a conclusions,    Conference, provided that in the meantime no administrative responsi-Minute l.)       bilities in Zone A were transferred to the Italians.  It would be diffi-cult to persuade the Italians to accept this condition.   He hoped,nevertheless, that means could be found of bringing both Italy and yugoslavia to the conference table.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.45222-2 b 2
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 318) on the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations underthe Anglo-Jordan Treaty of 1948.The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 29th October the cabinet had agreed in principle that we should accept the invitation of the jordan Government to send an armoured squadron to Ma&apos;an in eastern Jordan for training with the Arab Legion. Since then,however, relations between Israel and Jordan had become strainedby reason of the frontier incident at Qibya, and he had decided thatthe move of this armoured squadron should be delayed until theSecurity Council had completed its discussions on the Qibya incident.He proposed that thereafter the squadron should be sent to Ma&apos;anand that we should at the same time assure the Governmentof Israel that it would not be used for aggressive purposes against them but remind them of our obligations under the Anglo-jordan treaty. Apart from the despatch of this particular squadron, wehad also to consider whether we should send additional forces toJordan, either now or in the event of an attack by Israel. He thoughtthat the best course would be to discuss with the Jordan Government,after the despatch of the armoured squadron to Ma&apos;an, what further help we might be able to give in the event of an attack by Israel.Any action of ours should be sufficiently firm to deter Israel froman act of aggression and sufficiently forthcoming to prevent Jordanfrom invoking the terms of the Treaty and possibly precipitating the hostilities with Israel which we wanted to avoid.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was some risk that if we moved British forces intoJordan they might become involved in hostilities between Jordan and israel. On the other hand, if the Israeli Government felt sure that wewould do nothing to honour our Treaty obligations to Jordan, thatmight encourage them to attack Jordan.(h) Although a major act of aggression would be reported to theSecurity Council, that would not absolve us from our Treaty obligationto come immediately to the aid of Jordan in the event of war. If wesought to escape from these obligations by denouncing the Treaty,we should impair our influence with other Arab States. The Anglo-Iraq Treaty was of particular value to us, and we could not overlookour oil interests in other Arab countries of the Middle East.(c) The despatch of one armoured squadron for training with theArab Legion might well have a steadying effect, but there would be-little value in supplementing this with an additional battalion and four R.A.F. squadrons, which would be ineffective in the event of major hostilities between Israel and Jordan. If war did break out,one infantry brigade group and one armoured squadron could besent within a week, but further reinforcements could only come fromthe Canal Zone.Jordan.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5.)defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 60thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received a message from the United States Government asking when we proposed tomake the next move in defence negotiations with Egypt. He didnot propose to answer this, as he had already made it clear to themthat we thought it was for the Egyptians to make the next move. Hehad also been told that the Americans now wished to give economic aid to Egypt. He proposed to represent to them very strongly theinexpediency of doing this while, the outcome of the defence nego-tiations remained uncertain. If they wished to discuss the Egyptianquestion with us, there would be a convenient opportunity for themto do so at the forthcoming meeting in Bermuda.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
So.The Prime Minister said that the situation was one of gravepotential danger and the Cabinet should consider it further. Itwas beyond our strength to carry all the burdens of trouble in theMiddle East and he was inclined to think that this particular source of trouble concerned the United Nations more than it concerned theUnited Kingdom. In any case, we ought to know what the UnitedStates intended to do in the event of further trouble between israel and Jordan. He agreed that no troops should be sent to Jordan untilthe Security Council had concluded its discussions on the Qibyaincident. In the meantime, he would be glad to consider further theterms of the warning statement which we might make to the israeli government if it was finally decided to send an armoured squadronto Ma&apos;an. He was impressed by the danger that by sending smallforces we might merely provoke Israel. If we had to intervene atall, it would be better to use overwhelming force which could provide an effective deterrent.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider further (i) the termsof a warning statement which might be made to the israeli government, if it were decided to send the armouredsquadron to Ma&apos;an, in order to discourage them from anyaggression against Jordan; and (ii) the terms of the state-ment which might have to be made to the Jordan Govern-ment about our obligations under the Anglo-jordan treaty of 1948 if it were decided not to send any british forces to Jordan.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question on19th November.East/west trade.(previous references:CC. (53) 60thConclusions,Minute 5,and 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 319) covering a report by officials on future policy towards the control of trade with the Soviet bloc.The Foreign Secretary said that the alternative courses open tous were, broadly, to persevere with our present attempts to whittledown gradually the items subject to this trade embargo or to try tosecure replacement of the present wide list of embargoed items bya &quot; short list.&quot; On the question what goods such a &quot; short list &quot;should cover there was some difference of opinion between theMinistry of Defence and the economic Departments. The formerconsidered that it should include, in addition to strictly military equipment, a limited range of key items which might help to buildup the Soviet war potential. The latter considered that it should include only items of direct importance to Soviet military production.On balance, he would prefer to adhere to the present policy, whichwould be more in keeping with current American policy. But, if theCabinet wished, he would be ready to try to secure general agreement to the adoption of a &quot; short list,&quot; although the prospects of securingAmerican agreement to this seemed to him to be slight. In any event it did not seem possible for us to delay for very much longer the intro-duction of transaction controls.The general view of the Cabinet was that we should put forward proposals for the adoption of a &quot; short list,&quot; not so much in the expectation that this would prove generally acceptable but as a meansof inducing the Americans to agree to the greatest possible restriction of the existing list. Its restriction was highly desirable in the interestsof increased export trade, for which the Soviet bloc countries offeredone of the few promising outlets. The scope of the &quot; short list&quot; tobe proposed would clearly need further detailed consideration by theDepartments concerned.   For example, &quot; electronic equipment,&quot;
Transatlantic 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Post-Telephone master-General (C. (53) 314) seeking authority to sign an agreementCable. with, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for the con-previous        struction of a transatlantic telephone cable.   The memorandumReference:      recalled that the Cabinet had already approved this project inC.C. (53) 5th    principle subject to fulfilment of the following conditions: -Conclusions. q that t^e British cable system should be adopted betweenMmute8.) Newfoundland and Nova Scotia;(ii) that there should be access from the cable to the Canadiancommunications network, and that Canada should be ableto participate in the project if she so desired;(iii) that our capital contribution should not exceed  5 millionswithout Treasury approval;(iv) that neither construction nor maintenance of the cable shouldcost us foreign currency;(v) that the Company should undertake that any second trans-atlantic cable, when it came to be laid, would be routedthrough this country.The draft agreement met the first two conditions; the Treasury had agreed to a capital contribution of up to  6 - 25 millions; and it was now clear that our loss of dollars would be confined to the equivalent of some  45,000 a year. As regards the fifth condition, the draft agreement included a formula (reproduced in Annex 2 to the paper),which fell short of a firm undertaking but was as far as the Americancompany felt they could commit themselves in writing withoutexposing themselves to the charge that they had handed over to theUnited Kingdom the control of further development of United Statestransatlantic communications. The draft agreement was acceptable to all the Departments directly concerned.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (53) 314, and authorised thePostmaster-General to proceed accordingly.which covered a wide range of articles from cyclotrons to radio valves,was clearly too wide a category for inclusion in any list and would need closer definition.There was also general agreement that we should eventually be obliged to adopt transaction controls, but it was suggested that our readiness to do so should be used in the forthcoming discussions asan additional means of securing the maximum possible restriction ofthe embargoed list of goods.The Lord Privy Seal said that it would be necessary to informthe Governments of other Commonwealth countries (apart from canada, which would be a party to the forthcoming discussions) ofour proposals for the adoption of a &quot; short list &quot; of embargoed goods.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that, in the forthcoming discussions withthe Americans on this matter, we should try to obtain their agreement to the adoption of our policy of a &quot; short list &quot;of goods to be subject to security export controls.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the scope of theproposed &quot; short list&quot; of such goods to be further con-sidered in detail by officials of the Foreign Office, Treasury,Ministry of Defence, Commonwealth Relations Office,Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply.(3) Agreed in principle that at an appropriate stage in the forth-coming discussions Our representatives should state thatit was our intention to introduce transaction controls.
Television 8.   The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that LordDevelopment   Reith had indicated his intention to raise a debate in the House of(Previous        Lords on 25th November on the White Paper on competitive tele-Reference :      vision.  It was believed that he would seek to press this to a division,CC. (53) 65th   and that he would have the support of some prominent ConservativeConclusions,    Peers. There was therefore a distinct possibility that in a division the minute 6.)       Government would be defeated.  It would have been preferable thatthe House of Commons should debate the White Paper first, but there seemed to be no means of securing a deferment of Lord Reith&apos;motion.The Chief Whip said that there was no prospect of arranging a debate on this matter in the House of Commons until at least a fort-night after the date of publication of the White Paper. Meanwhile a systematic canvass of all Government supporters in the House ofCommons was being undertaken with a view to establishing what theirattitude was likely to be when the White Paper eventually come beforethe House.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:CC (53) 63rdConclusions.Minute 3.)9. The Minister of Labour said that the Amalgamated Engineer-ing Union had decided to support a proposal for a 24-hour token strike in protest against the rejection of their claim for an increase in wages;and it was likely that, if the employers rejected on 19th november the similar claim by workers in the ship-building industry, the tokenstrike would be extended to ship-building. It was disappointing thatthe more moderate of the engineers&apos; leaders had failed to carry theirsuggestion that the dispute should be referred to him. But a tokenstrike would be less serious in its effects than a decision to ban over-time or piece-work. It was not yet possible to forecast what further action the men might take after the end of the token strike.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Armed Forces.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:CC. (53) 47thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The Minister of Defence said that there was increasing pressure in both House of Parliament for some increase in the retired pay of Service officers who had retired between the wars, and he was seriously embarrassed by his inability to announce any definiteGovernment decision on this matter. He was being questioned on itin the House of Lords that afternoon, and he would do his best tohold the position with a further temporising statement. He hoped,however, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would now submit tothe Cabinet the report which he had undertaken to furnish when thematter was last discussed on 30th July.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit, for theCabinet&apos;s consideration at their meeting on 19th Novem-ber, his proposals regarding the retired pay of service officers who retired between the two wars.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to say, in reply to aQuestion in the House of Lords that afternoon, that astatement on this subject would be made in the course ofthe following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th November, 1953.
