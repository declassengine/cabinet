(a) 18 months for withdrawal of combatant troops;(b) 3 further years with 4,000 technicians;(c) 2\ years with a smaller number of technicians and inspectors.He considered that seven years was the minimum period likely to be acceptable to Government supporters in Parliament and the countryand that our delegation should be instructed to reduce their minimumrequirement to seven years but no further.The Prime Minister said that in the circumstances we must be content with a seven-year Agreement but we must also be prepared to face a breakdown of the negotiations on this issue, if necessary.The Lord Privy Seal said that the second main issue on which aCabinet decision was required concerned freedom of navigationthrough the Suez Canal. The Committee under his chairmanshipwhich had considered this matter recommended that our delegation should be instructed to secure Egyptian agreement to the inclusion in the preamble to the Defence Agreement of a clause in the following terms:  &quot; Recognising the economic, commercial and strategic im-portance of the Suez Canal as an international waterway andY &quot; I being agreed as to the necessity of preserving and upholding theprinciples of freedom of navigation set forth in the international convention at present governing the use of the Canal;&quot;and that it should be made clear to the Egyptian negotiators that we wished also to see a suitable article included in the body of theAgreement.Discussion showed that the Cabinet adhered to their view thatsome reference to this matter should be included in the defence agreement. They considered that the suggested clause for inclusion in the preamble would be very suitable for this purpose. they agreed that the essential need at this stage was to secure Egyptianagreement to the inclusion of such a clause in the preamble. Placedthere it would have sufficient legal validity to be used later as thebasis for a complaint to the International Court if Egypt shoulddisregard her obligations and it would pave the way for a subsequentmultilateral approach to Egypt by the main maritime Powers.The Lord President said that our chances of reaching final agree-ment with the Egyptians on terms that were acceptable to us wouldbe enhanced if we were able to enlist general American support or at the very least, by making abundantly clear the limits beyond whichwe were in no circumstances prepared to go on the main outstanding issues, prevent the United States Ambassador in Cairo from againraising false hopes among the Egyptians.Egypt. 1.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lord PrivyDefence Seal (C. (53) 254) and the Lord President (C. (53) 257) on the out-Negotiations, standing issues in the negotiations for a Defence Agreement with(Previous EgYPt-The Lord President said that the prospects of concluding anC.C.

Of the two main outstanding issues, one concerned the duration of the Agreement and the number of technicians to beallowed at the various stages.

The Commonwealth Secretary reported that, in spite of theefforts made by the Prime Minister and himself, Pakistan was determined to become a Republic, and that the Constituent Assembly,which would meet on 22nd September, would take decisionsaccordingly. Thereafter the Government of Pakistan would almost certainly ask that Pakistan as a sovereign independent Republicshould continue full membership of the Commonwealth. This wasa matter on which application would have to be made to all members the Prime Minister said that he would consider whether heshould follow up any approach which the Lord President might make to Mr. Dulles for this purpose by a personal message to president eisenhower. It might well be, however, that, in spite of all our efforts, it would not prove possible to reach an acceptable Agreementwith the Egyptians; if this should happen, we must not flinch fromthe consequences. If, on the other hand, an Agreement was finallyconcluded, we must make sure that we reaped the full advantages tobe derived from it, including the greatest possible reduction in our military forces in the Middle East.The Minister of Defence said that, if an Agreement shouldmaterialise, he would share the Prime Ministers desire to effect thegreatest possible reduction in our forces in the Middle East consistent with the maintenance of our prestige and influence in that importantarea. The exact disposition of the forces that remained was a matter to be considered later.The Commonwealth Secretary welcomed the proposal in para-graph 7 of C. (53) 257 to communicate our minimum requirements onthe main outstanding issues also to the Governments of India,Pakistan and Iraq.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were also important financial aspects of the proposed Agreement with Egyptwhich must in no circumstances be allowed to go by default.General Sir Brian Robertson said that special arrangements had recently been made to ensure that these aspects of the agreement were adequately handled during the remaining stages of thenegotiations.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to record their appreciation of the services which General Robertson hadalready rendered in this matter and their good wishes to him for thesuccessful conclusion of negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that our delegation in Cairo should be instructed:  (a) to propose to the Egyptians a seven-year agreement on the lines of &quot; X &quot; above;(b) to secure Egyptian assent to the inclusion in the preamble to the Agreement of a clause in the terms set out at &quot; Y&quot; above and to indicate that weshould also wish to see a suitable article includedin the body of the Agreement.(2) Approved the draft formula regarding the availability of the base set out in Annex B to C. (53) 254.(3) Invited the Lord President to seek American support for.our final proposals to the Egyptians.
of the Commonwealth, but he assumed that the Government of theUnited Kingdom would agree to it if, as seemed likely, this proved to be the general wish. The fact was that, although many prominentPakistanis were anxious to continue to recognise the Crown, therewas an overwhelming popular feeling in Pakistan in favour of are public.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the commonwealth secretary.The Cabinet. 3.   The Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting of(Previous the Cabinet at which Lord Leathers would be present.
