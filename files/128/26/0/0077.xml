BermudaGarrison.(previous reference:. C.C.(52)74thConclusions,Minute 4.)Kenya.Court-martialof CaptainGriffiths.(PreviousR ef erence:C.C. (53) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)45362-2. The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet thatthe record of the court-martial proceedings in the case of CaptainGriffiths had now arrived in London. He did not propose to accede to the Opposition request to publish this as a White Paper, but hewould place four copies of the photostat of the record in the libraryof the House of Commons, and four in the House of Lords. the record disclosed a number of disturbing matters, which were, however,restricted to the King&apos;s African Rifles. He thought it essential fromthe point of view of the Army to have a thorough enquiry into thewhole conduct of operations, with the object of exposing and rectify-ing errors.   He had considered having an enquiry conducted by-2 B 21. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had receiveda telegram from the Prime Minister expressing the view that, for reasons of prestige, we ought to put back in Bermuda a british garrison consisting of a battalion or possibly a strong company witha band. The Prime Minister was anxious to announce before leavingBermuda that a decision to this effect had been taken. A memo-randum on this question (C. (53) 343) had now been circulated to theCabinet by the Secretary of State for War.The Secretary of Stale for War said that, on strictly military grounds, there was no case for replacing the garrison in Bermuda;but, if for reasons of prestige it was thought desirable, it could bedone. There was no early prospect of freeing the battalion now inBritish Guiana and it was considered essential to maintain in Jamaicaa reserve against trouble which might occur in such places asGrenada, Trinidad, Antigua, &amp;c. The garrison would therefore haveto be found from elsewhere, and he urged that it should not exceeda company. There could be no permanent band but the battalionband in Jamaica could make periodic visits. The annual cost ofmaintaining a garrison of one company in Bermuda would probablyamount to  60,000 or  70,000, not  20,000 as stated in his memo-randum, on account of the cost of movements and the high rate oflocal overseas allowance. He suggested that, as there were only threeinfantry battalions now in the United Kingdom, the possibility of finding the garrison from the Royal Air Force Regiment or royal marines should be considered.The Minister of Defence supported the view of the Secretary ofState for War and suggested that it might be possible to form a specialcompany of volunteers of good character but not of the highestmedical category to undertake garrison duties in Bermuda.The Colonial Secretary, while strongly opposed to reducing thegarrison in Jamaica or Honduras, thought that it was important toreturn a garrison to Bermuda for reasons of prestige. It should bepossible to make the necessary modifications in the agreement for thesale of accommodation, for which the Bermuda Government was nowlegislating; and it was not unlikely that the Bermuda Governmentwould be ready to offer some financial assistance towards the main-tenance of a garrison.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Prime Minister, before leaving Bermuda,should announce that it had been decided in principle tosend back a small garrison to the Colony: the exactcomposition of this garrison and the date of its arrivalcould be settled later.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence in consultation with theService Ministers to decide the most economical methodof providing a garrison of the equivalent of one company for Bermuda.
persons outside the Army, but had come to the conclusion that this had grave disadvantages. It would take a considerable time andwould have a serious effect on the immediate conduct of operations.He therefore proposed that General Erskine should be instructed tohold a court of enquiry under the presidency of a Major-General tobe sent out from the United Kingdom with terms of reference on thefollowing lines:  &quot; To enquire into and report upon the allegations whichwere made at the trial of Captain Griffiths in (i) the offering to soldiers of monetary rewards for MauMau kills;(ii) the keeping and exhibition of score boards recordingofficial and unofficial kills and other activities in operations against Mau Mau;(iii) the fostering of a competition spirit amongst units inregard to &apos; kills &apos; in anti-Mau Mau operations.&quot;He wished to announce his intentions in a statement to the House ofCommons on 10th December.The Colonial Secretary said that enquiries were also proceeding in the case of six policemen alleged to be guilty of intimidatingwitnesses. One of these men might be liable to a charge of murder.If any civilian enquiry was set up now, these police witnesses wouldprobably refuse to give evidence lest they should incriminate them-selves. If the cases against the police disclosed wide-scale offences,a civilian enquiry could be held later.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Public concern would not be allayed unless it was clear thatthe Army court of enquiry was entirely free from local bias: inaddition to the General Officer from the United Kingdom as president, a senior official from the Army Legal Department inLondon might be included.(b) It was essential that at least the findings of the court ofenquiry should be published. Nothing less would satisfy publicopinion. It should be possible to publish them in such a way as toavoid libel or prejudicing individuals.(c) It was possible that further charges would be brought againstCaptain Griffiths, but this could not be determined without further examination. Any statement in the House of Commons should therefore avoid any direct reference to him. It could say that his conduct was under review and that the Attorney-General in Kenyawas primarily responsible for advising about further charges.(d) As Captain Griffiths&apos; court-martial had been held in public and certain parts of it had been reported in the Press, the placing ofthe proceedings in the libraries of the House of Commons and Plouseof Lords would not prejudice him in any possible future trials.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Secretary of Statefor War should now draft a statement, in the light of the discussion,to be made in the House of Commons on 10th December. The termsof the statement should be agreed with him and other ministers concerned. In the meantime he should let the Prime Minister know the general line he proposed to take.The Cabinet- &apos;(1) Agreed that, subject to the views of the Prime Minister^; theSecretary of State for War should make a statement inthe House of Commons on 1 Oth December promising theappointment of a court of enquiry on the lines agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to settle the terms ofthis statement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers concerned.
3. The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had now asked that the foreign affairs debate to be held before the Houseadjourned for the Christmas Recess should last for two days. If14th and 15th December were to be devoted to the debate on theGovernments White Paper on television development, the foreignaffairs debate could take place on 16th and 17th December. Thiswould enable the Foreign Secretary, who would not have returnedto London from the meeting of the North Atlantic Council untilthe evening of 16th December, to speak for the Government on17th December. If the Prime Minister did not prefer to make astatement on the Bermuda Conference earlier in the week, he might wish to open the foreign affairs debate himself on 16th December.If he should not wish to do so, the first day of the debate might possibly be devoted to discussion of United Nations affairs.Arrangements on these general lines were likely to be advan-tageous to the Government, provided that the Opposition were ready in return to facilitate the Committee stage of the Money Resolutionsin respect of the Housing Repairs and Rents Bill. Time would notbe available for any further debate on Colonial affairs althoughthe Government had no special reason for wishing to avoid such a debate or on the proposed transfer of responsibility for atomic energy except on a Prayer for the annulment of the Atomic Energy(Transfer of Functions) Order.It would be announced on .10th December that Parliament wouldre-assemble after the Christmas Recess on 19th January.The Cabinet were informed that there was reason to believethat the supporters of Lord Jeffreys&apos;s Motion on officers&apos; retired pay,which was due to be discussed in the House of Lords on 15th Decem-ber, might refrain from forcing the issue to a division if theGovernment spokesman were to make it clear that the mind of theGovernment was not entirely closed on the subject and that due consideration would be given to views expressed and points raised in debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the Govern-ment could clearly not go so far as to express readiness to reconsider their decision, it should be possible for their spokesman in the debateto adopt an attitude which was sufficiently forthcoming to avert a division in which the Government might be defeated. He would discuss the matter in detail with those of his colleagues directly concerned with a view to submitting proposals to the Prime minister on his return from Bermuda.The Cabinet were also informed that the unwillingness of thetwo Labour Members concerned to withdraw the motions whichwould take precedence over the motion on officers&apos; retired pay which sir Edward Keeling, M.P., had tabled for discussion in the Houseof Commons on 11th December, combined with the fact that sir edward Keeling himself was unwell, made it very unlikely that dis-cussion on his motion would now arise.Standing The Lord Privy Seal said that the heavy pressure from Govern-Committees. ment Bills to which the Standing Committees of the House ofCommons would be subjected when Parliament re-assembled inJanuary made it very desirable that Ministers responsible for majorGovernment measures should discuss with him in good time the timing and arrangement of proceedings on them in Committee.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 74thConclusions,Minute 4.)(3) Agreed that copies of the proceedings of Captain Griffiths&apos;court-martial should be placed in the libraries of theHouse of Lords and House of Commons.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for War to consult with theLord Chancellor and Attorney-General on the questionof further proceedings against Captain Griffiths.
television development.(previous reference:CC. (53) 76thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (53) 342) on possible ways of modifying theproposals in the Government^ White Paper (Cmd. 9005) to introduce into the proposed competitive programmes an element not directlyfinanced from advertisements.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that serious discussion by the Cabinet of any possible modification of the proposals in theWhite Paper must now await the return of the Prime Minister andthe Foreign Secretary from Bermuda. Meanwhile it was necessaryto consider the arrangements for the two-day debate on the white paper to be held in the House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was agreed that it would be unrealistic to suppose that the scope of the debate could be restricted by the tabling of aGovernment motion in narrow terms or, indeed, that it would be right that the debate should be so restricted having regard to the Govern-ment&apos;s declared wish that publication of their White Paper shouldstimulate comment upon their proposals. The motion to be tabled by the Government should, therefore, be in as general terms aspossible but it must clearly invite approval by the House of theGovernments proposals, and a three-line Government Whip mustbe issued.The Lord Privy Seal said that, assuming that the governments proposals were approved by the House, it would be desirable to intro-duce the necessary Bill into the House of Commons as soon as possible after the re-assembly of Parliament in January. It was, therefore,important that the Postmaster-Genera! should have authority to pro-ceed with the drafting of the Bill as soon as this became possible.The Postmaster-General said that so much of the preliminariesto the drafting of the Bill as had been practicable hitherto had alreadybeen carried out. but it was not possible to instruct the Parliamentarydraftsman in detail until the lines of the Governments scheme hadbeen finally determined. This would not be the case at least until after the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons.The Cabinet were informed that there was some reason to believethat the B.B.C. might wish to lay their views before the government after the White Paper had been debated in the House.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Motion to be tabled by the Governmentfor debate in the House of Commons on 14th and 15thDecember should be in the following terms:  &quot; That this house approves the general policy of Her majesty&apos;s government on television development (Cmd. 9005)&quot;.(2) Agreed that a three-line Government Whip should be issued for the debate.Foreign Affairs. 4. The Minister of State said that the terms of the reply to the note from the Soviet Government had been agreed in Bermudaand the Note was to be delivered in Moscow that day. It proposedthat a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers should take place inBerlin on 4th January.Yugoslavia had rejected the latest proposals for a conferenceon Trieste, but the agreement of the Italian and Yugoslav Govern-ments to withdraw their troops from the zonal frontiers was an encouraging sign.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of State.
inland 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Post-Telegraph       master-General (C. (53) 340) recommending:  Service^(i) that the charge for ordinary inland telegrams should beincreased from Is. 6d. for 12 words to 3s.;(ii) that an overnight telegram service, without the &quot; Greetings &quot;facility, should be introduced at a charge of Is. 6d. for12 words;(iii) that the charge for Press telegrams should be increased fromIs. 3d. for each page to 3s.The Postmaster-General said that the inland telegraph service had always been a public service rather than a commercial propo-sition, but in recent years the loss on it had steadily increased until it now amounted to 3s. on every telegram sent and a total of nearly 5 million a year. There was no scope for further economies in opera-ting the service, the cost of which was largely represented by staffwages, and -some increase in charges seemed unavoidable. It was true that the increase he proposed was one of 100 per cent., but thenumber of social telegrams sent represented only about one suchtelegram per household per year. The result of merging the finances of the telegraph service with those of other Post Office operations would only be to render unavoidable an early increase in, say, postalor telephone charges, as the Department&apos;s general surplus was now only about  5 million a year. Even with the increased charges pro-posed, the telegraph service would continue to show a deficit of about 2 million a year.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the Post-master-General&apos;s proposals had the support of the Home AffairsCommittee on whose behalf the problem had been investigated indetail by a sub-committee under his chairmanship. The Committeehad considered it impossible to ignore the strongly expressed viewsof the Select Committee on Estimates and had hoped that the intro-.duction of an overnight telegram service at existing rates would makethe proposed increases in other charges politically defensible.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It was not clear why the telegraph service had to continueto be accounted for as a separate service. If it could be treated as one part of the unified services of the Post Office, it might be easier to devise some remedy for the situation which would be less embarras-sing than the proposed increase of 100 per cent, in ordinary telegramcharges.(b) The view was expressed that there was no good reason whyany deficit, however small, should continue to be incurred on the transmission of Press telegrams.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Lord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary and the assistant Postmaster-General the arrangements forGovernment spokesmen in the debate.(4) Invited the Postmaster-General to complete all possiblepreliminaries to the preparation of a Bill in order thatdrafting might proceed as soon as the government&apos;s proposals were finally determined.(5) Deferred consideration of the memorandum by the Post-master-General (C. (53) 342).
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he himself saw no practical alternative to the Postmaster-General&apos;s proposals, but a finaldecision on so important a matter must clearly await the PrimeMinister^ return.The Cabinet Agreed to resume discussion of the proposals in C. (53) 340after the Prime Ministers return.Japan.Trade with the sterling Area.(previous reference:C.C.(53) 18thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 341) proposing the policy whichshould be pursued in current negotiations with Japan on trade and payments.The Economic Secretary, Treasury, said that the Japanese were asking for credit facilities and were also anxious that import restric-tions on Japanese goods should be withdrawn both in the UnitedKingdom and in the Colonies. He did not think there were any economic grounds for offering Japan credit. There was, however,no longer any justification on balance of payments grounds for restricting the import of Japanese goods into the United Kingdomand the Colonies. The maximum imports which the Colonies wouldtake from Japan amounted to  33 million, but the President of theBoard of Trade was anxious to restrict imports into Nigeria so as toavoid placing an insuperable obstacle in the way of United Kingdomtextile exports to West Africa. Negotiations with the Japanese hadalready begun. The Japanese had put forward their proposals andit was becoming urgent for the United Kingdom to put forwardcounter-proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that the cabinet should delegate authority to the Economic Policy Committee, whichwas meeting on the following day, to settle the form of the proposalswhich the United Kingdom should now put to the Japanese. TheMinisters mainly concerned were all members of the Economic PolicyCommittee and the Minister of Housing and Minister of transport would be invited to attend. The conclusions reached by the economic policy Committee would be reported to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to delegate authority to the Economic Policy Com-mittee to settle the form of the proposals which the UnitedKingdom should now put to the Japanese in the current negotiations on trade and payments.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would indue course report to the Cabinet the conclusions reached by the Economic Policy Committee on this question.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:CC. (53) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, reportedthat the Federation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Trades Unionswas meeting on 10th December and was likely to recommend thatthere should be a ban on overtime and piece-work. This recom-mendation would have to be confirmed by a further conference inthe following week and there was therefore little prospect of anyserious trouble before Christmas.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th December, 1953.
