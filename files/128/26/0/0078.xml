industrial ... 1.   The Cabinet met to review the latest developments in the disputes.        railway wages dispute.Railways.The Minister of Labour said that the railwaymen&apos;s claim for a wage increase of 15 per cent, had been discussed through the normalmachinery for wage negotiation and had finally been referred to theRailway Staff National Tribunal, whose awards had hitherto beenaccepted. The Tribunal had awarded a fiat increase of 4s., whichwas an unexpectedly low figure. This award had immediately been rejected by the three Unions concerned and one of them, the NationalUnion of Railwaymen (N.U.R.), had decided to call a national strike of its members beginning at midnight on Sunday, 20th December.The new Chairman of the British Transport Commission, Sir BrianRobertson, had been in touch with the leaders of the Unions duringthe week-end: in his dealings with them he had shown a remarkablecombination of firmness and understanding, and had gone far to wintheir confidence. He had offered to make an announcement to thefollowing effect: the British Transport Commission accepts theTribunal^ award and is ready to implement it: if the Unions accept this position, the Commission will be ready to examine the whole ofthe wage and salary structure of the railways with a view to removinganomalies and providing further incentives, where these are neces-sary: the Commission would also wish to confer with the Unionswith a view to evolving means of increasing the efficiency of railwayorganisation, not only by wage adjustments, but by other means.Two of the three Unions had declared themselves ready to accept astatement in these terms, though one of them was now trying to with-draw its acceptance; but it seemed unlikely that the N.U.R. wouldbe able, on the basis of the offer already made on behalf of theCommission, to cancel their decision to call a strike. Thus, theproblem was now one of finding a means of modifying the suggestedstatement in such a way as to make it acceptable to the N.U.R., with-out saying anything which would undermine the authority of theTribunal or involve the Commission in immediate wage increases which would substantially increase their operating costs. It must beremembered that every shilling added to the pay of the lowest grades of railwaymen would increase the Commission^ costs by about  1^-millions a year. The Minister said that this was a difficult positionand he was by no means confident that the strike could be averted.He had, however, arranged to renew his conversations with the repre-sentatives of the N.U.R. on the following day and he would do his utmost to persuade them to accept Sir Brian Robertson&apos;s offer withthe least possible modification.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Might it not be possible to offer that any wage improvementsmade as a result of-the promised review of the wage and salary structure should be applied retrospectively from, say, 1st January?It was argued that this might give the impression of abandoningforthwith the award of the Tribunal. Moreover, it would take atleast three months to complete a general review of the wage and salary structure, and the increased fares and charges necessitated by increased wages could not be made to operate retrospectively. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that the financial loss which theCommission would incur as a result of a strike would far exceed thecost of making such a retrospective application of a wage adjustment.(b) Although a railway strike so near to Christmas would involvemuch hardship for the public, there would probably be a measure of. public sympathy for the railwaymen. This award of 4s. comparedunfavourably with the recent increase of 6s. for farm-workers; and itwas widely recognised that the wage rates of the lowest grades of railwaymen had failed to keep pace with the general movement ofwages. Ministers agreed, however, that the statement suggested bySir Brian Robertson offered a real basis for negotiation.
2. The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested to him that, before the Foreign Affairs debate on 17th December, thereshould be a meeting of the Conservative Party&apos;s Defence committee at which Ministers concerned could explain the military background to the policy which the Government were pursuing in the currentdefence negotiations with Egypt. He understood that such a meeting might well be attended by as many as 200 Government supportersand, if this was so, the suggestion seemed to him to have serious disadvantages. There would not be the same objection to the holding of a small private meeting at which the Minister of Defence, possiblyEgypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2.)The Cabinet then proceeded to consider what action would haveto be taken to maintain essential services if these attempts to averta railway strike were unsuccessful.The Home Secretary said that the position had been reviewedearlier in the day by the Official Committee on Emergencies. Therewere five particular points which he wished to bring to the Cabinefsnotice at this stage:  (i) It would be necessary to proclaim a state of emergency underthe Emergency Powers Act, 1920, so that emergency powers might beavailable. This could not be done until after the strike had begun;and, as Parliament would by then have risen, both Houses would haveto be recalled within five days from the proclamation. any emergency Regulations made would have to be confirmed by bothHouses within seven days from the date on which they were made.(ii) Troops would be needed for technical services, and Christmasleave in the Services might have to be stopped on that account. Inthe Royal Navy, Christmas leave began on 15th December; in theother Services it did not begin until 18th December. It was estimatedthat all the technicians required could be provided by the Army andAir Force; and, that being so, there seemed to be no need to take animmediate decision to stop Christmas leave in the Navy.(iii) It would probably be necessary to call for civilian volunteersthrough the local offices of the Ministry of Labour.(iv) The machinery for maintaining essential services could notbe put into operation without prior consultation with some outside interests; and the risk must be faced that, as soon as these interests were consulted, the news would spread that the Government were about to bring emergency machinery into operation.(v) The Post Office would need to make an early announcement about the modifications to be made in the arrangements for christmas mails.The Cabinet (1) Approved the course which the Minister of Labour was proposing to follow in the hope of averting the threatenedstrike of railwaymen.(2) Took note of the steps which would have to be taken tomaintain essential services if these efforts to avert the strikeproved unsuccessful.(3) Agreed that, as it was not certain that the strike would occur,no action should be taken to stop Christmas leave in theRoyal Navy, which was due to begin on 15th December.(4) Authorised the issue of a short statement to the Press to theeffect that a special meeting of the Cabinet had been held to consider the latest developments in the railway wagesdispute, that the Minister of Labour would continue on thefollowing day the conversations which he had been holdingwith the British Transport Commission and the TradeUnions concerned, and that further meetings of theCabinet would be held as necessary.
with General Sir Brian Robertson, could explain the situation to four of five of those Government supporters who felt particularly stronglyon this issue and who, it was known, might decide to table a motionupon it. He had agreed to speak at a luncheon arranged by the 1922Committee on 16th December, and he might take that opportunity to assure Government supporters generally that the Governmenfs policyin the negotiations was not in any way based on fear of what the egyptians might do but on a realistic appraisal of our own interests,and he could appeal to them to have faith that the Government would continue to handle the situation with firmness and cool judgment.He could mention at the same time that steps were being taken toexplain the military aspects of the problem, in confidence, to a small number of those who were concerning themselves most closely withthe subject. In view of the many other important topics to be covered in the debate on 17th December it seemed unlikely that much time would be devoted on that occasion to the defence negotiations with egypt. In any event those Government supporters who were dis-satisfied on this issue hardly seemed likely to resort to extreme courses,at least on that occasion. When the Governmenfs policy came to be fully debated in the House, he would be both able and anxious toexpound the powerful military arguments which could be adduced insupport of it.In discussion there was support for the view that there was bothwidespread ignorance and dissatisfaction on this issue among Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons and that, if a motioncritical of the Government were tabled, it might well attract a numberof signatures. There was no doubt that those Government supporterswho were exercised about this matter held very strong views upon it,and could not necessarily be relied on to refrain from causing acuteembarrassment to the Government. In these circumstances thesituation could not adequately be met by explaining the militarybackground to four or five of the more prominent government supporters concerned. On the other hand, there were certainlyobjections to explaining even the facts underlying the government&apos;s policy to as many as 200 Government supporters at this stage. If themeeting of Government supporters could be confined to members ofthe Party&apos;s Defence Committee, the number might possibly be restricted to about 80. Alternatively, it might be possible to arrange a private dinner, at which attendance might be restricted to about30 Members. Such a gathering might be presided over by the lord privy Seal and addressed by the Minister of Defence. The cabinet were informed that General Sir Brian Robertson had expressed his willingness to meet Government supporters during the first half ofthe present week and explain the situation to them, although he considered that, if he met any substantial number of government supporters for this purpose, he ought also to offer to meet labour members.The Prime Minister said that he was not convinced that thetabling of a motion by those Government supporters who wereuneasy about the possible outcome of the negotiations with egypt would seriously embarrass the Government. Indeed, the tabling ofa motion and the support which would no doubt be forthcoming for it from Conservative Members would serve as a timely reminder tothe Egyptian Government that the United Kingdom Government also had to consider Parliamentary and public opinion. At the same time,if it was the general view of the Cabinet that steps should be takento try to arrange a meeting of modest size at which the militarybackground to the defence negotiations could be explained to Govern-ment supporters, he would not wish to press his objections to that course.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip to explorefurther, and report to the Prime Minister upon, the possi-bility of arranging before the Foreign Affairs debate on
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th December, 1953.16th December a private meeting to be attended by a strictly limited number of Government supporters at whichthe military facts underlying the Governments policy in thecurrent defence negotiations with Egypt could be explained by the Minister of Defence and possibly by General Sir BriauRobertson.
