5 QLegislativeProgramme.(previous reference:CC. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)Inventions and designs (CrownUse) Bill.2. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew attention to difficulties which had arisen in the House of Lords over the Inventionsand Designs (Crown Use) Bill. When this Bill, whose purpose wasto make permanent certain provisions of emergency legislation relating to inventions and designs, had been submitted for SecondReading in the House of Lords on the previous day, considerable opposition to some of its provisions had been expressed, particularly by Government supporters. Attention had also been drawn to thefact that the Lord Chancellor, in a debate on emergency powers inthe House of Lords on 20th November, 1952, had indicated thatpossible legislation on this matter would be the subject of consulta-tion with interested industrial organisations. It appeared, however,that this undertaking had not been fully carried out and in thesecircumstances he had considered it his wisest course, as actingLeader of the House, to move the adjournment of the debate.The President of the Board of Trade said that, although his department was responsible for this Bill, it was not required for anyBoard of Trade purpose. The provision in the Bill to whichparticular exception had been taken in the House of Lords had been inserted at the request of the Ministry of Supply and was said to be needed both by that Department and by the Admiralty for defence purposes. The policy of the Bill and the draft Bill itself had beenapproved by the appropriate Cabinet Committees but it wasregrettable that it had been made to appear in Parliament that theGovernment had failed to carry out its undertaking to consult withthe industrial organisations concerned.The Home Secretary said that in no circumstances must theGovernment go back upon their declared intention to dispense withthe emergency legislation in question before it again became due forrenewal.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the action of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster in adjourning the Second Reading debate inthe House of Lords on the Inventions and Designs(Crown Use) Bill.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to discuss with the Ministers concerned what course the Govern-ment should now follow in respect of the Bill.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:CC. (53) 70thConclusions,Minute 7.)45361-3. The Minister of Labour said that in all parts of the country85 per cent, to 100 per cent, of the members of the amalgamated engineering Union (A.E.U.) had come out on strike that day.Members of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union and of theGeneral Municipal Workers&apos; Union were not striking, even in places where normally they worked side by side with members of the A.E.U.The A.E.U. was meeting on the following day and would make recommendations to the Federation of Engineering and ShipbuildingTrades Unions, who were meeting in York on Wednesday, 9thDecember, and would take final decisions.   At that meeting they-3 b 2Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse  of Commons during  the  remaining two weeks  beforeParliament was adjourned on 18th December for the christmas recess.    It   would  probably   be  necessary  for Parliament  tore-assemble on 19th January but this latter date would not be announced immediately.
Uganda 4.   2 he Colonial Secretary said that the ex-Kabaka of BugandaProtectorate.    had now been to see him. His attitude throughout the interview had(Previous        been correct and friendly.   He bore no malice to the Governor ofReference:      Uganda, to whom he had sent a sincere and friendly message ofC.C. (53) 74th   farewell, regretting the pain and  trouble he had caused.    he conclusions,    had, nevertheless, refused to give the assurances for which he Minute 1.)       had been asked.   When it was made plain to him that there couldbe no compromise on these assurances, he had changed the topic ofdiscussion and complained that the financial provision of  5,000 perannum gross, which the Uganda Government proposed to make for him in exile, was insufficient to meet his needs.  It might be wise toremove this cause of friction by increasing the amount to  7,500 perannum, or even to  10,000 per annum.  The ex-Kabaka had made itclear that he disliked being made the centre of political controversy in the United Kingdom and was anxious to leave London as soonas possible.The Colonial Secretary said that in these circumstances the best course in the debate in the House of Commons that day would be todraw attention to the correct behaviour of the ex-Kabaka on his arrival in this country, but to make it clear that his continued refusal to give the necessary assurances had now created almostinsurmountable barriers to his return. If he said anything lessuncompromising than this, or appeared to be offering the chance ofa reversal of the Governmenfs decision, it would be a graveembarrassment to the Governor of Uganda and might well encouragedisturbances in the Protectorate. It was moreover possible that,before the debate took place, he might have received information thata new Kabaka had already been elected; and that would auto-matically conclude the matter.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary; and endorsed the line which he proposed to take in the debate in the House of Commons that day.Television 5.   The Chance/lor of the Exchequer read to the Cabinet a letterDevelopment,   which the Lord President had sent to the Prime Minister reporting(Previous        that a discussion which he had had with Lord Waveriey had shownReference:      that the difference of view between him  (and probably otherC.C.

Thisfeature of the Governmenfs proposals was also unacceptable to theAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce and even to the advertising interests themselves.   While he would not favour anymight decide to call another day&apos;s strike, to put a ban on overtimeand piece-time work, or to ask him for a court of enquiry. Hewould keep the Cabinet informed of developments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
147CC. 75 (53).major change in the Governmenfs proposals (which there was reasonto believe would be resisted by Government supporters in the Houseof Commons), some modification of them wnich would have theresult of introducing into the alternative programme an elementwhich was not financed from advertising revenue might not only make them more generally acceptable but positively improve them.Any such modification of the Governments proposals might be designed to enable the new corporation to finance &quot; sustainingprogrammes &quot; either through receiving a small portion say fiveshillings of the television licence fee, which would in any case haveto be increased in the near future, or by means of a levy upon theprogramme companies. It had to be remembered that the Govern-ment&apos;s success in securing the defeat of the recent Motion in theHouse of Lords had been due in part, at least, to the undertaking which they had given to give further study to some of the ideas putforward in debate and that it would be necessary in due course tocarry a Bill through that House. He would, therefore, welcomeauthority to hold confidential discussions about possible modifica-tions of the Governments proposals, first with Lord Waverley and thereafter with leading representatives of interested government supporters in the House of Commons.The Chief Whip said that a thorough canvass of government supporters in the House of Commons had shown that, with the useof the Government Whip, the Governments proposals would be likelyto be supported by all but three Conservative Members, who were opposed to competitive television in principle, and that, on a free vote, some 15 to 20 Government supporters might abstain from voting.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be worthexploring further the possibility of achieving an acceptablecompromise with those opponents of the Governments proposalswho were represented by Lord Waverley, particularly as there was some evidence that their modification on the lines sketched by thePostmaster-General might also be acceptable to government supporters in the House of Commons. At the same time there was general agreement that the Government ought not to contemplate any fundamental change in their proposals. Consultations aboutmodification to the proposals should in the first instance be held only with Lord Waverley and on a strictly confidential basis.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to discuss confidentially with lord Waverley possible modifications of the proposalsembodied in the Governments White Paper (Cmd. 9005)with the object of introducing into the proposed alterna-tive television programme an element not to be financeddirectly from revenue derived from advertisements.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General, in the light of the discussionsprovided for under Conclusion (1) above, to submit amemorandum for consideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting.territorial waters.(previous reference:CC. (53) 59thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 337) proposing the terms of an announcement which might be made in Parliament that Her MajestyS Governmenthad decided to adhere to the traditional policy of delimiting territorial waters from low-water mark.The Minister of State said that the principles on which the drafstatement was based had already been approved by the cabinet certain amendments had, however, been proposed to the draft, whiclthe Cabinet should consider, and he would also like advice on thtiming of the announcement.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The latter part of the first paragraph of the draft, which stated categorically that the judgment of the International Courtof Justice in the Anglo-Norwegian Fisheries case had no general application, might give offence to the International Court. It wouldbe enough to make clear that that judgment did not precludecountries from applying less stringent laws for the delimitation of territorial waters if they so desired.(b) The use of the term &quot; freedom of the seas &quot; might be opento misinterpretation and the statement should make it clear that itapplied only to times of peace and to the protection of fishinginterests.(c) The second paragraph should be broadened to bring it outthat colonial territories were also concerned with fishing interests.(d) The reference to the International Fisheries Convention of1946 was too specific: this passage should refer more generally to international Fisheries Conventions.(e) The view was expressed that an early announcement was desirable. The exact timing should be decided by the Lord privy seal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that a statement should be made inParliament on United Kingdom policy regarding the delimitation of territorial waters, on the lines of the draft attached to C. (53) 337.(2) Invited the Minister of State to revise the draft statement inaccordance with the points made in discussion, and toobtain the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Colonial Secretary, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister ofAgriculture, the First Lord of the Admiralty and the attorney-General.(3) Invited the Minister of State to consult with the Lord privy seal on the timing of the announcement in Parliament.Sudan. 7.   The Minister of State said that the Foreign Secretary had(Previous been considering whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should not reference: send an official message to the Governor-General of the SudanC.C.

If nothing were said, we should be open to thereproach that we..were harbouring resentment because the results ofthe elections were unfavourable to us.The general view of the Cabinet was that it would be wiser totake no initiative at present. The matter might be further considered when the Sudanese Parliament met, and it was possible that in themeantime a Parliamentary Question might provide an opportunityfor making a modest and restrained statement.The Cabinet Agreed that no official message should be sent to theGovernor-General of the Sudan on the results of the sudanese elections at this stage.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd December, 1953.
