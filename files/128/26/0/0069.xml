1. The Colonial Secretary recalled that, under the plan of actionapproved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 19th November, the kabaka of Buganda Province of the Uganda Protectorate was to beinvited to London for discussions &quot; on grave matters affecting hisTreaty relationship with Her Majesty&apos;s Government&quot; on theunderstanding that he would thereafter be allowed to, return toUganda. The Governor of Uganda had now advised strongly against allowing the Kabaka to return to Uganda after visiting London, ashis return in such circumstances was likely to be the occasion for serious disorders. The Colonial Secretary said that, while he would himself have preferred to adhere to the original plan, he did not feel able to recommend that the Governors advice should be set aside.He therefore recommended to the Cabinet that the Kabaka shouldbe given the opportunity of coming to London to lay his casepersonally before him if discussions between the Governor and the kabaka in Uganda had shown that the latter persisted in hisintransigent attitude. Under this revised plan the Kabaka would, ineffect, visit London under suspended sentence of deposition and deportation. If the Kabaka should not wish to visit London under such conditions he would be deposed and deported forthwith.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to put into operation the revised plan which he had outlined to the Cabinet for handling the constitutional crisis in Uganda.2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the claim for therestoration of the 9\ per cent, cut imposed in 1935 on the pension rates of Service officers who retired between the wars.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result of anxiousconsideration since the Cabinefs last discussion, he adhered to theview that the Government would be wise to continue to resist this claim for the present. Any concession to these retired Service officersmust be accompanied by a corresponding concession to retired CivilServants in a comparable position, and the Parliamentary pro-ceedings on the legislation necessary for this latter purpose would be most embarrassing to the Government. He had, however, consideredmost carefully how any concession might best be made and presentedif the Cabinet should consider that some concession was unavoidable.He had been compelled to reject the possibility of linking any suchconcession with possible proposals for improving the position of pensioners generally. ..The only practicable course, in his view, wouldbe to isolate the claim by retired Service officers and Civil servants and to justify a concession limited to retired servants of the Crown.Although this would call for legislation in respect of Civil Servants,it might be possible to frame the Bill in such a way as to limitdiscussion and controversy in Parliament. He tabled a draft of thestatement which might be made if this course were adopted. But he felt bound to recommend that this concession should not be made atthe present time.The Minister of Defence said that the proposals embodied in thedraft statement before the Cabinet were acceptable to him. He had always considered that the claim of the retired Service officers and civil Servants was founded on an injustice and could be distinguishedon that account from claims which might be made on behalf, of otherpensioners.In discussion there was support for the view that the claim ofthe retired Service officers and Civil Servants could be isolated fromother claims. It was argued that the Service officers&apos; claim could even be differentiated from that of the Civil Servants on the ground that
the latter had retired later in life and had received lump-sumgratuities on retirement. It was not to be supposed that there wasno element of hardship in these cases. And it should be rememberedthat these were men who had deserved well of the State and had expected that their claims would be recognised by the present Govern-ment. Finally, it was material that their claims were being pressed by Opposition representatives as well as Government supporters in both Houses.On the other hand, serious concern was expressed at the probablerepercussions of making such a concession to retired servants of theCrown at a time when the grievances of pensioners generally were thesubject of active canvassing and strong pressure in the constituencies.Though Opposition members might support this claim, they wouldtake advantage of any concession made to press the claims of otherpensioners. And there was a grave risk that a concession limited tothese Crown servants would be misrepresented on the lines that theGovernment were ready to find money for those who did not need it but not for others who did.The Minister of National Insurance said that the pensions of old age pensioners and war disability pensioners were now worthonly 80 to 85 per cent, of what they had been worth when the rates were settled in 1946. He thought, however, that there was areasonable prospect of holding the position for another year or soprovided that there was no further marked rise in the cost of living and no breach in the general policy of restraint.The Prime Minister said that the conclusion which he drew fromthe Cabinets discussion was that, while these retired Service officersand Civil Servants had a strong case on merits for the restoration ofthe cuts imposed on their pension rates in 1935, their claim was onewhich the Government could not safely meet at the present time. Hewould not, however, ask the Minister of Defence to announce andjustify this decision. He would be ready himself to make a statementof the Governments decision in the House of Commons, in reply tothe Questions set down for answer on the following day. A similar statement should be made on the Governments behalf in the Houseof Lords.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the claim for the restoration tocertain senior Service officers who retired between thewars of the % per cent, cut imposed in 1935.upon the1919 pension rates, and the corresponding claim on behalfof Civil Servants, were just and reasonable and should bemet when circumstances allowed.(2) Agreed to review the situation in regard to these claims in notmore than six months&apos; time.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would state the Govern-ments attitude to the claim of the retired Service officersin reply to Questions in the House of Commons on thefollowing day and that a similar statement would be madein the House of Lords.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd November, 1953.
