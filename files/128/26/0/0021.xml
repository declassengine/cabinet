149C.C. 2,1 (53)Royal AirForce.Loss of bomber aircraft over germany.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Secretary of State for Air said that it was now estab-lished that the R.A.F. bomber aircraft which had been shot down by russian fighters over Germany was itself unarmed and had received no warning of attack. It was true that the Russians had collectedsome rounds of ammunition from the wreck, but these were someodd rounds which had been left in the aircraft by mistake. The air-craft was certainly off its course and the crew had apparently eitherbeen unable, or neglected, to establish their position by the use of radio aids. In either case there appeared to have been a breach of lying discipline. It was normal practice to use Lincoln bombers onthese training flights over Germany with the object of testing theefficiency of our radar screen. These flights were undertaken byskilled crews who thereby gained important navigational experience.The Prime Minister said that this latest information confirmed the truth of the preliminary statement which he had made in theHouse of Commons. It was, however, likely that there would befurther public criticism of this form of training.In discussion reference was made to the Russian suggestion ofa conference on the regulation of flying near the Zonal boundaries inGermany. It was agreed that this suggestion should be accepted, butthat before the discussions began our own technical case should be carefully prepared and agreement reached with the Americans onthe line to be adopted. It was also agreed that the Air staff representatives at the discussion, should be accompanied by amember of the Staff of the United Kingdom High Commissioner inGermany in view of the political issues involved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Russian suggestion of a conference on the regulation of flying near the Zonal boundaries in germany should be accepted.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State forAir to prepare the instructions for the United kingdom representatives at this conference.Judges&apos; 2.   The Cabinet were informed that opposition to the Judges&apos;Salaries. Remuneration Bill was developing among members of all Parties in(Previous        the House of Commons.   The Labour Party had given notice of a reference:      motion for the rejection of1 the Bill.   Some Liberals intended toC.C. (52) 100th support a motion which, while endorsing the principle that theConclusions,    remuneration of Judges should be improved, would deprecate the minute 4.)       method of tax-free allowance which was proposed in the Bill.  among government supporters there were divided opinions on the best method of improving the Judges&apos; remuneration.   A number of conservative Members had expressed disapproval of the proposal fora tax-free allowance, but there were indications that others would feel similar objections to proposals for a substantial increase in the gross salaries of Judges.   In these circumstances it was doubtfulwhether it would be practicable to proceed with the present pro-gramme of carrying the Second Reading of both the Bill and theFinancial Resolution in the House of Commons on 26th March.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that most of the objections which were now being raised to this Bill had been set out in the paper(C. (52) 334) which he had circulated to the Cabinet on 14th October.He believed that the Cabinet would now be compelled to considerother methods of improving the Judges&apos; remuneration. He was atpresent disposed to favour an increase of gross salary combined witha travel allowance.   If that method were adopted, it might not be
possible to confer on all the Judges a net benefit equivalent to the tax-free allowance of  1,000 a year proposed in the present Bill.Ministers clearly needed further time in which to consider alternative methods of carrying out this policy and to justify their proposals totheir supporters in the House of Commons. It might therefore be wise to defer Parliamentary discussion of the Bill until after Easter.The Prime Minister said that the Government must adhere firmlyto the principle that the remuneration of the Judges should be improved. So long as they maintained that principle they could afford to listen to arguments about the method by which effect shouldbe given to it. He himself still believed that the method proposedin the Bill was the most convenient; but he would be ready to accept an alternative method which commanded a wider measure of supportamong Conservative Members in the House of Commons so longas it conferred roughly the same net benefit on the Judges as theywould have derived from a tax-free allowance of  1,000 a year. Hethought that the Government would show weakness if they deferredall Parliamentary discussion of this question until after Easter. Hewould prefer that the matter should be debated on 26th March as previously planned and that the House of Commons should then beasked to take a decision on the point of principle. The choice ofmethod could, if need be, be left over for further discussion and brought up for final decision after the Easter recess.There was general agreement with the Prime Minister^ view.Further discussion turned on the best tactics for separating thequestions of principle and of method. It was ultimately agreed thatthe most convenient course would be to move the Second reading of the Bill on 26th March as previously planned, but to indicate atthe outset of the debate that the Financial Resolution would beallowed to stand over until after Easter. It could then be made clearthat the decision on the Second Reading would be treated as adecision on the principle of improving the Judges&apos; remuneration, andthat the method by which this should be done would be left open for further discussion on the Financial Resolution. Meanwhile thePrime Minister would explain the position to the Executive of the1922 Committee. The Cabinet recognised that if, as a result of thediscussions, they decided to adopt a different method of improving the Judges&apos; remuneration, the necessary changes in the form of TheFinancial Resolution might be so substantial that the Speaker mightrule that a fresh Bill should be introduced.  .The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Second Reading of the Judges&apos; RemunerationBill should be taken in the House of Commons on26th March but that proceedings on trie Financial Resolu-tion should be deferred until after the Easter recess sothat further discussions might be held with government supporters about the method by which the Judges&apos;remuneration should be improved.(2) Invited the Prime Minister, in moving the Second reading of the Bill, to make it clear that the Government were atthat stage asking the House of Commons to pronounceonly on the principle of improving the Judges&apos; remunera-tion and were not committed to giving effect to that principle by the method proposed in the Bill.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would take steps to seethat this position was explained, before the SecondReading debate, to Government supporters in the Houseof Commons.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider alterna-tive means of conferring on the Judges a net benefitapproximately the same as that which they would havederived from the provisions of the present Bill.
151CvC. 21 (53)Farm Price 3.   The Minister of Agriculture said that the negotiations onReview. farm prices had now been completed. A settlement had been reached(Previous with the farmers&apos; representatives within the limits of the authorityReference: given by the Cabinet on .17th March.  Subject to certain reservationsC.C. (53) 20th on the prices for eggs and milk, the farmers&apos; representatives were conclusions, ready to accept this settlement; and the Government could thereforeMinute 12.) count on their continued co-operation in the campaign for increasingagricultural production.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to present to Parlia-ment a White Paper announcing the results of the annual review of farm prices.Kenya. 4.   The Cabinet were informed that the reinforcements which(Previous were to be despatched to Kenya, in accordance with their decision ofReference: 10th March, were due to leave this country by air on 30th March andC.C. (53) 18th to arrive in Kenya on 7th April.  Fayid and Khartoum were amongConclusions, the intermediate points at which the aircraft carrying these troopsMinute 5.) would land to refuel.The Prime Minister said that it was convenient that these stagingpoints were being used. It might be useful, when the time came, tokeep some of these troops for a few days in Khartoum, where their presence might have a salutary effect on public opinion both in theSudan and in Egypt. This advantage could be secured at slightcost if it imposed only a short delay on their arrival in Kenya. TheForeign Secretary should keep this possibility in mind. Meanwhile,the Minister of Defence could consider whether any special arrange-ments would need to be made to enable these troops to prolong theirstay in Khartoum for a short period, though care must be taken toensure that no rumour of this possibility should reach the Sudaneseor the Egyptians.The Foreign Secretary undertook to keep this possibility inmind and to consult further with the Minister of Defence if it was desired that any of these troops should remain for a few days inKhartoum on their way to Kenya.commercial policy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)Relaxation of restrictions on trade withWesternEurope.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade(C. (53) 100) proposing some relaxation of existing restrictions on trade with Western Europe; and a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 107) giving an outline of the statements which they proposed to make at themeeting of the Council of the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.) on 23rd March.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was a real risk that European countries would reverse their liberal trade policies andimpose restrictions upon United Kingdom exports unless we offeredsome relaxation of our import restrictions and increased the touristallowance. He and the President of the Board of Trade were there-fore proposing that we should relax import restrictions within an estimated cost of  30 millions in a full year. This relaxation would apply in the main to food-stuffs and manufactured goods. It involvedsome risk to our balance of payments, but this was less than the riskof finding our exports to Europe severely reduced by import restric-tions. He and the President of the Board of Trade were alsoproposing that the tourist allowance should be increased to  40.
This compared favourably with the standard rate of  35 recom-mended by O.E.E.C., and it was known that the French government felt that a tourist allowance of  40 would be sufficient to restoreour tourist traffic to France almost to its traditional level. any higher rate would place an additional strain upon our reserves.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The view was expressed that an increase in the touristallowance to  50 and a less generous relaxation of import restrictions would be more popular both with the public and with manufacturinginterests.   It was pointed out in reply that European countries, and, in particular Italy, attached more importance to the relaxation of import restrictions, and that unless this was done they wouldcertainly impose restrictions upon us. The French were satisfied with a tourist rate of  40 and the Italians had expressed no concern about the tourist allowance.(b) The relaxation proposed was likely to put us into deficit in the European Payments Union unless we received similarlygenerous treatment from other European countries. It was satis-factory that they had so far taken no retaliatory measures against us,but they should be encouraged to take some positive measures ofrelaxation themselves.The Cabinet (1) Approved relaxations in imports from Western Europe within an estimated cost of  30 millions in a full year in accord-ance with the proposals put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade.(2) Agreed that the tourist allowance should be raised to  40.(3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to announce these relaxations at the meetingof the O.E.E.C. Council on 23rd March; and authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make a simultaneous announcement in the House of Commons.Commonwealth        The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he and the ForeignEconomic       Secretary were due to make statements at the Council of O.E.E.C.Conference.     on 23rd March on the outcome of their discussions in Washington on(Previous        the approach to a multilateral system of trade and payments. TheyReference:      would follow the terms of the communique which had been issuedC.C. (53) 20th   after the Washington talks, and would impress upon O.E.E.C. theConclusions,    importance of moving forward to a wider objective in a manner which minute 3.)       involved the minimum of risks and preserved to the maximum thegains which had been made in recent years by co-operation inO.E.E.C. They would not disclose the essential secret elements of theproposals evolved at the Commonwealth Economic Conference, but would concentrate on the European aspects of the problem.   Thiswould lead to a proposal that O.E.E.C. should undertake to discussthe prolongation of the European Payments Union after 30th June,and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would suggest that the european payments Union should be continued in substantially its present formfor twelve months, but that this decision should be reconsidered inthe event of a concerted approach towards convertibility before June1954.   The important point was to insist that there should be nowithdrawal from the European Payments Union except by agreementwith all its members.  The Chancellor added that he had had some preliminary discussions with the Americans and the Canadians andthat they were prepared to support this statement in O.E.E.C.The Cabinet-(4) Approved the form of statements to be made by the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer at themeeting of the Council of O.E.E.C. on 23rd March.
6. The Foreign Secretary said that the Minister of State was now on his way to the Sudan where he would have conversations withthe Governor-General and with the leaders of the Sudanese political parties. He hoped that this visit would have the effect of encouraging the Sudanese to resist undue Egyptian influence. The british members of the Sudan Administration had been discouraged by thecourse of events and he thought that the Minister of State would beable to inject into them a more hopeful view of the future. GeneralNeguib had been warned of the Ministers visit, and had expressed histhanks for the courtesy shown in giving him this advance notice.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.7. The Rome Secretary said that the Opposition leaders in theHouse of Commons had tabled a motion for discussion on 23rd Marchin the following terms : - That this House accepts the principle enunciated by thePrime Minister that the damage inflicted on various parts of theUnited Kingdom by flood and tempest on 31st January and1st February, 1953, requires to be treated on a national basis, and owing to the magnitude of the catastrophe expects that principle to be fully implemented by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.He proposed to accept this motion. He thought this was a better course than to put down an amendment and so encourageunnecessary controversy.The Cabinet-Endorsed the view expressed by the Home Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,20th March, 1953.Flood Damage.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 11.)(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)
