The Cabinet1. The Prime Minister said that this was the last meeting ofthe Cabinet which Lord Cherwell would attend before resigning theoffice of Paymaster-General. He knew that his colleagues would wishto express their appreciation of the valuable counsel which LordCherwell had given over the past two years, not merely on scientificquestions, but over a wide range of problems with which the cabinet had had to deal. The Cabinet would be glad to know that, although he was relinquishing his Ministerial responsibilities, Lord Cherwellwould continue to make available to the Government his personaladvice on scientific questions, particularly those relating to atomic energy.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week of the new Session.It was hoped that the Debate on the Address would be completed by 10th November.Regency Bill.(previous reference:CC. (53) 44thConclusions,Minute 1.)451243. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 301) covering revised drafts of:  (a) a Bill to amend the Regency Acts;(b) a Message from the Queen;(c) Motions for Addresses from each House in reply to the message.The Home Secretary said that he had now taken the Queen&apos;pleasure on the point which had been left open at the Cabinefsmeeting on 6th July. It was the Queen&apos;s wish that, in the event ofher incapacity, the Duke of Edinburgh should become and remainRegent unless there were a child or grandchild of theirs who hadattained the age of eighteen and could, therefore, be Regent in the duke&apos;s place. The Queen&apos;s wish was met by Clause .1(2) of the revised draft Bill.The time-table which he had in mind for proceeding with theBill was as follows. On 4th November the Royal Message wouldbe delivered and Addresses would be moved in reply. The Bill wouldbe introduced on 5th November, and he hoped that all its stagescould be taken in the House of Commons on 11th or 12th November.If necessary, however, the Committee and remaining stages couldbe deferred until 16th November.. The Bill should therefore reach the House of Lords not later than .16th November.Other Commonwealth Governments should receive at least48 hours&apos; notice of the.delivery of the Royal Message. As soon,therefore, as the draft Message had been approved by the Queenit should be telegraphed to other Commonwealth Governments, who should also be informed of the statement which would be made bythe Government spokesman in the House of Commons when movingthe Motion for an Address. He suggested that this statement shouldtake the following form:  &quot; I am sure that it will be the desire of the House that effect should be given to Her Majesty&apos;s wishes, and I propose to presenta Bill to-morrow for the purpose. It will be made available to members later in the week. I might add that Her Majesty&apos;swishes have been considered by the Commonwealth PrimeMinisters concerned who have all agreed with the proposal that effect should be given to them.&quot;The Prime Minister said that Opposition Leaders in the Houseof Commons should be informed in advance of the change made inthe Bill since they had last been consulted.b 2
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft Bill, draft Royal Message and draftMotions for Addresses attached to C. (53) 301.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would submit the draftRoyal Message for the Queen&apos;s approval.(3) Approved the time-table proposed by the Home Secretaryfor proceeding with the Bill.(4) Invited the Home Secretary to inform Opposition Leadersof the change made in the Bill since they had last been consulted on the matter.(5) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to telegraph to other Common-wealth Prime Ministers concerned the text of the RoyalMessage, as approved by the Queen, and the statement to be made by the Government spokesman whensubmitting the Motion for an Address in reply.British Guiana.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 57thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Prime Minister said that the arrest and detention without charge of the leaders of the People&apos;s Progressive Party (P.P.P.) inBritish Guiana was a serious step and the Cabinet ought to be made aware of the grounds on which it had been thought to be justified.The Colonial Secretary said that the authorities in British Guianawere faced with a dilemma. If they made no arrests until violenceor bloodshed had occurred, they would be accused of weakness andwould share some of the responsibility for the consequent sufferingand disorder. If, however, arrests were made to forestall serious trouble, as had been done, it could be said that the arrests had notbeen justified. The Governor was entitled to make such arrests underthe emergency powers which had been conferred on him by Order-in-Council and it would be a mistake to deprive him of all discretion in the exercise of his function of preserving law and order. He had urged the Governor to take steps to restrain the leaders of the P.P.P.short of arresting them but, when the Governor had informed him that these leaders were organising illegal. meetings and otherwiseobstructing the Governors efforts to restore normal conditions inthe Colony, he had authorised him to make the arrests. As a resultof intimidation, witnesses required by the prosecution were notcoming forward but he had urged the Governor to take all possibleadministrative means to bring the P.P.P. leaders to trial.The Lord Chancellor said that, while the Governor could not reasonably be criticised for exercising his emergency powers in theway he had, there was clearly a limit to the period for which personscould reasonably be held under such powers without being broughtto trial.The Colonial Secretary said that he would be glad to knowwhether his colleagues shared his view that it would be right for himto grant an interview to the former Prime Minister of British Guianaduring his visit to this country. He would, of course, confine himself to listening to what Dr. Jagan had to say to him.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Colonial secretary would be well advised to accord interviews both to the representa-tives of the P.P.P. now in London and also to the representativesof the Opposition Parties in British Guiana.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should grant interviewsto the visiting representatives of the People&apos;s ProgressiveParty and of the Opposition Parties in British Guiana.
V.9Jordan. 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Jordan Government had(Previous        invited us to send a squadron of an armoured regiment to Ma&apos;an reference:      which lay some 100 miles to the north-east of Akaba. The squadronC.C. (52)53rd   would enter Jordan via the Port of Akaba and would have no reasonConclusions.     to approach the Jordan-Israel frontier. Its arrival in Jordan should minute 6.)       not, therefore, attract undue publicity or increase the existing tension between Israel and Jordan. Indeed, it might have a stabilising effect by reassuring the Jordan Government of our fidelity to our obligations to them.The fact that the Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, hadchosen this moment to pay a visit to Amman was, in his view, more likely to be regarded as provocative by the Israel Government butit appeared to be too late to prevent this visit.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, at a time to be determined by the foreign secretary, a squadron of an armoured regiment should proceed to Ma&apos;an in response to the invitation of the jordan Government.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Prime Ministerof the circumstances in which the Commander-in-Chief,Mediterranean, was visiting Amman.Home Guard.(previous reference:C.C.(52)30thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (C. (53) 258) on the future of the home guard.The Secretary of State for War said that the time was approachingwhen those who had joined the Home Guard when it was first re-established would have to decide whether to extend their two-year period of service or be discharged; and it was therefore necessaryfor the Government to decide their future policy. It might perhapsseem anomalous to maintain the Home Guard at a cost of  1,000,000a year at a time when substantial reductions might have to be madein the size of the Army. On the other hand, the Commander-in-ChiefDesignate, United Kingdom Land Forces, attached considerable importance to the maintenance of the framework of the Home Guardand it was also necessary to bear in mind the statements which government spokesmen had made in defending the Home guard against Opposition attempts to have it disbanded. Indeed, the issuehad become in part a political one. If it should be decided to retain the Home Guard, the case for doing so must be effectively presentedif recruiting was to be maintained.The Minister of Defence said that the future of the home guard ought properly to be considered as part of the current reviewof defence expenditure generally. He had no doubt, however, thatthere was a good case for retaining in peacetime the nucleus of an organisation which in atomic war might well have an invaluablepart to play, particularly in assisting the civil defence services.The Borne Secretary said that disbandment of the Home Guardwould have a discouraging effect on recruitment to the civil defence services, which were seriously under strength.The Secretary of State for Scotland hoped that any announce-ment about the future of the Home Guard would include some reference to the part which it might play in assisting the civil defence services in war.The Prime Minister said that it was clearly the view of the Cabinetthat the Home Guard should be retained. The decision to retain itshould be announced boldly.The Cabinet-Authorised the Secretary of State for War to announce that it Was the Government^ intention that the Home Guardshould continue in being.
7. The Prime Minister said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision of 27th October, two informal meetings of Ministersh^d been held to discuss the proposals for the future marketing of meat and bacon which had been outlined by the Minister of Food. in C. (53) 298 and to consider how these could best be presented tothe farmers&apos; representatives and to Government supporters; these meetings had served to clarify some of the doubts expressed in the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion. In particular, it had been established that a system of buttress prices would not be inconsistent with theprovision for minimum prices under section 5 of the agriculture act,; 1947, though it would be necessary that in the first two yearsof the new scheme the buttress prices should not be lower than theminimum prices already declared for those years. In presenting this plan to the farmers and to Government supporters Ministers wouldhave to make it plain that it did not imply any weakening of their support for the principle of producers&apos; Marketing Boards; and onthis account it was now proposed that the announcement of these arrangements for meat marketing should be accompanied by adeclaration that the Milk&apos;Marketing Boards would resume operations in 1954 over the whole range of milk products including liquid milk.The Prime Minister said that the plan now proposed was out-lined in a draft memorandum (C. (53) 302) which had been preparedby officials of the Departments concerned in the light of the discus-sions at the two informal meetings of Ministers to which he had referred. The choice before the Cabinet was whether, despite thepolitical risks, they should go forward with this plan, which was consistent with their general policy of relaxing Government controlsand freeing the economy, or whether they should continue state trading and delay the dismantling of the Ministry of Food while apublic enquiry was made into the whole problem of meat marketing.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the proposal to go forward with a plan on the general lines indicated in C. (53) 302.The following points were raised in discussion of this plan:  (a) It was suggested that, as a matter of presentation, the newprice proposals should not be described as a &quot; deficiency payments &quot;system. The principle of deficiency payments was unpopular with the farmers&apos; representatives and with Government supporters. And thisdescription also tended to obscure the new and important feature ofbuttress prices. The plan was in fact a dual-price system providingboth collective and individual guarantees. Some short title should be devised which would bring out the true nature of the plan.(b) The Minister of Agriculture said that, if he was to refer tothe possibility that a producers&apos; Marketing Board might eventually be established with wide powers of trading in meat, he would wishto do so in more encouraging terms than those used in the last partof paragraph 16 of C. (53) 302. He would like to invite the farmers&apos;representatives to formulate proposals for a Meat Marketing board with wider functions, and to promise them his assistance in working out such proposals.The point was made that there were limits to the extent to whichthe Minister could properly assist one of the interested parties in working out proposals for a marketing scheme which, at a later stage,would require his Ministerial approval. It was his duty to consider,not only the interests of the producers, but also those of other partiesaffected by a marketing scheme, and at some stages of the procedurehe had a semi-judicial function to discharge. It was, however, agreedthat this consideration need not preclude the Minister from encouraging-ing producers to formulate proposals for marketing schemes, since itwas the declared policy of the Government that Marketing boards should be established in appropriate cases.In further discussion it was suggested that the invitation to the farmers&apos; representatives to formulate proposals for a Meat Marketing
Board could be given in more encouraging terms if it were made before, instead of after, the reference to the establishment of a board which would develop the voluntary marketing of fatstock and exercisecompulsory powers in respect of pigs sold for bacon curing.This part of the statement should also be amended so as to makeit clear whether the Board which would exercise compulsory powers inrespect of bacon and pigs would also operate, on a voluntary or a compulsory basis, in respect of other livestock.(c) The Minister of Agriculture suggested that further considera-tion should be given to the method of exercising Government controlover the fixing of prices by Milk Marketing Boards. In his view thisshould be secured by directions given by the Agriculture ministers under the Agricultural Marketing Acts, even if it were necessary toamend the Acts for that purpose. He thought it preferable that this control should be exercised under these permanent Acts and not under temporary powers available to the Minister of Food underthe Defence Regulations. This might affect the wording of paragraph20 of C. (53) 302.The Minister of Education said that, if the Milk marketing boards were to operate the Welfare Milk Scheme, it might be desirablethat they should also assume responsibility for the School MilkService.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals outlined in C. (53) 302on the future marketing of meat and bacon and on thefuture operation of the Milk Marketing Boards.(2) Invited the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of food to consider further the particular points noted in para-graphs (a)-(c) above.(3) Asked the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the Agri-culture Ministers, the Minister of Food, the Minister of housing and the Chief Whip, to draw up a detailed pro-gramme and time-table for presenting these proposals toParliament after preliminary consultation with Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons and withrepresentatives of the farmers and the food trades concerned; and invited him to submit this programme and time-table for the Prime Ministers approval.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th October, 1953.
