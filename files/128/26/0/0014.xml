Persia.XPreviousReference:G.G. (53) 3rdConclusions,Minute 6.)negotiations in Tehran.,The MiriellaCase.1. The Foreign Secretary said that the latest Anglo-american proposals for the settlement of the oil dispute with Persia includedarbitration by the International Court of Justice at The Hague and the reservation of 25 per cent, of the proceeds of the sales of oil to beapplied towards the compensation awarded by the Court. Theseproposals were satisfactory to us, but it seemed likely that dr. Musaddiq would reject them. He hoped that in that event thenew American Administration would be more ready than their pre-predecessors had been to decline to compromise on the principles of thejoint proposals.The Foreign Secretary said that the Miriella, an Italian tankerwith a cargo of oil from Persia, was impounded at Venice, pending the hearing of a claim for an injunction lodged by the Anglo-Iranian oil company. It was difficult to bring strong pressure to bear upon theItalian Government so long as this case was still the subject of judicialproceedings.  He thought, however, that they would be helpful.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Germany.Arrest of former Nazis.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 5thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that a good deal of damaginginformation had been obtained by the examination of the documentsseized on the arrest of Werner Naumann and his associates. Therewas evidence that members of this group had maintained contacts with Fascist sympathisers in other countries, and that one at least oftheir number had established contact with the Russians. It was hopedthat the examination of the documents would shortly have reached apoint at which sufficient evidence could be made available to theGerman Federal Government to enable them, if they chose, to bringcriminal charges against some of the members of the group.Meanwhile, protests were being made in this country against thedecision of the British authorities in Germany to withhold fromNaumann facilities for private consultation with his legal adviser.This decision was being called in question by Sir Hartley Shawcross,M.P., in a letter published in The Times that morning, and by LordSimon, in a Question which he was proposing to ask in the House ofLords that afternoon. This matter was in a sense sub judice, sinceboth sides had appealed to higher legal authority against the decisionof the British judge that Naumann should be allowed to see his legal adviser in the presence of the registrar of the court. It should bepossible to avoid Parliamentary controversy over that aspect of thematter while that appeal was pending. For the rest it could be statedthat Naumann was being held in custody merely for the purposes ofinterrogation; that there was no intention of holding him indefinitelyfor this purpose; and that, if any charges were preferred against him,he would be given full facilities for consultation with his legal adviser.&apos;The Prime Minister said that every effort should be made to avoidParliamentary controversy over this, especially as we hoped to be able in the near future to transfer to the German authorities the responsi-bility for dealing with these men.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements, and invited the Foreign Secre-tary to arrange that questions about the grant to Naumannof facilities for consultation with his legal adviser should be handled on the lines indicated in the Cabinets discussion.
european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 73) regarding the suggestions made by the FrenchGovernment for a closer association between the United Kingdomand the European Defence Community.The Foreign Secretary said that he could not advise the Cabinetto accept the French proposal that we should undertake to maintainBritish forces on the continent at their present strength, even withan escape clause that in the event of a serious crisis overseas british forces might have to be withdrawn after consultation. Our obligations to station forces on the continent were entered into as a result of decisions taken within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(N.A.T.O.). This should be a sufficient guarantee that we would at no time remove forces from the continent without consultation inN.A.T.O. He was, however, prepared to agree that this consultationshould take place, not only in N.A.T.O., but with the european defence Community, if that would help the French to secure ratifica-tion of the Treaty. He was also prepared to suggest to the French that we should be ready to propose to the other N.A.T.O. countries,including the United States, that the North Atlantic Treaty should beextended for an additional period of thirty years so as to be co-terminous with the European Defence Community. He could discuss this point with the United States Secretary of State when he visitedWashington. If these proposals were approved by the Cabinet, hewould make the following adjustments in the proposed reply to theFrench Government (Annex D to C. (53) 73):  (i) At the end of paragraph 7 there would be added: &quot; but intheir view the arrangements for consultation suggested in paragraphs and 6 above could be used to discuss, inter alia, the level of UnitedKingdom and European Defence Community forces to be main-tained on the continent at any time.&quot;Magistrates&apos; 3.   The Cabinet again considered the proposal, put forward in aCourts. memorandum by the Lord Chancellor and the Home SecretaryCompensation (C. (52) 231), that the. regulations to be made under section 42 of the for part-time Justices of the Peace Act, 1949, should provide for compensation forClerks. part-time Clerks to Justices who would be displaced by the(Previous        reorganisation to be carried out under that Act.Reference: The Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary repeated onceC.C. (52) 100th again the arguments in favour of this course which they had putConclusions, before the Cabinet in the earlier discussions on 22nd July and minute 5.)       25th November, 1952.  They added that the need for a decision was now urgent, as the scheme of reorganisation was to be brought intooperation in April.Other Ministers supported their proposal, and expressed the viewthat there were grounds for differentiating the part-time Justices&apos;Clerks from other part-time officers who had been excluded fromcompensation under other post-war Acts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, however, that he was con-cerned about the cost of the Justices of the Peace Act, 1949, as a whole;for it now seemed likely to lead to expenditure three or four timesgreater than that originally envisaged. He suggested that he mightdiscuss with the Ministers directly concerned means of retarding the pace at which these reforms were introduced, with a view to reducingthe expenditure involved in the near future.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would dis-cuss with the Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary thecost of the reforms to be introduced under the Justices of thePeace Act, 1949.
(ii) The last sentence of paragraph 9 would be amended to read:&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government would accordingly be willing to make aproposal to the other N.A.T.O. countries to extend the North atlantic treaty for an additional period of thirty years.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he would like further time to con-sider this question.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (53) 73 at their next meeting.Treaty withLibya.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 67) covering the revised text of a Treaty with the libyan Government, and asking for authority to initial the revisedTreaty.The Foreign Secretary said that prompt acceptance of the LibyanPrime Minister^ offer to initial the Treaty would confirm his con-fidence in our good faith and improve our chances of obtainingsatisfactory military facilities in the negotiations now in progress.The United States and French Governments were also seeking agree-ments with Libya, but the Libyan Government had not so far shown the same readiness to conclude these.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to conclude the revised draft Treaty with Libya and the two related documents(Annexes 1, 2 and 3 of C. (53) 67).6. The Colonial Secretary said that the Judicial Committee ofthe Privy Council had rejected the application of Lee ment for leave to appeal against the death sentence imposed upon her in Malaya.He had asked the British authorities in Malaya to ensure that the ruler of Perak was made aware of the strong arguments againstexacting the death penalty in this case, and he hoped that it would becommuted to a sentence of imprisonment. Were the Cabinet agree-able that in this event we should accept the offer of the hungarian government to exchange Mr. Edgar Sanders for Lee ment and pro-ceed with the necessary practical arrangements?The Prime Minister said that he had grave doubts about the wis-dom of proceeding with the proposed exchange. It must be assumed that it would be impossible to conceal the connexion between the tworeleases. The cases were not in any way comparable, and the wholetransaction was likely to have the appearance of a somewhat dis-reputable deal with the Communists. Once we lent ourselves to thesepractices, it was difficult to know where they might lead. CommunistGovernments would certainly have no scruple in arresting other british subjects and holding them as hostages, if they thought thatthey might be able thereby to extract concessions from us. Were therenot other means of applying pressure to the Hungarian Governmentwith a view to securing Mr. Sanders&apos;s release?The Foreign Secretary said that strong commercial sanctions hadalready been applied, and it was doubtless these which had led the hungarian Government to obtain the permission of the soviet authorities to make their offer to exchange Mr. Sanders. He doubted whether anything more could be done to persuade them to releaseMr. Sanders without some countervailing concession.   He would,Hungary.Mr. EdgarSanders.(previous reference:C.C.

J3JTheCoronation.The Homage.(previous reference:C:C. (53) 13thConclusions,-Minute 7.)7. The Lord Chancellor said that the sub-committee of the coronation Committee had now met to consider the suggestion thatthe Speaker of the House of Commons should do homage to her majesty in the Coronation ceremony. The sub-committee had been persuaded to recommend that, whatever the merits of this suggestion,there was no longer enough time to carry through before the Coro-nation the necessary consultations with other Commonwealth Govern-ments. There was good reason to hope that the Coronation Committeewould accept this recommendation without further discussion.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Chancellor.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th February, 1953.however, consider the matter further in the light of the views whichthe Prime Minister had expressed; and would see whether there was any different proposal which he could put to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this matter at their next meeting.
