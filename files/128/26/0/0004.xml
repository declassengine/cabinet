5 QParliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on 27th January on the Supplementary Estimate forthe Argentine credit would occupy most of the day. Unless it rangedfairly widely over the Argentine trade agreement as a whole, anotherdebate on that agreement was likely to be raised in the discussion onthe Consolidated Fund Bill in the following week. It was thereforeagreed that the Chief Whip should try to secure that a wide debate would take place on 27th January. In that event, the Minister ofFood and the Economic Secretary, Treasury, should speak on behalfof the Government.Sunday 2.   On 30th January the House of Commons would debate aObservance. Private Member&apos;s Bill designed to remedy the anomalies of the Sunday observance Acts. This Bill was unlikely to command any wide measure of support, for it would legalise the Sunday opening oftheatres and music halls and the holding of professional sportingevents on Sundays, and many people would think that this went too far. On the other hand, most people would agree that the statutoryprohibitions against amateur games and similar activities on Sundaysshould now be removed, and there might be a large body of support for the suggestion that an enquiry should be held into the reform ofthe Sunday Observance Acts.In discussion it was agreed that the decision on this Bill shouldbe left to a free vote of the House of Commons, and that the Govern-ment should not offer any guidance to Members on the principle of theBill. It would be more convenient for the Government if the bill were defeated on Second Reading. If an enquiry were held, its report would extend to the contentious aspects of this subject; and theGovernment, if it had set up the enquiry, would be under some obliga-tion to introduce legislation.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary would submit to hiscolleagues a memorandum setting out the advantages and disadvantages of holding an enquiry into the reform of the sunday Observance Acts.The Royal Styleand Titles.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 12.)43665-3. The Home Secretary said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 14th January, he had consulted the Labour Oppositionabout the Royal Titles Bill. They had agreed that this Bill shouldbe treated as non-controversial and need not occupy much Parlia-mentary time. They had, however, expressed the view that a Bill ofthis importance should be taken first in the House of Commons.In discussion it was pointed out that Parliament ought to dealpromptly with this Bill once it was introducedrand that it would bedifficult to find time to make progress with it in the Commons forseveral weeks. This meant that, if it had to start in the Commons,its introduction must be delayed. But it had already been announced,in reply to a Parliamentary Question by Mr. John Rankin, M.P.,on 20th January, that the White Paper would be laid before the house in the very near future, and it was undesirable that there should beany long interval between the presentation of the White Paper andthe introduction of the Bill. If these considerations were put to theOpposition through the usual channels, they might perhaps withdraw their objections to the proposal that the Bill should be started in theHouse of Lords. If not, the introduction of the Bill would have tobe delayed.   - &apos;-2       &apos; B 2
nationalised industries.Pensions for full-time members of boards.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 79thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Co-ordina-tion of Transport, Fuel and Power (C. (52) 451) outlining a scheme ofpensions for full-time members of Boards of nationalised industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that under this schemeBoard members with no pre-existing pension rights would bepensionable on terms similar to those of the relevant staff pensions scheme. The scheme outlined in the memorandum had necessarilybeen framed on broad lines, and any particular case for which itfailed to provide adequately would be open for discussion between theMinisters concerned.The following points arose in discussion:  (a) In the Airways Corporations the only persons likely to beaffected were the Chairmen and, although the Civil Aviation Actwould have to be amended, it would not be necessary to introducespecial legislation for this purpose. There would doubtless be anopportunity during the next few years to include the amendment insome Civil Aviation legislation needed for other purposes.(b) The scheme should be introduced as unobtrusively as possible,Publicity might intensify the pressure for supplementary pensions formanual workers.(c) The risk that a qualifying period of service of ten years might result in the retention on Boards of members who had outlived theirusefulness was one which must be accepted.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (52) 451.Coa!- ; 5.   The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, FuelMiners&apos; Wages. anci Power reported a further development in the negotiations on the(Previous        current wages claim by the National Union of Mineworkers.   the reference:      Union, who had throughout been anxious to extend the area of theC.C. (53) 3rd    award, had now suggested that, if it could extend to all day-workers,Conclusions,    the younger men might be excluded. This extension would have the minute 5.)       effect of increasing the cost of the award by something between 2J and  2-J millions.  It would also increase the risk that the awardmight start a further round of applications for wage increases in otherindustries.  Acceptance of this suggestion would encourage the moreconservative elements in the Union, who were now prepared toencourage Saturday working and were showing signs of becoming more co-operative generally. But, despite this, the Secretary of Staterecommended that the National Coal Board should not be encouraged to make this concession.The Cabinet -Reaffirmed their decision of 20th January that the Govern-ment should support the National Coal Board in refusingany further concession in their current wages negotiationswith the National Union of Mineworkers.Tariff Policy. 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignJapan and the Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 20) aboutG.A.T.T. the attitude to be adopted by the United Kingdom delegation to the(Previous forthcoming meeting of the Intersessional &quot;Committee of the Con-Reference: tracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and TradeC.C. (52) 81st (G.A.T.T.) on Japan&apos;s application to enter into tariff negotiations with conclusions, a view to her eventual accession to the Agreement.Minute 8.) presi^ent Qj the Board of Trade said that our policy in thismatter must take account both of the desirability of associating Japan
i-3 QHungary, 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had received an intima-Mr. Edgar tion that the Hungarian Government would now be willing toSanders. surrender Mr. Edgar Sanders, a British subject who had beenimprisoned in Hungary for several vears on charges of espionage, in with the international organisations of the free world and of the need to prevent a disruption of the general pattern of trade by a recurrence of pre-war Japanese trade practices. The effect of admitting japan to G.A.T.T. on the normal terms would be to give her an absoluteright to &quot; most-favoured-nation &quot; treatment. This v/ould mean thatif any member country of the G.A.T.T., including commonwealth countries, found it necessary to raise its tariffs against Japan, it wouldalso be bound to raise them correspondingly against this country.This would lead to a general increase of trade barriers which wouldbe contrary to our policy of seeking an expansion of world trade. Itwas therefore recommended that we should seek the support of othercountries likely to be sympathetic to our view for example, Australiaand France in putting forward a proposal that there should beinserted in a special protocol of accession for Japan a provision that countries might resort to discriminatory action against her along thelines envisaged in Article XIX of G.A.T.T., not only if her importscaused or threatened to cause serious injury to the domestic indus-tries of a contracting party, but also if they caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the exports of a contracting party to territories in an area within which preferential arrangements were permitted under G.A.T.T. Before such discriminatory action could be taken,it would be necessary to consult Japan and the other contractingparties, unless the urgency of the situation appeared to require actionbefore consultation.The Foreign Secretary said that, although he saw no alternative,the course recommended in the memorandum was likely to be unpopular with many members of G.A.T.T., including the UnitedStates. It might well be found that the United States Governmentwould prefer some relaxation of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he fully recognised the need for some safeguard against the potential danger fromJapanese trade competition; but he also thought that the ultimate solution might lie in a relaxation of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule.The President of the Board of Trade pointed out that a relaxation of the &quot; no new preference &quot; rule would not be of assistance to othercountries which would equally wish to protect themselves againstundue Japanese competition.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the United kingdom delegation to the Intersessional Committee of G.A.T.T. should, in thefirst instance, explore with other interested delegations the possibilityof securing support for the proposals outlined in C. (53) 20. Theseproposals should, if possible, be first discussed with representativesof the United States Government. Other Commonwealth Govern-ments should also be kept in touch with the course of the discussions.Our attitude might, however, have to be reconsidered in the light ofthe results of these preliminary consultations.The Cabinet Agreed that, in preparation for the forthcoming meeting ofthe Intersessional Committee of the contracting parties tothe G.A.T.T., preliminary soundings should be taken withthe United States Government and with other interested governments with a view to judging what support would be forthcoming for the proposal that the Japanese protocol of accession to the Agreement should contain safeguards on thelines suggested in C (53) 20.
exchange for a Chinese Communist woman named Lee ment, whohad been arrested in Malaya and sentenced to death. He was anxiousto seize this opportunity of securing the release of Mr. Sanders, whohad endured great hardships. Difficulties might, however, arise fromthe fact that Lee ment had been given, leave to appeal against hersentence to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.The Lord Chancellor said that, if the appropriate authorities in malaya were ready to exercise the prerogative of mercy in thiswoman&apos;s favour, there should be no difficulty in arranging with hersolicitors for the appeal to be withdrawn.The Colonial Secretary said that, if satisfactory assurances weregiven that Mr. Sanders would be released, he would be prepared topress the appropriate authorities in Malaya to arrange for the releaseof Lee ment.The Cabinet-Agreed that it would be advantageous that this exchangeshould be carried through, if suitable arrangements could bemade; and invited the Foreign Secretary and the colonial secretary to concert the necessary action for this purpose.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd January, 1953.
