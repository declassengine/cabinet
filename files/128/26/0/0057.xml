Foreign Affairs.        1.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had asked the UnitedTripartite States Secretary of State and the Foreign Minister of France to comeMeeting. to meet him in London to discuss current questions of foreign policy(Previous affecting the three Governments.   Both had accepted this invitationReference: and the talks would open on 16th October.   In the announcement,CC. (53) 45th which would be issued that afternoon, this would be presented as a conclusions, continuation of the meeting held in Washington in July.Minute 6.)Germany.Four-power meeting.(previous reference:CC. (53) 52ndConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Foreign Secretary invited the Cabinefs views on thedraft, prepared by officials of the United Kingdom, United States andFrench Governments, of a reply to the Soviet note of 28th Septemberregarding the proposal of the three Western Powers for a Four-power meeting on Germany. Copies of this draft were handed round atthe meeting.Discussion turned on the phrasing of a reference, in paragraph of the draft, to the composition of the proposed political conferenceon Korea. As the attitude of the United States Government towards this had been rather different from our own, care would need to betaken to use a form of words which would be acceptable to both governments. But the formula should be such as to leave it opento the United States Government to go some way to meeting the viewsheld by other Governments on this point.The Foreign Secretary undertook to reconsider, in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion, the wording of this part of paragraph 6 ofthe draft.The Cabinet-Subject to the point raised in their discussion, approved theterms of the draft reply to the Soviet note of 28th September.Egypt. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that no further progress hadDefence been made in the defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government.Negotiations.    It was valuable, from our point of view, that the Egyptians were(Previous        willing to include in the preamble to an agreement a satisfactoryReference:      reference to the Suez Canal; but they showed no signs of willingnessCC. (53) 55th   to meet our requirements on the wearing of uniform by British troopsConclusions,     in the Base or on the circumstances in which we should be entitledMinute 2.)       to resume use of the Base for war purposes.   As they were unwilling to agree that the Base should be made available to us in the eventof United Nations action to resist an act of aggression, he was considering an alternative formula under which it would become available if, in the light of the general situation, either party con-sidered that the according of such facilities was essential to the safety of the Middle East.  This would cover our essential needs,and it was possible that the Egyptians might regard it as less widein scope than the formula referring to action by the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be seeing on the follow-ing day a member of the United Kingdom Delegation in Cairo whowas returning to London to report on the stage reached in thenegotiations. In the light of this report he would seek further decisions from the Cabinet on 15th October, so that he could give instructions to the Delegation in time for their next meeting with the egyptians, which was to be held on 17th October.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
5. The Colonial Secretary said that the situation in british guiana still remained quiet. The Governor feared that there mightbe outbreaks of incendiarism, but this had not yet been attempted onany considerable scale. Mr. Jagan, the spokesman of the dismissedMinisters, had expressed a wish to come to London for discussions with the Colonial Secretary, but he had been told that he should in thefirst instance see the Minister of State for the Colonies, who was dueto arrive in Georgetown on 19th October.The Prime Minister said that no great harm would be done if mr. Jagan came to this country and were seen to be associating withCommunists here; but it would hardly be appropriate for the colonial secretary to receive him immediately after he had been dismissedfrom office.The Colonial Secretary said that the Opposition were anxious that the situation in British Guiana should be debated as soon as parliament reassembled. He proposed to present a White Paper on20th October: this would obviate the need for any statement beforethe debate, which was to be held on 22nd October. From soundingswhich he had taken he believed that, in view of the attitude of thedismissed Ministers towards the trade union movement in british guiana and of their association with the World Federation of trades union, the Labour Opposition in the House of Commons would notbe united in condemning the action which the Government had takenin this matter.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statements, and invited him to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of his proposed White Paper on the situation in British Guiana.British Guiana.(previous reference:CC. (53) 56thConclusions,Minute 1.)Trieste. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that since he reported to the(Previous Cabinet on 8th October the Yugoslav Government had intensifiedReference: their resistance to the Anglo-American plan for bringing about aCC. (53) 56th de facto settlement of the Trieste problem. They had communicatedConclusions, their views to the United Nations and had also proposed that a minute 2.) conference of representatives of the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, United States, Italy and Yugoslavia should be held at once to consider the situation. The Foreign Secretary said that he did not intend to reply to this proposal until he had had an opportunity of discussing it with the United States Secretary of State and the french foreign Minister later in the week. Meanwhile, he would remindMarshal Tito, through his Ambassador in London, that the settlementnow proposed was little different from that which Tito had beenready to accept a year ago; and he would protest vigorously againstthe insults which were being offered to the representatives of her majesty&apos;s Government in Belgrade. The Italians had exploited to thefull our failure to make it plain at the outset that we thought thisshould be a final settlement of the Trieste problem. This was the weakness of our position, and he intended to make every effort to persuade the United States Government to take a firmer&quot; line on thispoint.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to lodge with the yugoslav government a vigorous protest against the attacksrecently made on British official premises in Belgrade.
AGovernmentOrganisation.regional organisation.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 29thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 212) proposing the closure of regional offices of Government Departments in Cambridge and Reading.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view the closing of these Regional offices was an essential element in the Governmentsdeclared policy of making such changes in the organisation of Gov-ernment Departments as would simplify administration and reducecosts. But in order to meet the difficulties of those departments which could not readily fall in with his proposal he was prepared to defer closure until July 1954 and to agree that the Ministry of Labourmight retain small staffs to handle industrial relations both inCambridge and in Reading.The Minister of Labour said that he was ready to examine indetail the staffing of his regional offices in both, these towns with aview to their being reduced as much as possible. He must, however,insist on retaining in each Region a Controller with enough staff to handle both industrial relations and placing in employment, both ofwhich functions called for close personal contacts with industrialfirms.The Minister of Housing said that in principle he attached greatimportance to the maintenance of those personal contacts betweenCivil Servants and local authorities and private individuals whichwere possible at the regional level. These contacts and the corres-correspondingly close relations which existed in the regions between repre-sentatives of his Department and those of the Ministries of Labourand Works would be particularly valuable when private buildingcame to be freed from control. He was, however, prepared to agreeto the transfer of his regional staffs from Cambridge and Reading toLondon provided that they continued to be organised as regional offices and were not merged with the headquarters staffs.The Minister of Works said that he desired to retain offices in both Cambridge and Reading in connection with the licensing ofbuilding work and the provision of services for other GovernmentDepartments. He also pointed out that the saving which was expectedto accrue from the closure of regional offices in these two places wouldbe offset by the need to hire alternative accommodation in Londonwhile retaining a lien upon the regional offices in Cambridge, whichwould be required in war.The Lord President said that it seemed to him important to balance against the obvious need for every possible staff economy thedesirability of decentralisation as a principle consistent with thegeneral policy of the Conservative Party.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would try to workout in the light of the Cabinets discussion a modified plan for effectingsome measure of economy by a reorganisation of regional offices inCambridge and Reading.The Cabinet Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would workout a modified plan for reorganising regional offices inCambridge and Reading and would report the results tothe Cabinet in due course.Food Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 3.)7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofFood (C. (53) 271) and the Minister of Labour (C. (53) 276) on the changes in food prices which would be required to keep the total costof food subsidies close to the limit of  220 millions which had been set for the current financial year.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be unfortunate-nate if the Government should fail to carry out their declared intentionto restrict the total cost of food subsidies this year to  220 millions.To bring the total cost of the subsidies down to  223 millions wouldinvolve making the increases of food prices, yielding  35 millions,which were set out in paragraph 8 of C. (53) 271. He recognised thatan increase in the price of bread would be open to serious objectionsand he was prepared to consider a solution on the lines of makingonly such price increases as would ensure that by the end of thefinancial year the subsidies were running at a rate equivalent to anannual total of  220 millions. The increases required under such a plan would be as follows:  Beef: 2d. per pound from 1st December,Milk: Maintain present price of Id. a pint.Butter: 4d. per pound from 1st November.Cheese: 2d. per pound from 1st November.These changes would involve an increase of -63 in the cost-of-living index.The Minister of Food said that the chancellors proposal wouldbe acceptable to him, although he would have preferred that theGovernment should not for a third time fail to carry out their declaredintention to reduce the price of milk.The Minister of Labour said that even a rise of only -63 in thecost-of-living index in respect of food might have unfortunate effects on wage negotiations, particularly at this season of the year.Responsible trade union leaders were constantly emphasising theimportance of keeping the cost-of-living index steady and particularly of avoiding increases in food prices, which led directly to pressure for higher wages. Employers had also made it clear that they could not reasonably be expected to resist wage claims if it could be shown thatthe price of food had increased. From the point of view of industrial relations, therefore, any further increases should be kept to aminimum and deferred for as long as possible.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) It was suggested that the increases in food prices proposed bythe Chancellor might be put into operation in two separate stages.As against this, it was pointed out that the proposed increases in theprices of butter and cheese would have to be made in any event by may 1954 if the Government adhered to their present intention tode-control these commodities at that date. It was also suggested thatthe proposed price increases would not necessarily arouse less criticism if they were introduced gradually.(b) Although it was true that considerable significance was attached to the cost-of-living index figures, the actual increases inweekly household expenditure on food which would be involved underthe chancellors proposals would be trivial and it was relevant thatin the current year there had been an increase of no less than 60 millions in expenditure on sweets alone.(c) The food subsidies were, as conditions changed, becoming lessa means of keeping down the price of food in the interests of con-sumers than a means of ensuring an adequate return to Britishfarmers. It might well be desirable before long to make changes in themethod of. handling, and presenting the subsidies which would bring this out more clearly.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that such increases should be made in food prices as would ensure that by the end of the current financial year the food subsidies were running at a rateequivalent to an annual total of  220 millions.
Raw Cotton.Importing and marketing.(previous reference:CC. (53) 35thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofMaterials (C. (53) 278) recommending that Government purchase ofcotton through the Raw Cotton Commission should be discontinuedand that facilities should be given for the re-opening of the futuresmarket of the Liverpool Cotton Exchange.The Minister of Materials said that the Government werepledged to re-open the Liverpool cotton market, and the timing ofthis operation had been under discussion with the cotton spinnersand the Liverpool Cotton Association for more than six months.The industry confidently expected the Government to allow themarket to re-open in 1954. They were ready to assume full responsibility for the purchase of cotton, and they were confident that they could discharge this responsibility with success if the futuresmarket were re-opened. Meanwhile the Raw Cotton Commission,whose operations in the previous year had resulted in a loss of 27 millions, were losing the support and confidence of the trade.Spinners were taking increasing advantage of their new opportunityto buy their own cotton, and the Commission was now handling only44 per cent, of total imports. The Chairman had declared his inten-tion to resign; and, as the scope of the Commission^ activitiesdeclined, the more efficient members of the staff were beginning to look elsewhere for their future employment. The Minister was satisfied that it would not be possible to keep the Commission in being, as an efficient organisation, for another year. It was certainlyundesirable to continue, if it could be avoided, the present practiceof providing through, the Commission Government cover for theprivate purchase of cotton by spinners; and this arrangement wouldbe brought to an end as soon as the futures market was re-opened.It was true that, if the market were free, we should risk the loss of up to  11 millions on our dollar balance of payments; but theMinister considered that, despite this, the balance of advantage layon the side of discontinuing the present system of Governmentpurchase.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer to postpone this action for a further year. Though satisfactory progress had been made in righting our adverse balance of payments, we hadnot yet built up a substantial surplus; and other measures of de-control on which we were now embarking, e.g., the abandonment of the existing control over softwood, might increase our overseas expenditure by  50 or  60 millions. Moreover, there was reason tobelieve that a trade recession might soon develop in the UnitedStates. This would have a serious adverse effect on our dollar balanceof payments; and, while this was threatening, he was reluctant toabandon existing controls over our dollar expenditure. The abandon-ment of too many import controls at this stage would put us in aposition in which commodities were convertible while our currencyremained non-convertible and our gold and dollar reserves were inadequate.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary shared the Chancellor&apos;s anxiety on this point. He also feared&apos; that in a freemarket spinners might buy American cotton in preference toBrazilian cotton, with the result that Brazil would be unable to dis-charge her trade debts to.this country. If, however, the Minister was(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Labour, the Minister of Food and other ministers concerned, to work out a plan for implementing the decision recorded in Conclusion (1) above on thegeneral lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerbut with such modifications in detail and timing as mightbe agreed upon.
University 9.   The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 6thFranchise.       October the Cabinet had agreed that the question of restoring the(Previous        University franchise should be further considered in the light of the reference:      debate which was to have been held on this subject at the PartyCC. (53) 55th   Conference at Margate.   In the event, this matter had not been conclusions,     discussed at the Party Conference.   He had, however, little doubtMinute 7.)       that, in view of the difficulties set out in the memorandum by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 272),the Government would be ill-advised to attempt to carry out the pledge given at the last General Election to restore Universityrepresentation in the House of Commons.There was general agreement with the view expressed by thePrime Minister.The Cabinet-Decided to take no further action with a view to restoringUniversity representation in the House of Commons.Government 10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was muchLoans. gratified by the success of the operation for floating new government loans which had been completed on 10th October. A total of  341millions had been subscribed in cash for the new 3 per cent. ExchequerStock 1962-63. And  552 millions of the If per cent. Serial FundingStock 1953 had been converted, either into If per cent. Serial Fundingsatisfied that the Raw Cotton Commission could not be continued inefficient operation for another year he would be prepared to accept these risks.In discussion it was argued that the freeing of this market wouldnot necessarily result in a neavy loss on our dollar balance of pay-ments. The price of cotton was now so high that there was little riskof purely speculative transactions. And the Liverpool CottonExchange expected to be able to restrain speculators from buyingdollar cotton and selling it overseas. Moreover, after the first year,they would be able to apply some restraint on the purchase of american cotton. The risk of a trade recession in the United states was admitted; but in that event the price of American cotton would fall and, as trade slackened in this country, the volume of cotton imports would also decline. The members of the Liverpool CottonAssociation had weighed very carefully the difficulties which theywould encounter in re-opening the futures market, and they were confident that they could overcome them. If they were again deniedthe opportunity to go back into this business, they might well loseheart.The Cabinet also recognised the great political advantages whichthey would gain by redeeming their pledge to re-open this market.They would thereby re-affirm their belief in the benefits accruing tothe consumer from a system of buying and selling in a free market.They considered, however, that the conclusive argument in favourof the course proposed by the Minister of Materials was the difficultyof maintaining the Raw Cotton Commission in efficient operation for another year.The Cabinet Agreed that the futures market of the Liverpool CottonExchange should be allowed to re-open in 1954; and invited the Minister of Materials and the President of the Board ofTrade to arrange for the discontinuance of Governmentpurchase of cotton through the Raw Cotton Commission.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th October, 1953.Stock 1954 or into a new 2  per cent. Serial Funding Stock 1957.No less than  503 millions of this had been converted into the new1957 stock. As a result only  25 millions of the 1953 stock remained to be paid off in November. It was gratifying to find so high a proportion of conversion, particularly into the later of the two stocksoffered. And the new cash subscription would enable  341 millions to be applied to debt redemption. This would reduce the high levelof Treasury Bill indebtedness. It would also tend to contract theliquid reserves of the clearing banks and so reinforce the Govern-menfs credit policy.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer and invited him to convey to the Governor ofthe Bank of England an expression of the Cabinetsappreciation of the success of this operation.
