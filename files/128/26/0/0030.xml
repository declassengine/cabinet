Indo-China.Parliament.SimplifiedSpelling Bill.1. The Prime Minister said that at their meeting on 29th april the Defence Committee had decided that, in view of our limited resources, we must refuse a French request for the loan of transport aircraft for use in Indo-China. Since then, however, he had been told that we were holding a number of suitable aircraft in reserveagainst the possibility that we might have to resume the air-lift intoBerlin. If this were so, it might be more difficult to continue to refusethis French request.In discussion it was suggested that such transport aircraft as wereavailable in this country might be needed for our own military purposes if an emergency arose requiring the reinforcement of Britishtroops in the Middle East or in South-East Asia. It was also saidthat there was some reason to believe that the French themselves hadtransport aircraft available which they had not yet sent to Indo-China.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of state to enquire further into the points which had been raised in discussion and to report the result of their enquiries to thePrime Minister.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. The Prime minister would open the two days&apos; debate on foreign affairs on 11th May andthe Government speakers on 12th May would be the Minister ofState and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.The Minister of Education said that the Simplified Spelling Bill,a Private Member&apos;s Bill sponsored by Mr. 1. J. Pitman, M.P., had passed through Committee and would reach the stage of report and third reading as Second Order on 8th May. The promoters of theBill, whose principal object had been to obtain publicity for their scheme, were now prepared to withdraw the Bill if she would makea statement indicating that it would be open to research organisations to investigate further the possibility of improving the teaching of reading by use of a new system of spelling. She was prepared, if theCabinet agreed, to make a suitable statement to this effect, and adraft of this was read to the Cabinet. The statement proposed would leave the position exactly as it was and would involve no commitment for the Government.The Chief Whip said that there could be no certainty that the bill could be defeated on 8th May. The promoters had mustered a sub-stantial body of support for it and it would be undesirable to issue an official whip against it. If, however, the promoters would agreethemselves to move an adjournment of the debate, this would belikely to be carried, as it would be opposed only by those elements in the House whose main concern was to embarrass the Government.In discussion it was suggested that, if the Bill received a third reading in the Commons, it might still be defeated in the Lords.It was pointed out, however, that there could be no certainty of this in view of the efforts made by the promoters to enlist support for theBill in both Houses, and that in any case the defeat of the Bill in the lords after it had been passed by the Commons might at the momentimpair relations between the two Houses. On the other hand, if the promoters were frustrated in an attempt to withdraw the Bill in the commons, its subsequent defeat in the Lords could not give rise to serious criticism.The Prime Minister said that he would have preferred to avoidmaking any arrangement with the promoters of this Bill, but in allthe circumstances he was willing that this possibility should be explored.
television development.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (53) 142) suggesting the appointment of aCabinet Committee to advise on certain aspects of television develop-ment by the B.B.C. and by commercial companies.The Postmaster-General said that it would be of advantage ifa small Committee could consider and advise the Cabinet on the implications of an early decision to allow the B.B.C. to proceedimmediately after the Coronation with the construction of fiveadditional low-powered television stations. A decision on thisquestion should be reached by July, if sponsored television was to bein operation before the next General Election.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he favoured an immediate decision to authorise the erection of the five additionalB.B.C. stations. Further hesitation in approving this development would deprive substantial populations of television for no good reasonand would seriously delay the introduction of sponsored televisionfor which there was strong support in the Conservative Party.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with thePostmaster-General in thinking that it would be helpful if, beforeauthority was given for any additional B.p.C. stations, the. pro-gramme of television development, both public and commercial, couldbe reviewed on the Cabinets behalf.The Prime Minister said that it would be convenient if a Com-mittee could formulate the points for decision by the Cabinet anddraw up a suggested time-table of development.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),Home Secretary,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,Lord Privy Seal,Secretary of State for Scotland,Postmaster-General,to study the problems raised in C. (53) 142 and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Education to discuss further with the promoters of the Simplified Spelling Bill the possibilityof securing that the Bill should be withdrawn, and toreport to the Prime Minister whether satisfactory assurances of this could be obtained.Press Council The Home Secretary said that curtailment of debate on theBill- Simplified Spelling Bill would involve the Government in furtherembarrassment as the Third Order for 8th May was the adjourneddebate on the Press Council Bill. It would be unfortunate if this Bill,which provided for a statutory Press Council, were to receive aSecond Reading when the interests concerned, under pressure fromthe Government, had agreed upon the main lines of a voluntary PressCouncil which it was hoped to bring into being by 1st July.The Lord Privy Seal said that the situation was complicated bythe fact that most of the Governments supporters who were interestedin this subject had already exhausted their right to speak on secondreading of the Bill.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Home Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal and theChief Whip to consider, in consultation, how best toensure that the Press Council Bill should not receive aSecond Reading on Friday, 8th May.
The Home Secretary said that the Secretary of State for Scotlandhad asked him to remind the Cabinet that the reason given hithertofor the inability to make television available in North-East scotland in time for the Coronation had been the shortage of resources. Ifapproval were now to be given for the erection of five additionalB.B.C. stations, the Government might be severely criticised for having failed to make a service available in this area before the coronation.  Was a temporary service still out of the question?The Postmaster-General said that from personal enquiries whichhe had made he was satisfied that opinion in North-East scotland would not be content with anything less than a permanent service,which certainly could not have been provided before the Coronation.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Committee appointed under Conclusion (1) above to consider whether any temporary television service should be provided in North-East Scotland for the coronation.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (53) 146) seeking authority to present to theSelect Committee on the Army and Air Force Acts proposals forrevising the definition of mutiny and the penalties for it which hadbeen before the Cabinet at their meeting on 17th February.The Minister of Defence said that these proposals had now beenfully discussed with the Law Officers, whose main concern was toensure that the difficulties which they saw in them were fully appre-ciated by all concerned. These difficulties would accordingly bebrought to the notice of the Select Committee, to whom it would alsobe made clear that the proposals did not represent the considered views of the Government.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence to communicate withthe Select Committee on the Army and Air Force Acts onthe lines proposed in C. (53) 146.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had considered further, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, what would bethe best method of implementing the Governments decision toimprove the remuneration of the Judges of the High Court. He was now disposed to recommend an all-round salary increase of  3,000a year, together with a tax-free travel allowance of  150 a year. ForJudges now on a salary of  5,000 a year, this would mean a net increase of remuneration of  995; for those on higher rates of salarythe net increase would be smaller. He suggested that the cabinet should consider this alternative method, and should also decide whether it would be practicable to pass the necessary legislation during the current session.On the method, differing views were expressed in the cabinets discussion. Some Ministers thought that a further attempt mightbe made to satisfy Government supporters that the original proposalfor a tax-free allowance was justified by the argument that the HighCourt Judges held a unique position and were not comparable withany other class of tax-payer. Alternatively, it might be easier tojustify on that ground a proposal to reduce the salaries (e.g., from 5,000 a year to  3,500) and make them wholly exempt from tax.Other Ministers believed that it was the element of exemption from taxation which had occasioned the widespread criticism of the original

The Prime Minister said that he had been asked for a replySalaries of       to the representations, made by a deputation from leading membersMembers and   of the Labour Party which he had received on 1st April, in favourHouse of        of increased remuneration for Members of the House of Commons.Commons       He was being asked, in particular, whether the Government wereProcedure.      willing to propose that this question be examined by a Select(Previous        Committee.   He remained convinced that any proposal to raiseReferences:     Members&apos; salaries at this juncture would be strongly opposed by aC.C. (53) 24th   majority of Government supporters, and he therefore preferred that conclusions,    the Opposition should be left to take the initiative in raising the minute l,       matter publicly.   He also thought that the pressure for an increase and 29th        in Members&apos; salaries might possibly be relieved by encouraging theConclusions,    discussion of means of easing the strain on Members by adjustmentsMinute 10.)     in the procedure of the House.   Such a discussion on questions ofprocedure might disclose possibilities of increased allowances for members, e.g., for postage, and other facilities which might lessen the demand for an increase of salary.  He proposed to reply to theOpposition Leaders on those lines, and to point out that it was opento them to raise the matter on one of their Supply Days.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had now agreed to the appointment of a Select Committee to enquire into the amenities available for Members in the Palace of Westminster.The point was also made that, in the interests of Party discipline,Government supporters should not be encouraged to put forwardsuggestions for improving the present arrangements for pairing: thediscussion of this matter could best be handled through the usual channels.proposal and considered that on this account it would be easier topass through Parliament legislation providing for an increase of grosssalary.The Lord Chancellor said that, if this latter method were adopted, the opportunity should be taken to remove some of the disparity between the salaries of the English Judges and those of judges in Scotland and Northern Ireland.On timing, the Cabinet were informed that, owing to the con-gestion of the Parliamentary time-table, there was now little prospect that legislation on this subject could be passed into law before the endof the current session. The point was also made that it would beinconvenient that this question should again become the subject ofpublic controversy at a critical stage in the negotiations on the currentwages claim in the engineering industry. On the other hand, an earlyassurance ought to be given of the Governments intention to carry through their decision to improve the Judges&apos; remuneration;, and it&apos;was suggested that some announcement of the Governmenfs decision should be made during the summer, even though the necessary legisla-tion could not be introduced until the autumn. Some Ministers felt,however, that it might be inexpedient to make such a declaration sofar in advance of the introduction of legislation, especially if impor-tant negotiations for industrial wage increases were then in progress.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for the Lord chancellor to meet the Executive of the 1922 Committee in order thathe might explain the reasons for the government&apos;s decision to improve the remuneration of the Judges andhear their views on the alternative methods of giving effectto that decision.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion when the results of that meeting were available.
The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would ascertain the viewsof the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Sealon the terms of the reply which he proposed to send to the representations made on behalf of the Labour Party infavour of increased remuneration for Members of the Houseof Commons.Atomic Energy.Future ExternalPolicy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 28thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Paymaster-General (C. (53) 145) covering the draft of the message aboutco-operation with Australia in atomic energy matters which was tobe sent to the Prime Minister of Australia in accordance with the cabinets decision of 21st April.The Paymaster-General explained that the underlined passages in the third and seventh paragraphs of the draft message were designedto meet points raised by the Prime Minister. The underlined passage in the third paragraph was intended to discourage the Australiansfrom thinking that they would find it easy to come to some arrange-ment with the Americans for co-operation in atomic energy matters.The Prime Minister said that the draft would be more acceptable to him if the words &quot; at the present time &quot; were inserted after thewords &quot; we cannot count &quot; in line 5 of the third paragraph.The Cabinet Approved the draft telegram attached to C. (53) 145, subjectto the amendment noted above.Provision for old Age.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 59thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C (53) 143) seeking the Cabinetsendorsement of a recommendation by the Home Affairs Committeethat the financial and economic problems arising from the provision made for old age should be investigated by an independent and authoritative committee of enquiry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the fact that expend!-ture from the National Insurance Fund was expected to begin tcexceed income from contributions in .1954-55 reinforced the case for an enquiry, which the Secretary of State for Scotland wished tocover Scotland as well as England and Wales. He hoped that theMinister of Labour would make every effort to secure the co-opera-tion of the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) in the enquiry. TheCommittee&apos;s terms of reference might be on the lines suggested in his memorandum.The Minister of Labour said that he was ready to approach theT.U.C., although there could be no certainty that they would abandon their previous objections to taking part in an enquiry of the kind proposed. He hoped that, when the appointment of the Committeewas announced, it would be made clear that it would take intoaccount the work already done in this field by a Committee underthe Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Secretary to his Ministry, onwhich the T.U.C. was represented.  .The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that an independent committee of enquiry should beappointed &quot; To review the economic and financial problems involved in providing for old age, having regard to the prospective increase in the number of the aged, and tomake recommendations.&quot;
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult the PrimeMinister on the selection of a Chairman for the proposed committee, and to settle the remaining membership ofthe Committee in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal,the Minister of Labour and the Minister of national insurance.East-West 9.   The President of the Board of Trade informed the cabinet trade. that he had evidence that a firm called Draybex Limited had con-Draybex trived to sell a consignment of ballbearings to the Soviet Union byLimited. deliberate evasion of the export licensing regulations, and he was(Previous        proposing to institute proceedings against the company for breach ofReference:      those regulations.   One of its directors, Mr. G. B. Drayson, was aC.C. (53) 16th   Conservative Member of Parliament.   Defence Regulation 91 had conclusions,    the effect that, if an offence against the regulations was committedMinute 4.)       by a company, any director of the company was deemed to be guilty of the offence unless he proved that it was committed without his knowledge or that he had exercised all due diligence to prevent itscommission.   It had not, however, been the practice of the Boardof Trade to proceed in such cases against all the directors of a com-pany; and on the present occasion there was reason to believe thatMr. Drayson had no special knowledge of the transaction constitutingthe offence.   Subject, therefore, to the opinion of an independentcounsel experienced in the criminal law, he proposed that these pro-ceedings should be taken against the company and the director knownto be responsible for the transaction, and that Mr. Drayson shouldnot be joined in the proceedings.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th May, 1953.
