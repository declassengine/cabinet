Trieste. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the recent rioting in the Free(Previous Territory of Trieste had occurred at a moment when agreement had reference: been reached between the United States, French and United KingdomC.C. (53) 61st Governments on proposals for convening a conference of representa-Conclusions, tives of those three Governments and of Italy and Yugoslavia. these minute 1.) proposals, which were set out in Washington telegram No. 2429 of 7th November, had appeared to hold out a reasonable prospect of progress towards a settlement. They offered some advantages to both parties. Thus, Italy would welcome the proposal that Italians should at once take over specified posts in the administration of Zone A;and Yugoslavia would be gratified by the declaration of the three governments in regard to the finality of the de facto settlement of8th October and by the arrangements proposed for ensuring freeaccess to, and unrestricted use of, the facilities of the Port of Trieste.1 He had felt, however, that the recent riots, which had been encouragedfrom across the Italian frontier, made it impossible to proceed at thisstage with proposals which might bear the appearance of rewardingItalian misbehaviour. He had therefore made representations bothin Washington and Paris to the effect that the communication of the agreed proposals to the Italian and Yugoslav Governments should be delayed. The final views of the United States Government in response to these representations were still awaited, but the first reactions ofthe State Department had been strongly against delay. M. Bidaulthad. been more receptive to the arguments for marking time andhad indicated that he would be reluctant to press for immediate action if the United Kingdom Government remained strongly opposedto it. At the same time he had made it clear that, if the United StatesGovernment, in spite of our representations, remained in favour ofaction, he would on balance be disposed to agree with them.The main argument against delay was that the Yugoslav Govern-ment were anxious to make public a proposal of their own for the summoning of a meeting of Ambassadors to prepare the way forthe convening of a formal conference. This proposal might attractsome measure of support if it were made public at the present timebut, in fact, it was unlikely to serve any useful purpose. A further argument against delay was that Signor Pella was due to leave Romeon 12th November on a visit to Turkey.It did not seem practicable to propose the immediate summoning of a conference without making at the same time some proposal forbeginning to transfer the civil administration of Zone A to the Italians,for the Italian Government had declared publicly that they could not agree to be represented at a conference until the administration ofZone A had been transferred to them in accordance with the decisionof 8th October. Nor would it be advisable to make only a generalproposal that certain unspecified posts in the administration wouldbe handed over to Italy, for such a statement would be interpretedboth in Italy and in Yugoslavia as implying an intention to transfereffective control of the administration to the Italians. In fact, the posts which it was proposed to hand over in the first stage were relatively, unimportant and, in particular, did not cover control ofthe police which it was vital to retain in Allied hands.It was the general view of the Cabinet that any concession toItaly at this juncture would be interpreted as a sign of weakness onthe part of the three Powers and as having been wrung from themby the disturbances which had occurred. This might encourage pro-Yugoslav elements to resort to extreme courses. The Cabinettherefore considered that a further effort should be made to bringthe United States Government round to our point of view. they recognised, however, that, if this effort should be unsuccessful, weshould be obliged to acquiesce in the immediate communication ofthe agreed tripartite proposals to the Italian and Yugoslav Govern-ments in the interests of maintaining a common front between thethree Powers, though we might make it clear that we continued to doubt the wisdom of following this course.&apos;
Tripartite 2.   The Prime Minister said that, in view of the unsatisfactoryMeeting in       tone of the latest Soviet response to the proposal for a Four-PowerBermuda.        Meeting on Germany, he had thought it would be valuable if the(Previous        Heads of Governments of the United States, United Kingdom and reference:      France could meet, with their Foreign Ministers, to review the possi-C.C. (53) 37th   bility of breaking the existing deadlock and to discuss the urgentConclusions,     problems which were of common interest to the three countries.   he Minute 2.)       had therefore suggested to President Eisenhower that the project ofthe Bermuda Meeting, which he had been obliged to postpone inJuly, should now be revived.   The President had favoured this plan,though he was unable to give a final answer until his Secretary ofState returned to Washington.   An invitation had therefore beenThe Foreign Secretary said that, if the United States Governmentcould be persuaded to agree to some deferment of the presentation of the agreed proposals in Rome and Belgrade, it would be wise to try to persuade the Yugoslav Government to continue to deferpublishing their own proposals for a meeting of Ambassadors byindicating to them that, if it had not been for the recent disorders,the three Powers would by now have put forward proposals whichwould have been likely to have been acceptable to them in certain respects and that it was hoped that the situation would soon permit the resumption by the three Powers of the course which they had hadin mind when the disorders occurred.The following further aspects of the matter were covered in thecourse of discussion:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he felt some doubt about the wisdom of allowing the Italian Government to appoint a Director for the Port of Trieste, having regard to the intention ofthe three Powers to require arrangements to be made to assure freeaccess to, and unrestricted use of, the facilities of the Port.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he himself felt some doubt about the proposal to invite the Italian Government toappoint an official to serve in the Office of the Chiefs of Staff. Theproposals as a whole were, however, acceptable to General Winterton.(b) It was important that everything possible should be done toemphasise the Anglo-American character of the present regime in theFree Territory. The projected visit of Admiral Radford would be helpful from this point of view and would be unlikely to cause offence to the Yugoslav Government provided the circumstances in whichthe visit was taking place were explained to them in advance.(c) It was agreed that no objection need be raised to the forth-coming routine visit of three British frigates to Trieste, provided that instructions were issued to ensure that entertainment and hospitalitywere kept to a minimum.(d) The Foreign Secretary read to the Cabinet the draft of thestatement which he proposed to make in reply to Questions to beput to him in the House of Commons later that day.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make a further effort to persuade the United States Government to agree to the deferment of soundings for a conference in Rome andBelgrade on the lines proposed in Washington telegramNo. 2429 of 7th November.(2) Agreed that, if the United States Government should insist on proceeding forthwith with such soundings, we should join them in doing so.

It now seemed likely that definite agreement would be reached within the next 24 hours to hold this tripartite meeting in Bermuda from 4th-8th December, It might be possibleto make an official announcement to this effect in the course of thefollowing day.The Cabinet-^Endorsed the initiative which the Prime Minister had takento bring about an early meeting of Heads of Governmentsof the United States, United Kingdom and France.
