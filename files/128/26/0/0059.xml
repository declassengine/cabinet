Atomic Energy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 30thConclusions,Minute 7.)Paymaster-General&apos;mission toAustralia.1. The Prime Minister welcomed the Paymaster-General onhis return from Australia, and invited him to make a preliminaryreport on the results of his mission.The Paymaster-General said that he had not been able to reach any firm agreement with the Australian Government about thedisposal of uranium produced in Australia. Soon after his arrival in Canberra the Press had disclosed the purpose of his visit; and, inview of the forthcoming elections, Australian Ministers had beennervous of entering into any firm commitments. He had been unableto persuade them to do more than give him an aide-memoire of theirviews.On his return journey he had had useful talks in Washingtonabout the exchange of intelligence regarding the type of bombs nowbeing produced in the Soviet Union. The Americans seemedgenuinely anxious to find some way of making their information available to us without exposing themselves to a charge of con-travening the McMahon Act.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Paymaster-General, and invited him to submit a written report on the results of hisvisits to Australia and the United States.Trieste. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the strong(Previous        reactions of the Yugoslav and Italian Governments, it would probablyReference:      be necessary to modify the Anglo-American proposals for a de factoC.C. (53) 57th   settlement of the Trieste problem.   He was considering the possibilityConclusions.    of handing over the civil administration of Zone A to the Italians,Minute 4.)       while Allied troops remained in the Zone.   This might be a first step towards a more lasting solution, but there were technical difficulties about it.   It would not relieve us of the burden of maintaining troopsin Trieste, though their numbers might perhaps be reduced at a later stage.The difficulty in putting forward in Parliament an effectivedefence of the original Anglo-American plan was that we were notat liberty to make it plain that we regarded it as a final settlement ofthe dispute and had so presented it privately to the Italian Govern-ment. He still hoped to persuade the Americans to agree that ourreal intentions should be made public, for otherwise the ItalianGovernment would continue to imply that they regarded theirassumption of responsibility for Zone A as no more than a first instalment.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Territorial 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignWaters. Secretary (C. (53) 277) proposing that the United Kingdom Govern-previous ment should adhere to the traditional method of delimiting territorialReference: waters from low-water mark and should make every effort to rallyC.C. (52) 74th international opinion to this point of view; and a memorandum by conclusions, the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 287) pointing out that a minute 5.) decision to this effect would injure the inshore fishing interests inScotland.The Foreign Secretary said that he was now convinced that thebest way to safeguard our interests as a naval and maritime Powerand the interests of our deep-sea fishing fleets, which caught thegreater part of our fish, would be to adhere to the traditional method
hits CoEgypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:CC. (53) 58thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the United kingdom delegation in Cairo had suggested a modification of that part of theirlatest instructions (approved by the Cabinet on 15th October) which dealt with the right of British technicians in the Base to wear uniform.The formula now suggested by the United Kingdom Delegation read as follows:  &quot; Outside the Base area, and when off duty within it, british personnel will wear plain clothes.   When on duty in the base of delimiting territorial waters from low-water mark. It was now known that the United States Government intended to advocate thiscourse and were anxious that we should do the same. He recognisedthat this would not be acceptable to Scottish in-shore fishing interests,but he felt that our adoption of the base-line method would seem tojustify the fisheries policy of the Iceland Government, against whichwe were now protesting, and would make it impossible for us to dissuade other countries from adopting unreasonable methods ofdelimiting their territorial waters. He therefore proposed that apublic statement should be made at an early date to the effect thatwe would make no change in our method of delimiting territorial waters and that thereafter we should do our best, in concert with theUnited States and other Powers, to influence world opinion in favourof resisting encroachments on the high seas.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a decision to this effect would be very much against the interests of Scottish inshorefishermen, who were responsible for about one-third of the totalcatch of white fish. It would lead to considerable political difficulties and to a revival of the complaint that Scottish interests were sacrificedto those of England and Wales.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) The delimitation of territorial waters was a matter of con-siderable importance to the Colonies, but the majority would benefit from adherence to the present method. Amohg commonwealth countries, India and Pakistan were in favour of the base-line method,but the rest would probably follow the lead of the United Kingdom.(h) The decision would be easier to defend politically if, before it was announced, we had persuaded the Iceland Government to referour fisheries dispute with them to The Hague Court. So far, the Iceland Government had refused to do so until the ban on the landing of Iceland fish in this country was removed. It seemed possible that this ban might be brought to an end by the activitiesof Mr. Dawson, who was attempting to market Iceland fish in thiscountry despite the landing-ban. It might, therefore, be as well to wait for a week or two before making any public announcement.The Prime Minister said that no decision need be taken for two weeks, but in the meantime the Foreign Secretary would be free toproceed with the drafting of the necessary documents and public statements on the assumption that we should adhere to the traditionalmethod of delimiting territorial waters.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the United Kingdom Governmentshould advocate adherence to the traditional methods ofdelimiting territorial waters from low-water mark.(2) Agreed that no announcement to this effect should be madefor the time being; and invited the Foreign Secretary, after further consultation with the Secretary of State forScotland, to bring the matter before the Cabinet again inthe first week of November.
. installations or in transit between them they will normally wearworking dress. However, the Egyptian Government accepts inprinciple that they may wear Service uniform and that they will do so occasionally (or on occasions). These personnel may carry a weapon for their personnel protection.&quot;In discussion the following points were made:-(a) The Secretary of State for War pointed out that during thewinter months the working dress worn in the Base was in fact battledress and that, if the suggested wording were adopted, it could be interpreted as meaning that British soldiers in the Base could wearbattle dress only on occasions. It was pointed out in reply that,as the sole object of this particular clause was to satisfy Egyptiansusceptibilities, it would be better to leave the definitions of uniform and working dress in vague terms.(b) It was generally felt that the phrase &quot; on occasions &quot; or&quot; occasionally &quot; was liable to misunderstanding and that it would bebetter to substitute for it the words &quot; when so directed.&quot;(c) Further drafting amendments were also approved.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom Delegation in Cairo to press for the inclusion in a defence agreement of a provision on the wearing of uniformin the following terms: &quot; Outside the Base area, and whenoff duty within it, British personnel will wear civilian clothes.When on duty in the Base installations or in transit betweenthem they will normally wear working dress. However, theEgyptian Government accepts in principle that they maywear Service uniform and that they will do so when sodirected. They may carry a weapon for their personalprotection.&quot;5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 286) containing a statement of the objectives to be aimed at in the Political Conference on Korea. This had been drawnup as a basis for an exchange of views with the Governments of the older Commonwealth countries, the United States and France.The Cabinet (1) Approved the statement in C. (53) 286 of the objectives to be aimed at in the Political Conference on Korea.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain how far this state-ment would be acceptable to the Governments of the olderCommonwealth countries, the United States and France.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (C. (53) 288) proposing that an immediate announcement shouldbe made of the Governmenfs decision that processed milk, butter,margarine, cheese and cooking fats should be freed from control inthe course of 1954.The Minister of Food said that on 12th October the economic policy Committee had decided in principle that these products shouldbe freed from control in 1954. On the same day, in the course ofgeneral discussions on future arrangements for the marketing ofagricultural products, the representatives of the National FarmersUnions were informed of this decision as it had a bearing on the
Certification 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerand Detention pf Health (C. (53)291) seeking authority to recommend the appoint-of Mental ment of a Royal Commission to review the law on the certificationPatients. and detention of mental patients.The Minister of Health said that the law on these matters neededbringing up to date and codifying and it seemed right that, following the precedents of the Acts of 1913 and 1930, the framing of legislation should be preceded by an enquiry by a Royal Commission, theappointment of which should also help to allay the public anxietyaroused by certain recent individual cases. The Commission^ pro-posed terms of reference had been agreed with other ministers concerned.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the Ministersproposal had been considered by the Home Affairs Committee, whichhad unanimously agreed to recommend it for approval by the Cabinet.possible restoration of some of the powers of the Milk marketing boards. The farmers were now discussing among themselves theresults of their consultations with Ministers and it was probable that,as a result, news of this decision on milk products would become more widely known. It would be embarrassing to the Government, in the irrelations with the food trades, if the news of this decision, which affected them far more closely than it did the farmers, reached themfor the first time as a result of a leakage from the farmers&apos; represen-tatives. The Minister therefore proposed that he should nowannounce publicly his intention to decontrol processed milk in the spring of 1954 and butter, margarine, cheese and cooking fats in theearly summer of that year.The Minister of Labour said that those concerned in wage negotiations would be quick to deduce from this announcement thatthese foods would cease to be subsidised and that their retail price would rise. He hoped, therefore, that it would be made clear, in any announcement, that the decision involved no immediate change in food prices and that it was too early to judge what the eventual effecton food prices might be.In further discussion the Cabinet were reminded that the farmers&apos;representatives had been informed that no public statement wouldbe made about the decision to decontrol these foods while they were considering the proposal that some of the powers of the Milk Market-ing Boards might be restored. It would be a breach of this under-standing with the farmers if a public announcement were now madeon the lines proposed by the Minister of Food. Some Ministersalso suggested that the decision might have to be reconsidered in thelight of the farmers&apos; views on the restoration of the powers of the milk Marketing Boards. As against this, the Minister of Food andother Ministers pointed out that the decision had been taken on its merits without reference to the views of the farmers&apos; representatives.The general conclusion of the Cabinet was that, though no public announcement should be made for the time being, the decision whichhad been made known to the farmers&apos; representatives should be similarly communicated to the food trades directly concerned, eventhough this increased the risk that the decision would become generally known.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Food to inform the food tradesdirectly concerned, in confidence, that he intended todecontrol processed milk in the spring of 1954 and butter,margarine, cheese and cooking fats in the early summer of1954.
Tariff Policy.&quot; No-New-Preference &quot;Rule.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 50thConclusions,Minute 8.)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (53) 283) and the Foreign Secretary(C. (53) 292) about the attitude which the Government should adoptif they should fail to secure any modification of the rule of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) prohibiting Common-wealth countries from increasing margins of preference in their tradewith one another.The President of the Board of Trade said that there was stillsome prospect that the general waiver of the &quot; no-new-preference &quot;rule which the Cabinet had authorised him to seek to obtain wouldbe accorded. The Government should, however, be ready to take appropriate action at once if the final decision on this issue shouldbe unfavourable, in order that they should not appear to be actingonly as a result of the public pressure to which they would undoubtedly be subjected. It would be politically impracticable tocarry legislation to raise duties on imports from commonwealth countries, as the provisions of the G.A.T.T. would require us to do ifwe increased the duties on the foreign imports in question. Nor didhe think it would be practicable to continue to rely indefinitely onquota restrictions, which we were only entitled to use if we were in balance of payments difficulties and which the Government had undertaken, in response to the representations of the national farmers Unions (N.F.U.s), to replace by tariffs. The course which he favoured was to remove the quota restrictions and to make thenecessary tariff increases without making the corresponding increases in rates of duty on Commonwealth products which would be requiredby the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule. We were at liberty to make thenecessary tariff increases, but failure on our part to make correspond-ing increases in the rates of duty on Commonwealth products wouldinvolve a technical breach of the G.A.T.T. Almost all the membersof the G.A.T.T. had at one time or another committed breaches of theAgreement and the United States Government, in particular, werefollowing certain policies which violated it flagrantly. He could not accept the Foreign Secretary&apos;s alternative proposal that we shouldresort to negotiation for waivers in respect of individual commodities,pending a general review of the G.A.T.T., as there was no real prospect that any such individual waivers would, in fact, be obtainable.The Foreign Secretary said that he had made this proposalbecause of his extreme reluctance to agree to our committing a clearbreach of an international Agreement to which we were a party. Itwould in his view be particularly unfortunate if we were to announcepublicly that we intended to violate the Agreement immediately after we had failed to obtain by negotiation the modification of the Agree-ment which we desired.Discussion revealed that the Cabinet inclined to the view that opinion on this issue within the Conservative Party and amongst the farming community might make it necessary to adopt the coursefavoured by the President of the Board of Trade if a general waiver of the &quot; no-new-preference&quot; rule were not accorded to us; indeed,the Government might well be subjected in that event to considerable pressure to withdraw from the G.A.T.T. altogether, a course whichwould need to be most carefully considered as its implications wouldbe much more serious. At the same time the Cabinet felt that sucha course of action should not be decided upon before consideration had been given to the question how it might best be presented publiclywith a view to minimising the technical breach of the G.A.T-T. whichThe Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to recommend to The Queen thata Royal Commission should be appointed with the terms ofreference proposed in paragraph 5 of C. (53) 291 and, subjectto Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, to announce the Commission^appointment. -
V 6 oTariff Policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:CC. (53) 55thConclusions,Minute 9.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 293) seeking authority to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation to the current session of the contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) to abstain from voting on the question of Japan&apos;s pro-visional association with the Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that on 6th october the Cabinet had authorised him to seek a compromise solution of this problem which would avoid Japan&apos;s provisional association with theAgreement. It now seemed clear that the Australian Governmentwere not willing to agree to any such compromise and in these circum-stances he wished to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation atGeneva not to entertain the proposed compromise any longer butto abide by their earlier instructions to abstain from voting on thequestion of Japan&apos;s provisional association.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposed compromise solution had been devised largely to meet our point of view and wouldnot prejudice any of our vital interests. By adopting the course recommended by the President of the Board of Trade we should belikely to impair our relations with Japan and cause annoyance to theUnited States Government without obtaining any countervailingadvantage. The United States Government were continuing to exertpressure upon the Australian Government to agree to a compromiseand it would be unfortunate if we were to choose this moment to issuerigid instructions in a contrary sense to our delegation in Geneva.The Lord Privy Seal said that it would be desirable that weshould send a further message to the Australian Government to clear up certain points of doubt arising from their earlier communications.This opportunity might be taken to ask them to reconsider theirattitude to a compromise solution, while making it clear that wehad every intention of keeping in step with them in this matter.There was general support for this suggestion.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to send an urgent message to theAustralian Government to the effect that, while the UnitedKingdom Government firmly intended to keep in step withthem on this issue, they must ask them to consider againwhether the two Governments would not be better advised to agree to some compromise solution which would not prejudice their essential interests.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th October, 1953.it would involve. Thus, advantage might be taken of the facts thatthe tariff increases would in themselves involve no breach of theG.A.T.T. and that the increases in duties on corresponding Common-wealth products without which a breach would be committed wouldinvolve legislation and could not therefore in any case be put intoeffect immediately.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the proposed general waiver of the &quot;no-new-preference &quot; rule of the G.A.T.T. in our favour werenot agreed to, the Government would have seriously toconsider making certain tariff increases without thecorresponding increases in duties on Commonwealthgoods which would be required by the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider urgently, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, how such a decision might best be presented publicly with a view to minimisingthe technical breach of the G.A.T.T. which would thereby be involved.
