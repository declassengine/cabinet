Armed Forces.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 28thConclusions,Minute 3)medical services.2. The Cabinet considered a memoiandum by the Secretary ofState for War (C (53) 161) drawing attention to the serious shortageof medical officers in the Army and proposing the appointment of anindependent committee of enquiry to consider how best to ensure that effective medical services would be provided for the Armed Forcesin the future.The Secretary of State for War said that the pay and conditionsof service of medical officers in the Armed Forces had recently been reviewed by an inter-departmental committee, whose recommenda-tions were summarised in C. (53) 161. These recommendations were acceptable to the Navy and Air Force; but he was satisfied that theywould not solve the Army&apos;s problem, and his view was shared by theArmy Medical Advisory Board. He therefore proposed that, withoutprejudice to the acceptance of those recommendations as an interim measure, an independent committee should be appointed to undertake a more radical examination of the problem and to devise means of ensuring that the three Services would be able to rely on effectivemedical services in the future.The Minister of Defence and The Minister of Health supported this proposal.The Lord President said that he had no doubt, from his experi-ence in dealing with the allocation of medical man-power in the last war, that the maintenance of a separate medical corps by each of thethree Services led to a waste of resources. He believed that, especially as a National Health Service had now been created, there was need fora radical enquiry into the future organisation of medical services forthe Armed Forces.The Chancellor of the Exchequer regretted that the War office were not content with the recommendations of the inter-departmentalcommittee, which were acceptable to the other two Service Depart-ments. He would be most reluctant to sanction medical services forthe Army more costly than those provided for the Navy and AirForce. He would welcome an opportunity of further discussion,with the Ministers concerned, of the purposes of the further enquirynow proposed.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister ofDefence and the Secretary of State for War, in consultationwith the First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary ofState for Air, to draw up terms of reference for an inde-pendent committee of enquiry to consider how best to ensurethat effective medical services were available for the armed forces, in peace and war; and to discuss the composition of the proposed committee.Coal.(previous reference:C.C.(53) 24thConclusions,Minute 2.)Date of st. Leger.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and theMinister of Fuel and Power (C. (53) 173) proposing that the Jockey-Club should be urged to arrange for the St. Leger to be run this year on Saturday, 12th September, instead of Wednesday, 9th September.In discussion it was agreed that, as eight years had passed sincethe end of the war, the Jockey Club should in principle be free to revert to the traditional practice of running this race on a Wednesday.Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
In view, however, of the substantial loss of coal production which hadalready been sustained this year on account of the Coronation, itwould be justifiable to ask the Stewards to continue for one further year the war-time arrangement of holding this race on a Saturday.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange for theStewards of the Jockey Club to be informed that it was theview of the Government that the St. Leger should this yearbe run on a Saturday.television development.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (53) 170) covering the latest draft of the proposed statement ofGovernment policy on television development, prepared in the lightof discussion in the Television Committee, and a further note(C. (53) 171) reporting the views of the Foreign Secretary onsponsored television.The Chief Whip said that special enquiries had been made toascertain the current state of opinion on sponsored television amongstGovernment supporters in the House of Commons. These indicated that 180 (including Ministers) were in favour of it; that 43 wereagainst it; and that 15 were doubtful. The attitude of 67 was un-known, though none of these was thought to be strongly opposed toit. Among the 43 known to be against it, there were at least 12 who could not be relied upon to vote in favour of it even if a three-lineWhip were issued. While there had been no pronounced shift ofopinion in recent weeks, there was undoubtedly a greater feeling of uncertainty, resulting in part from constituents&apos; letters hostile tosponsored television. A substantial proportion of the 43 opponentsand of the 15 whose attitude was in doubt could probably be persuaded to support the Government in the division lobby and itwas his , personal opinion that, if the issue went to a division, theGovernment would avoid defeat. Nevertheless, when account wastaken of the fact that the Liberals would not vote with the Govern-ment, the possibility of the Governments defeat could not be excluded.It had been suggested that the issue might be left to a free vote.He felt bound to warn the Cabinet that this course would be likelyto have very serious effects upon Party unity for some time time tocome. The supporters of sponsored television did not regard this asan issue of conscience suitable for a free vote: they looked on it asa choice between monopoly and competition and, as such, essentially political issue. If the Government allowed it to be determined bya free vote, they would regard this as a betrayal of an important Partyprinciple. A small element had even threatened to ignore the Partywhip on other issues if it were not imposed in respect of sponsoredtelevision. Even a complete reversal of policy, difficult though itwould be, would be likely in his view to have less serious effects, sofar as concerned Government supporters in the House of Commons,than a decision to leave the matter to a free vote.The Home Secretary said that he believed that sponsored tele-vision was favoured by a majority of Government supporters, notonly in the House of Commons but in the country and, in particular,among the owners of television sets. The introduction of sponsoredtelevision was likely on balance to work out to the advantage ofthe Conservative Party in the long run; and a Government retreaton this issue at this juncture would have a most damaging effect onits prestige, which had been greatly strengthened by its apparentability to carry out its declared policies.Several Ministers expressed support for this view.The Prime Minister said that it would be most unfortunate ifthe Government were to risk defeat in Parliament in an effort to carry
through proposals which were unpalatable to respected elementsboth amongst Government supporters and in the country generally.This seemed to him to be the sort of issue which could reasonably have been regarded as a matter of conscience rather than of party politics. Surely the Government would be justified, even now, intaking the line that on this account and in view of the evidence of strong feeling on the matter in the country the issue should be leftto be decided by a free vote in Parliament?The Lord President said that, if the issue ever came to a vote in the House of Lords, it was very doubtful whether the Governmentwould be able to secure a majority in favour of sponsored television.He would therefore have preferred to resort to a free vote, whichwould in his view be fully justifiable. Though this might causedifficulties in the Party in the immediate future, he believed that inthe long run it would bring credit to the Government.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was disposed to agree withthe view expressed by the Lord President.  &apos;The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that considerations of party unity seemed to preclude the complete abandonment at thisstage of the principle of&quot; introducing a measure of competition intotelevision. It did not, however, seem necessary that the Governmentshould choose this unpropitious moment to announce their deter-mination to proceed with sponsored television without explainingmore fully than in the draft statement annexed to C. (53) 170 the case for their policy and the safeguards to which it would be made subject.He therefore favoured a statement reiterating the Governmentssupport for the principle of competition but adding that they hadbeen impressed by the recent evidence of the risks of its abuse and explaining how they proposed to guard against these.The Postmaster-General said that he would welcome a revisionof the draft statement on those lines. At the present moment thecase for what the Government had in mind was tending to go bydefault.Further discussion showed a general desire for some measure.of delay before making any final announcement on television policyin order that public opinion, which had been stirred by the televisingof the Coronation, might have time to settle down and an oppor-tunity had been obtained to explain more fully the safeguards whichcould be applied to prevent abuse of any facilities accorded to com-mercial companies. It was also recognised to be desirable, if possible,to avoid the issue being forced to a division in Parliament in theimmediate future. The Cabinet recalled that the occasion for afurther announcement of Government policy was the proposed publication of the B.B.C.&apos;s plans for the next ten years, of the reportof the Television Advisory Committee and of the government&apos;s decision to allow the B.B.C. to proceed on 1st July with projects which would make television available to another 6-7 million people.In practice it did not appear necessary that publication of the B.B.C.&apos;future plans should be accompanied by any further statement on theGovernments policy, while the decision to allow the B.B.C. toproceed forthwith with certain development projects might perhaps be put into operation without any full statement on the lines of thedraft annexed to C. (53) 170. The more compelling reasons for anearly statement of the Governments intentions in regard to sponsoredtelevision were, however, the growing restiveness amongst Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons imregard to this matterand the belief in the Party that, if the Government intended topersevere with their plan to introduce sponsored television, it was important that the public should have had, before the next GeneralElection, some practical experience of what sponsored television hadto offer. While the Cabinet recognised the force of these arguments in favour of an early statement of Government policy, they felt that
no comprehensive statement should be made, if this could be avoided,until they were in a position to disclose fully the basis on which itwas proposed to allow a limited measure of competition in television and the safeguards to which sponsored television would be subject.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, in con-sultation with the Postmaster-General, (i) for how longa full announcement of the Governmenfs policy on tele-vision could be deferrred; and (ii) the form which the- announcement should take.(2) Agreed that no further delay need be imposed on the publica-tion by the B.B.C. of their proposed statement on thefuture development of their broadcasting services.East/west trade.British shipping in the ChinaTrade.(previous reference:C.C.(53) 34thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (C. (53) 175) covering a draft statement designed to rebutrecent American criticisms of British activities in the China trade.The Minister of State said that he proposed to make the statement that day in answer to two Parliamentary Questions. He wouldincorporate in it a few amendments which had been suggested by her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington.The Prime Minister said that the proposed statement was asatisfactory justification of our policy, but he thought it was too longto be made as an oral reply to Parliamentary Questions. He would prefer that it should be circulated in the Official Report.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the terms of the draft statement on Trade with china annexed to C. (53) 175, subject to the amendments suggested by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the statement tobe circulated in the Official Report and issued to the Press.Raw Cotton. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-Importing and dent of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Materials (C. (53) 164)Marketing. reporting the findings of the Review Committee appointed to consider(Previous whether any change would be desirable in the obligations and dutiesReference: at present imposed on the Raw Cotton Commission with respect toC.C(53) .13th the supply of cotton to the United Kingdom cotton industry and theConclusions, provision of cover for spinners buying cotton on their own account.Minuk- 6 &apos; The President of the Board of Trade said that the Review Com-mittee proposed broadly that the arrangements which had prevailedin 1952-53 should be continued for the next buying&quot; season. It was,however, their unanimous view that it was undesirable in principlethat public funds should be used to provide cover for private trade,and that urgent enquiry should be made into means of providingcover based on private funds. He proposed that the Committee&apos;srecommendations for the 1953-54 cotton-buying season should beaccepted and that he should announce this in reply to a parliamentary question. He would point out that the arrangements after the nextbuying season would be the subject of early discussion with the trade interests concerned, but that the Government accepted in principle the unanimous view of the Committee that it was undesirable thatcover for private trade should be provided at the risk of public funds.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to publish the report of the Cotton Import (Review) Committee andto make an announcement in Parliament in the terms whichhe proposed.
ColonialDevelopmentand Welfare.(previous reference:C.C.(52)70thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (53) .167) on future assistance for Colonial development and welfare after the termination of the present Colonial Develop-ment and Welfare Acts on 31st March, 1956.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet needed more time toconsider this matter and asked that the Colonial Secretary shoulddefer his proposed announcement in Parliament until the following week.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume discussion of C. (53) 167 at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th June. 1953.
