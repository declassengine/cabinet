Judges&apos;, 1.   The Prime Minister said that on the previous day he had dis-Salaries.      . : cussed with the Executive of the 1922 Committee the Governments(Previous        proposals for handling the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill.  He had been reference:   .  impressed by the strength of their opposition to the Bill.   ThoughC.C. (53) 2lst   they were ready to agree in principle that the Judges&apos; remunerationConclusions,    should be improved, they were very critical of the proposal to do this minute 2.)       by the grant of a tax-free allowance.  It became clear from the dis-cussion that the Government would find great difficulty in carrying the Second Reading of the Bill on the basis contemplated by the.      Cabinet in their discussion on 20th March; and, after consulting theLord Privy Seal, the Prime Minister had come to the conclusion thatthey must postpone the Parliamentary proceedings on the Bill until after Easter, in order that they might have, more time in which todiscuss with their supporters the method by which the Judges&apos;remuneration should be improved.   Later in the evening he had. &quot;       learned that news of this decision had reached the Press, and he had therefore issued a formal announcement to the effect that the SecondReading of the Bill would be postponed until after the Easter recess.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers conclusion and his action in announcing it. * ,The Lord Privy Seal said that he would have to make a statement&quot;     &apos;. 1  &apos; in the House of Commons that.afternoon about the alteration in thebusiness for .26th March.  He would take that opportunity of making.&apos;.&apos;! it clear that the Government still considered that an increase in the- Judges&apos;remuneration was overdue and that they would proceed with.,&apos; legislation in due course. It was for consideration whether he should- v        say that the extent of the increase should be that declared in the Bill.&apos; For, if a different method had to be adopted, it might not be possibleto secure for the Judges the same net benefit as they would have.   derived from the tax-free allowance proposed in the Bill.  After dis-.    .&apos; cussion it was agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should refer to theGovernments determination to secure an increase in the Judges--&apos;    7    remuneration &quot; of the order proposed in the Bill.&quot;The Cabinet--     . - . , .(J) Took note that the Second Reading of the Judges&apos; Remunera-tion Bill would be postponed until after the Easter recess.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to make a formal announcement to that effect in the House of Commons that afternoon.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for further discussions to be held with Government supporters afterthe Easter recess on the. method by which the remuneration of the Judges should be improved.Parliament. 2.

(52) 104thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. In pursuance of the Cabinets decision of .18th December,1952, the Minister of Defence had circulated on 20th February amemorandum (C. (53) 69) recommending a public announcement thatthere would be no further prosecutions of men who deserted fromthe Armed Forces between 3rd September, 1939 and 16th August,1945; that those wishing to take advantage of this amnesty should report in writing to a Service authority, when they would receive a protection certificate and be transferred to the appropriate Reserve;and that those who claimed the benefit of the amnesty would not1 be prosecuted for certain offences consequential upon their desertion,such as subsequent fraudulent enlistment or the possession of identitydocuments in a false name. The Prime Minister had approved theseproposals, and had made an announcement to this effect in the Houseof Commons on 23rd February.44015-1 b 2
. The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum bv the Ministerof Defence (C. (53) 106) reporting that, of 1,500 men who had so farclaimed the benefit of this amnesty, about 300 were not entitled to benefit by it as they had deserted at times outside the limiting dates.There was no doubt that many of them had made their application in the mistaken belief that they -were covered by the amnesty, and itwould seem harsh to take advantage of their mistake and to takecourt-martial proceedings against them for desertion. There were three possible methods of dealing with this situation: (i) to try thesemen by court-martial, but to mitigate their sentences on review;(ii) to ignore their admission of desertion; or (iii) to invite them to sign a confession of desertion, but to dispense with trial by court-martial and to place them on the appropriate Reserve.The Minister of Defence said that there was no satisfactory solution of this problem, On the whole he thought that the thirdof the courses set out in his memorandum was the least objectionable..He recognised, however, that this would have the effect of extending the amnesty and would thus involve a risk that the Government wouldbe pressed to extend it still further.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable to destroy the letters of admission received from men who were not entitled to benefit by the amnesty, and to take no action against thembased on those admissions. This, however, would not benefit menwho, believing themselves to be covered by the amnesty, had not onlywritten to a Service authority but had otherwise disclosed themselvesin a manner which might expose them to the risk of proceedings fordesertion. It might be preferable to say merely that each case wouldbe considered on its merits, the man&apos;s confession being taken intoaccount as a mitigation of his original offence/- The Prime Minister suggested that the various possible coursesshould be further considered by a small Cabinet Committee. ThisCommittee should also consider two other classes of case, namely,(i) men who had served well during the war but had deserted after-wards; and (ii) men who had deserted before the war, but had subsequently rejoined the Forces and served well during the war. - ,The Cabinet  &apos; , &apos;.(1) Appointed a Committee composed of-Lord President (In the Chair);Home Secretary; ,Minister of Defence;Attorney-General.to consider, with the Service Ministers, how best to dealwith the erroneous claims described in C. (53) 106, andwhether the amnesty should also extend to the two furtherclasses of case mentioned by the Prime Minister in the cabinets discussion.(2) Invited this Committee to complete their review in time foran announcement of the Governments decision to bemade early in the following week.Armed Forces. 4.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofOfficers&apos; Defence (C. (53) 99) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 105)Retired Pay. on a proposal for improving the retired pay of officers who retired. from the Armed Forces between the twowars.Reference: The Minister of Defence said that among Government supportersC.C. (52) 104th . in both Houses of Parliament there was strong, support for the viewConclusions, that officers who had retired from the Armed Forces before the intro-Minute3.) duction of the current pensions; code in September 1,950 should be
given the benefit of the new rates of retired pay..- Officers who werepensioned between the wars and did not even obtain the benefitof the improved code introduced in 1945 were suffering considerablehardship; and a special claim was made on behalf of those senior&apos;officers whose retired pay had actually been reduced in 1935. In that,year the standard rates of retired pay had been stabilised at 9\ percent, below the 1919 rates. There were about 350 senior officers whohad not had any part of that cut restored, and between 5,000 and 6,000for whom only a part of the cut had been restored. The minister suggested that the current agitation might be checked if the pensions of those officers were now restored to the 1919 rates. The annual cost would be about  210,000 initially but it would diminish rapidly as most of the beneficiaries were by now elderly men.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of the exchequer was most reluctant to accept this proposal. It would involve a depar-ture from the principle that any additional funds available for service pensions should be used for the relief of hardship. It would conferrelatively large benefits on senior officers compared with thoseconferred on officers of lower rank;&apos; And it would certainly provokepressure for similar concessions to&apos; other State servants who weredrawing pensions lower than those currently awarded. Some senior civil Servants, in particular, had suffered the same reduction in pen-sion rates in 1935; and, if the proposed concession were made toretired officers, it would be difficult to refuse to extend it to them.In discussion the view was also expressed that the concessionproposed by the Minister of Defence would not satisfy those Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons who were pressing forgeneral improvement in the pensions of officers who retiredbefore 1950.The Cabinet- .   i       . , &apos;(1) Invited the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for amemorandum to be circulated on the probable repercussions-sions of the proposal put forward by the Minister ofDefence in C. (53) 99, stating in particular the estimated1 cost of extending the same benefits to other State servants in similar circumstances.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting when the Chancellor of the Exchequer could be present.. &apos;Historic jBuildings Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (53) 97) seeking endorsement of the conclusions of aCabinet Committee which had re-examined the policy: underlying theproposed Bill for the preservation of historic buildings. -The Lord President said that his anxiety about the Bill, whichhad led to the re-examination of its policy by the Lord Chancellor^Committee, was based upon the knowledge of the attitude of owners of historic houses which he had acquired from serving on committees of the National Trust and other similar bodies. As the bill&apos;s pro-visions were to be permissive,, the co-operation of owners would be essential. - They would be suspicious of accepting Government grants,which might turn out to be the prelude to the compulsory acquisitionof their houses by the State. They did, however, feel entitled to some government assistance as they were ; expected to maintain theirproperties as national monuments but were ^prevented from doing
so by present rates of taxation. There was a wide measure of support,even in the Labour Party, for the view that historic houses should sofar as possible be maintained in private occupation. There was nodoubt that it was the occupied houses, rather than those which hadbeen elegantly embalmed by the Ministry of Works, which particu-larly appealed to overseas visitors, who made an important contribu-tion to our foreign exchange earnings. He did not press for expenditure greatly in excess of the sum which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had agreed to, make available. \ But, in spite of theCommittee&apos;.? report, he remained strongly in favour of assistance byway of tax reliefs in respect of approved expenditure on the fabricof historic houses. The policy underlying the present Bill wasdangerous in principle and seemed likely to be ineffective in. practice.It would doubtless be uncontroversial, but this was hardly surprisingsince it was based on the policy favoured by the Labour Party when in office. -   .The Lord Chancellor said that the conclusion to which his committee had reluctantly come was that the limits to the amount ofmoney which could be spared for this purpose precluded any approach to the problem on the lines favoured by the Lord President.The limited suras likely to be available in the near future would bebetter spent in the form of grants, but the Bill was so drawn thatthe scale of grants to owner-occupiers could be increased without difficulty if and when more money became available.The Minister of Works said that tax reliefs would not serve for houses to be acquired under Clause 4 of the Bill with money to bemade available from the Land Fund, or for houses whose owners&apos;gross incomes were insufficient for the maintenance of. their propertieseven with the assistance of tax reliefs, or for houses whose ownersmight wish to abandon the attempt to maintain&apos; them even though they had the means to do so. Apart from these practical objections,tax reliefs were open to objections of principle for example, theywould bring greater relief to the richer than to the poorer owner and they were likely to be opposed by some Government supportersas well as by the Opposition.i The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that the sum of money which, the Chancellor of the Exchequer saw his way to make availablefor this purpose in the immediate future could, in his view, be more effectively used by a system of grants than by one of tax reliefs.In discussion the following further points were made:  (a) One serious, if not insuperable, objection to tax reliefs wasthat that they would involve differentiation in taxation, not on thebasis of some readily demonstrable principle, but by administrativeselection.(b) It was suggested that, even if it should be decided to proceed by way of ad hoc grants under the Bill as drafted, grants should so faras possible be made to owner-occupiers rather than for the preservation-tion of houses which were unoccupied or occupied by public bodies.The Prime Minister said that, although the Cabinet clearly feltconsiderable sympathy with the point of view expressed by the lord president, it would be difficult for them to give effect to it in the face of the considered advice of the Cabinet Committee which had investi-gated the problem in detail. Approval, of the policy underlying thepresent Bill need not, however, be taken to preclude future considera-tion of a possible widening of the basis of Government assistance forthe preservation of historic buildings.The Cabinet- &apos;Endorsed the conclusions set out in paragraph 9 of C (53) 97.

The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary oj State forForeign A flairs said that the United States Government had nowindicated that they would prefer not to take part in the suggestedconference on the regulation of flying near the Zonal boundaries inGermany. Our plan for a Conference of the four Powers on thissubject was, therefore, no longer practicable.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that nevertheless GeneralChuikov\s invitation to us to open talks should be accepted withoutfurther delay.The Cabinet  ,Reaffirmed their decision that the Russian suggestion of aconference on the regulation of flying near the Zonalboundaries in Germany should be accepted.Cabinet Office, SAV.
