Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned, for the Whitsuntide recess andfor Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation, from 22nd May until 9th June.Education 2.  The Cabinet were informed that the Roman Catholics,(Miscellaneous although they had been parties to the agreement between the variousProvisions) denominations on which the provisions of this Bill were founded,BiU- had since been attempting to obtain more money for their schoolsby placing a new interpretation upon the correspondence which theyhad originally had with the Minister. An amendment to the bill had been carried against the Government in Committee, the effectof which was to insert certain words which gave the appearance of helping the Roman Catholics but would, in fact, be inoperative.These words might mislead the general public, as their lack of mean-ing could only be established in the light of the provisions of theEducation Act, 1944. An amendment had been tabled to omit these words on the Report Stage of the Bill in the House of Commons that afternoon. Support for this amendment seemed unlikely to be forth-coming either from the Opposition or from certain elements in theConservative Party, and there was thus a possibility that, if the issuewere forced to a division, the Government might be defeated. Thealternative course was for the Government to allow the amendment to be negatived without a division after making it clear that theprovision would in fact be inoperative. But in that event the pro-vision might be removed from the Bill in the House of Lords, andthe House of Commons would then be faced with a difficult positionwhen they came to consider the Lords amendments.The Chief Whip said that there were about sixteen government supporters who could not be relied upon to vote for the amendmentand in these circumstances there could be no assurance that theGovernment would not be defeated if it went to a division.The view of the Cabinet was that the Government ought notto risk defeat on the floor of the House for the sake of preventing the enactment of words which, in fact, possessed no significance.If, as a result of the statement which the Minister of Education wouldbe making at the opening of the debate, it became clear that thoseGovernment supporters who were at present dissatisfied had beenwon over to supporting the amendment the matter could be allowedto go to a division. If, on the other hand, any doubt remained aboutthe outcome of a division, the Government should allow the amend-ment to be negatived, after making it clear that in their view thewords in fact possessed no significance.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Education and the Solicitor-General,on the Report Stage of the Education (Miscellaneous Provi-sions) Bill, to proceed on the lines suggested in the cabinets discussion, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal andthe Chief Whip.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Labour OppositionSalaries of in the House of Commons had asked whether, if they tabled a motionMembers. for the appointment of a Select Committee on the salaries of(Previous Members, the Government would be willing to allow it to be deter-Reference:      mined by a free vote of the House.C.C. (53) 30th In discussion it was agreed that the House should be allowedConclusions, to decide by a free vote whether such a Select Committee should minute 6.)       be appointed.   The Government could not, however, be expectedto give a firm promise to allow a free vote without having seen theterms of the proposed motion.
Judges&apos; Salaries.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 30thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Lord Chancellor said that, in company with the chief whip, he had discussed with the Executive of the 1922 Committeethe Governments proposals for improving the remuneration of the judges Of the High Court. He had found them ready to agree inprinciple that the remuneration of the Judges should be improved,though some of them seemed to think that a net improvement of 1,000 a year might be excessive. They could not, however, be persuaded that it would be right to effect this improvement by themethod of granting a tax-free allowance in addition to salary. Theywould have been willing to consider other concessions, such asincreased allowances for expenses or improved rates of pension.They would have preferred that this matter should not have become the subject of controversy between  the Parties; and they had askedwhether it would not be possible, even now, to find some way of reaching agreement upon it with the Labour Opposition.The Cabinet agreed that in all the circumstances the best coursewould be to adopt the method of an increase in gross salary whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested at their last discussion on 5th May.The Cabinet  -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate fortheir consideration detailed proposals for improving the remuneration of the Judges by an increase in gross salarycoupled with a tax-free allowance for travelling expenses.Monopolies Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 84thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 149) seeking authority to promoteduring the current session an agreed measure to strengthen the monopolies Commission and enable it to speed up its work.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Chairman ofthe Monopolies Commission would be retiring early in 1954, and hewas satisfied that he would be unable to obtain a person of adequatestanding to take his place unless the appointment was made permanent and pensionable. He also wished to enlarge the Commission in orderthat, by working in &quot; panels,&quot; it could pursue several enquiries atthe same time. The Home Affairs Committee had agreed that forthese purposes he should seek to put through an agreed measure the Lord President said that, if a Select Committee were appointed to consider the remuneration of Members of the Houseof Commons, he would find it difficult to resist pressure for a corres-ponding enquiry into the possibility of granting some allowances to Peers in respect of expenses incurred by them in attendance inthe House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chief Whip to inform the Leaders of theLabour Opposition that the Government would be dis-posed in principle to allow a free vote on a motion forthe appointment of a Select Committee to review the remuneration of Members of the House of Commons,but must reserve their final decision until they had seen the terms of the proposed motion.(2) Agreed that, if a Select Committee were appointed toconsider the remuneration of Members of the House ofCommons, the Government should not resist a proposalfor a similar enquiry into the question of allowances forPeers attending the House of Lords.
Tariff Policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:G.C. (53) 8thConclusions,Minute 6.)during the current session, although this would involve shelving theplan to include the nationalised industries within the Commission^scope.In discussion the view was expressed that the Conservative party was so deeply committed to the proposal to bring the nationalised industries within the Commission^ scope that some convincing reasonmust be given for the apparent abandonment of this plan. It could,however, be argued that it would be premature to include this pro-posal in the Bill at a time when the question of control over these industries was being considered by a Select Committee of the Houseof Commons.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to seek toobtain the co-operation of the Opposition in the pro-motion of an agreed Monopolies Bill on the lines proposedin C. (53) 149,(2) Agreed that, if Opposition support were forthcoming, a Billshould be drafted and submitted to the legislation committee.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the BOard of Trade (C. (53) 137), the Minister of State (C. (53) 151)and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C\ (53) 152) about the attitude to be adopted by Her Majesty&apos;s Government,- as a contracting partyto the General Agreement oil Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.), on thereport of the Intersessional Committee on Japan&apos;s application to accede to the Agreement.The President of the Board of Trade said that he agreed withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer that, before any decision was takenin this matter, the issues should be more fully examined on the cabinet&apos;s behalf, but he would prefer that this examination shouldbe carried out by Ministers. Meanwhile he wished to make thefollowing points:  (a) There was, in his view, no doubt that Japan&apos;s accession tothe Agreement would result in damage to our export trade and, there-fore, that our self-interest required her continued exclusion.(h) if this country became a party to Japan&apos;s admission to theAgreement subject to safeguards, legislation of a kind likely to bevery embarrassing to the Government would be unavoidable.(c) It was necessary to set against the Minister of State&apos;s argu-ments for supporting Japaifs application to accede the fact that therewere powerful elements in this country which in certain circumstances might well coalesce to form an anti-Japanese front which could do more damage to Anglo-Japanese relations than any reservations inrespect of Japan which we might make as a contracting party to theG.A.T.T.(d) Any further evidence that the United States was likely to tighten up rather than relax her trade policies would make it stillharder for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to defend in this country andvis-a-vis the South African, Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments the undertaking by us of fresh trading Obligations vis-a-visJapan.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of:  Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),Commonwealth Secretary,Colonial Secretary,President of the Board of Trade,Paymaster-General,Minister of State,to study the problems raised in C. (53) 137, 151 and 152 and tosubmit their recommendations to the Cabinet.
territorial waters :IcelandFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 24thConclusions,Minute 11.)7. The Cabinet had before. them a memorandum by theMinister of State (C. (53) 153) explaining that a complete impassehad now been reached in the Iceland Fisheries dispute and recom-mending that a communication should be addressed to the iceland government to the effect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government proposedto take no further initiative and that it was for the Iceland Govern-ment to make some positive proposal. A statement to the same effect would subsequently be made in Parliament.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (53) 153.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 26thConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the defence negotiations with the Egyptian Govern-ment. A deadlock had been reached over the arrangements for technical supervision of the base installations in the Canal Zone, andthe negotiations were in effect suspended. Meanwhile provocativespeeches were being made by Egyptian Ministers and sporadic attacks on British troops and property in the Canal Zone were increasing. Itwas known that about 1.000 members of the Muslim Brotherhoodhad been organised into parties of 50, each under German leadership,for the purpose of undertaking sabotage and guerilla activities in the canal Zone. The Defence Committee had considered the situationand had authorised certain precautionary measures, including thedespatch of some reinforcements from Malta. It would, however,be unwise to launch the operation for protecting British lives and property in Cairo and Alexandria unless civilians in those cities were clearly seen to be in imminent danger. The Defence Committeewould continue to keep a close watch on developments.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) General Robertson had recommended that for the present no initiative should be taken by us to secure the resumption of thenegotiations. His latest message to the Prime Minister was read tothe Cabinet (Cairo telegram No. 790 of 12th May).(b) The United States Secretary of State, who was now visitingCairo, had made a helpful statement about the attitude of hisGovernment towards the objectives of the negotiations. The cabinet considered whether it would be expedient to bring this specially tothe notice of Parliament. It was recognised, however, that a Parlia-mentary statement about it would provoke numerous questionsdesigned to elicit any points of difference between the United Statesand United Kingdom Governments; and, after discussion, it wasdecided that on this account it would be preferable not to volunteerany further statement at the present time about the attitude of theUnited States Government towards the negotiations.(c) The British military authorities in the Canal Zone would be under increasing pressure to provide information to Press representa-tives. The Minister of Defence undertook to consider, in consultationwith the Minister of State, whether they should be provided with further expert assistance in dealing with the Press.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement and of thepoints raised in the Cabinets discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th May, 1953.
