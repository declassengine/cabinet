British Guiana.        1.. The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs discussion(Previous        on 3rd October there had been much speculation in the Press aboutReference:      the Governmenfs plans for dealing with the political situation inC.C. (53) 54th   British Guiana.   As a result, the element of surprise had now been conclusions,     lost; and, that being so, he thought that an official announcementMinute 4.)       should at once be issued stating that the Government intended to take all necessary steps to restore law and order and to prevent the estab-lishment of a Communist regime in the Colony.   Other Common-wealth Governments and interested foreign Governments should alsobe informed without delay of the action which we were proposing totake and the reasons for it.The Prime Minister added that the fact that the Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies Station had himself sailed inthe cruiser which was carrying the troops from Jamaica to british guiana, and the statement which he had made to the Press on his departure, might have contributed towards the undue Press publicity which had been given to this movement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an official announcement should now be made regarding the Governmenfs plans for handling the poli-tical situation in British Guiana, and invited the colonial secretary to submit a draft announcement for the PrimeMinister&apos;s approval.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to concert with the ForeignOffice and the Commonwealth Relations Office arrange-ments for informing other Commonwealth governments and interested foreign Governments of these plans and ofthe reasons which had made it necessary to put them intooperation.(3) Took note that the First Lord of the Admiralty would submit to the Prime Minister a report on the action of theCommander-in-Chief, America and West Indies Station.Egypt. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptians had shown no(Previous        sign of willingness to adopt a less uncompromising attitude on the reference:       points of difference still outstanding in the defence negotiations.C.C. (53) 54th   They were willing that a suitable reference to the Suez Canal should conclusions,     be included in the preamble to an agreement, but they seemed unlikelyMinute 2.)       to make concessions on any of the other outstanding points.   TheUnited Kingdom Delegation in Cairo had been instructed to make itclear that, although we wanted a reasonable agreement if we could get it, we were not prepared to accept a bad agreement, and that theproposals which they had made in pursuance of the Cabinefs decisionof 16th September represented our final terms.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 47thConclusions,Minute 7.)Sale of ships to soviet bloc.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty (C. (53) 270)proposing a relaxation of existing policy governing the export of ships from the United Kingdom to countries in the Soviet bloc other thanChina.The President of the Board of Trade said that the rules adoptedby the Paris Group, while they prohibited the export of tankers,whaling factories and large icebreakers to these countries, allowed the export of merchant ships and fishing vessels subject to limits of numbers.   We ourselves, however, had been applying a more
stringent policy, by which shipbuilders in the United Kingdom wereprohibited from accepting any orders from these countries for -merchant ships and fishing vessels. The Admiralty were satisfied thatthere was no longer any strategic reason to maintain this completeembargo; and they considered that, as some shipyards in this country would soon be getting short of work, we should fall into line with theother countries of the Paris Group and resume the export of merchant ships and fishing vessels to these countries within the limits allowed by the rules of the Paris Group. The President commended thiscourse to the Cabinet but suggested that we should also seek agree-ment in the Paris Group that an embargo should be placed on theexport to these countries of merchant ships of 15 knots or over,irrespective of size, and that, as regards other merchant ships and larger fishing vessels, there should be prior consultation in the Groupbefore orders were accepted for small coasters and ships readilyconvertible for use as troop-carriers.In discussion it was pointed out that this proposed relaxation ofexisting policy would not be popular in the United States. Whiletherefore we might be fully justified in making it, we should be well advised to do so at a time when the change of policy was least likelyto prejudice Anglo-American relations.The Foreign Secretary said that on this account he would prefer that in the first instance we should confine ourselves to consultation in the Paris Group on the proposal to export the trawlers for whichfirm enquiries had been received. This would enable us to test there actions of the Americans as well as other members of the paris group; and the Cabinet could review the position in the light ofthose consultations. They could then decide whether orders for thetrawlers should be accepted and also whether we should proceed toput to the Paris Group our further proposal to accept orders for merchant vessels, and the recommendations in paragraph 15 (c) ofC. (53) 270 for amendment of the existing rules of the Group.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for consultations tobe held in the Paris Group on the proposal that ship-builders in the United Kingdom should accept orders for,the delivery to countries in the Soviet bloc other thanChina of certain trawlers in respect of which firmenquiries had been received.(2) Agreed that, in the light of these consultations, they would consider whether those particular orders should beaccepted and also what action should be taken on thefurther recommendations put forward in C. (53) 270.Coal. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the deep-mined Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (53) 273) on the long-term prospectsProduction. for the production of deep-mined coal in this country. This memo-(Previous randum embodied the results of the Minister^ consideration of the reference: various enquiries and suggestions which had been put forward in theC.C. (53) 45th general discussion of this question which the Cabinet had held on conclusions,     23rd July.MmutL   ! The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the coal prospects for,the coming winter were good. Distributed stocks had already reached a total of 17-3 million tons and would probably rise to18-5 million tons before the beginning of the coal winter. Thiswould include about 1 - 8 million tons of house coal. There wastherefore little risk of any shortage of coal in the immediate future.Output was not rising, however, as rapidly as he had hoped; and thelong-term prospects were less promising. He was particularly con-cerned about the efficiency of colliery management and the continuingshortage of large coal.
As regards management, he had, with the Cabinefs approval,resisted the demand made by Government supporters earlier in theyear tor an independent enquiry into the organisation of the national coal Board; and he still believed that, if such an enquiry wereinitiated by the Government, it would impair the good relations which had been established between management and men in theindustry. He was glad therefore to be able to inform his colleagues that the Coal Board had themselves decided to introduce a new scheme of decentralisation, outlined in C. (53) 273, which was designed to confer greater responsibility on Area General Managers;and that they were also proposing themselves to appoint a Com-mittee, including some prominent industrialists from outside thecoal-mining industry, to consider other means of adapting theBoard&apos;s structure with a view to securing the greatest practicablemeasure of decentralisation. He hoped that Government supporters would be content with these measures, which were more likely to be acceptable to the miners than any enquiry undertaken at the initiative of the Government.The shortage of large coal was the inevitable result of increasedmechanisation. With modern methods of mining the proportion oflarge coal must be less than in former years; and consumers must therefore be induced to accommodate themselves to the use of smallcoal. The railways, one of the largest users of large coal, had now accepted this position: they were taking a far higher proportion ofsmall coal than ever before, and were ready to accept all thebriquettes which could be made available from the existing briquet-ting capacity. The Minister said that he was considering with theCoal Board whether further briquetting plants should be erected, andhe was not yet in a position to make a final recommendation to theCabinet on that point.It was more difficult, both practically and politically, to inducehouseholders to burn small coal. Something might be done by increasing price differentials; but the main problem was to find furthermeans of inducing householders to install modern grates capable ofburning small coal. Though these were not expensive, they were notbeing bought in sufficient quantities; and it was evident that house-holders must be offered some further inducement to install them. TheMinister was considering whether it would be practicable to offer a free issue of i ton of fuel to anyone installing one of these grates, buthe was not yet ready to make a final recommendation on that point.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the problem of inducing consumers to use more small coal. At first sight it might seem anomalous that the Coal Board should have spent so much money on mechanisation, if its main result was to produce in larger quantities the grades of coal which it was most difficult to sell. but without increased mechanisation it would not have been possible toproduce the quantity of coal required. Nor would it have beenpossible under modern conditions to find a sufficient number of minerswilling to cut coal by the old-fashioned methods which had formerlyproduced a higher proportion of large coal. The mechanisation policy had therefore been inevitable. But its consequences should have been more clearly foreseen from the outset, so that an earlier start could have been made with the process of inducing consumers to makegreater use of small coal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he was not yet ready to commit himself to any particular method, he recognised thatsome financial incentives would have to be provided to inducedomestic consumers to use a higher proportion of small coal. Thecost of these incentives, and possibly of an increased production ofbriquettes, might perhaps be met in part by higher prices for large coal. It was politically important that the Government should beable in the autumn to present a considered coal policy; and such apolicy could in his view be constructed on the basis of the proposals and suggestions set out in C. (53) 273. These should now be con-sidered further by the Departments directly concerned, with a view
television development.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 274) setting out the various possible means of introducing competitive television and the object-tions to each.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if the Governmentadhered to their intention to introduce competitive television, the simplest way of doing so would be to license private companies whichwould own the stations and manage the programmes on defined con-ditions. His Committee had concluded, however, that adequate control of standards would not be obtainable under such an arrange-ment and could only be ensured by the establishment of a public corporation. This body would erect, own and operate the stations,and would sell &quot; time &quot; for the transmission of programmes devisedby private companies drawing their revenue from advertisements.Such a corporation might be established either with public or with private finance. He had not felt able to agree to the use of public money without first knowing the general views of the Cabinet on theproposal for a public corporation, but his Committee had felt grave doubts about the practicability of using private finance for this pur-pose. He was inclined to think that the use of public funds couldbe justified by the need to ensure adequate control of standards andby the argument that on defence grounds it was more suitable thattelevision transmitters should be erected by a public than by a privatebody. The sum required would be of the order of million, andthere seemed to be a reasonable prospect that in due course theGovernment might recover at least a proportion of this initial outlay.The establishment of a publicly-financed corporation would involve legislation and it would be necessary to consider what reference shouldbe made to this subject in The Queen&apos;s Speech.The Postmaster-General endorsed the views expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer. It seemed to him that, if the Govern-ment adhered to the view that competitive television was in the publicinterest and were satisfied that adequate control of standards couldonly be ensured by the establishment of a public corporation, theywould be fully justified in making available from public funds the sum required to establish such a body.to the preparation of a Government statement embodying a compre-hensive policy on coal.The Minister of Labour said that the further considerationsuggested by the Chancellor should cover the man-power problemsof the coal-mining industry.The Lord President asked that he should be informed if itappeared, in the course of the inter-departmental consideration whichhad been suggested, that the Research Councils working under hisdirection could make any contribution towards this problem.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of Chancellor of the Exchequer (in the Chair),Minister of Labour,Minister of Housing,Minister of Food,Minister of Fuel and Power,Minister of Transport,to formulate, and submit for consideration by the Cabinet,proposals for a comprehensive Government policy on coal.
In discussion there was general agreement that the scheme out-lined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer offered the most promisingprospect of carrying through the Governments declared intentionto introduce a measure of competition into television. The followingparticular points were made:  (a) The arrangements proposed would not give advertisers controlover programmes. The public corporation would regulate the timeto be devoted to advertisements, their relationship to other items in programmes and the kinds of advertisements to be allowed.(b) Ministers should consider further whether under the proposed arrangements religion and politics should remain a monopoly of theBritish Broadcasting Corporation. This might be acceptable toGovernment supporters, at least at the outset, and it would avoidmany awkward problems. On the other hand, it was open to question how far it would prove possible in practice to maintain an embargo of this nature.(c) A decision on the question whether the matter as a wholeshould be left to a free vote in Parliament must be deferred untilMinisters were able to judge the reactions of public opinion and theattitude of the official Opposition to the terms on which it was proposed that competitive television might be permitted.The Cabinet -(1) Reaffirmed their intention to publish a White Paper defining the terms on which competitive television might be permitted.(2) Agreed that the scheme most likely to be generally acceptablewould be that for the establishment of a public corpora-tion on the lines suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit for their considera-tion a memorandum on the question whether religion andpolitics should be excluded, either permanently or at the outset, from the scope of television programmes broadcastfrom stations controlled by the proposed new corporation.agricultural policy.(previous reference:CC. (53) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (53) 275) seeking approval of a draft state-ment of the general principles of the Governments agricultural policy,which had been prepared as a basis for discussion with the national farmers Unions (N.F.U.S).The Minister of Agriculture said that the adaptation of the systemof guaranteed prices and assured markets under the Agriculture Act,1947, to the conditions of greater freedom and plenty into which wewere now moving was bound to be a difficult and delicate process:Hitherto, it had proved possible, with the help of the N.F.U.S, to preserve the farming community&apos;s confidence in the Government andto secure their agreement to new arrangements for the marketing ofhome-grown cereals which at an earlier stage the farmers would nothave been prepared to contemplate. The increase in the volume ofimports of cereals which had followed the recent fall in world prices had, however, alarmed the farmers and they were becoming increas-ingly nervous about the future, particularly in regard to livestock.The fact was that for producers any change from the position whichhad obtained during the war and under the Agriculture Act, 1947,must be a change for the worse. Hitherto, the producer of fatstockcould foresee exactly what prices he would receive for his stock whenthey came to be marketed; but, if arrangements were adopted for meat similar to those adopted for cereals, the producer would experi-ence again some of that sense of uncertainty about the returns for hislabours which had been his lot before the war.

7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 272) on theproblems involved in restoring the University franchise.The Home Secretary recalled that at the last General Electionthe Conservative Party.had pledged themselves to restore the repre-sentation of the Universities in the House of Commons. At theforthcoming Party Conference a resolution would be moved callingon the Government to redeem that pledge. He had recentlyconsidered this question, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, and they were both satisfied that it was not in factpracticable to devise a satisfactory scheme for restoring the repre-sentation of the Universities in the House of Commons. It would notin their opinion be defensible to revert to the earlier system by whichthe University graduate had two votes. But the alternative, by whichgraduates would be free to choose whether they should vote in a university constituency or in a territorial constituency, would havethe result that University Members would be elected by haphazardassortments of graduates, many of them living in constituencies where their votes could not affect the result of an election. Moreover, it-would be difficult to justify the separate representation of the Uni-universities in Wales and Northern Ireland; but, equally, it would bedifficult to devise any re-grouping of the Universities which wouldUniversityFranchise.(previous references:C.C.(51)4thConclusions,Minute 1, andC.C. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 7.)for the marketing of meat were now under discussion and he and hiscolleagues would shortly be submitting their proposals to the Cabinet.Meanwhile the N.F.U.S had asked the Government to reaffirm theirrecognition of seven principles of agricultural policy and wished todiscuss these with Ministers. He would like authority to talk to theN.F.U.S on the basis of the draft statement attached to his memoran-dum. This would be put before them as a basis for discussion, in thecourse of which he would seek to obtain their agreement to it.The Minister of Food said that the farmers were not, in fact,justified in being critical of the Government over the present cerealsposition, as the Ministry of J^ood&apos;s purchases of home-grown cerealshad actually been greater this season than in 1948 and 1951 when therehad been comparable harvests. No doubt there were local difficultiesbut these were due primarily to the rapid increase in the use of com-bine harvesters without a corresponding increase in the facilities fordrying and storing grain on the farms.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the crisis which was undoubtedly developing in agriculture was essentially a crisis of con-fidence. The Government had not, in fact, departed from theprinciples of the 1947 Agriculture Act and were firmly determinednot to do so. It was also clear that the next Budget would show no reduction in the extent of Exchequer assistance to farmers. Apartfrom devising satisfactory means of fixing prices and regulating mar-keting in the new conditions, which would not be easy, particularly for meat, the Government must pay careful attention to the presenta-tion of its agricultural policy generally.The Prime Minister said that experience had shown the import-ance of giving due notice of changes which would affect the prices which farmers obtained for their livestock and crops. So far as con-cerned cereals, present difficulties might be eased by Governmentpurchase of surplus home-grown grain for a strategic stock-pile.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement attached to C. (53) 275 as abasis for discussions with the National Farmers Unions;and invited the Agriculture Ministers to report the results ofthese discussions to the Cabinet.
not give offence to them all. And, if the Government sought to restore the University seats as they were before they were abolished,they would be open to criticism for creating constituencies withindefensibly small electorates. The Home Secretary said that forthese reasons he had come to the conclusion that it would be impracticable to restore University representation in the House ofCommons. He himself believed that, if it was thought right that the universities should be separately represented in Parliament, theirrepresentatives should take their place in a reformed House of Lords.The Cabinefs discussion was confined to the immediate questionof handling the forthcoming debate on this matter at the party conference. It was not to be assumed that the resolution callingon the Government to redeem their election pledge would necessarily be carried at the Conference particularly if the difficulties to whichthe Home Secretary had drawn attention were brought out in the debate. It would be preferable that these arguments should not be deployed by a Government spokesman, but arrangements shouldbe made to ensure that the difficulties were made clear by otherspeakers.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no statement on the University franchise shouldbe made by a Government spokesman at the forthcomingParty Conference; but invited the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster to ensure that the difficulties of restoring University representation in the House ofCommons were brought out by other speakers at theConference.(2) Agreed to consider this matter further in the light ofthe debate at the Party Conference.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture (C. (53) 267) reporting the position reached in the Icelandfisheries dispute and recommending that Ministers should take nofurther action for the moment but should await developments.The Cabinet Took note of the position and agreed that no further action should be taken for the moment.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 265) reporting develop-ments at the current session of the contracting parties to the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).The President of the Board of Trade recalled that the cabinet had authorised him to seek the co-operation of other commonwealth countries in abstaining from voting on the question of Japan&apos;sprovisional association with the Agreement and in stating that wecould not ourselves be parties to it. It was now clear that, if thisquestion were put to the vote, the result would probably be favour-able to Japan&apos;s application. There now appeared to be somepossibility, however, of securing the support of the United StatesGovernment as well as of the Governments of Commonwealth andother countries which shared our outlook on the matter for a settle-ment on the following lines:  (i) Japan would not be admitted to provisional association withthe G.A.T.T.;(ii) Japan would be allowed to participate in G.A.T.T. dis-cussions, which she already attended as an observer;
(iii) contracting parties would take note that a number of countries intended to base their commercial relations with japan on the G.A.T.T. but that it was open to others notto do so.He asked for authority to seek a settlement on these lines, whichwould meet almost all our requirements.The Foreign Secretary said that, according to his information, itwas doubtful whether it would, in fact, be possible to secure asettlement on this basis. He would be glad to be kept in touch with developments.The Cabinet &apos;Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to seek a settlement of the problem of Japan&apos;s association with theG.A.T.T. on the general lines indicated in paragraphs(i)-(iii) above.industrial disputes.engineering industry.LiverpoolDocks.10. The Minister of Labour said that on the following day theemployers in the engineering and shipbuilding industries would rejectoutright the current claim by the Unions for a substantial wage increase. The Unions were due to meet on 8th October to considerthe position and the possibility of some strike action or other inter-ference with normal working in these industries could not be excluded. In any event relations between employers and men inthese industries were bound to remain difficult for some time.An unofficial strike of dockers had been called on Merseyside,and between 7,000 and 8,000 men had ceased work. The transport and General Workers&apos; Union were trying to bring about an earlyresumption of work, and there was a reasonable prospect that theywould succeed in doing so.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th October, 1953.
