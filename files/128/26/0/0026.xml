Egypt-defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C.

The Cabinefs attention was drawn to telegrams passing(Previous between the Foreign Office and Khartoum from which it appearedReference: that the Governor-General, of the Sudan was unwilling to take anyC.C. (53) 21st active steps to counter the misleading propaganda which the EgyptiansConclusions, were disseminating among the Sudanese about the future of the SudanMinute 6.)       and the British attitude towards it.The Cabinet were informed that, the Governor-Generafs attitude was based on the constitutional responsibility which he bore to boththe Egyptian and the United Kingdom Governments&apos;. Other.steps were, however, being taken to ensure that this Egyptian propaganda in the Sudan would be effectively countered!&apos;     &quot; *.iH,- ,1. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the latest pro-posals for resuming defence negotiations with the Egyptian Govern-ment.. It had now been arranged that, when the negotiations were resumed. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo would be supportedby General Sir Brian Robertson, who would for this purpose relinquishhis military command in the Middle East a few weeks earlier than hewould otherwise have done. General Robertson had been brought back to London for consultations; and it was now hoped that thenegotiations would open in Cairo on 27th April. . This plan fitted in with the possibility of the United States joining with us later, on theoriginal model. : ,The Prime Minister was anxious that our conditions, as for-mulated in the instructions which were to have served as the basis for the proposed Anglo-American approach, should be plainly statedto the Egyptians at an early stage; and he preferred on this accountthat there should be a formal opening of negotiations which would bedistinct from normal diplomatic exchanges. His conversations withGeneral Robertson had confirmed him in this view. - He had there-fore instructed our negotiators to proceed on the basis that it was the egyptians who desired to resume the negotiations; that the discus-si ons should begin with a formal meeting at which both sides wouldstate their views; and that our case should be developed on the lines indicated in the instructions which had been drawn up for the purposeof the proposed Anglo-American approach. It would be announced in advance that the discussions were to be opened on 27th April.The Prime Minister also said that he was instructing our negotiators to do their utmost to secure Egyptian agreement to theproposal that British troops retained in the base installations in the canal Zone should wear uniform and carry personal arms. Hethought it specially important that these men should not be leftunarmed and open to arrest by Egyptian police if, for instance, troublearose about the Sudan. If they wore uniform and carried personalarms they could not be molested by the Egyptians without military action which would constitute an act of war.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theaction taken by the Prime Minister.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (53) 114) proposing that a Committee of Ministers shouldbe appointed to consider the various alternative schemes for reform of the composition and powers of the House of Lords.The Lord President said that he had set out in his memoranduma number, of alternatives. He was at present inclined to favour asystem by which the hereditary Peers would elect some of their number to sit in the House of Lords, viz., an extension to the EnglishPeerage of the system which had been adopted for Scottish Peerssince the Act of Union. The remainder of the House of Lords would consist of life Peers. There were difficulties about this solution, someof which he had indicated in his memorandum; and.he thought that,before the Cabinet went further into the problem, they would be well advised to have a full report from a Committee of Ministers..,.In discussion the opinion was expressed that any reform of the1House of Lords should restore its power to &apos; delay for two yearslegislation passed by.&apos;the House of commons, or should at least&apos; provide that the power&apos; of delay should be so extended that, when&apos; a dispute had arisen between the two Houses, ho decision could bereached until after the next General Election. It was argued that a simple repeal of the Parliament Act, 1949, might provoke theOpposition to commit themselves to reversing the position when theyH. :-n; - came into power j and thereby sacrifice the constitutional stabilitywhich was one of the objects:of reform. : -    &apos;... The Prime Minister said that a committee of Ministers should now study the various alternatives and report back to, the Cabinet.House of lords reform.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)Surrender of 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeFirearms. Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 118) pro-posing that an appeal should be made to members of the public to surrender to the police any firearms and ammunition in their posses-sion, on the understanding that iio proceedings would be taken forany breach of the law that might be disclosed.The Home Secretary said that a similar appeal in 1946 had yieldedspectacular results; and, although the response now was expected tobe much less, considerable numbers of firearms would probably be surrendered. Criminals would not surrender weapons in then&apos; pos-session; but, the fewer the firearms held by ordinary people, the lesswould be the risk of these being stolen by persons with criminalintentions. There was no doubt that criminals could at present acquireammunition and firearms on a considerable scale by stealing andillegal trading.In discussion there was general support for the proposal to make this appeal. It was, however, suggested that this would meet with amore favourable response if it could be indicated at the same,time that the police would give sympathetic consideration to applicationsfor firearms certificates by law-abiding people who&apos; needed firearmsfor their own,protection. The Home Secretary said that he would bring this point to the attention of Chief Constables.The Cabinet . (1) Approved the proposal outlined in C. (53) 118 for an appealto the public to surrender firearms and ammunition to the.  police. ,(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to consider what could be said, in this appeal,. regarding the attitude which the police would .adopt infuture towards applications for firearms certificates by.law-abiding citizens who needed firearms for their ownprotection.
