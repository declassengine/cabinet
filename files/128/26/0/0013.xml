The Cabinet, agreed that, as the Annual statement on Defence was to be debated in the House of Commons on. m 3rd March, it was preferable that any Parliamentary discussion onKorea should be left to find its place in the context of that general   1 debate.Malaya.(previous reference:C.C.

Flood Damage.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 12thConclusions,Minute 7.)FinancialAssistance.5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the amount of theGovernment contribution to the Lord.Mayor&apos;s Fund,,...The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government-wereincurring very large expenditure on grants to local authorities, drain-age schemes, rest centres and feeding centres and the transport offurniture, &amp;c. They had already paid more than  1 million forsandbags for coast defences, and the National Assistance Board were making generous payments to persons in distress. In these and otherways the Government had aheady spent  2-\ millions and wouldcertainly spend more. He agreed, however, that they must also make an adequate contribution to the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund and he proposedthat they should undertake to contribute  1 for each  1 contributed by the public. This would extend to overseas contributions, unless they were earmarked for some, specific project. The offer could not remain open indefinitely, but notice of a time-limit could be given at some later date. It had been calculated that this offer might invoivethe Exchequer in a maximum expenditure of  1* millions. &apos;In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Lord Mayor had expressed disappointment at thesuggestion that the Government should make a fixed donation of 1 million, but he was likely to be satisfied with an offer of a Govern-ment contribution of  1 for  1.(b) It was desirable that compensation for loss of livestockshould be covered by the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund, This loss was lessheavy than had been feared, and was estimated at about  200,000.Much livestock had been rescued and taken to safety on higherground, where additional rations of feeding-stuffs were being madeavailable.(c) It would be of great help in Scotland if part of the aid offeredfrom Canada could be given in the form of heavy tractors for movingdamaged timber,(d) If it was argued in the debate in the House of Commons thatthe Government should have borne the whole of the cost of making
Raw Cotton. 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of importing and the Board of Trade and the Minister of Materials (C. (53) 63) sub-Marketing, mitting proposals for the importing and marketing of cotton in the(Previous Year 1953-54. .      &apos;Reference: The President of the Board of Trade said that, as the foreignC.C. (52) 39th   exchange position still precluded the reopening of the LiverpoolConclusions,    Cotton Exchange, it would be necessary to extend the arrangementsMinute to.)      which had come into force as a result of the recommendations of theCommittee under the Chairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins.  This.Committee, with the agreement of all the interests concerned, includ-ing the Trade Unions, had succeeded in breaking the monopoly of the raw Cotton Commission in the purchase of raw cotton, and at themoment about 30 per cent, of the trade were buying privately. It now seemed likely that for the next cotton season a much higher proportionof spinners, possibly up to 60 per cent, of the trade, would decide to buy privately, This would raise two difficult questions.  How should cover be provided for these buyers?   And what would be the effect-    on the functions and future of the Raw Cotton Commission if it was left to handle only a small proportion of the trade?  He proposed.thatthese problems should be studied by a Review Committee, preferablyunder the Chairmanship of Sir Richard Hopkins, but that before theCommittee was set up every effort should be made to obtain the agree-ment of the interests concerned, especially the Trade Unions, who. - would face with reluctance the possibility that the Raw Cotton Corn-mission would be brought to an end., In the meantime, thegood the flood damage, it could be pointed out that this would involvemuch less flexible methods of administration than those which could, be used in distributing a charitable fund.(e) Attention was drawn to the distinguished service rendered by-   individuals during the floods, and the Home Secretary undertook to forward to the Prime Minister a list of recommendations for recogni-tion which might be submitted to The Queen.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was proposing to arrange for an ex gratia issue of tobacco tokens to old-age pensioners who had lost their own in the floods. The cabinet approved this proposal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governments contribution to the lord mayor&apos;s Fund should be on the basis of  1 by the Govern-mentfor each  1 contributed by the public, subject to the&apos; condition that this would not apply to overseas contribu-tions earmarked for specific purposes. -(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce this offer, with-;out reference to any time-limit, in the debate in the Houseof Commons that afternoon; but took note that at some later date notice would have to be given of the date atwhich the Governments offer would close.Lynmouth The Lord Chancellor said that the Lord Lieutenant of DevonshireFund- was now proposing to ask the Charity Commissioners to draw up ascheme authorising the diversion to the Lord Mayots Fund of theunused balance of the fund raised by the Lords Lieutenant of Devonand Somerset for the relief of loss and suffering in those countiescaused by the floods of August, 1952.  -     :The Cabinet (3) Took note of this statement by the Lord Chancellor.
96 ^.:&apos;- - ... ;.v   .Government would have to make some announcement about cover inorder to enable spinners to make their arrangements for the buyingseason of 1953-54. The precise form of cover could not be settleduntil the report of the Review. Committee was ready, but it could ,be stated that cover would be made available by the Raw Cotton Corn-mission for 1953-54 on the same lines.as it had been for 1952-53. Itwas likely that the Review Committee would report that new legisla-tion would be needed to replace the Cotton (Centralised Buying) Actand this should, if possible, be introduced before the end of 1953.  &apos;In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, much as he dis-liked using public funds to protect a single industry against lossthrough fluctuations in the prices of its raw materials, he was pre-pared to accept the cover arrangements proposed for 1953-54. Therisk involved was less than that of re-opening the futures market. Solong as sterling remained inconvertible, free dealings in futures wouldinvolve a serious risk of a&apos;substantial drain &quot;on our dollar reserves.In fact, in certain years the Government had made some profitthrough the provision of cover for cotton purchases, and it was by nomeans certain that the risk to the Government would be any greaterif 60 per cent. of. the. trade now decided to buy privately.(b)-The existing scheme had worked successfully and had been welcomed by cotton interests in Lancashire. 1 There was no reasonto suppose that an extension of it would be received with disfavour,although any radical alteration of the functions of the Raw cotton commission was unlikely, to appeal to the Trade Unions.&apos;(c) It would be premature to reserve a definite date for legis-lation to replace the Cotton&apos;(Centralised Buying) Act, but note couldbe taken of the fact that legislation on this subject was likely to berequired in the 1953-54 Session. - -&apos;    -  ,The Cabinet-        .   ; &apos;.&apos;.-&apos;:&apos; - .   -Subject to the point noted in paragraph (c) above, approved the proposals in C. (53) 63; and authorised the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Materials toproceed accordingly. -The 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordCoronation. ( Chancellor (C. (53) 62) on the question whether special legislationForm of was required to authorise the. changes proposed in the form of the coronation      Coronation Oath.0athi       &apos; The Prime Minister said that he was impressed by the legal and(Previous constitutional arguments.set out in this memorandum. Those whoReference: were advocating the passage of special legislation on this subject had .C. (53) 8th evidently failed to appreciate the change in the constitutional positionConclusions, which had been brought about by the enactment of the Statute of minute 1.)       Westminster.   Legislation by. the Parliament at Westminster would.not now suffice; and it was clear that,&apos; in&apos;the time now. remainingbefore the Coronation, it would not be possible to arrange for each member State of the Commonwealth to pass legislation sanctioningthe changes to be made in the form of the Oath. The Governmentcould base themselves upon this practical consideration, whateverconstitutional arguments might be deployed in any public contro-versy on this question. / A Parliamentary Question on this point.&apos;&apos;&apos;. ; would have to be answered in the House of Commons in the course&quot;of the following week; and, while the oral answer might be brief,he thought it would be advisable to publish, in the Official reports reasoned statement of the legal and constitutional considerations which the Government ,had taken into account in reaching their decision.
industrial disputes.Austin Motors.8. The Minister of Labour drew the Cabinefs attention to thestrike at the Austin Motor Works in Birmingham. About 2,000workers were on strike, and the total number temporarily unemployedJn discussion there was general support for the views expressedby the Prime Minister..;: : The Cabinet  *. ; (1) Agreed that no special legislation should be introduced to,&apos;&apos; authorise the changes proposed in the form of the coronation Oath.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the ^Commonwealth Secretary, to prepare a statement of the legal and constitutional considerationson which this decision was based in a form suitable for publication in the Official Report. &apos;The Homage. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Commonwealth(Previous Secretary (C. (53) 68) covering a draft of the message which would reference: have to be sent to other Commonwealth Governments if the Corona-C.C. (53) 12th tion Committee of the Privy Council should wish to proceed further conclusions, with the suggestion that the Speaker of the House of Commons should minute 6.) do homage to Her Majesty in the Coronation ceremony.In discussion it was pointed out that this suggestion, like that forthe introduction at Westminster of legislation authorising changesin the form of the Coronation Oath, paid insufficient regard to theindependent position of the other member States of the Common-wealth. The Coronation ceremony was to&apos; a considerable extent aChurch of England Service and. its special emphasis on Englishinstitutions could be defended so. long as. its traditional .characterremained unaltered. But once innovations were suggested, equalregard would have to be paid to the position of the other independentmember States of the Commonwealth, and no&apos; new proceduresaffecting them could properly be introduced except with the agree-ment of all Commonwealth Governments. This particular suggestionshould have been put forward, not to the Coronation Committee,but to the Coronation Commission on which the other commonwealth governments were represented.The Cabinet-(3) Took note that the Lord Chancellor would seek to ensurethat the Coronation Committee would proceed no further with the suggestion that the Speaker of the House ofCommons should do homage to Her Majesty in the coronation ceremony.Precedence. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 61) setting out his recommendations regarding theorder of precedence to be observed among the representatives offoreign Powers at the Coronation. , .In discussion it was suggested that further thought might be,&quot; given to the possibility of according a higher place to the representa-tive of the German Federal Republic.    The Foreign Secretarypromised to consider this further.The Cabinet (4) Subject to the point noted above, approved the order ofprecedence suggested in C. (53) 61 for the representativesof foreign Powers at the Coronation; and invited the, Foreign  Secretary  to  advise  the Lord Chamberlainaccordingly.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th February, 1953.as a result of it was about 5,000. The strike had been called by theNational Union of Vehicle Builders, which was under Communistcontrol; but the firm employed large numbers of men belonging to various other unions and it seemed likely that different views on the merits of the strike would develop among the workers affected by it.The Minister said that he would continue to keep in touch with thesituation, but he did not think it would be wise for him to makeany move in the matter for the present.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.
