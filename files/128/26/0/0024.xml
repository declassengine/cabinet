Coal Mining.Proposal forEnquiry.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport., fuel and Power said that on the previous day he had met a number ofGovernment supporters in the House of Commons who were interest-ing themselves in the problems of fuel and power, and had discussed with them the proposal for an enquiry into the structure and administration of the National Coal Board. He had explained tothem the Governments reasons for preferring that such an enquiry should not be held at the present time and, in the light of his explana-tion, those who had played a prominent part in putting this suggestionforward had undertaken to refrain from pressing it upon the Govern-ment for the time being.The Cabinet were informed that, despite this meeting, there was still some feeling among Government supporters that there was needfor an enquiry into the structure and administration of the coal board.Parliament. 1.   TTze Prime Minister said that, in company with the ChancellorSalaries of of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal, he was to receive that members. afternoon a deputation from leading members of the Labour Party,(Previous who wished to put before him arguments for increasing the salariesReference: 0$ Members of the House of Commons.   He had been consideringC.C. (52) 73rd whether he should suggest, in reply to the deputation, that this was conclusions, a matter which could conveniently be debated on a Supply Day in minute 2.) &apos; the House of Commons, and thus leave the Labour Opposition withthe responsibility of raising the matter formally in Parliament.In discussion it was argued that a proposal to raise Members&apos;salaries would command the sympathy of some government supporters in the House of Commons, though a majority of them would be opposed to it, and there was therefore some risk that, ifthe proposal were taken to a division in the House, there would bea majority in favour of it. The Government would then find it moredifficult to take no further action in the matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been con-sidering whether it might not be wise to offer some form of enquiry into the salaries and allowances of Members. Such an enquiry couldcover the position of Ministers, and it might possibly be extended toinclude the question of the Judges&apos; remuneration.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government, in supporting their proposal for an improvement in the Judges&apos;remuneration, would wish to rely on the argument that High court judges were not comparable with any other class of persons; andthis argument would be seriously weakened if an enquiry were launched which covered both Judges and Members of Parliament.The Lord President asked that, before any action was taken toincrease the salaries of Members of the House of Commons, serious consideration should be given to the possibility of making some contribution towards the expenses incurred by Peers in attendingmeetings of the House of Lords.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Ministersreceiving the deputation that afternoon should content themselves with promising consideration of the representations made on behalfof the Labour Party, and should not at this stage suggest that thismatter should be debated in Parliament or be made the subject of anindependent enquiry. The Cabinet could consider the matter furtherwhen they had before them the arguments advanced by the deputation.
3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Easter recess.It was expected that the general debate on the Budget statement would be completed on 20th April. Discussion of the Lords amend-ments to the Transport Bill, which it had not been possible tocomplete on 31st March, would be resumed on 21st April.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (53) 117) reporting the recommendations of the Com-mittee which the Cabinet had appointed on 24th March to consider how best to deal with deserters who were not covered by the termsof the amnesty announced on 23rd February but had reported them-selves to the military authorities in the mistaken belief that they were entitled to benefit under it. The Committee recommended that thesemistaken claims should be handled by requiring those concerned to sign a confession of desertion, after which no proceedings would betaken against them. They advised that an immediate announcement to this effect should be made in the terms of the draft annexed toC. (53) 117.In discussion there was general support for the recommendationmade by the Committee. It was suggested that, in order to avoid further ambiguity, the draft statement should be adjusted so as tomake it clear that the procedure now to be announced applied onlyto men who had deserted at times outside the limiting dates mentionedin the original statement of 23rd February but had reported them-selves in the mistaken belief that they were entitled to benefit underthe terms of the original announcement.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations set out in C. (53) 117.(2) Agreed that an announcement should be made in the Houseof Commons that afternoon, in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (53) 117, subject to the inclusion in para-graphs 3 and 5 of amendments designed to meet the point raised in the discussion; and took note that the HomeSecretary would make this announcement on the PrimeMinisters behalf.5. The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the onset of thepack-ice season made it desirable that the Commanding Officer ofH.M.S. Bigbury Bay, the frigate at present stationed off deception island, should be given discretion to sail for Port Stanley when he considered that local weather conditions made this course desirable.He hoped the Cabinet would agree that, before sailing, H.M.S.Bigbury Bay should take on boad the detachment of Royal Marinesat present on the island.The Minister of State said that he understood that it would bepossible for the Royal Marines to remain rather longer on the island if their withdrawal was carried out by the survey ship John Biscoe, whichwas specially strengthened to meet ice conditions and was at present inAntarctic waters.The Colonial Secretary said that he would prefer that the JohnBiscoe should be used to rescue and transport to Buenos Aires themembers of an Argentine expedition who had become stranded atMarguerite Bay. We were likely to gain more advantage from doing this than from leaving the Marines on Deception Island for a furthershort period.
In discussion there was general support for the Colonial Secre-tary&apos;s view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Commanding Officer of H.M.S. Bigbury Bayshould be given discretion to re-embark the detachment of Royal Marines now on Deception Island and to sail forPort Stanley as soon as he considered it wise to do so inview of local weather conditions.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary and the Minister of State toarrange that the John Biscoe should, if possible, rescue andtransport to Buenos Aires the members of the Argentineexpedition now stranded at Marguerite Bay.Steel. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Com-Allocation and commonwealth Secretary (C. (53) .116) seeking endorsement of theControl of recommendation of the Economic Policy Committee that the steelDistribution. distribution scheme should be brought to an end.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Committee were satisfied that steel supplies as a whole, were now adequate to justifythis step but their recommendation was made subject to the followingreservations (i) that the allocation system should be continued in respect of prime quality tin plate;(ii) that, before the distribution scheme was ended, special measures should be taken to control the distribution ofsteel plate;(hi) that the licensing of exports of steel should be maintained.The shortage of steel plate was serious and was having a graveeffect upon the shipbuilding industry. It was proposed that its futuredistribution should be regulated by an Order requiring producers to dispose of their output in accordance with the terms of licences to beissued by the Minister of Supply. The President of the Board of trade might wish to make early proposals for relaxing export licensing inrespect of certain types of steel of which ample quantities wereavailable.The Minister of Supply said that, while there was now some prospect of improved supplies of steel plate, effective arrangements for controlling its distribution must be introduced before the generaldistribution scheme was brought to an end. Relaxation of exportlicensing involved certain risks which must be closely studied before any relaxations were made.The Cabinet-Endorsed the recommendations of the Economic PolicyCommittee, as set out in paragraph 7 of C. (53) 116.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)Flood Damage.Damage toStandingTimber in     ,Scotland.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 11.)7. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while there was general satisfaction with the other arrangements made for dealingwith distress arising from the floods and gales of 31st January-lst February, there was continuing anxiety in Scotland about thedisposal of the timber blown down in the gale which could not besawn locally. The cost of transporting this surplus to the mills further south which had the capacity to handle it would be such that, without some Exchequer assistance, little or no profit would be made on itssale. All practicable steps were being taken to ensure that as muchof the fallen timber as possible was sawn locally, and portable sawingequipment was being brought specially into the area for this purpose;
Education. 8 Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterExpenditure on of Education (C. (53) 115) reporting the results of her enquiries intoAdult Studies, the arrangements made by unofficial bodies for providing facilities(Previous fQr adult education in such subjects as economics, literature,Reference:      psychology and the arts.C.C. (53) 18th Tne Minister of Education said that these enquiries had con-Conclusions, firmed her view that the fees paid by students attending these classesMinute 3.) were unduiy low. Contributions from all public sources towards thecost of these classes averaged about  4 per student per class, and theaverage students contribution was only 2s. She therefore proposedto appoint a committee to go into the whole matter and to recommendhow this work could best be organised and financed in future years.Meanwhile, for the coining financial year, she proposed that studentsshould be required to pay fees representing roughly 6d. a lecture,though suitable arrangements would be made to remit or reduce feesin special cases of hardship. No Government grant would be payable unless this condition were observed. It was estimated thaton this basis the total Government grant would probably not be substantially less than that paid in the current financial year.In discussion there was general support for the proposal toappoint a committee to devise more effective means of organising andbut, when all these possibilities had been exhausted, there would stillbe some surplus which would not be cleared unless arrangements could be made to transport it to sawmills in the south.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were two possible ways of dealing with this problem. The Government might make a contribution towards the cost of transporting the timber, tothe extent of two-thirds of a total transport cost not exceeding50s. a ton. Alternatively, the Ministry of Materials could offer to buy the timber which could not be sawn locally. He feared that thefirst alternative might establish a dangerous precedent.The Minister of Materials said that he saw serious objection tothe second alternative. He would find it difficult to justify to thePublic Accounts Committee the purchase of timber which he did not need at prices higher than those for which he could obtain it elsewhere.Secondly, Government trading in timber had been discontinued; andit seemed undesirable to revert to it for so small a transaction as this,which would represent less than 1 per cent, of the country&apos;s annualconsumption of timber. Thirdly, his Department no longeremployed staff qualified to handle a transaction of this kind.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in all the circumstances the preferable course would be to make an Exchequer contribution towards the cost of transporting this timber to sawmills further south.The precedent thus established should not prove dangerous since itwas most unlikely that gale damage on this scale would occur again for many years to come.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an Exchequer contribution (of two-thirds oftransport costs not exceeding 50s. a ton) should be made towards the cost of transporting to sawmills further southsuch Scottish timber blown down in the gale of31st January-lst February as could not be sawn locally.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland to announce this in a statement which he was proposing to make in theHouse of Commons that afternoon.
financing these classes in future years. Doubts were, however,expressed about the wisdom of attempting to impose a minimumstudents fee in advance of the findings of the proposed committee.It seemed likely that this would involve the Minister in considerablecontroversy before she had the support of the findings of theindependent enquiry. So long as it was announced that the whole subject was to be investigated, and that it was the Governments aim to ensure that reasonable fees were paid by the students, no harmwould be done by allowing the existing arrangements to continuewhile the investigation proceeded.The Minister of Education said that she would be content to follow this course so long as it was understood that it might havethe result of increasing by about  10,000 the amount of the Govern-ment grant to be made in respect of these services during the coming financial year.&apos; The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Education to appoint a committee to review the arrangements for organising and financing thefacilities provided by unofficial responsible bodies foradult education in such subjects as economics, literature,psychology and the arts.(2) Agreed that, while this investigation was proceeding, theexisting arrangements for paying Government grant inrespect of these services should be continued during thefinancial year 1953-54.9. The Commonwealth Secretary invited the Cabinet to considerwhether Her Majesty should be advised to invite the Irish RepublicanAmbassador in London to attend the reception which she was givingfor Commonwealth representatives on 1st June. The main arguments in favour of this course were that the Ambassador had been authorised to represent his Government at the Coronation; that hehad attended the reception for Commonwealth representatives whichThe Queen had given at the time of the late King&apos;s funeral; that hecould not properly be asked to the corresponding reception for representatives of foreign Governments; and that other Common-wealth Governments were not likely to raise any objection to his being included in the Commonwealth reception. The commonwealth secretary said that for these reasons he and the Home Secretary were disposed to recommend that the Ambassador should be invited tothis reception provided that the Prime Minister of Northern ireland was also invited to be present.In discussion it was suggested that it would be advisable in thefirst instance to verify informally that this arrangement would be:agreeable to the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to any views which might be expressedby the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, who should be consulted informally, Her Majesty should be advised to invite both the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and theIrish Republican Ambassador to be present at her receptionfor Commonwealth representatives on 1st June; and invited the Home Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary tomake arrangements accordingly.
Korea. 10.   The Prime Minister said that he would be making a state-previous ment in the House of Commons that afternoon about the resumptionReferences: of the armistice talks in Korea. The proposals now made by theC.C. (52) 82nd Chinese Communist Government for an exchange of sick and conclusions, wounded prisoners, and their apparent readiness to consider there-Minute 1; and after arrangements for the disposal of other prisoners of war, wasC.C. (53) 19th a welcome step towards breaking the present deadlock and might be conclusions; an indication of a genuine desire to conclude an effective armisticeMinute 5.)       in Korea.   We should be careful not to appear to discourage suchovertures as these, though we should continue to handle them with alldue caution.The Prime Minister said that in this statement he would takethe opportunity to comment on the patience and foresight which theForeign Secretary had shown, since assuming office, in all the negotia-tions which he had undertaken, in the United Nations and elsewhere,with a view to achieving an effective armistice in Korea.Territorial 11.   The Minister of State informed the Cabinet of the actionWaters: now being taken in this matter.   We were informing the IcelandIceland Government that we had been unable to obtain from the BritishFisheries fishing interests any undertaking to raise the landing ban after a rulingDispute. had been given by the International Court.   We were adding that(Previous        we were still quite ready to join with the Iceland Government in reference:      submitting for decision by the International Court the question ofC.C.

We were also seeking to arrange for the minute 6.)       technical aspects of the dispute to be ventilated at the forthcoming meeting of the Permanent Commission established under the Over-fishing Convention.  We were trying to persuade the French Govern-ment to raise the matter at this meeting.We had recently been asked by the Danish Government for our views on certain restrictions which they contemplated imposing uponfishing in waters under their control. These restrictions appeared tobe in keeping with the judgment of the Hague Court in the NorwegianFisheries dispute and were therefore likely to be less objectionablefrom our point of view than the restrictions imposed by the iceland government.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.industrial disputes.Austin Motors.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 23rdConclusions,Minute 9.)12. The Minister of Labour said that he might find it desirablewithin the next few days to accede to a request from the NationalUnion of Vehicle Builders, supported by the Trades Union Congress,that he should appoint a Court of Enquiry to investigate the facts of the dispute at the Austin Motor Works in Birmingham. In putting forward their request, the Union had made no stipulation about the reinstatement of the discharged strikers and they had expressed their readiness to accept the Courfs verdict. The Austin Motor Companydid not object to the establishment of a Court of Enquiry, although they felt no enthusiasm for it and could not reasonably be expectedto commit themselves in advance to act in accordance with its findings.The establishment of a Court of Enquiry should reduce the risk ofthe dispute spreading to other motor works or to other Unions.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st April, 1953.
