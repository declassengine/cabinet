&apos;5 *js2Uganda 1.   The Colonial Secretary said that the Kabaka of Buganda hadProtectorate.    now arrived in the United Kingdom and was on his way to London.(Previous        The Governor of Uganda had sent an account of his final interviewsReference:      with the Kabaka, from which it was clear that the Kabaka had beenC.C. (53) 73rd   formally warned on the morning of 30th November, before the final conclusions,    steps for his deposition were put in motion, that, if he declined to minute 4.)       give the assurances for which he had been asked, recognition wouldbe withdrawn.   The Kabaka had clearly understood this, but hadpersisted in his refusal.  It would be difficult for him to argue thathe had not realised the consequences which would flow from hisrefusal.  The utmost patience had been shown from the beginning ofthe negotiations in trying to persuade him to give the necessaryassurances.  If earlier warning had been given that recognition wouldbe withdrawn, he would probably have gone into hiding in Bugandaand raised an insurrection.    If, on his arrival in London, hechanged his attitude and made a sincere offer to co-operate loyallywith Her Majesty&apos;s Government in future, that would create a new situation and it would then be possible to consider, in consultationwith the Governor, whether it would be safe or wise to reinstate him.This development seemed very unlikely, but could not be ruled outaltogether at the present stage.The Chief Whip said that the Opposition would not seek to debate this matter that afternoon: they would be ready to come tosome arrangement to enable it to be discussed in the House ofCommons on 2nd December.The Prime Minister said that in these circumstances the cabinet should re-consider the position at a meeting on the following day.By that time the Colonial Secretary would have had further informa-tion from the Governor of the Protectorate and might have had an interview with the Kabaka himself. If, contrary to expectation, the kabaka changed his attitude, then, as the Colonial secretary had said, a new situation would arise which the Cabinet wouldhave to consider. If, on the other hand, the circumstances had not changed the Government should adhere to their decision to deposethe Kabaka and justify it in debate in the House of Commons.The Cabinet Agreed to resume discussion of the deposition of the kabaka of Buganda on the following day.Sudan. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Governor-General of the(Previous Sudan had sent a short report on the results of the electionsReference: (Khartoum Telegram No. 603).  From this telegram it seemed that.C.

The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Ambas-(Previpus ambassador in Tehran had now reported that the Persian Prime minister reference: and Foreign Secretary were recommending to the Shah a formula byC.C.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the explanationsOfficers&apos;        which the Foreign Secretary and he had given to GovernmentRetired Pay.    supporters ill the House of Commons of the Governmenfs decision(Previous       on the retired pay of certain Service officers had succeeded so farReference:      in holding the position on this issue.  There was now clear evidenceCC. (53) 7.1st   that the Government would have been subjected to strong pressureConclusions,    for wider concessions if they had agreed to meet the claims of these minute 1.)       Service officers and that they had, therefore, been right not to do soat this juncture.  The Parliamentary position was not easy, however;and he thought it. would be wise to take some early action to correct the widespread impression that these Service officers had beenunfairly treated.  For this purpose the Government might offer toarrange for an independent enquiry to be made into the facts of thematter, with the object of establishing that there was no ground forany charge of breach of faith.  Such an enquiry, which would be ofa quasi-judicial nature, might be undertaken on the Governmenfsbehalf by Sir John Forster, the Chairman of the Industrial Court.The enquiry would not be confined to the actions of the present government but would cover the circumstances of the original decision to stabilise pension rates in 1935 and the decisions of theLabour Government that these officers should be excluded from thebenefits of the Pensions Increase Act, 1944.   He was confident thatthe outcome of such an enquiry would be satisfactory from the government&apos;s point of view.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat any action which might be interpreted as a sign of weakness onthis issue should be avoided. Even if it were certain that the outcome of the proposed enquiry would be satisfactory, the fact that theGovernment had seen fit to propose it might give the impression that they had not satisfied themselves fully on the merits ofthe Service officers&apos; claim before deciding that it could not be met.Moreover, in explaining the position to Government supporters inthe House of Commons, emphasis had been laid on the fact that theGovernment had thought it necessary to withhold any concessionfrom these officers, not because of any weakness in their claim, but because of the repercussions to which any concession would havegiven rise. In the circumstances no indication should be given, inreply to the Question by Lieutenant-Colonel Lipton, M.P. in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, that any form of enquiry was in contemplation. The reply to that Question should be confined to astatement that the Government were not prepared to adopt his proposal that a Select Committee should be appointed.Mr. Hoover, it seemed possible that a basis for a settlement mightbe found in the creation of a consortium of oil companies in which united Kingdom and United States companies would hold roughlyequal interests. This was justified by the fact that Persian oil couldnot now be marketed unless production in other Middle East oilareas was reduced. He was, however, unwilling that any share inthis consortium should be given to those small American oil companies which were already seeking to buy from the Persians oil which belonged to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. If this con-sortium were formed, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company should act asthe selling agency; but it would probably be expedient to bring inthe International Bank as the nominal provider of the financial support. He did not wish the Cabinet to take any immediate decision on this plan; but he hoped that they would be able toconsider it further during his absence in Bermuda.The cabinet took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.

Discussion then turned on the probable course of any debate onthe motion which Sir Edward Keeling, M.P. had tabled for discussion on Friday, 11th December. This motion was third in order ofdiscussion that day, but Labour Members interested in this question were seeking to persuade the two Labour Members whose motionswould normally take precedence over it to withdraw their motionsand it therefore seemed likely that Sir Edward Keeling&apos;s motionwould be discussed. The Government Whip could not safely be usedfor the purpose of securing the defeat of a Private Membefs motion on a Friday. Attendance on 11th December would probablybe confined mainly to Members on both sides of the House who were interested in the issue of retired officers&apos; pay. It was likely, therefore,that the motion would be carried. Such a result would stimulaterenewed opposition to the Governmenfs decision.The view was expressed that in these circumstances and in viewof the importance of the issue the Governmenfs case should be putin debate by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who should do his utmost to prevent Government supporters from voting for the motion. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that theChancellofs participation in the debate would suggest that theGovernment attached great importance to it, and that the better course would be to play down the importance of the debate as muchas possible. It would be preferable that the Financial Secretary,Treasury, should speak for the Government. He could make it clearthat, while the Government could not accept the motion as it stoodbecause it implied immediate reconsideration of the decision whichthey had so recently announced, they had every intention of keeping the matter under constant review and of granting some concession to the Service officers concerned as soon as circumstances allowed.It might be worth considering whether, as a means of attractingsupport from the motion, a Government supporter might table an amendment in terms which would be acceptable to the Government.In the last resort, however, the Government must be prepared to facedefeat in a division and must take precautions to ensure that the pressdid not exaggerate the significance of the carrying of a PrivateMembefs motion against the Governmenfs advice. The carrying ofsuch a motion represented in no sense an operative decision by theHouse but rather the recording of the opinion of the majority of those members present on a Friday and taking part in the division. Forthis reason the fewer votes that were recorded, the better. If theGovernment should be defeated, it would thereafter be necessary forthem to consider, in the light of all the circumstances, whetherconsiderations of prestige required&apos; that they should then make theissue one of confidence.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to state, in reply to the question by Lieutenant-Colonel Lipton, M.P., in the House ofCommons that afternoon, that the Government were notprepared to adopt the proposal that a Select Committeeshould be appointed to investigate the alleged grievanceof these Service officers.(2) Agreed that, if Sir Edward Keeling&apos;s motion were debatedon 11th December, all possible steps should be taken to minimise the significance of the occasion and to avoid adefeat for the Government in a division but that the motion should not be accepted.
Fog. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary (C. (53) 333) presenting the recommendations of the reference: Ministerial Committee which the Cabinet had appointed on 19thCC. (53) 68th November to consider the report of the Beaver Committee on AirConclusions,    Pollution.Minute 4.) The Ministerial Committee recommended that the report of theBeaver Committee should be presented to Parliament as a white paper on 2nd December; that the Minister of Housing should on the armed Forces. 5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary(Previous 0f State for War and the Minister of Supply (C. (53) 338 and 339)Reference: proposing the adoption of a new type of rifle and ammunition forCC. (53) 71st    standard use by British Forces.Conclusions, The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of extensive trials by minute 1.) military representatives of Canada, Belgium and the United KingdomNew type of wjth United States observers, it had now been agreed that the Armedrifle and Forces of those countries should in future use a standard round ofammunition. -300 inch calibre in the American cartridge case T.65. Trials had also been made of various rifles to fire this standard round, and theWar Office were anxious to adopt the latest F.N. rifle designed by aBelgium firm, for standard use by the Army. There was a strongpossibility that Canada, as well as Belgium, would adopt this typeof rifle. Authority was therefore sought to negotiate with theBelgian company for rights to manufacture this rifle in the UnitedKingdom, and to order 5,000 of them for the purpose of carrying outtroop trials. It was not proposed that any public statement shouldbe made at this stage about the adoption of a new rifle, as it was intended that a general announcement should be made on behalfof the military authorities of the North Atlantic Alliance in order to demonstrate the extent of the standardisation achieved.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) There should be no announcement foreshadowing theadoption of this rifle by the British Army until the Ministry of supply had reached a satisfactory agreement with the Belgian firm regardingthe terms on which it could be manufactured in this country. Theordering of the initial supply of rifles required for troop trials should similarly be deferred until that agreement had been concluded.(b) The Governments of Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica should be informed, in advance of any public announcement,of this decision to adopt a new type of rifle. This could be done assoon as the negotiations with the manufacturers had been completed.(c) The announcement to be made on behalf of the north atlantic Alliance would probably be confined to the adoption of a standard round of ammunition. We need not ask that anannouncement so limited should be deferred until we had completedour negotiations about the manufacturing rights for the rifle.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the latest type of F.N. rifle, firing a 300 inchbullet, should be adopted for standard use by british forces.(2) Invited the Minister of Supply to negotiate with Belgiandesigners of this rifle for rights to manufacture it in theUnited Kingdom.(3) Agreed that, as soon as the negotiations under Conclusion (2)above had been satisfactorily completed, an initial supplyof 5,000 F.N. rifles should be ordered for the purpose oftroop trials.(4) Took note that there would be no public announcement of theadoption of this new rifle until the negotiations under conclusion (2) had been completed.
same day make a statement regarding it in terms set out in Annex Ato C. (53) 333; and that a statement in the terms of Annex B to C.(53) 333 should at the same time be issued for the guidance of thePress.The Committee considered that there was no need for any specialinter-departmental organisation to follow up the recommendationsof the Beaver Committee. The Minister of Housing and the Ministerof Fuel and Power would, however, continue to give their attentionto this problem, so that a further public statement might be made about it on the Governmenfs behalf in about three months&apos; time.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing to present the report of theBeaver Committee to Parliament on 2nd December, andto make a statement on it in the House of Commons that day on the lines indicated in Annex A to C. (53) 333.(2) Authorised the Minister of Housing to give general guidance to the Press on the lines indicated in Annex B to C.(53) 333.(3) Took note that the Minister of Housing and the Minister of fuel and Power would give continued attention to this problem, with a view to a further statement ofGovernment policy in about three months&apos; time.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.,1st December, 1953.
