103C.C. 68 (S3)Parliament       .    1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week. .House of The Opposition had suggested that there might be a debate onCommons. foreign affairs on 30th November, immediately before the departure of the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary for the BermudaConference. The Cabinet considered that this would serve no publicadvantage, and invited the Chief Whip to resist the suggestion on theground that the House had already had several opportunities to debateforeign affairs since the opening of the new session. In the last resort, however, he might offer a half-day&apos;s debate on 30th November.: Later in the meeting the Chief Whip, reported that the opposition had undertaken not to press this suggestion, on the understandingthat a foreign affairs debate would be held after the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary had returned from Bermuda.The Opposition had also suggested that proceedings on theHousing Bill might be deferred until after the Christmas recess. TheCabinet thought it necessary that the progress of this Bill should notbe delayed, and endorsed the proposal of the Lord Privy Seal thatthe second reading should be taken in the week beginning 30thNovember.The Cabinet were informed that it was now intended that thesecond reading of the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill should also be takenin the week beginning 30th November.Television 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the forthcoming debate on development   television in the House of Lords was now to be held on a motion,(Previous       tabled by Lord Halifax, which expressed positive opposition to the reference:      proposals in the Governments White Paper. The National TelevisionC.C. (53) 67th   Council had now declared its opposition to the Governmenfs scheme,Conclusions,    and it seemed to be a part of their tactics to secure an adverseMinute 8.) &apos;    vote in the Lords before the White Paper could be debated in the commons.  From soundings which had been taken among Govern-ment supporters it now seemed likely that, if the Government Whipswere on, the proposals in the White Paper could be carried by amajority in the House of Commons.  But, if Lord Halifax&apos;s motionwere carried in the Lords, some sections of Government supportersmight press the request that the whole issue should be left to a free vote in the Commons.   In these circumstances some Ministers con-sidered that determined efforts should be made to prevent the Lordsfrom debating this matter in advance of its discussion in the Com-mons; and it was suggested that the Lord President might be asked,on his return to London later that day, to consider whether lord halifax could not be prevailed upon to defer the discussion of hismotion.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 98thConclusions,Minute 3.)Food. 3.   The Minister of Food said that, as the supply of home-killedMeat Rationing, meat had now passed its peak, he must shortly reduce the amount of meat supplied to butchers. Since the end of August the weekly rationhad stood at 2s. Ad. and butchers had been offered in addition a freeallowance representing 6d. worth of meat for each customer. If hewas to be sure of being able to avoid reducing the ration below thelevel of 2s. a week in January, he ought to reduce it now to 2s. 2d.and discontinue the off-ration allowance. The longer this was delayed, the more likely it was that the ration would have to fall below 2s. in the New Year.In discussion the point was made that, as the off-ration allowance was sold mainly to people with larger incomes, there was much to besaid for withdrawing this before the level of the ration was itselfreduced.   If it were withdrawn at once it might be possible to
Fos- 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing (C. (53) 322) suggesting that the Government should at onceannounce the appointment of Ministerial and official Committees toco-ordinate the activities of the various Departments concerned withthe abatement of fog.The Minister of Housing said that much public interest wasbeing shown in this matter. This would be enhanced by the forth-coming publication of the report of the Committee on Air Pollution.The Government might gain credit by making it clear that theactivities of the several Departments concerned were under strongcentral control and direction.In discussion it was suggested that an even better impressionmight be created if the Government were able to announce, as soonas the report of the Committee on Air Pollution was published, what action they proposed to take on some at any rate of its recommenda-tions. Examination of the report might also put Ministers in abetter position to judge what practical need there was for inter-departmental organisation on the lines proposed in C. (53) 322.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee composed of: -Home Secretary (in the Chair).Secretary of State for Scotland..      Minister of Housing and Local Government.Minister of Fuel and Power.Minister of Health.Financial Secretary, Treasury.To consider urgently those parts of the report of theCommittee on Air Pollution which made recommenda-tions for early action, and to advise what statement ofGovernment policy could be made simultaneously withthe publication of the report and what inter-departmental organisation, if any, was required for following up therecommendations in the report.(2) Agreed that publication of the report of the Committee on air Pollution should be delayed until the ministerial committee had been able to submit a report to theCabinet.Armed Forces.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:CC. (53) 67thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 325) reporting the results offurther examination of the scheme outlined in his earlier memo-randum (C. (53) 206) for meeting the claim for the restoration of the%per cent, cut imposed in 1935 upon the pension rates of service officers who retired between the wars.&apos; The Minister of Defence said that, since the Cabinet had firstconsidered this matter nearly a year ago, pressure for the restorationdistribute extra meat for sale immediately before Christmas. It wasthe general view of the Cabinet that, if the prospective level ofsupplies were sufficient to warrant this course, it would be preferable to maintain the ration at its present level until after Christmas, evenif this involved some risk that it might fall below 2s. a week inJanuary.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Food to reconsider the level of meatsupplies over the next two or three months, in the light ofthe views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion, and to reporthis conclusions to the Prime Minister.
of this cut had been steadily mounting. It would culminate in a debate in the House of Lords on 15th December on a motion byLord Jeffries, on which it seemed likely that the House would divideand the Government be defeated. In his view the issue was a straight-forward one were the Government willing to remedy the injusticeinflicted on the few hundred senior officers concerned by the 1935cut in pension rates? He was ready to accept the Chancellor&apos;s pro-posal for a 10 per cent, increase in the retired pay of the officers concerned, although this would, in fact, fall slightly short of fullrestoration of the 9% per cent. cut.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not agreethat the issue was as narrow as the Minister of Defence contended.Retired senior Civil Servants had -suffered in 1922 a cut in their pension rates which amounted in some cases to as much as 24 percent, and, if a concession were now made to retired Service officers,the claim of these Civil Servants for similar treatment would beincontrovertible. This would involve legislation. It would also benecessary that any such pension increases should be extended tocomparable Service and civilian officers of the former Governmentof India, and the direct cost of all the concessions likely to be involvedwas estimated at  400,000. The Cabinet ought also to weigh care-fully the probable results of making concessions to senior retiredState servants so soon after the promise of costly pension increasesmade at the recent Conference of the Labour Party. As it happened,the Treasury was due to receive on 23rd November a deputation onbehalf of the senior retired Civil Servants concerned, and the cabinet might be in a better position a little later on to reach a final decision in the matter.The Minister of National Insurance said that sooner or later theGovernment would find it unavoidable to make some concessions to war disability pensioners and old age pensioners, and concessions to senior retired State servants would be more easily defensible ifthey could be deferred until such wider concessions becomepracticable.Discussion showed that there was support in the Cabinet for theview of the Minister of Defence that a concession to the senior retiredService officers concerned had now become unavoidable. But serious concern was also expressed at the probable consequences of making such a concession at the present time, and some Ministers thoughtit would be wiser to defer it at least until it could be announcedtogether with proposals for improving the position of pensionersgenerally.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of this matter at a meetingearly in the following week.Jordan.(previous reference:CC. (53) 67thConclusions,Minute 5.)6. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (53) 323) on the United Kingdom&apos;s obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty of 1948.The Foreign Secretary said that he favoured sending an armouredsquadron to Jordan for training as soon as the Security Council hadpronounced on the Qibya incident. Before this was done, it wouldbe wise to give the Israel Government an assurance that neither thesenor any other British troops would be used in Jordan for an aggressivepurpose, and to take that opportunity of reminding them of our treaty obligations to Jordan. It was more difficult to know what should be said at this stage to the Jordan Government. We might do no more than accept their invitation to send an armoured squadronfor training in Jordan, without saying anything about its possible usein fulfilling our obligations under the Treaty. Alternatively, we might
Uganda 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the protectorate..   Colonial Secretary (C. (53) 324) on the present political situationin the Buganda Province of the Uganda Protectorate. i .The Colonial Secretary said that the hereditary ruler of Buganda the Kabaka was a weakling who had lost face with his subjects: by his recent conduct. In an attempt to restore his authority he had adopted an extreme nationalist line and was persisting in a demandfor &quot; independence &quot; for Buganda. In doing so he was violating anAgreement of 1900 governing the relations of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment with the Kabaka. Under Article 6 of this Agreement theUnited Kingdom Government undertook to recognise the Kabakaoffer to discuss ways and means of fulfilling those obligations. Inthat event we should have to make the point that, if were to beable to discharge those obligations effectively, we should have to station an armoured brigade in Jordan in time of peace. We might thus secure their agreement to this in principle, while making it clearthat its timing would turn on the outcome of our defence negotiationswith Egypt.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, in the eventualredeployment of British troops in the Middle East, there would bestrategic advantages in stationing an armoured brigade group in jordan. It would be well placed in relation to the tasks which itwould have to perform in a major war, and in peace it would serve to stiffen the Arab Legion. But, although this was a sound long-term objective, we could not at present afford the cost of constructingthe permanent accommodation which such a force would require.For the moment, therefore, the Chiefs of Staff would prefer to do no more than send an armoured squadron to Jordan for training with theArab Legion and to build this up, as resources allowed, to the strengthof a regiment. If hostilities broke out again between the Jews andthe Arabs and it became necessary for that purpose to send reinforce-ments to Jordan, the strength required would be one infantry brigade group and an armoured regiment, and a force of this strength couldnot be made available in Jordan within less than one month.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of this statement, it seemed preferable that our immediate communication to the jordan government should be kept within the limits proposed in para-graph 4 (i) of C. (53) 323, and that nothing should be said to them at this stage about the possible use of British troops to fulfil our obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.In the discussion which followed there was general support forthe first of the alternatives set out in paragraph 4 of C. (53) 323.The Prime Minister repeated the view which he had expressedin the Cabinefs discussion on 17th November that we should be careful to avoid a situation in which British troops became engagedin hostilities between Israel and Jordan.The Cabinet (l) Agreed that, as soon as the Security Council had pronouncedon the Qibya incident, an armoured squadron might besent to Ma&apos;an in Jordan for training with the Arab Legion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Israel Govern-ment of this movement, before it took place, assuring themthat British troops would not be used in Jordan for an aggressive purpose but reminding them of our obligations under the Anglo-Jordan Treaty.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to communicate with the jordan government, at the appropriate time, in the sense pro-posed in paragraph 4 (i) of C. (53) 323.
as ruler of Buganda &quot; so long as the Kabaka .... shall co-operateloyally with the United Kingdom Government in the organisationand administration of the said Kingdom of Uganda.&quot; The Kabakahad further indicated that it was his intention publicly to oppose the attitude of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on the issue of &quot; indepen-dence &quot; for Buganda in the Lukiko, the Provincial Council. In the governors view such public statements by the Kabaka would almost certainly precipitate riots and bloodshed on such a scale that theycould not be suppressed without the use of substantial forces.The Colonial Secretary said that, in these circumstances, he proposed to summon the Kabaka to London for discussions &quot; ongrave matters affecting his Treaty relationship with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment,&quot; giving him an undertaking that he would thereafter be allowed to return to Uganda. At this interview he would requirethe Kabaka to give certain assurances about his acceptance of theGovernments decision and his future co-operation with the Protec-torate Government. It was to be hoped that such assurances wouldbe forthcoming but, if they were not, the Kabaka would be warned that he must be prepared to take the consequences on his return toUganda. If, on his return, he persisted in his intransigent attitude,recognition would be withdrawn from him and he would immediately be deported from Uganda. If the Kabaka refused the invitation tocome to London for discussions, the Governor would summon him and inform him that Her Majesty&apos;s Government adhered to. their decision on the issue of &quot; independence.&quot; The Kabaka would beasked whether he was prepared to accept it and loyally abide by it.If he refused to do so he would be informed that his refusal must be reported to the Secretary of State. Not more than four days later the Governor would summon the Kabaka again and hand him a notewithdrawing recognition from him. Immediately afterwards hewould be deported. Thereafter the Lukiko, when the time was judgedright, would be invited in accordance with custom to elect a successor.It was desirable that the issue should be brought to a head beforethe end of November as it was believed that the Kabaka&apos;s threepresent Ministers would not support his defiance of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and they were liable to be replaced by new Ministersearly in December. The Governor of Uganda was entirely in agree-ment with the proposal to take stern measures against the Kabaka.Deposition and deportation of the Kabaka was almost certain to lead to some disturbances in the Province, but it seemed likely thatthey could be suppressed by the battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifleswhich was already moving into Uganda for the purpose from Kenya.If, however, action against the Kabaka were delayed until he had publicly defied Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the situation might require the transfer from Kenya to Uganda of a second battalion of the King&apos;s African Rifles, which would be kept at three days&apos;notice to move thither, and possibly of still further reinforcements.In reply to questions, the Colonial Secretary made the following further points:  (a) There was no scope for discussing with the Kabaka possibleextension of the present degree of self-government in the BugandaProvince. The Kabaka had made it abundantly clear that he wouldbe satisfied with nothing short of complete &quot; independence.&quot;(b) It would not be valid to contend that Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment would not be justified in deposing and deporting the Kabakaso long as he did not go beyond declaring that his aim was to securecomplete &quot;independence&quot; for Buganda. Public defiance by the kabaka of a decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Government duly communi-cated to him involved a clear breach of the Agreement of 1900. the attorney-General confirmed this view.The Cabinet-Authorised the Colonial Secretary to proceed in this matter as proposed in C. (53) 324.   1
Betting, 8.   Xne Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeLotteries and Secretary (C. (53) 317) on the recommendations in the Report ofGaming.        the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (CommandOff-the-Course   8190).Betting.The Home Secretary said that the Royal Commission^ main recommendations, which were summarised under (i) to (iv) in thefirst paragraph of his paper, had been examined by a Sub-Committeeof the Home Affairs Committee. The Sub-Committee had recom-mended, and the Home Affairs Committee had agreed, that theCommission^ recommendations should be accepted with the excep-tion of some minor recommendations on football pools and on therestriction of opportunities for betting on dog racing.As regards the Commission^ proposals for dealing with theproblem of cash betting off-the-course, the Home Affairs Committeewere generally agreed that the arguments against continuance of thepresent situation in which there was in practice more illegal thanlegal betting with&apos;a consequent serious threat to police discipline were unanswerable and that the proper solution lay in the establish-ment of licensed betting offices. The Committee had further agreedthat the best course would be for the Government to discuss thedifficulties frankly with the Opposition as a prelude to a general debate in Parliament possibly on a Private Member&apos;s motion onthe Commission^ recommendations, during the course of which itwould be desirable that the Government spokesman should indicatethat the Government were disposed to adopt the course recommendedby the Royal Commission.It was now nearly three years since the Royal Commission had reported and Government decisions on its recommendations couldnot be deferred much longer.During the course of a preliminary discussion the view was expressed that the proposal to permit the establishment of licensedbetting offices was an important one which ought not to be decided in the absence of several senior members of the Cabinet. some further delay could be accepted as the present was not a propitioustime for initiating Parliamentary discussion of further controversialissues.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume consideration of C. (53) 317 at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,19th November, 1953.
