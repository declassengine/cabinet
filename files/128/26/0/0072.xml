Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Second Reading of the Housing Repairs and Rents bill would be moved on 30th November by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Housing: the Minister of Works and the Minister of housing would speak for the Government on the second day of the debate.The Opposition would expect that a debate on foreign affairs should be held as soon as the Prime Minister and foreign secretary had returned from the Bermuda Conference. That debate could not take place before the meeting of the North Atlantic Council,which was to be held in Paris on 14th to 16th December, unless thePrime Minister and Foreign Secretary were able to return fromBermuda in time to take part in a debate on 10th December. If theycould not be back by then, the debate would probably have to be deferred until 17th December. The date for this debate must there-fore be kept open for the time being, as it was not possible to forecastprecisely when the Bermuda Conference would end.The Lord Privy Seal said that it now seemed likely that theSecond Reading of the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill would have to be postponed until after Christmas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in that event the bill might be amended so as to apply retrospectively from 1st January,1954.Egypt. 2.   The Prime Minister said that, from representations which hadDefence recently been made to him, it was clear that some of the GovernmenfsNegotiations. supporters in the House of Commons would be seriously disturbed(Previous if a defence agreement on the lines now envisaged were concludedReference: with the Egyptian Government. These Members were not speciallyC.C.

They would find it difficult to supportany agreement which failed to safeguard the use of the Canal as aninternational waterway.The Prime Minister said that the strategic importance of the Base,for peace or for war, was much less than it had formerly been; and,if the Egyptian Government rejected our latest proposals for an agree-ment, there was much to be said for starting afresh on an entirely new basis. Our essential requirements in the Middle East would bemet if there were in Egypt an international base, containing a few thousand British troops, to which we could have access in time ofwar, and if we had one armoured division stationed elsewhere in theMiddle East. He believed that, if we could obtain unequivocalAmerican support in a fresh approach, the Egyptians might still be forced to concede our minimum demands.The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptians had hitherto been quite unwilling to join any international organisation for the defenceof the Middle East, and he was doubtful whether they could be induced to adopt a different attitude on that point. He agreed, how-ever, that there would be every advantage in exploring the possibilityof securing stronger American support in any fresh approach to theEgyptian Government. An attempt should certainly be made tosecure this in the forthcoming discussions in Bermuda.The Cabinet Took note that at the Bermuda Conference the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary would seek to secure a firm promise of American support in a fresh approach to the Egyptian Government, to be made in the event of a breakdown in the current defence negotiations in Cairo.
tripartite meeting in bermuda.(previous reference:CC. (53) 65thConclusions,Minute 2.)Policy in theFar East.3. The Cabinet took note, with approval, of a memorandumby the Foreign Secretary (C. (53) 330) indicating the general line to be taken, in the forthcoming discussions at Bermuda, on policyin the Far East.european defence community.(previous reference:CC. (53) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 332) on the arrangements for British association with the European Defence Community (E.D.C.).The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of discussions with officials of the E.D.C. Governments, a revised draft had been pre-pared of an Agreement defining the basis of co-operation betweenthe United Kingdom and the Community. The text of this draft was reproduced in Annex A of C. (53) 332. In substance it was fully in accord with the decisions taken by the Cabinet on 19th May.He proposed that this draft Agreement should now be initialled onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government. A draft Statement ofCommon Policy for Military Co-operation had also been prepared(Annex B to C. (53) 332). This had been approved by the Chiefsof Staff, and he proposed that it should be published at the sametime as the draft Agreement, in order to show the full extent of our proposed co-operation with the Community. The draft Agreement,when signed, would be laid before Parliament together with theStatement of Common Policy.The French had now suggested that, in addition, there shouldbe a further exchange of letters defining our obligations in a way which would imply a commitment to keep British troops in Europefor a specified term of years. The Foreign Secretary recommendedthat this further suggestion should be rejected; but he asked theCabinet to leave it to him to decide whether our position on this point should be made clear at once through the French Ambassador inLondon or whether it should be explained to the French representa-tives at the Bermuda Conference.In discussion there was general agreement that we should not go further, in defining our association with the Community, than waspromised in the draft Agreement and Statement of Policy annexed to C. (53) 332. The attitude of the French towards the E.D.C. hadthroughout been most disappointing. They had become the victims of their early enthusiasm for a federal conception of European unity;for they were now reluctant to embrace those very elements in theplan on which they had&apos;at the outset insisted. At the beginningthey had advocated a federal structure because they had thoughtthat France would dominate it: but, now that German recovery had made such rapid strides, they feared that she would play the leading part in a federal structure. If they had been willing to accept thelooser form of association which we had advocated, we could have played a part in it which would have helped to allay their fears ofGerman dominance.The Cabinet agreed that, at the Bermuda Conference, everyeffort should be made to persuade the French to ratify the E.D.C.Treaty without further delay. If the French representatives should say that it was impossible for them to carry this through their Parlia-ment, the Americans might well press for the early admission ofGermany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).The essential need was that an early start should be made with there-creation of a German army. All the plans for this had now beenmade, and ten German divisions could be available within two years
from the date on which authority was given to proceed with thoseplans. There was, however, no doubt that, if Germany&apos;s military strength were re-created within the framework of the E.D.C., thiswould give a greater assurance that it would not be used for an aggressive purpose; and from that point of view it was preferable that Germany&apos;s military contribution to the defence of western europe should be made within E.D.C. rather than through Germany&apos;saccession to N.A.T.O. It was suggested that French reluctance to ratify the E.D.C. Treaty might perhaps be reduced if it were possiblein some way to suspend the introduction of the federal aspects ofthe Treaty and to proceed in the first instance to implement only the plans for the creation of a European army.In further discussion there was agreement that we should supportthe French in their efforts to persuade the Americans to make a public declaration of their readiness to continue their commitments underthe North Atlantic Treaty beyond the contractual period of 20 years.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct his represen-tative in Paris to initial the draft Agreement, and to acceptthe draft Statement of Common Policy (Annexes A and b to C. (53) 332) defining the means by which the UnitedKingdom would co-operate with the European defence community.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to sign the Agreement indue course on behalf of the United Kingdom Government,and to present it to Parliament and publish it together withthe Statement of Common Policy.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to resist French pressure for afurther exchange of letters defining our obligations to theEuropean Defence Community.(4) Took note that, in the forthcoming discussions on thisquestion at the Bermuda Conference, the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary would be guided by the views which had been expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.United Statesand CanadianLoans.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 37thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 331) on the question whether waiver of interest should be claimed for the year .1953 under the UnitedStates / United Kingdom Loan Agreement (Command 6708).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in June theCabinet had authorised the opening of negotiations with the UnitedStates Government with a view to the deletion of section 6 (iii) of theAgreement. This section, containing the third condition which hadto be satisfied before we were entitled to claim waiver of interest, hadthe paradoxical effect of making any claim to the exercise of the waiver stronger when our financial position was more favourable and vice versa. The negotiations had so far proved inconclusive and itwas now necessary to consider whether we should claim waiver ofinterest for the year 1953 under the Agreement as it stood. It mustbe recognised that although the attitude of the Secretary of the UnitedStates Treasury was friendly, the United States Administrationas a whole were showing little disposition to take any practical measures to support our economy and continued to countenancepractices, for example, by the Export/Import Bank, which did serious harm to our commercial interests and were incon-sistent with the declared American aim of freeing international trade from restrictions. Failure on our part to claim waiver of interest for a third year in succession would make it harder for usto invoke the waiver clause in subsequent years. He therefore recom-mended that we should now inform the United States Administration,
as suggested by Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington inparagraph 4 of his telegram No. 1109 (annexed to C. (53) 331), thatwe had decided that the facts of the situation were such as to justifyus in asking for the waiver this year and that we intended to do sounless they could show that such a claim would not be justified underthe Agreement as it now stood. At the same time we should leaveour request for revision of the Agreement on the table. The main purpose of this approach would be, not so much to secure the agree-ment of the United States Government to the exercise of the waiverfor the current year as to induce them to discuss seriously the revisionof the Agreement.The Foreign Secretary expressed full agreement with the Chan-cellor&apos;s criticisms of the present attitude of the United States Adminis-tration on these matters. It seemed to him, however, that a claim for exercise of the waiver for 1953 was unlikely to have the effectdesired by the Chancellor and might well stir up latent hostility to thiscountry in the United States. It had to be remembered that we were still receiving from the United States Government in the form of aidtwice as much money as we should stand to gain by exercise of the waiver this year. Might it not be wiser, therefore, while making itclear that we regarded ourselves as fully entitled to the waiver, to refrain from asking for it but to press all the more strongly for revisionof the Agreement?The Lord Privy Seal said that account must be taken of the factthat, if we were excused interest on the United States loan, theCanadian Government would find themselves compelled to excuse usinterest on the Canadian loan.In discussion there was support for the view that a claim to exer-cise of the waiver might well have a contrary effect to that which was desired. On the other hand, the view was expressed that invocationof the waiver clause on the lines recommended by the chancellor would amount to no more than the exercise of our legitimate rights under the Agreement and could not reasonably be challenged by theUnited States Administration although it might well be politicallymisrepresented.The Prime Minister said that, whatever might be the technicalitiesof the matter, there was no doubt that failure to pay the interest due on our loans would gravely damage our credit at home and abroad,which the Government had done so much to re-establish, and wouldbe exploited by the Opposition in Parliament. He would, therefore,not be in favour of invoking the waiver clause at the present time.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, if it was the Cabinefsview that we should not invoke the waiver for 1953, it was for con-sideration whether we should notify the United States Administrationforthwith of our intentions in the matter. It was not necessary tomake such a notification for about a month and in the meantimeuncertainty about our intentions might make the Americans moreforthcoming in the negotiations for revision of the Agreement.The general view of the Cabinet, however, was that a frankapproach should now be made to the United States Government onthese matters on the lines suggested by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Agreed that the United States Government should now beinformed that, although we considered ourselves to beentitled under the terms of the Loan Agreement to waiver of interest on the loan for 1953, we did not intend to invokethe waiver clause but looked for an early and satisfactoryoutcome of the negotiations for revision of the Agreement.
Overseas 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign Secretaryinformation (C. (53) 305) covering the Report of an independent committee of services. enquiry into the Overseas Information Services (the Drogheda(Previous Committee) and memoranda about the Report by the CommonwealthReference: Secretary (C. (53) 260), the Lord Privy Seal (C. (53) 310), the ForeignCC. (52) 74th Secretary, Colonial Secretary and Parliamentary Under-Secretary of conclusions, state for Commonwealth Relations (C. (53) 315) and the Chancellor of minute 10.) the Exchequer (C. (53) 321).In the course of a brief preliminary discussion it was agreed thatit would be helpful to the Cabinet if these papers could be studied indetail by a small group of Ministers without departmental interest inthe subject matter, who could hear the views of the interestedMinisters and submit considered recommendations to the Cabinet.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee comprising Home Secretary (Chairman),Lord Privy Seal,Minister of Labour,to examine the Report of the Drogheda Committee on the overseas Information Services and the memoranda whichhad been circulated to the Cabinet on it, and to submit their recommendations to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th November, 1953.
