Trieste. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had now been(Previous reached with the United States and French Governments on the basisReference: for an approach to the Italian and Yugoslav Governments with aC.C.(53)60th view to a Five-Power Conference on Trieste. There was some reasonConclusions, to believe that the Italians would accept a solution based on a divisionMinute 3.)       of the Free Territory of Trieste on the lines of the existing Zones.But the attitude of the Yugoslav Government seemed to be harden-ing: they were now threatening that they would take military action if any part of Zone A were handed over to Italy. Their object wasto force a withdrawal of the Anglo-American declaration of8th October: although they might ultimately accept a decision onthat basis, they wished it to proceed from a conference. He was considering the possibility of suggesting that, in advance of a confer-ence, the decision would be put into effect only to the extent ofhanding over to the Italians the civil administration of the City of trieste. This would probably satisfy Italy; but Tito, despite hisadmission that Trieste itself was predominantly Italian, was unlikely to welcome it.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Industrial 2.

The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Service Ministers to send through normal Servicechannels messages expressing the Governmenfs apprecia-&apos; tion of the services rendered by troops in distributing oil in the London area during the recent strike.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would submit to thePrime Minister an estimate of the cost of the measures taken to deal with the emergency and of the loss whichit had involved.Atomic EnergyOrganisation.(previous references:C.C. (53) 50thConclusions,Minute 10and 58thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had. before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (53) 296) covering a draft White Paper setting out the Governmenfs proposals for transferring responsibility foratomic energy research and production to a public Corporation.In discussion of the terms of the draft White Paper the followingpoints were raised:  (a) The Prime Minister said that at his invitation the lord president had agreed to assume Ministerial responsibility for the new corporation. A statement to this effect had been included inparagraph 14 of the draft White Paper.(b) The Paymaster-General proposed that a paragraph shouldbe added to the draft White Paper describing the arrangements forordering atomic weapons in the following terms: &quot; The arrangementabout atomic weapons will be that the Ministry of Supply will beresponsible for the provision of complete weapons to the Services.It will therefore arrange with the Corporation for the supply of nuclear components and for research in relation to specific weapons.&quot;
(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would like todiscuss with the Paymaster-General whether the terms of para-graph 18 of the Appendix to the White Paper could be adjustedso as to avoid the implication that salaries payable to employees of the Corporation must be such as to enable it to &quot; compete &quot; with industry in securing men for the higher posts. Lord Waverley might possibly agree to substitute words implying that some of the salarieswould be comparable to those paid in industry.In further discussion the Minister of Supply said that he wasnot satisfied that the transfer of this work to a public corporation would secure any early advantage in practice. Little more flexibilitywould be secured so long as the financial control continued to rest with the Treasury. The arrangement reached about the responsibilityfor atomic weapons would tend to blur Ministerial responsibility.In general, he felt that Ministers had been influenced too much bythe.civilian, and too little by the military, aspects of atomic energy.As, however, the Cabinet had decided to proceed with the transfer,he accepted their decision.Discussion then turned on the Parliamentary time-table for giving effect to this decision.The view was expressed that no public announcement of theGovernments decision should be made until all the details of theproposed transfer had been fully worked out and any necessary legis-lation was ready for introduction. By this course the government might avoid premature debate in the House of Commons. It might,in particular, be inadvisable that any mention of the plan should bemade in The Queen&apos;s Speech until it was certain that legislation wouldbe required, the Paymaster-General said, however, that the pro-posed transfer would have to be carried out by stages. The first step would be to transfer the Ministerial responsibility from theMinister of Supply to the Lord President. All the details of this transfer had already been worked out and the necessary Order inCouncil had been drafted. There was no doubt that, in the second stage, legislation would be needed for the establishment of the pro-posed Corporation; but the preparation of this legislation, and thecompletion of the other administrative measures, would be facilitatedif the Ministerial responsibility were first transferred. He himselfhoped that the White Paper could be presented as soon as possiblein order to bring to an end the present uncertainty about theGovernments intentions.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed that, on balance, thebest course would be to announce the Governments intentions inThe Queen&apos;s Speech, to present about 8th November an Order inCouncil transferring Ministerial responsibility to the Lord President,so that this transfer could become effective by 1st January, 1954, andto present the White Paper at the same time. The main debate inParliament could then be held on the basis of the White Paper andthe draft Order. The necessary legislation should be ready for intro-duction early in the New Year.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to Her Majesty&apos;s approval, an additionalparagraph should be inserted in The Queen&apos;s Speech onthe Opening of Parliament in the following terms:&quot; Proposals will be laid before you for the transfer ofresponsibility for atomic energy from the Ministry ofSupply to a statutory Corporation.&quot;(2) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C. (53) 296,subject to the addition set out in paragraph (b) above andto further consideration of the point noted in paragraph (c)above.(3) Agreed that the Order in Council under the Ministers ofthe Crown (Transfer of Functions) Act, transferringMinisterial responsibility for atomic energy from the
Food.(previous reference:CC. (53) 60thConclusions,Minute 8.)FutureMarketing of meat andBacon.4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of Food(C. (53) 298) and the Minister of Agriculture (C. (53) 299) on thearrangements to be made for the future marketing of home-producedmeat and bacon after the end of meat rationing.The Minister of Agriculture said that this was a difficult prob-lem, which had been under discussion between the Departmentsconcerned for some time past. In the last month, however, theNational Farmers Unions (N.F.Us.) had introduced a new factorinto the situation by producing firm proposals of their own. Theyhad come down strongly against any system of deficiency payments,and had formulated a scheme for the central purchase of livestockby a producers&apos; Marketing Board, at pre-determined fixed prices,followed by re-sale in a free market. He doubted whether it wouldbe possible to restore the farmers&apos; confidence in the Governmenfsagricultural policy unless some of the main principles underlying those proposals were accepted. He had therefore devised a plan (outlined in C. (53) 299) which, while avoiding some of the difficulties inherent in the proposals of the NFUs., preserved its main principles and, inparticular, provided for the establishment of a producers&apos; MarketingBoard. Many of the Governmenfs present supporters were firmlypledged, as he was himself, to the principle of agricultural marketing boards, which had been a feature of the agricultural policy of theConservative Government before the war. The farmers had now,however, become apprehensive that the Government might abandonthat principle, and he believed that their confidence in the Govern-ment would not be restored unless it were reaffirmed. The plan which he had outlined in C. (53) 299 would make it plain that theGovernment were prepared to encourage the establishment of pro-ducers&apos; Marketing Boards. Further, by continuing the system of an assured market at pre-determined prices, it would provide the farmerswith the security which they required. At the same time, by itsprovision for the re-sale&apos; of meat in a free market, it would redeemthe Governmenfs pledges to the meat traders and would restorefreedom of choice to consumers. State trading by the Ministry ofFood might, it was true, have to be continued during the interim period before the establishment of the producers&apos; Marketing Board;but he hoped that the Board might be able to begin operations bythe middle of 1955.The Minister said that the farmers, remembering their experienceafter the end of the First World War, were genuinely nervous of theconsequences of de-control. Their fears had been increased by theirtemporary difficulty in disposing of this season&apos;s crops, following thede-control of cereals; and they were on this account the more dis-trustful of the method of. deficiency payments. It was these feelingswhich had led the N.F.Us. to take such a firm stand against any proposals for the future marketing of meat which were based on theprinciple of deficiency payments though it must be admitted thatthey were not yet aware of the suggestion that deficiency payments should be supplemented by a system of buttress prices.Minister of Supply to the Lord President should be laidbefore Parliament on about 8th November and that theWhite Paper should be presented to Parliament at thesame time.(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the necessary legislation to be ready for introduction early in 1954.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider whichMinister should take charge of this legislation in the Houseof Commons and which Minister should thereafter beresponsible for answering on the Lord Presidents behalfQuestions in the House of Commons in respect of thework of the new Atomic Energy Corporation.
The Minister of Food said that he was strongly opposed to theproposal that his Department should continue State trading in meatuntil such time as a producers&apos; Marketing Board could be estab-lished with monopoly powers. During this interim period, under theplan proposed by the Minister of Agriculture, the Ministry of food would be required to buy meat at fixed prices and re-sell it in a freemarket for what it would fetch. The Ministry would be unable tocontrol the quality or the quantity of the meat offered by producers and would have to sell it to traders enjoying, for the first time forfourteen years, the right to refuse meat which they did not want toaccept. This was a bad commercial proposition for any GovernmentDepartment to undertake. Moreover, the meat traders would bebitterly opposed to this system and would therefore have every reasonto increase the Departments potential losses. The producers wouldalso have a positive incentive to increase them, since the initial amountof the Exchequer assistance to the new Marketing Board, when itwas established, was to be determined by reference to the tradingloss incurred by the Ministry in the last year before the establishmentof the Board. Such a system would also make it necessary for theMinistry to continue to control meat imports and to engage in thebulk purchase of foreign meat during the interim period. Finally,there could be no assurance that this interim system could be broughtto an end by the middle of 1955. A long and complicated procedurehad to be complied with before a producers&apos; Marketing Board couldbe established. If therefore the Government adopted the planproposed by the Minister of Agriculture, it seemed likely that theMinistry of Food would still be trading in meat, at heavy cost to theExchequer, at the time of the next General Election. Monopolytrading in meat by a central agency was in fact open to very serious objections, as indicated in paragraph 10 of C. (53) 298. And,politically, it could be represented as a stage towards the nationalisa-tion of the meat trade.The Minister said that the alternative plan which he had outlined in C. (53) 298 would further the Governments general policy of abolishing bulk purchase and State trading and would at &quot;the sametime provide adequate means of fulfilling the Governments guaranteesto the farmers. It would carry out the Governments pledge to restoreto meat traders the business which had been taken from them at thebeginning of the war. And it would restore freedom of choice tothe consumer. It did not exclude the creation of a producers&apos;Marketing Board, though it was not based on the principle of a singleBoard with powers of monopoly trading.The Prime Minister said that he was impressed by the advantages of the plan put forward by the Minister of Food. It was in accord with the general theme of the Governments policy for relaxingcontrols and restoring free markets, and abandoning State tradingand bulk purchase. At the same time it would honour the Govern-ments guarantees to the farmers by way of an Exchequer subsidybased on the two principles of deficiency payments and buttressprices. The farmers could insist that the Government should carryout these guarantees; but it was for the Government to determineby what methods they should do so. He himself preferred that thepublic should pay through taxation such sums as were required toensure the stability of British agriculture, and that the prices which,as consumers, they paid for home-produced food should be left to bedetermined by the operation of a free market.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the present Govern-ment were not committed to the principle of producers&apos; marketing boards with powers of monopoly trading. In the AgriculturalCharter published by the Conservative Party in 1948 it had been stated that &quot;the basis of good marketing in the future should beproducers&apos; co-operation both through voluntary organisations and through statutory Marketing Boards.&quot; It had clearly been contem-plated that the method would vary according to the requirements ofdifferent commodities.
The Chancellor said that the Minister of Agriculture hadremoved some of the worst features in the proposals put forward by the N.F.Us., but even his modified scheme as outlined inC. (53) 299 seemed to be too ambitious. It would be highly dangerous to establish a single agency responsible for buying at fixed prices allhome-produced meat, involving an annual turnover of about  300millions, and for selling it for what it would fetch on a free market.He could not accept the unlimited liability which this would createfor the Exchequer. The scheme was unsound financially and, evenif it were well received by the farmers in the first instance, it would expose the Government to damaging criticism in later years. Oneconomic and financial grounds, there could be no doubt that thesystem of deficiency payments and buttress prices proposed by theMinister of Food was the better plan. But it would not be easy to persuade the N.F.Us. to accept it. They were in a difficult mood,and were disposed to reject out of hand any scheme based on theprinciple of deficiency payments. Further thought should thereforebe given to the means of presenting such a plan to the farmers. Itmight be helpful if their representatives were invited to co-operatefrom the outset in framing long-term arrangements for promotingefficient marketing. A Marketing Council might perhaps be estab-lished to consider the problems listed in paragraph 3 of the appendix to C. (53) 298. But if, after further consideration, Ministers feltthat it would be impossible to persuade the farmers&apos; representatives to accept a plan on the general lines proposed by the Minister ofFood in C. (53) 298, the alternative course would be to set up anindependent committee of enquiry to consider the whole problem.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The suggestion of an independent enquiry was open to twoobjections. First, criticism of the Governments agricultural policy had arisen largely from the delay in announcing plans for the futuremarketing of home-produced foodstuffs, and it was likely to increaseif one of the most important aspects of this problem were nowremitted for independent enquiry. Secondly, the appointment of acommittee of enquiry would mean that the Ministry of Food wouldhave to continue for a further year the existing system of state trading in meat.(b) The Cabinet were informed that the Government of NorthernIreland supported the plan outlined by the Minister of agriculture in C. (53) 299.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Governmentwould have difficulty, both with the farmers and with many of theirown supporters in Parliament, if they appeared to reject the principleof producers&apos; Marketing Boards. On the other hand, it was argued that the creation of Marketing Boards with powers of monopolytrading was not a suitable remedy for universal application and, ifpressed as such, would be strongly opposed by some government supporters.Id) The Government were under no less an obligation to fulfill their pledges to the meat-traders than to carry out their undertakings to the farmers.(e) Although the balance of the economic and financialarguments might lie in favour of the plan proposed by the Ministerof Food in C. (53) 298, there would be serious political difficulty in securing its acceptance. It would be unwise to confront the N.F.Us.with it as a firm Government decision. Further thought shouldbe given to the possibility of making adjustments and additions whichmight make it more acceptable to the farmers and to certain sectionsof Government supporters in Parliament.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that policy proposals for the future marketing of meat and bacon should be worked out on the general lines of the plan proposed by the Minister of Food inC. (53) 298.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theMinisters of Food and Agriculture and the Secretary ofState for Scotland and other interested members of theCabinet, what additions and adjustments could be madeto that plan with a view to making it more acceptable to the farmers and, in particular, how a system of&quot; buttress prices &quot; for meat and bacon would be operated in practice and how it could be reconciled with the provi-sions of section 5 of the Agriculture Act, 1947; and alsoto consider how proposals on these lines could best be presented to the farmers&apos; representatives and to Govern-ment supporters.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of this problem later in the week, in the light of the results of the discussions to be undertaken in pursuance of Conclusion (2) above.Commercial 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would bePolicy. attending the Ministerial meeting of the Organisation for European(Previous        Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) in Paris on 29th and 30th October.Reference:      He proposed to announce at that meeting the decision, reached byC.C. (53) 23rd   the Economic Policy Committee, that our trade with O.E.E.C.Conclusions,     countries should be further liberalised to a figure of 75 per cent.Minute 4.)       He would not announce the particular commodities to which thisliberalisation would apply until a later stage.   This meant that the tourist allowance must be raised from  40 to  50, which was thestatutory minimum laid down by O.E.E.C.The Foreign Secretary supported the proposals of the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The Cabinet Endorsed the decision regarding the liberalisation of our trade with Europe which the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed to announce in general terms at the forthcoming meeting of O.E.E.C. in Paris.Tariff Policy. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theThe G.A.T.T.   President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 300) reporting the results(Previous        of a meeting of the Contracting Parties of the General AgreementReference:      on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) which had ended on 24th October.C.C.

We had abstained from voting on this resolution and should not sign the protocol:The Contracting Parties had agreed to a waiver of the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule which gave us a general dispensation from theobligation to impose duties on Commonwealth goods in cases where we imposed or raised most-favoured-nation duties on foreign goodsin order to protect United Kingdom industries. This waiver was limited by conditions more stringent than those which we had proposed, but it conceded the substance of our claim.The Contracting Parties had also agreed that the period withinwhich there could not be re-negotiation of &quot; bound &quot; tariffs shouldbe extended by a further eighteen months.The Cabinet Took note of this report on the results of the recent meetingof the Contracting Parties of the G.A.T.T.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27th October, 1953.
