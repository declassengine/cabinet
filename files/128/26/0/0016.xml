Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of. Commons in the following week.&apos; ^........ . ITelevision 3.   jjie -pr(me Minister recalled that on 25th November, 1952,Development, the Cabinet had agreed that no decision to extend television to. further(Previous areas in the United Kingdom should be taken for a period of sixReference: months. Government supporters&apos;in the House of Commons wereC.C. (52) 100th now urging, however,  that temporary television facilities should be conclusions, provided, before the Coronation, for Portsmouth, Plymouth andMinute7.) Aberdeen,1 He understood that satisfactory arrangements had beenmade to relay television transmissions to Brighton; and, if similar arrangements could be made for the three towns which he had mentioned, much public . dissatisfaction in those areas might be avoided.The Postmaster-General said that in the time now available for the Coronation nothing better than a&apos;make-shift service couldbe provided for these areas. The extent of this would be limited:it could not&apos; be made available to residents in all parts of the areas.It would also be unreliable, because it would be subject to atmosphericinterference; and it was possible that conditions on Coronation Daymight be such that the television programme could not be received in any of these areas at all. On both counts it seemed to him to beunjustifiable to allow people in these areas to be encouraged to buyexpensive television sets in&apos; the hope of receiving television pro-grammes which&apos;in the event many of&apos;them might be unable to see:43862 &apos; . b 2
Moreover, these temporary facilities could not be.continued after the coronation; and, if local residents had bought television sets, theGovernment would be under strong pressure to proceed at once withthe permanent extension of the television service to these.areas.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, in the circumstances described by the Postmaster-General, it would be inexpedient to pro-vide these temporary television facilities.The Cabinet  .(1) Agreed that no temporary arrangements should be made toenable the television programme of the Coronation toV   .        be received in Portsmouth, Plymouth and Aberdeen.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to consult with the Common-wealth Secretary regarding the means by which this,    .  .      decision should be made known to Government supporters in the House of Commons and, if necessary, to the general public. .East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 15thConclusions,Minute 10.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (53) 81) and the Secretary of State forCo-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power (C. (53) 80) on thepossibilities of imposing further restrictions on exports from theUnited Kingdom to China and on the use of British shipping imtheChina trade.      &apos;The Cabinet agreed that, as regards control over exports fromthe United Kingdom to China, the Foreign Secretary should have no great difficulty in defending our record&apos; against American criticisms.We were entitled to ask that we should npt be pressed to do morethan other European countries were willing to do. We were alreadytrying to induce the other countries in the Paris Group to make theircontrols over exports to China as effective as our own, and we could resonably ask that the other countries should match what we were doing before we were pressed to do more.The Cabinet recognised, however, that we were more vulnerable to American criticisms of the participation of British shipping in the china trade and of British assistance to foreign ships engaged in that trade. Their discussion turned mainly on the suggestions put forward in C. (53) 80 for meeting some of those criticisms.The first of those suggestions was that we might offer to prohibit the carriage of strategic goods to China in ships registered in theUnited Kingdom or the Colonies, and to join with the United StatesGovernment in persuading other maritime countries to do likewise.On this the following points were raised: -(a) The control suggested would be imposed by an order under defence Regulation 46. ,It was pointed out that this Regulation wasnot being used at present and was to have been included among theRegulations to be revoked before the next annual review of emergency powers at the end of the year. Critics of the continued use ofemergency powers would doubtless argue in Parliament that, ifcontrols of this kind were likely to be required for some time to comefor the purposes of the cold war, a fresh legislative sanction for their use should be sought from Parliament. It would in any. event be wise to seek the views of the Law Officers on the question whetherDefence Regulation 46 could properly be used for the purposes now envisaged.(b) The proposed control would be applied only to ships above a certain size, and the prohibition would extend only to a short listof strategic goods readily identifiable by ships&apos; masters.(c) The order under Defence Regulation 46 would apply to all ships registered in the United Kingdom or Colonies; but in singapore and possibly some other Colonies new legislation would be required before proceedings for breach of the order could be taken againstowners or masters of ships domiciled there.
(d) If there was likely to be any delay, in bringing the new orderinto operation, owners of British ships might in the meantime beasked to take special steps to avoid accepting cargoes of strategic goods for destinations in China. -The second suggestion was that foreign ships carrying strategiccargoes to China should be refused bunlcering facilities in british ports, or by British companies in foreign ports, oh the understandingthat the United States Government would join with us in seekingconsent to this procedure by the foreign and Commonwealth countries concerned, either as the owners of the ships affected or as controlling the ports in which bunkering facilities might be refused. On this thefollowing points were raised:  (e) The Cabinet agreed that, while it would be valuable to havethe support of the United States in any approach to the foreigncountries concerned, it would be preferable that the United KingdomGovernment should handle alone the necessary negotiations withother Commonwealth Governments.(/) Appropriate procedures should be devised to reduce the needfor inter-departmental consultation in London on each separateoccasion on which bunkering facilities were to be denied under thispolicy. It should be possible to arrange that, when a ship was knownto be engaged in this traffic, bunkering facilities would be denied toher unless special instructions to the contrary were given to anyparticular port.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider the other suggestionsdiscussed in C. (53) 80. They agreed that, for the reasons indicatedin&apos;paragraph .13 of the, memorandum, no undertaking could properly be given to withhold at British ports stores, water or repairs fromships carrying strategic goods to China. As regards the complaint that ships operating on behalf of Chinese Communist interests hadbeen registered in Hong Kong to secure the protection of the british flag, the Cabinet agreed that it would not be practicable to take powerto remove these vessels from the British Register. Moreover, if licensing system were introduced under Defence Regulation&apos; 46, therewould be-positive advantage in keeping these ships on the BritishRegister so as to bring them within the control over the carriage of strategic goods to China. It would certainly be embarrassing if theRoyal Navy were required to protect such a ship from interferenceby Chinese Nationalist forces. This situation could best be avoidedby refraining from affording naval protection to British shipping inthe Straits of Formosa and conveying a private&apos;warning to reputableowners of British ships that their vessels should, for the time being,avoid passing through those waters.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, as regards control over exports from the UnitedKingdom to China, the policy of the United KingdomGovernment should be defended against Americancriticism on the basis indicated in sub-paragraphs (1) and(2) of paragraph 9 of C. (53) 81. :(2) As regards shipping engaged in the China trade, approved the recommendations made in paragraphs 19 and 20 ofC. (53) 80,, subject to (i) confirmation by the Law officers that the licensing control proposed in paragraph 5 of that memorandum was intra vires the powers conferred by defence Regulation 46, and (ii) the reservation that anyrequest for co-operation by other commonwealth governments should be made by the United Kingdom...... -     Government alone.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to take such steps as might be necessary to ensure that reputable British ship-ping companies were privately warned that it would be. advisable for the time being that ships owned by them,   .        should not pass through the Straits of Formosa.
international labour conference,1951.United Nations.PersonnelPolicy.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (C. (53) 76) seeking authority for the issue of a White Paperdeclaring the Governments attitude to two Conventions&apos;and fourRecommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference&apos;in 1951.The Minister of Labour said that the constitution of the Inter-national Labour Organisation required member States to bring Con-ventions and Recommendations before the competent authority intheir own country. The practice in the United Kingdom was toindicate the Governments proposals to Parliament by means of a white Paper. The points requiring consideration on this occasionwere:- - &apos; - .     ,, (i) A Convention on the machinery for fixing minimum wages inagriculture. He proposed that this should be ratified and that theRecommendations accompanying it should be accepted, subject toreservations on two paragraphs.(ii) A Convention on equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value. He proposed that this convention should be deferred since, although it was acceptable in principle, itcould not in existing circumstances be put into practice in the UnitedKingdom. , - &apos;(iii) A Recommendation on collective agreements. This was acceptable, subject to, certain reservations.(iv) A Recommendation on conciliation and arbitration. Themachinery recommended was already in use in this country and thisRecommendation could therefore be accepted.TheCabinet  v .Approved the proposals made by the Minister of labour in G. (53) 76 for dealing with the Conventions and Recom-mendations of the InternationaFLabour Conference, 1951,and authorised him to present these proposals to parliament in a White Paper. , ...6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (C. (53) 84) seeking approval of the line to be followed bythe United Kingdom Delegation to the United Nations in a debate in the Assembly on a report on personnel policy submitted by theSecretary-General.    ,The Minister of State said that this report was designed to allayAmerican fears about possible violations of United States law by united States members of the United Nations Secretariat. On manygrounds it would have been preferable that our Delegation should express no opinions in this debate, but it seemed necessary to siiowsome sympathy with the United States Government, who were clearly anxious about this position. He therefore proposed that theUnited Kingdom Delegation should be authorised to say that they- accepted the Secretary-GeneraFs views on the international character and independence of the Secretariat, approved his intention to. dis-pense with the services of any member of the Secretariat who was believed to be engaging in subversive activities against any member government, and supported his view that any accusation must bewell supported by evidence. The Secretary-General had also askedfor the assistance of member States in checking the character andrecord of members of the staff. On this point it was proposed tosay that we should be willing to furnish particulars of United kingdom nationals in such detail as our security regulations allowed.  This,in(4) Invited the Minister of. State to prepare, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, a&apos; draft of a telegraminforming the Foreign Secretary of the Cabinets conclu-sions and to submit the draft for approval by the PrimeMinister.
territorial waters:IcelandFisheriesDispute(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3.)effect -meant that little information &quot;would be provided, and that nothing would be said which might in any way compromise the sources of the information. Finally, the Secretary-General had proposed to rule that anyone who invoked the privilege against self-incrimination(as permitted under the Fifth Amendment) and refused to answer questions had thereby shown his unfitness for employment by theUnited Nations. In practice this was doubtless a sound position totake, but, although the United Kingdom Delegation would not opposeit, it was preferable that they should show no enthusiasm in its support.The Cabinet Approved the memorandum by the Minister of State(C. (53) 84) and authorised him to instruct the United King-dom Delegation to the United Nations accordingly.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 77) reporting the state of negotiations with the Iceland Government on the fisheries dispute.The Minister of State said that the Iceland Government had now stated that they were ready to discuss with us how the dispute should be brought before the International Court, provided that the landing ban would be lifted immediately agreement had been reachedupon the form of the submission. It was therefore not certain either that the Iceland Government would agree to go to the Court at all,or that they would agree to go, as we wished, on the Faxa Bay issueonly. It was now necessary to consider whether any guarantee couldbe given about the raising of the ban on landings in this country and,if so, in what form. It would be useless to go back to the iceland government with a repetition of our previous proposals, and he therefore recommended that a meeting should be arranged, with theBritish fishing interests at which the Foreign Secretary and the.Minister of Agriculture should seek to obtain as firm an undertakingas possible that the ban would be lifted after a ruling had been givenby the International Court.&apos; If this undertaking could be obtained,the Iceland Government would then be asked to give an assurance that they agreed to go to the Court^on the Faxa Bay issue alone.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Agriculture supported the proposals madeby the Foreign Secretary but said that the only chance of obtaining the assent of British fishing interests was to convince them that thepresent proposals for dealing with this dispute offered the best, and perhaps the only, hope of improving our general position as a.fishing nation. . ;..(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that the Aberdeentrawler owners should be included in the proposed consultation withthe fishing interests.The Cabinet Approved the proposals made in paragraphs 4 (b) and 6 ofC. (53) 77.   . .Farm price review.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 45thConclusions,Minuted.)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofAgriculture and the Minister of Food (C. (53) 79 and 78) reporting that the Ministers concerned had reached agreement on all the matters to be discussed in the forthcoming annual review of agricultural prices,with the single exception of the amount of the increase to be offered in the price of milk.    .      ,:The Minister of Agriculture said that, while the Governmentwere introducing a new economic system for agriculture combiningfreedom with stability, it was of the utmost importance to avoidundermining the confidence of the farmers by pressing them too hard
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,-I 3rd March, 1953.on profit margins; He had agreed.to several measures, including a significant under-recoupment of the increased costs of pig-raising,which it would be difficult enough to persuade the farmers to accept;but on milk he thought it essential to give farmers something not very far short of full recoupment for their increased costs. Full recoup-ment would be - 82d. per gallon. He sought authority to offer upto %d. although he thought it might well be necessary to go up to %djThe effect of giving -fd. would be to increase the cost of milk by \d.a pint for 104- weeks between July and September. The Minister ofFood, on the other hand, was proposing &quot;that only \d. a gallonshould be offered, and this would represent \d. a pint increase for ^- weeks. The difference between them was, therefore, only \d. apint for 6 weeks for the consumer, but for the milk producers it&quot; was as much as  3 millions.      -.-   -The Minister of Food said that he would have preferred to offer no increase in the price of milk, but he was prepared to go as far as ;\d. a gallon for the purpose of retaining the confidence of the farmers.Milk production was not unprofitable, the average net profit being94-rf. a gallon. If it were made still more profitable, this would inducemore high-cost production at a time when the real needs of thenation were for more meat, cereals and eggs. While it was no doubtpolitically important to consider the claims :of the farmers, it mustnot be forgotten that the Government had already, by reductions inthe food subsidies, added  300 millions to the cost of food to theconsumer. ,In discussion the following points were made:  :(a) The Minister of Labour expressed concern about the effectof a rise in the price of milk upon the cost-of-living index. The indexhad been steady for eight months, though it might go up by one pointin the near future. Any further rise was likely to provoke demands for increased wages.  In reply, the Minister of Agriculture said that&apos; he estimated that the effect of the whole of the award in the farm price review, including %d. per gallon for milk, would not represent ,more than two-fifths of a point on the cost-of-living index.(b) Although milk production was undoubtedly profitable for larger farmers with good land, it was by no means so profitable for small farmers in remote districts. It was argued, on the other hand,that it was unwise to encourage farmers to produce milk if they couldnot do so economically. -(c) If production of milk increased as a result of a generousaward, there might be an additional demand for imported feeding-stuffs,, with a damaging effect upon the balance of payments. It waspointed out, on the other hand, that the^greatest risk of an increased&apos;  demand for feeding-stuffs was for pigs, and it was on. this account that less favourable prices were proposed for.pig-meat.(d) The milk subsidy was&apos; at present running at  90 millions per year. An increase in the price of milk would make it more.difficultto reduce the subsidy; and any consequent increase in milk production would automatically increase the total paid in subsidy.The Prime Minister said that he would be glad if a small numberof independent Ministers could give the Cabinet the benefit of their advice on this question&apos; after reviewing the economic and political arguments on either side.The Cabinet  -Invited the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Housing andthe Paymaster-General to consider what increase in the priceof milk should be offered to dairy farmers in the farm price review, and to report to the Cabinet not later than.10th March.
