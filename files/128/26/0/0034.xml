Government after consultation with the United Kingdom Governmentand other Governments concerned.  President Eisenhower had saidthat he would welcome some such indication of our support for theseproposals; and the Prime Minister had felt that the statement wasone which he could issue without prior reference to the Cabinet.  -The Cabinet-Endorsed the action taken by the Prime Minister in issuingthis statement.East-west trade.British shipping in the ChinaTrade.(previous references:C.C. (53) 16thConclusions,Minute 4, and30th Conclu-sions, Minute 9.)2. The Prime Minister referred to recent comments by membersof the United States Congress on the extent to which British ships were engaging in trade with Communist China. Fie hoped that itwould be. possible to deny the particular allegation that chinese communist troops had been carried in a British ship.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that he was investigating this allegation. It was con-ceivable that this use might have been made of some ship which hadbeen chartered by Chinese Communist interests some years ago onbare-boat terms and was still flying the British flag though outsideBritish control. He hoped to be able to show that this was not so and he would submit a report to the Prime Minister as soon aspossible.The President of the Board of Trade said that, as regards the shipment of strategic goods to China, we could show that we wereexercising a more effective control than any of the European countries.The Prime Minister asked that a draft statement should be pre-pared on both points and held in readiness for use at the appropriate moment to rebut criticisms made in Congress.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a draft statementrebutting recent American criticisms of British activities inthe China trade to be prepared in consultation with theDepartments concerned and submitted for consideration bythe Cabinet.Sudan, 3;   In continuation of their discussion on 21st April the Cabinet(Previous were informed of certain measures which had beeh put in hand to reference: counteract Egyptian propaganda in the Sudan during the periodG.G (53) 28th before the holding of the Sudanese elections.Conclusions.

The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Prime MinisterRepresentation of Malta had been persuaded to rescind his decision that Maltaof Malta.       should not be represented at the Coronation and that the local Coro-(Previous        nation festivities in the Island should be cancelled. He had, however,Reference:      done so on condition that, in addition to the other concessions men-C.C.

Westminster Abbey.   As the number of coaches was limited, this had meant that other Prime Ministers had had to be asked tosharea coach; and it had not so far been found possible to arrive at asolution by agreement with the other Prime Ministers concerned.In discussion it was suggested that, if no other solution couldbe found, one motor car might have to be included in this part ofthe procession.The Cabinet -Authorised the Prime Minister and the commonwealth secretary to decide on their behalf what arrangements could best be made to gratify the desire of the Prime Minister of-  Malta to ride in the Coronation procession.Gold coast and Nigeria.constitutional developments.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 16thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (53) 154) informing them of constitutional developments in the Gold Coast and Nigeria.The Colonial Secretary said that, if the Gold Coast was to con-tinue to be governed by consent, further constitutional changes were now inescapable. The Governor was reasonably confident that thenext stage of constitutional advance could be restricted to internal affairs, the main changes contemplated being the transfer of finance and perhaps also of Justice to representative Ministers and the restric-tion of membership of the Legislative Assembly to persons chosen by direct elections throughout the territory by universal adult suffrage.It was proposed that the United Kingdom Government should insist on retaining responsibility for External Affairs and Defence, includingPolice, and should not be prepared to discuss the possibility of this being transferred. He believed that the political leaders in the gold coast would be willing to co-operate on this basis.In discussion the view was strongly expressed that the political leaders in the Gold Coast should be left under no illusion that, if they4. The Prime Minister said that he had asked the Secretary ofState for War to arrange for a sufficient number of officers and menof the Royal Welsh Fusiliers to be moved from Jamaica to Bermudain order to provide a guard of honour and perform other dutiesduring his forthcoming meeting with President Eisenhower and thePrime Minister of France.The Secretary of State for War said that, if these troops had toproceed to Bermuda by sea, they would be unable to play their partin the Coronation celebrations in Jamaica. He therefore proposedthat they should be moved by air after those celebrations were over.He would arrange for the movement to be carried out in modemaircraft provided by the British Overseas Airways Corporation.The Cabinet-Agreed that these troops should be moved from Jamaica to-        Bermuda by air as proposed by the Secretary of State forWar. -

(53) 154.The Colonial Secretary said that in Nigeria the collapse of thecumbrous Constitution established under the auspices of the labour government had provided an opportunity of according a largermeasure of autonomy to the 14 million Moslem inhabitants of theNorthern provinces who were more favourably disposed to thiscountry than the Southern Nigerians. Centralised administration should be confined as far as possible to such matters as railways, whichhad to provide adequately for the movement of agricultural producefrom the North to the South for shipment.TheCabinet-Took note of C. (53) 154 and of the :points made in their discussion.        ....CanadianInterest-FreeLoan.CPreviousReference:C.C, (52) 104thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 159) seeking approval for the repayment of the balance of the interest-free loan of $700 millionsmade to the United Kingdom by the Canadian Government in 1942.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under the settlementnow proposed by the Canadian Government, the United kingdom would make a lump-sum payment of $49 millions and would there-after repay the remainder of the loan by quarterly payments amoiint-ing to $30 millions a year during the years 1954-58. In return theCanadian Government would forthwith release the  600 millions ofUnited Kingdom-owned. Canadian securities from the restrictions towhich they had been subject since 1942. The removal of these restric-tions. would be likely to increase our dollar income and our share inCanada&apos;s development. The date for making the lump-sum pay-ment would be fixed in agreement with our Embassy in Washington,which had advised that such a payment to Canada while the questionof further defence aid for the United Kingdom was still before Con-gress might be exploited by hostile elements as a reason for reducing our appropriation.        ...The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in C. (53) 159.Unpaid Public 8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the SecretaryService. (C. (53) 160) covering correspondence between the General SecretaryExpense 0f the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) and the Prime Minister aboutAllowances.     the expense allowances made to persons undertaking various formsof unpaid public service, together with the draft of a further letterfrom the Prime Minister to Sir Vincent Tewson.In discussion there was general agreement that, for the reasons give in the second paragraph of the draft letter, it would not be rightto meet the T.U.C.&apos;s request to be consulted on the final drafts ofany regulations.The Lord Privy Seal said that there was no prospect of early legislation to make jurors&apos; compensation for loss of earnings deter-minable by statutory instrument. -
The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to reply to the Secretary-Generalof the Trades Union Congress in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (53) 160.9. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(subsequently circulated as C. (53) 191) covering copies of a minutefrom the.Lord President to the Prime Minister and a memorandumon the subject of the Regency.The Lord President said that it was understood to be The Queen&apos;swish that, before she left on her Australian tour, provision shouldhave been made whereby, if she should die before Prince Charlesattained the age of eighteen, the Duke of Edinburgh would becomeRegent and guardian of the Sovereign. The issues raised by the queen&apos;s request were set out in the memorandum accompanying his minute of 21st May to the Prime Minister. At the Prime Ministersrequest he had discussed these issues with the Lord Chancellor, theHome Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Scotland. With the exception of the Secretary of State forScotland, they had all agreed to recommend that the Governmentshould invite Parliament to pass legislation giving effect to the queen&apos;s wish, which was understood to be shared by the othermembers of the Royal Family who were directly concerned. they proposed that the suggested alteration in the arrangements embodied in the Regency Act, 1937, should be an ad hoc alteration in respectof the Duke of Edinburgh only, as there could be no certainty thata Consort would always be a suitable person to act as sole Regent.They further recommended that the Regency Act, 1937, should alsobe amended so as to provide that, in the event of The Queen&apos;sincapacity, Prince Charles would become Regent on attaining the ageof eighteen instead of twenty-one.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he would himselfprefer that the Regency should be put into commission by the creationof a Council of Regency. This would provide more satisfactorily forall possible eventualities, including the possibility that The queen and the Duke of Edinburgh might be killed together in an aircraftaccident, and it might be more readily acceptable to opinion inParliament and the country. If a Council of Regency were considered to be impracticable, might it not be possible to leave the matter tobe dealt with urgently, if the need should actually arise, in the lightof the circumstances then existing?It was pointed out that, if no action were taken now, PrincessMargaret would automatically become Regent in the event of the queen&apos;s death or incapacity, and that to deprive her of the Regencyat that stage&apos; might well present greater difficulties than to amend theAct now on the lines desired by the Royal Family.The Home Secretary said that he had been greatly influenced by the fact that all the precedents (quoted in Appendix -I to thememorandum before the Cabinet) supported The Queen&apos;s request.The Lord Privy Seal suggested that the force of the precedentsquoted had been weakened by the.fact that in 1937 Parliament had established by statute a principle which represented a definitedeparture from them.The Lord Chancellor said that there was very scanty information about the grounds on which the principle embodied in the RegencyAct, 1937, had been adopted by the Government of that day. they appeared to have been influenced primarily by the desire to have &quot; an automatic plan &quot;; but he doubted whether this was in fact a matter which could be determined satisfactorily by the automatic applicationof a pre-determined rule.
The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Commonwealthposition in this matter, which was complicated, was set (Jut at length in paragraphs 10-14 of the memorandum before the Cabinet. TheLord Chancellor had since advised that the Regency Act of 1937 oughtalmost certainly to be held not to apply to Australia and New Zealandwith the result that in those countries, as in Canada and South Africa,there would be no Regent in the event of The Queen&apos;s death orincapacity. The position in Pakistan and Ceylon, on the other hand,was that, in the absence of further legislation applying to them.Princess Margaret would become Regent in the event of The Queen^death or incapacity. Both Mr. St. Laurent and Mr. Menzies, whom he had sounded privately on the matter, had indicated their agreementwith the proposal to amend the Regency Act, 1937, so as to enablethe Duke of Edinburgh to be Regent. He proposed to take theopportunity provided by the presence of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters in London for the Coronation to discuss the matter at ameeting with them at which he would be grateful for the lord chancellor&apos;s assistance.i The Lord Chancellor said that there was room for two opinionson the question whether the Regency Act of 1937 must be held toapply to Australia and New Zealand, but on balance he was inclined to the view that the Act did not so apply. He would like to take theopportunity of discussing the matter privately with Sir Owen Dixon,the Chief Justice of Australia, who was now in this country.The general view of the Cabinet was that, as the Royal Familywere united in the desire that, in the event of The Queen&apos;s death orincapacity, the Duke of Edinburgh should become sole Regent, theGovernment would not be justified in resisting this desire, which was supported by all the precedents. Before formal advice in this sensewas tendered to The Queen, however, it would be necessary to consultinformally, not Only Commonwealth Prime Ministers, but also theLeaders of the Labour and Liberal Parties in this country.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to indicate informally to the queen that the Government were willing to invite Parliamentto pass the necessary legislation to amend the provisionsof the Regency Act, 1937, in accordance with Her Majesty&apos;swishes; that, before formal advice could be tendered to her majesty in this sense, it would be necessary to consultCommonwealth Prime Ministers and the Leaders of theOpposition Parties in this country; and that it was hopedthat these consultations could be completed within two orthree weeks with a view to the passing of the necessary legislation before The Queen&apos;s departure on her tour ofAustralia and New Zealand.Cabinet Office, SWA,27th May, 1953.
The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to reply to the Sedretary-Generalof the Trades Union Congress in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (53) T60. &apos;
