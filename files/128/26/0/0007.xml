2. The Lord Privy Seal invited the Cabinet to consider what line should be taken by the Government spokesman in the debate inthe House of Commons on the following day on a Private Member&apos;motion (by Mr. Colegate, M.P.) urging the early introduction of legis-lation to give effect to the objectives of the Gowers Report on thepreservation of historic houses. On 21st October the Cabinet had agreed that assistance towards the preservation of historic houses should be given by way of Exchequer grants, and had authorised thepreparation of legislation on that basis. This had not been mentionedin The Queen&apos;s Speech, but the Prime Minister had said in the debate on the Address that the Government hoped to proceed with ameasure on this subject when time permitted. The preparation ofthis legislation was well advanced; and Mr. Colegate&apos;s Motion wouldnot have presented any difficulty had it not been for the fact that theLord President had recently called in question the principle on whichthe Government^ Bill was based. In a memorandum to the HomeAffairs Committee he had suggested that assistance to the owners of historic houses should take the form of relief from taxation; and theCommittee had recommended the Prime Minister to appoint a small body of Ministers to re-examine the whole question and report on itto the Cabinet. The Government would not therefore be able in theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons to promise early legis-lation on this subject. Would it be possible to indicate that a white paper announcing the Government^ intentions would be presented in the course of the present session?The Cabinet agreed that, despite their earlier decision of21st October, they must review their policy on this matter in thelight of the considerations which had since been brought forward by the Lord President. They further agreed that no final decision should be taken until the Lord President, who was indisposed, was able to take part in their further discussion of the matter. It followed that nothing should be said in the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons which would prejudge that discussion. It could be saidthat the Government were in full sympathy with the objectives ofthe Gowers Report, but were still considering the detailed methods by which these could best be attained: that it was still the Govern -ment&apos;s intention to introduce legislation on this subject when timepermitted, but the difficulties of the Parliamentary time-table were such that it could not yet be stated when the Bill would be introduced.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Works to speak on the Government^behalf in the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on the preservation of historic houses, and tomake a temporising statement on the lines indicated inthe Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint a CabinetCommittee to ^-examine the policy underlying the pro-posed Bill for the preservation of historic houses and toreport on this to the Cabinet.:- 3 b 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
SoHousing Policy.(previous references:C.C. (52) 85thConclusions,Minute 7,and 101stConclusions,Minute 1.)3.   The Cabinet had before them (i) two general memoranda by the Minister of Housing(C. (53) 23 and 24) outlining proposals for a compre-hensive housing policy;(ii) memoranda by the Minister of Housing (C. (53) 26) andthe Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 33) submittingdetailed proposals for legislation amending the rent restriction Acts;(hi) a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Housing (C. (53) 25) setting out proposals for legislation to provide a new basis of valuation for rates.The Minister of Housing said that he did not ask for immediatedecisions on all the proposals set out in these memoranda. It would suffice if the Cabinet would at this stage decide in principle that heshould aim at presenting to Parliament in the early summer a white paper outlining a comprehensive housing policy and a Bill dealingwith rents and repairs. A corresponding Bill for Scotland could beintroduced about the same time. The Valuation Bill would then beintroduced in the following session. If this plan were approved inprinciple, authority could be given for the drafting of the three Bills,and he might perhaps have the assistance of a Cabinet committee with which he could discuss the questions of policy which would arise in the preparation of this legislation. The results of this Com-mittee&apos;s work would, of course, be submitted for the cabinet&apos;s approval in due course.In discussion there was general agreement with the plan of actionsuggested by the Minister of Housing. The following particular points were also raised:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would assist them in the presentation of his Budget if it were known at that time that the Government were proposing legislation on the subject of rents against the general background of a comprehensive housing policy. He therefore hoped that the White Paper and the Rent bill might be ready for presentation in April rather than May.(b) It was suggested that the proposals for ensuring the repair of existing houses, as set out in C. (53) 24 and 26, might impose unduehardship on landlords. This point should be considered by theCabinet Committee, which was to review the policy as a whole.(c) It was also possible that these proposals might have the resultthat an undue proportion of the available building resources wasdiverted to the repair of houses. This point should also be kept inmind by the proposed Committee.(d) Nothing should be said publicly at this stage which might indicate that the Government were proposing to introduce legislation to amend the Rent Restriction Acts.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that an immediate start should be made with thepreparation of draft legislation to amend the rent restriction Acts and the Rating and Valuation Acts, asproposed in C. (53) 25, 26 and 33.(2) Appointed a Cabinet Committee consisting of Lord Privy Seal (Chairman);Secretary of State for Scotland;Minister of Housing and Local Government;Minister of Works;Minister of Health;Economic Secretary, Treasury;to review the proposals for a comprehensive housing policy-outlined in these memoranda, to consider points of policywhich emerged in the preparation of the proposed legis-lation, and to advise the Cabinet on the scheme as a whole.
The Coronation.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 5thConclusions,Minute 6.)Form ofCoronationOath.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor and the Home Secretary (C. (53) 45) on the form of the coronation Oath.The Prime Minister said that he had wished the Cabinet to be assured that there was no legal impropriety in altering the form of the oath, without specific statutory sanction, in order to take account of constitutional changes which had been made since the form of Oathwas first prescribed by statute in 1688. It was clear from the memo-randum now before the Cabinet that there was ample precedent for making, without fresh legislation, the kind of variations which were now envisaged.The Cabinet Took note of C. (53) 45.and Title.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 12.)The Royal Style 5. The Prime Minister said that the conclusions reached by theCabinet on 14th January about the Latin version of the Royal Titlehad been reported to him before a formal submission had been madeto Her Majesty. It had seemed to him that the words &quot; Britanniarumet Ceterorum Regnorum Suorum et Terrarum Regina&quot; would strikeharshly upon English ears, and he had asked the Lord chancellor to consider whether a less cumbrous version of this part of the Titlecould not be devised. The Lord Chancellor had now recommended the following alternative: &quot; Britanniarum Regnorumque SuorumCeterorum Regina.&quot;The Prime Minister said that this alternative seemed to him tobe preferable. For himself, however, he regretted the necessity fora Latin version of the Title. The days were long past when Latinhad served as a means of communication between peoples of differentraces; and the English language was to-day spoken or understood bya large proportion of the population of the civilised world.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, the Latinversion of the new form of the Royal Title for use in theUnited Kingdom should be: Elizabeth ii, dei gratiabritanniarum regnorumque suorum ceterorum regina,consortionis populorum princeps, fidei defensor.Commercial ^ 6.   At their meeting on 3rd December the Cabinet had invitedAgreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider which Department shouldArgentina. carry on its Vote a provision to meet possible drawings on the credit(Previous of  20 millions provided under the recent Commercial Agreement withReference: Argentina. They now had before them a memorandum by theC.C. (52) 101st Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 36) reporting that this provisionConclusions, could be carried on the Foreign Office Vote without legislation, and minute 7.) setting out the difficulties involved in promoting legislation to enable it to be carried on the Vote of any other Department.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Foreign Secretary had been unwilling to carry this money on his Vote, for the reasons summarised in paragraph 3 of C. (53) 36.But, in view of the difficulties of any other solution, which were setout elsewhere in that memorandum, he had reluctantly come to theconclusion that he must acquiesce in the proposal that the provision should be carried on his Vote.
The Cabinet Agreed that provision to meet possible drawings on the credit of  20 millions provided in the recent commercial agreement with Argentina should be carried on the ForeignOffice Vote.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 37) dis-cussing what guidance should be given to firms asking to be advisedwhether they should send representatives to the international economicconference which the Chinese Communist Government were pro-posing to hold in Peking in the spring.The President of the Board of Trade said that there was no doubtthat this Conference would be used as an instrument in communist propaganda, and any representatives of British firms who attendedit should be made aware of this and be put on their guard against thetraps which would be set for them. On the other hand it was still our,policy to encourage legitimate trade with China, and we should notdiscourage any British firms which thought that their prospects ofsecuring such trade would be advanced by sending representatives tothe Conference. The Foreign Secretary and he proposed that firmsseeking official guidance should be informed accordingly.In discussion some doubts were voiced about the expediency ofgiving even this degree of encouragement to British firms who were considering sending representatives to this Conference. We had gained little trade from the similar conference held in Moscow, andit seemed doubtful whether the possible commercial advantage whichwe might obtain if British firms were represented at the PekingConference would outweigh the political disadvantage of appearing to seek closer association with Communist China. The attitudesuggested in C. (53) 37 was liable to be misinterpreted by both Govern-ment and public opinion in the United States.On the other side, the President of the Board of Trade said that,despite the war in Korea, we had not so far thought it necessary toattempt to suspend our legitimate trade with China, and continuedpursuit of that trade was consistent with the maintenance of controlsdesigned to prevent the export of strategic goods and materials to china.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade to discuss therecommendations made in C. (53) 37 with the Foreign Secre-tary, in the light of possible divergences of view between theUnited Kingdom and United States Governments on policy towards China and the Far East; and agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their meeting on 10th February.8. The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Powerand the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (53) 35) asking authority toinform the National Coal Board that a 10 per cent, increase in theprice of coal might be announced as soon as the current wages claimby the miners had been settled; and (ii) a memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour (C. (53.) 44), recom-
mending that, instead of an immediate increase in coal prices, special efforts should be made to work off the National Coal Board&apos;s deficitby increased productivity.The Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that on 12th February the National.Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers were likely to arrive at a wagessettlement on the basis of extending the increase of 6s. Qd. per week to - a larger number of lower-paid workers in the industry. this increase, together with other additional wages costs and estimatedreductions in profits, would mean an estimated deficiency for 1953of  36 millions. This could be very nearly eliminated by a 10 percent, increase in the price of coal from 13th February.. He recom-mended that the National Coal Board should be allowed to introducethis increase in price. They had been carrying forward deficits for six successive years and their total deficit now stood at  14 millions.It was the statutory duty of the Coal Board to balance revenue andexpenditure over the years, and it would be dangerous to encourage them to increase their total indebtedness by withholding consent forthe price increase which they wished to introduce. He thought thatthe National Union of Mineworkers had now been brought to realise the grave economic consequences which had been caused by theirsuccessive wage demands, short-time working and stoppages. Theywere now ready to co-operate with the Coal Board in intensive jointefforts to increase productivity.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that theMinister of Labour was most anxious that nothing should be done which was likely to give rise to a series of demands for increased wages during 1953. An increase in the price of coal might well have this effect, and he had therefore suggested that the Coal Board&apos;sdeficit should be carried for a limited period in the hope that increased productivity would work it off. A 5 per cent, increase in productivity would wipe out the whole deficit by the end of 1953.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis point.On the one hand it was argued that for the Exchequer to carry the Coal Board&apos;s deficit, even for a limited period, was equivalent toa concealed subsidy and would be inconsistent with the Governmentsaim to reduce the level of Government expenditure. Moreover, itwas hardly conceivable that a deficit of  36 millions could be wipedout by increased productivity in a single year. The view was expressed that miners were more likely to work hard to increase production if they had already seen the grave effects of increased coal prices upon the national economy as a whole, and upon the budgetsof every individual household.On the other hand it was argued that an increase in the price ofcoal would lead inevitably to increased costs in transport, steel and a wide range of industries which used power from coal. This would be particularly serious at a moment when the expansion of the exporttrade was of the first importance in restoring the national economy.It would be preferable to attempt to wipe out the Coal Board&apos;s deficitby increased production, and it was argued that it would be easier to appeal to the miners for an increased effort if it could be pointed out to them that, unless they achieved it, the price of coal would have tobe increased, with all the grave consequences indicated above.Further, if coal prices were now increased and subsequently theproduction drive succeeded and a position was reached at whichcoal prices could be reduced, there would be no corresponding reduction of the prices of other commodities which had risen withthe price of coal.The point was made that a decision need not necessarily followimmediately upon the settlement of the current.wages claim. For itwould not be so easy as had previously been assumed to relate this increase in coal prices to the increases in miners&apos; wages.  Although
it could be shown that  21 millions out of the  36 millions deficit was due to additional wages costs, it would be difficult to prevent thepublic from gaining the impression that an increase in wages costing 6 millions was being offset by a 10 per cent, increase in the price ofcoal yielding  44 millions.The Prime Minister said it might be found useful to put beforethe responsible leaders of the National Union of Mineworkers the alternatives which the Cabinet, had discussed. Was the appeal forincreased production more likely to be successful if the price of coalhad already been increased, or if the increase were deferred in thehope that by their efforts they would make it necessary?The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion on coal prices at ameeting during the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th February, 1953.
