Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the remaining two weeks of the current session. It was hoped that the remaining stages of all outstandingBills would be completed in the course of the following week and, ifthe proposed debate on foreign affairs were finished in one day,Parliament could be prorogued on 29th October.  .2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (53) 279) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament.In discussion of the draft the following amendments were agreedupon:  (a) The following new paragraph should be inserted afterparagraph 4:  &quot; My Ministers regret that it has become necessary to sus-pend the constitution of British Guiana.&quot;(b) The words &quot; and the disposal of wind-blown timber inScotland &quot; should be added at the end of paragraph 16.(c) The closing words of paragraph 21 should follow the wording of the long title of the Act and should read: &quot; and to provide forthe return of iron and steel undertakings to private ownership.&quot;(d) A new paragraph in the following terms should be inserted after paragraph 24:  &quot; A measure has been enacted providing for the reorganisa-tion of the University of St. Andrews.&quot;The Cabinet Approved the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Proroga-tion of Parliament annexed to C. (53) 279 subject to the amendments noted above and to certain drafting amend-ments approved in the discussion.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the prorogation ofParliament.The Queen&apos;s 3.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the speech on the Exchequer (C. (53) 280) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on opening of the Opening of Parliament.Parliament. The following points were raised in discussion of this draft:  (a) Scottish Legislation. The Cabinet agreed that appropriateadditions should be made to paragraphs 15 and 22 to cover projectedlegislation to modify the arrangements for the payment of equalisation-tion grant to Scottish local authorities and to provide for a newgoverning body for the Scottish Museum of Antiquities.(b) Atomic Energy. The Minister of Supply suggested that paragraph 19 of the draft would invite debate and Questions inadvance of the presentation of the proposed White Paper and beforedetailed arrangements for the proposed transfer of responsibility hadbeen fully worked out.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should be omitted.(c) Judges&apos; Salaries. The Lord President said that theChancellor of the Exchequer had drawn his attention to certain difficulties of timing in relation to this Bill. If the governments intentions were announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech, but presentation of the Bill was deferred until further progress had been made in thecurrent examination of the remuneration of Ministers and Membersof Parliament, there was a risk that misinformed comments wouldbe made in the Debate on the Address and that criticism would develop among Government supporters before the Governmenfs
Egypt.defence negotiations.Q?previous reference:CC. (53) 57thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 281) and the Minister of Defence (C. (53) 282) onthe stage reached in the defence negotiations with the egyptian government.The Foreign Secretary said that both parties to the negotiations in Cairo now felt that the time had come to bring the discussions toa head and the next meeting between them, which was to be heldwithin the next few days, would evidently be decisive. The UnitedKingdom Delegation had asked for final instructions regarding theattitude which they should adopt at this meeting. They believedthat, if they then declined to make any further concessions, thelatest, proposals had been explained to them. Might it not be preferable to avoid any public reference to the Governments,intentions in this matter until the Bill could be presented and its provisions explained to Government supporters? Delay in publica-tion of the Governmenfs intentions might also be of positive advantage in restraining wage claims.The Minister of Labour said that there was some risk that theproposal to increase the Judges&apos; remuneration would be used insupport of wage claims, whenever it was announced, and he wouldnot wish to urge that the announcement should be delayed on this account.The Cabinet were reminded that on 2nd October they had decided that the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill should be mentioned inthe Queen&apos;s Speech. There seemed to be no new circumstances whichwould justify reversing this decision. Notice of presentation of theBill, which was ready, should therefore be given as soon as possible after the Opening of Parliament. This would preclude discussion ofthe matter during the Debate on the Address. The nature of the government&apos;s proposals and the justification for them should be fully explained to Government supporters before the Bill was published.(d) Road Traffic Bill. The Lord Privy Seal said that theuncertain prospects for this Bill made it desirable that the reference toit should be rather more tentative. He had reason to believe that theMinister of Transport would be content that the present referenceto it should be deleted from paragraph 21 and that a new paragraph should be inserted thereafter in the following terms:  &quot; My Ministers are attentively examining the Road TrafficActs with a view to introducing further legislation to improveroad safety and promote the orderly use of the roads.&quot;This was approved.(e) Disablement from Industrial Diseases. The Minister ofNational Insurance suggested, and it was agreed, that, in place ofthe reference to the Road Traffic Bill in paragraph 21, the following words should be inserted:  &quot; to provide benefit from certain further cases of disablementfrom industrial diseases.&quot;In the course of the discussion various detailed amendments tothe draft Speech were also suggested and adopted.The Cabinet Approved the draft of the Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament&apos; in the form annexed to C. (53) 280 subject tothe amendments.noted above and to certain drafting amend-ments approved in the discussion.
Egyptians would break off the negotiations. There seemed, however,to be a reasonable chance of securing an agreement if we were willingto go a little further to meet the Egyptians on some of the points towhich they attached special importance. The concessions which, inthe opinion of the Delegation, should suffice to secure an agreement on principles were set out in the Appendix to C. (53) 281.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disposed to instruct the delegation to continue their efforts to secure an agreement on principles. The Cabinet accepted the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view andproceeded to consider the various points enumerated in theAppendix to C. (53) 281.(a) Duration. It was agreed that we should insist on an agree-ment lasting for seven years.(b) Withdrawal of Troops. It had been suggested that we might offer to complete the withdrawal of combatant troops in fifteen months (instead of eighteen months) from the date on which anagreement came into force.The Minister of Defence said that this would be practicable ifwithdrawal began immediately agreement on principles had beenreached. In that event, however, the withdrawal would have to beso planned that we should retain in Egypt until the final agreement was reached enough troops to enable us to hold our position if nego-tiations broke down on details. It would also be important that the movements made in this initial phase should not be such as to weaken our bargaining position.The Cabinet agreed that on the basis indicated by the Ministerof Defence the Delegation might be authorised to agree that with-drawal would be completed within fifteen months of the date onwhich the agreement came into force.(c) Number of Technicians.-lt was agreed that we must continue to insist on a total of 4,000 British technicians for the firstA\ years of the agreement.The Minister of Defence said that military requirements wouldbe satisfied if in the following \\ years we could retain in the Base aminimum number of 2,500 technicians. In the last year of the agree-ment we should ask. for a minimum number of 1,000 technicians,excluding the small numbers required by the Royal Air Force inconnection with their staging facilities at Abu Sueir, though our negotiators might be authorised in the last resort to reduce this figure to 750.The Cabinet agreed that the proposals put forward by theMinister of Defence should be communicated to the United kingdom delegation in Cairo.(d) Availability. The Foreign Secretary suggested that the delegation should&quot; be authorised to put forward a new formularegarding the availability of the Base for war purposes. This wouldprovide that the Base would be made immediately available to us inthe event of (i) an attack by an outside power on Egypt; or (ii) anattack by an outside power on any member of the Arab MutualSecurity Pact; or (iii) a recommendation by the United Nations thatthe Base should be made available in the event of aggression orthreat of aggression. It would also provide that in the event of a threat of attack on any member of the Arab Mutual Security Pact,Iran or Turkey there should be immediate consultation between theUnited Kingdom and Egypt.The Cabinet agreed that the Egyptians should be pressed toaccept the revised formula suggested by the Foreign Secretary.(e) Uniform-The Foreign Secretary said that he was notcontent with the proposal which our Delegation had suggested regard-ing the wearing of uniform by British technicians in the Base.  He
would, however, be willing that they should suggest to the Egyptiansa formula in the following terms:  &quot; British personnel in the Base will normally dress as follows.When at work: overalls or shirts and shorts, with rank distinc-tions. At other times: plain clothes. They will be entitled towear the uniform of the Service to which they belong and tocarry a weapon for their personal protection.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he saw no reason to include in theagreement this description of the working dress of British techniciansin the Base. He proposed that the formula for inclusion in theagreement should be as follows:  &quot; Within the Base installations and in transit between themBritish personnel will be entitled to wear the uniform of theService to which they belong and to carry a weapon for their personal protection. Outside the area of the Base they willwear plain clothes.&quot;Our Delegation might be authorised to inform the Egyptians orallythat the British technicians when at work would normally wear over-alls or shorts and shirts with rank distinctions. This statement shouldnot, however, be included in the formal agreement itself.The Cabinet accepted the proposal put forward by the PrimeMinister.(/) Air Facilities. The Cabinet were informed that agreement had already been reached with the Egyptians regarding the provisionof staging facilities at Abu Sueir. The Secretary of State for Air saidthat this would secure the essential requirements of the Royal AirForce in peace. The Cabinet should, however, understand that, withthe failure of the original proposals for Anglo-Egyptian arrange-ments for the air defence of the Base, we had no assurance that the airfields would be maintained in such a condition that the Royal AirForce would be able to operate from them soon after our re-entry into the Base in war. This would greatly reduce the potential military value of the Base in war.(g) Organisation of the Base. The Cabinet agreed that theofficer in charge of British technicians in the Base should have the title&quot; Senior British Officer, Canal Zone Base.&quot;The Prime Minister said that he was concerned about the attitude which some Government supporters were likely to adopt towards an anglo-Egyptian defence agreement of the kind which the cabinet were now contemplating. Some would be disposed to suggest that,sooner than accept an agreement on these lines, we should have sought to maintain our position in Egypt by force; and they wouldprobably argue that,, if a drastic military solution had been sought,it would have been possible thereafter to reduce the strength of theBritish garrison in Egypt to a figure well below the present level. Hewas himself inclined to think that this course could not have been followed unless the Egyptians had committed some flagrant acts ofprovocation which would have justified us in proceeding on the basis that something equivalent to a state of war had arisen in Egypt. Ifwe had taken strong military action in a situation short of that, weshould have lacked the support of the United States Government;and, if the dispute had been referred to the United Nations, we couldnot have expected that a decision would have been given in our favour.Matters having now gone as they had, he was prepared to agree thatit might be the wiser course to seek an agreement on principles on thelines which the Cabinet had now approved. This should, however, be presented to the Egyptians as our last word; and he was anxious thatno final agreement should be reached with them until Parliament hadreassembled and Ministers had had an opportunity of explainingprivately to Government supporters the situation which had now beenreached.   It was of great importance that Ministers should have that
opportunity of preparing the way for the agreement, if it was to be concluded, and doing their utmost to reduce the risk of its being sub-jected to damaging criticism by their own supporters.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom delegation in Cairo that, at their next meeting with the egyptians, they should attempt to secure agreement on principles with the limits indicated in paragraphs (a)-(g)above, but that no announcement indicating that final agreement had been reached should be made untilMinisters had received a report of the results of that meeting.(2) Took note that, as soon as Parliament had reassembled, theChief Whip would arrange for the Prime Minister, theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence to explainprivately to Government supporters the stage which hadbeen reached in these negotiations.(3) Authorised the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to arrange for the Governments ofthe older Commonwealth countries to be informed of thefurther proposals which were now to be made to the egyptians; and to consider what information should begiven to other Commonwealth Governments, after thenext meeting with the Egyptians, about the course whichthe negotiations had taken.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th October, 1953.
