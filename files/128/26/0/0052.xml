koSHousing Policy.(previous reference:CC. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)119   .1.   The Cabinet had before them CC. 52 (53)(i) Memoranda by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment (C. (53) 219 and 250) covering the first and seconddrafts of a White Paper on Housing Policy for Englandand Wales;(ii) A memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (53) 251) covering a draft of a White Paper on housing policy for Scotland;(hi) A memorandum by the Minister of Works (C. (53) 230)commenting on the first draft White Paper on housing policy for England and Wales.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hehad tried to present his plan, not as a policy for dealing with rent restriction and security of tenure, but as a policy for preserving anessential national asset. The housing problem could not be solvedsimply by the erection of new houses; existing houses must be kept in good repair and preserved. The best of these houses could bekept in good condition, given a reasonable rent; and, in his view, thefairest method of giving this was to allow rents to rise by \\ times thestatutory deduction for rating purposes, provided that the landlordgave proof that he had actually spent this money on repairs from 1st January, 1953, up to&apos; the date of the claim. The slum houses, ofwhich only a proportion could be pulled down and replaced in the next five years, would have to remain in use; and he was proposing that local authorities should buy these and do what they could to improve their condition until demolition and replacement became possible.He was also intending to increase the return which owners would receive if they undertook to improve or convert their property.There was no doubt that, as the policy necessitated an increase inrent for something like 5 or 6 million houses, it was unlikely to be popular. It was important therefore that, if legislation were intro-duced, there should be ample time to judge its generally good effects.He hoped that the White Papers might be published just before the prorogation of Parliament and discussed during the debate on the address. The second reading of the Bills might take place before christmas and the Royal Assent received in about May 1954. this time-table would mean that some of the effects of the measures would begin to be seen by the autumn of 1954.Discussion showed that the Cabinet favoured the general principles of the proposals and believed that they were ingenious,courageous, equitable and right. The following particular points were made:  (a) Opponents of the policy would seek to show that its effect would be to give landlords higher returns without any compensatingbenefit to tenants. This criticism could, however, be answered if itwas decided to adopt the condition that landlords should give proof that they had spent the money on repairs. This condition would,moreover, have the effect of staggering the rent increases so that theydid not all take place at the same moment.(b) Against the imposition of this condition of proof it was argued that the best landlords would be penalised and that only thoselandlords, who spent money at the last minute in the specified period after 1st January, 1953, would reap any benefit. It was agreed thatsome variation of this qualifying period should be considered.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland felt that to insist on thecondition of proof for Scotland would make his Bill unworkable. Itwas generally accepted that there would necessarily be some differences between the policy for Scotland and the policy for england and Wales, and that sound grounds could be found for thesediscrepancies.
id) Local authorities, who had no profit incentive, had been obliged by economic considerations to make considerable increases intheir rents, and it could probably be shown that the rent increases forprivately owned houses which would result from these proposals would not exceed the increases which local authorities had made during the last eighteen months. In any case the rent increases couldnot exceed the sum represented by \\ times the statutory deductionfor rating purposes, and even this increase was subject to the over-riding proviso that no rent should rise above twice the existing grossvalue (for rating purposes) of the house.ie) It was suggested that, if rent increases for private landlordswere to be limited in this way, similar restrictions should be put uponincreases which local authorities and Housing Associations could make. Many small private owners of houses had invested their money in house property in the expectation of some return, whereaslocal authorities had no need to make profit. It was pointed out inreply that local authorities were subject to popular control and thatany large increase by them in their rents usually ended in their for-feiting public support.(/) The condition that a landlord would only be permitted to claim a repairs increase if the house was in &quot; good and tenantablerepair &quot; did not necessarily mean that the tenant would find it a satis-factory house with modern conveniences, and many privately-ownedhouses brought to this state would not compare with the high standards of modern local authority houses. It was, however, opento landlords to get assistance in making improvements to existing houses and the White Paper might perhaps be so drafted as to linkthese two ideas together.ig) There was no doubt that the proposals as a whole would impose a considerable strain on building resources. The extent ofthis strain could not be forecast in advance and it might therefore beas well not to indicate any definite time-limit for the programme of repairs, but to leave it to the building industry to do its best to meetthe demands made upon it. It was suggested that perhaps the best method of controlling the load on the building industry would be to limit the labour force which it could employ.ih) The repair, improvement and replacement of slum houses would inevitably lead to renewed demands for similar treatment forslum schools. These demands could not be resisted in any area where work on slum houses had begun.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he gave his full support to the general scheme, though he would wish to reservecertain points of detail for further discussion. From the point ofview of national credit and confidence in sterling he had no doubtthat the policy would be most valuable, but it offered little relief tothe budgetary position. He would want to discuss further the extentof the Exchequer subsidy for repairs and slum clearance and he hopedthat some reference could be made to the question of rents for localauthority houses. If these did not go up, then the housing subsidieswould continue at their present rate. Increases in rents would be anew factor in considering the level of food subsidies, since simul-taneous increases in rents and in the price of food would have aserious effect upon the cost-of-living index.The Prime Minister said that it was clear that the Cabinet feltthat the general lines of the policy proposed were right and should beadopted. Unless this vital question of repairs were tackled the new housing programme would lose much of its value. He had no doubtthat the policy would invite a good deal of criticism and the Govern-menfs aim should be to push it through as rapidly as possible so thatits beneficial effects could be seen at an early date. The CabinetCommittee under the chairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal should now consider the draft White Papers in the light of the points made
Malta. 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Colonial(Previous Secretary (C. (53) 253 and 255) about recent developments in regardReference:       to Malta&apos;s constitutional status.C.C. (53) 47th Tne Colonial Secretary recalled that the Cabinet, at their meetingConclusions. on 30th July, had agreed in principle that, in response to a MalteseMinute 3.) request that responsibility in London for handling Malta&apos;s affairs should be transferred to tne Commonwealth Secretary, means shouldbe sought of putting Malta under the Privy Council, with the HomeSecretary as the responsible Minister, on the analogy of the channel islands. The Cabinet had, however, wished to be assured that this plan was constitutionally and administratively practicable and wouldnot be inconsistent with a considered long-term plan for the develop-ment of commonwealth relations. These assurances were containedin C. (53) 253, which also recorded his view, which was contrary tothe Cabinets provisional opinion, that, to allay Maltese suspicions,emphasis in the public presentation of the proposed transfer ofresponsibility should be laid on the jurisdiction of the Home Secre-tary rather than of the Privy Council.In the meantime the handling of the matter had been complicated by an intimation from the Maltese Prime Minister, prompted by anotification of impending increases in the strength of the UnitedStates naval air squadrons in Malta, that his Government intendedat an early date to press for full self-government for Malta withinthe Commonwealth and the scrapping of the present dyarchicalconstitution. In spite of this more radical proposal, he recommendedthat, if the proposed plan to offer to transfer responsibility for Malta to the Home Secretary was now approved by the Cabinet, the offer should be made privately to the Maltese Prime Minister forthwithand should be published after a reasonable interval. He was alsoasking the Cabinet to agree that, if Dr. Olivier were to reject this offer and to proceed along the more extreme course which he had nowforeshadowed, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should announce their intention to appoint a Royal Commission to enquire into the workingof the 1947 Constitution.General support was expressed both for the proposed offer totransfer responsibility for Malta to the Home Secretary under the aegis of the Privy Council and for the manner in which the colonial secretary proposed to handle the matter generally.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were adminis-trative aspects of the proposed transfer of departmental responsibility which he would wish to discuss with the Home Secretary and theColonial Secretary at the appropriate stage.in discussion, but on the firm basis that the Cabinet fully supported the policy and intended to pursue it. It might be found wise to makethe White Papers less precise on certain difficult points so as to preserve greater flexibility for the Ministers handling the Bills.The Cabinet (1) Accepted in principle the general lines of the housing policy set out in the memoranda by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland(C. (53) 250 and 251).(2) Invited the Cabinet Committee on Housing Policy under theChairmanship of the Lord Privy Seal to examine thedraft White Papers attached to C. (53) 250 and 251 in thelight of the points made in the Cabinets discussion andon the basis that the policy had been approved inprinciple.(3) Agreed that the aim should be to publish the White Papersjust before the prorogation of Parliament, so that theycould be discussed during the debate on the Address.
Gold Coast.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (53) 244) seeking approval of proposals for afurther measure of constitutional advance in the Gold Coast.The Colonial Secretary said that the proposals of the Gold coast government for constitutional change which had now been formallysubmitted by the Governor were, broadly, in the form foreshadowed in his earlier memoranda C. (53) 154 and 218. Acceptance of theproposals would mean that, short of the exercise of the Governorsreserved powers, responsibility for internal affairs would be almost wholly in Gold Coast hands, while Her Majesty&apos;s Government would retain, through the Governor, responsibility for external affairs and defence. Assuming a satisfactory settlement of the outstanding issues,he proposed to submit new constitutional instruments to the privy council early in 1954. This would enable a fresh General election to be held in about May so that, if all went well, a new Governmentwould have taken office by the middle of the year. The Gold coast government attached particular importance to their request thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government should make a declaration expressingreadiness, as soon as the necessary constitutional and administrative arrangements for independence had been made, to grant the gold coast full self-government within the Commonwealth. Despitepossible objections to such a declaration of future intention, he was convinced that, on balance, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would bewell advised to meet this request. He therefore sought the Cabinefsagreement to the Gold Coast Cabinet being informed that, subjectto a general agreement on the constitutional changes now to be made,he would be prepared to make in due course, on behalf of her majesty&apos;s Government, a declaration on the lines of the draft con-tained In paragraph 6 -of his paper. The most likely time for such adeclaration to be made would be early in 1954.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he agreed in principle with the proposed declaration of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs futureintentions but that he would welcome an opportunity to have itsexact wording considered by the Cabinet Committee on Common-wealth Membership.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals for constitutional advance in the Gold Coast outlined in C. (53) 244.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theCabinet Committee on Commonwealth Membership toconsider the exact wording of the proposed declaration by Her Majesty&apos;s Government regarding the eventualgrant to the Gold, Coast of full self-government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an offer to transfer responsibility in London for handling Maltese affairs from the Colonial Secretary tothe Home Secretary under the aegis of the Privy Councilon the lines suggested in C. (53) 255 might now be madeto the Maltese Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary and the Colonial Secre-tary would at the appropriate time discuss and agreewith the Chancellor of the Exchequer the. necessary administrative arrangements for carrying out the transfer.(3) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to proceed generally inthe matter on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 ofC. (53) 255.
123CC. 52 (53)television development.(previous reference:CC. (53) 45thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (53) 252) covering a draft White Paper on television policy.The Postmaster-General recalled that Government statements in Parliament on 2nd July had promised &quot; a White Paper in theautumn defining the terms upon which competitive television mightbe permitted to operate.&quot; The Cabinet, at their meeting on 23rd July,had invited him, in consultation with some of his colleagues, to circulate a White Paper setting forth the various possibilities. this he had done and, as he had foreshadowed in his earlier memorandum(C. (53) 201) he had come down in favour of the idea of a secondpublic corporation to be financed from advertising revenue.A brief discussion revealed considerable doubt in the Cabinetabout the proposal to establish a second public corporation and itwas agreed that the problem required further detailed considerationby a smaller group of Ministers.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thematter to be considered further, on the basis of C. (53) 252,by the Cabinet Committee on Television Development, withthe addition to its membership of the Minister of State,Board of Trade.Korea.(previous reference:CC. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Lord President said that the Chinese Governmentsreply to the Resolutions adopted by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations on 28th August, dealing in particular with the corn-position of the Political Conference, invited the Assembly, in effect,to re-open the whole matter. The United States Government werenot unnaturally looking to us to support them in trying to prevent such a re-opening of the issue so soon after its decision by the general assembly. Further disagreement between us and the Americans atthis juncture would be most unfortunate and he recommended thatwe should fall in with the Americans&apos; wishes. At the same time he considered it important that we should prepare for a situation inwhich it had become clear that the Chinese could not be broughtto accept the United Nations&apos; proposals as they stood. He, therefore,proposed that the Minister of State, who was leaving for New Yorkthat day, should ask Mr. Dulles what course of action he had inmind to pursue if this deadlock arose.The Minister of State said that he was in entire agreement.Further public discussion of the issue in the General Assembly atthis stage would only increase the difficulty of reaching agreementwith the Chinese.The Cabinet Approved the course of action in regard to the ChineseGovernments reply to the General Assembly&apos;s Resolutionsrecommended by the Lord President.United Nations.Representationof China.(previous reference:CC. (53) 51stConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Lord President said that the formula which had beenagreed between the Americans and ourselves for delaying attempts to raise the question of the representation of China in the united nations had now been adopted by the General Assembly of theUnited Nations. This formula precluded any discussion of thisquestion during the present session of the Assembly in the current year i.e., during the remainder of 1953.
Germany. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordFour-Power President (C. (53) 256) discussing possible alternative forms of aMeeting. security guarantee between the Soviet Union and the Western Powers.(Previous The Lord President said that, if the Soviet Union accepted the reference:      invitation to Four-Power talks on 15th October, it would be necessaryC.C. (53) 50th   for us to hold preliminary consultations with the French and conclusions,    Americans at the end of September so that we could enter the Four-Minute 3.)       Power talks with an agreed policy.   One of the main problems ofany Four-Power talks would be to find some form of mutual security arrangements which would give the Russians adequate guaranteeswithout sacrificing the interests of the Western Powers.   He hadenumerated several alternatives in his memorandum but the subject was too complicated for full discussion in Cabinet at short notice.He therefore asked that a committee of Ministers should be appointedto consider the form of the instructions to be given to our representa-tives in the preliminary consultations with the French and the americans.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the memorandum by the Lord President(C. (53) 256).(2) Appointed a committee of the following Ministers:  Lord President (in the Chair),Lord Privy Seal,Minister of Defence,Minister of Housing and Local Government,to consider this memorandum and the form of theinstructions to be sent to the United Kingdom repre-sentatives at any preliminary consultations that might take place with the French and the Americans in advanceof Four-Power talks with the Soviet Union.The Cabinet.(previous reference:CC (53) 51stConclusions,Minute 7.)8. The Cabinet agreed that they would meet on Friday,2nd October, and took note that, if an earlier meeting were needed,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the Prime Ministers absence,would summon one.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th September, 1953.
