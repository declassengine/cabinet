These proposalsfor an important change in Government organisation ought, hethought, to be presented in the name of the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister agreed that the White Paper should be presented in his name. The Lord Privy Seal should answer, as leader of the House, any questions about the procedure for handling the subject in Parliament.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the  the House of Commons in the following week.House of On the last two days of the Debate on the Address, on 9th andCommons. 10th November, the House would discuss Opposition amendmentson agriculture and on the cost of living. On 9th November theGovernment spokesmen would be the Minister of Agriculture and either the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Parliamentary Under -Secretary of State for Scotland. On 10th November the Minister ofFood and the Lord Privy Seal would speak for the Government.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 55thConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The Minister of Labour said that the employers in the shipbuilding and engineering industries would that day reject theworkers&apos; demands for an increase in wages. The Federation of engineering and Shipbuilding Trades Unions would meet on12th November to consider what course of action they should follow.It was possible that they might decide to bring the dispute formally to the notice of the Minister of Labour. Meanwhile, however, there might well be some sporadic strikes in these two industries.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Television. Development(previous reference:C.C. (53) 55thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by thePostmaster-General one (C. (53) 289 (Revise)) outlining the plan for establishing a new public corporation to operate television in competition with the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.), andthe other (C. (53) 290 (Revise) discussing whether religion and politicsshould be excluded from the scope of television programmesbroadcast from stations controlled by the new corporation.The Cabinefs discussion first turned on the question whetherreligion and politics should be excluded from television programmesbroadcast from the stations owned by the new corporation. Differ-ing opinions were expressed on this question. On the one hand itwas argued that the anxieties of those who were apprehensive aboutcommercial television might be allayed if it could be said that, at the outset at any rate, religion and politics would be excluded from thecommercial programmes. The original Charter of the B.B.C hadprecluded the Corporation from broadcasting on matters of political controversy; and this might be a good precedent for providing thatthe commercial television companies should not in their infancy45176-1B 2
trespass on this dangerous ground. There had been difficulties in arriving at a satisfactory understanding on political broadcasts, as.between the political Parties and the B.B.C.; and these difficulties were likely to be renewed if a number of television stations began to,make competing claims on the limited number of Ministers and.Members of Parliament available to participate in political broadcasts.On the other hand it was argued that those who wished to break the B.B.C. monopoly would be reluctant to leave it with a monopolyover the more serious subjects for television. It should not be for-gotten that one of the main criticisms of commercial television wasthat it was likely to limit its programmes to the lighter forms of enter -tainment. It would, moreover, be difficult to define what was meantby &quot; religion and politics.&quot; Where was the line to be drawn? Wereprogrammes of carols or community hymn singing to be excluded as&quot; religious.&quot; And plays could convey political propaganda at least as effective as a political speech. It was these considerations whichhad led the Postmaster-General to recommend that the new com-mercial companies should be allowed to cover religious and politicaltopics in their programmes on the same conditions as were alreadyapplicable to the B.B.C.The Cabinefs general conclusion was that it would not be practicable in the long run to exclude religion and politics from thescope of the commercial television companies. It might, however, be expedient to propose that the companies should not attempt to coverthese topics in the early stages of their operation-or, at least, thatin these early stages Party political broadcasts might be left to theB.B.C. In any event this particular issue might appropriately be leftto a free vote in Parliament.The Cabinet then proceeded to discuss whether the whole of thisquestion could be left to a free vote.The Prime Minister said that he still hoped that it might be pps-sible to arrange for all Parties in the House of Commons to allow their members to vote on this question in accordance with individual con-science. Questions of conscience were involved, as was evidenced bythe Cabinefs discussion that morning. He thought it wrong thatthe small body of Government supporters who had originally putforward the demand for commercial television should be allowed to compel other Conservative Members to vote against their conscienceon a matter which was in no way vital to the safety of the State andhad not been mentioned in the Party&apos;s programme at the last Election.There was some reason to believe that feeling on this subject among government supporters was now less strong than it had been earlier in the year; and, if this proved to be so, it might still be possible toallow the matter to be determined by a free vote of the House ofCommons.In discussion it was pointed out that Labour Members wouldvote against any form of commercial television and that, on a free vote, the plan outlined in the White Paper was bound to be defeatedif only a few Conservative Members abstained from supporting it.Ministers had spent many months in devising a moderate plan whichmight have some prospect of escaping criticism from those government -ment supporters who had been alarmed by the original proposals forsponsored television. There were good grounds for believing thatthe plan outlined in the draft White Paper would be acceptable toa large proportion of Government supporters. At the conservative party Conference at Margate there had been strong support for the government&apos;s proposal to go forward with a moderate plan for commercial television. In these circumstances there Was much to besaid for,putting this plan forward as firm Government policy, withthe support of the Government Whips subject only to further con-sideration of the suggestion that a free vote might be allowed on theparticular question whether religion and politics should be excludedfrom the television programmes of the commercial companies.
House of lords reform.(previous reference:CC. (53) 26thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (53) 297) reporting the progress made by the CabinetCommittee which had been considering proposals for the reform ofthe House of Lords.The Lord President said that the work of this Committee hadbeen suspended during the summer. It would now be resumed, andinformal and confidential consultations would also be held withleading members of the House of Lords. A further report would thenbe made to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that it seemed unlikely that agreement would ever be reached between the Parties on any scheme for the reform of the House of Lords. And there was a real risk that the search for such an agreement might have the effect of weakening astructure which would otherwise have continued to bear a usefulweight for another generation or so. The House of Lords made a valuable contribution to government, and commanded much publicrespect. But this might well cease to be so if its composition became a matter of public controversy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Lord Presidents memorandum (C. (53) 297).(2) Invited the Cabinet Committee on the reform of the House ofLords to continue their study of this problem.Moscow TradeTalks.(previous reference:CC. (53) 8thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 309) dis-cussing what advice should be given to business firms invited to send representatives to trade talks opening in Moscow on 22nd November.The President of the Board of Trade said that the British council for the Promotion of International Trade were inviting firms to send representatives to these trade talks. This Council was a Communistorganisation. Its aim was to conduct Communist propaganda andthere was strong reason to suspect that commissions charged on tradeconducted through it were used to finance Communist activities in theUnited Kingdom. In these circumstances he and the Foreign Secre-tary thought it right to state unequivocally that the Governmentwould deprecate any visits to Moscow sponsored by this body. they believed that the great majority of the firms receiving invitations fromThe Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (2) below, approved the draft white paper annexed to C. (53) 289 (Revise).(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-General to consider, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion,what should be said in the White Paper on the questionwhether religion and politics should be excluded from the television programmes of the commercial companies.(3) Agreed that the extent to which these matters could be leftto a free vote in Parliament should be further considered at a later meeting of the Cabinet, after the publication ofthe White Paper.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in replying to a Parlia-mentary Question by Mr. Jay, M.P., on 10th November,would take the line that it would be inexpedient to deter-mine the manner of voting in Parliament on this issueuntil the White Paper had been published and members had had an opportunity of studying its proposals.
coal production.(previous reference:CC. (53) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (C. (53) 304) reporting the action taken, in pursu-ance of the Cabinefs decision of 9th July, to import large coal to supplement prospective home supplies.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that he had been autho-rised to import not more than 1 million tons of large coal from countries included in the European Coal and Steel Community. Some600,000 tons had already been bought from France and Belgium. Hewas now satisfied that the balance of 400,000 tons would be needed;but, owing largely to the recent coal strike in France, it would not bepossible to met the whole of this requirement from Western europe and some part of it would have to be bought from Poland.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange forthe National Coal Board to negotiate for the purchase from poland of such part of the remaining 400,000 tons of large coal as could not be obtained from Western Europe.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th November, 1953.the Council would follow this advice. If the Cabinet approved thiscourse, a statement to this effect should be made in answer to a parliamentary Question.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that business firms in this country should be strongly urged to decline invitations from the British Council forthe Promotion of International Trade to send representa-tives to the trade talks opening in Moscow on 22ndNovember.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make an announcement,in reply to a Parliamentary Question, in the terms of thedraft annexed to C. (53) 309.
