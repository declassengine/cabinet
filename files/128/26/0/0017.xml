/S&quot;0Egypt. The Cabinet had before them a number of telegrams from theDefence Foreign Secretary reporting the results of his discussions with negotiations.    President Eisenhower on the suggestion that the next stage of the(Previous        defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government should be under-Reference:       taken in Cairo by an Anglo-American team comprising military as c.C. (53) 15th   well as diplomatic representatives of the two Governments.Conclusions, The United States Administration were prepared to support the minute 9.) proposals outlined in the documents annexed to C. (53) 17 Revise asa basis for the next stage of the negotiations, but they had at first been reluctant to participate directly in the negotiations. As a result ofthe Prime Ministers personal message to the President, and the con-versations which the Foreign Secretary had held in Washington, theAdminstration had been brought to agree that a joint Anglo-American approach offered the best prospect of success; and thePresident had promised that General Hull, Deputy Chief of Staff ofthe United States Army, would be made available at short notice tojoin the United States Ambassador in Cairo in the negotiations.Difficulties had then arisen over the conditions on which we should insist regarding the maintenance in peace of the military base in the canal Zone. While the Americans agreed that we should do our utmost to persuade the Egyptians to accept the. conditions laid downin Case &quot; A &quot; in the papers annexed to C. (53) 17 Revise, they were reluctant to commit themselves in advance to the view that nothingless than Case &quot; A &quot; could be accepted. If it were found that the egyptians could not be persuaded to accept this, they did not wishto exclude from the outset consideration of Case &quot; B &quot; or of some compromise lying somewhere between the two. The Prime minister had feared that the position of the British negotiators would be seriously weakened if the American attitude on this point remaineduncertain. If there were any risk that the Americans would not support us on some condition regarding the maintenance of the basewhich we thought essential for our future security, it would be better that we should enter upon the negotiations alone. He had conveyedhis anxieties to the Foreign Secretary in a series of messages despatchedduring the two previous days, and had urged the Foreign Secretaryto press for satisfactory assurances on this point in his final interview with the President which had taken place earlier that day.The Cabinet now had before them a telegram from the foreign secretary (Washington telegram No. 523 of 9th March) giving a preliminary report on this interview. This showed that president eisenhower fully shared our anxiety to secure Egyptian acceptanceof the conditions set out in Case &quot; A,&quot; and that his representatives would be instructed to do their utmost to secure agreement on theacceptance of those conditions. If, however, this attempt should fail,he recognised that the alternative arrangements must be such that wecould resume the use of the base as soon as possible after the outbreakof war, and that for this purpose we should insist on the need for keeping certain of the installations and depots under British technicalsupervision and control. He also agreed that no modification of theconditions under Case &quot; A&quot; should be made unless they were acceptable to both the British and the American military repre-sentatives in the negotiations.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Field-Marshal Sir William Slim said that in his view therewas some scope for minor concessions under Case &quot; A,&quot; so long as there was no infringement of the principle that the essential depotsand installations should remain under British command.It was agreed that, before opening their discussions with the egyptians, the British and American negotiators should first agree upon the minimum conditions regarding the maintenance of the basewhich should in no circumstances be compromised. Field MarshalSlim undertook to draw up a note of these in consultation with theMinister of Defence.
(b) It would be wise to remind the United States Governmentonce again that the five main proposals outlined in C. (53) 17 Revisewere to be treated in the negotiations as an interdependent whole.There could be no question of our agreeing to withdraw British troops from the Canal Zone unless the Egyptians accepted the other pro-posals.(c) The Government would face political difficulties in defendingto their supporters any agreement involving the withdrawal ofBritish troops from Egypt before the expiration of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1956. But those difficulties would be greatly reduced if the withdrawal could be presented as part of a generalMiddle East settlement carrying the full support of the United StatesGovernment. The fact that we had acted in concert with the americans would also be a great help in justifying an agreement toAustralia and other Commonwealth countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hisanxieties had been relieved by the assurances which the foreign secretary had been able to obtain in his final interview with president eisenhower. He was specially glad to know that the Presidentappreciated the need for keeping the vital depots and installations inthe base under British supervision and command. If this point werestressed, if the Americans were reminded that the five proposals wereto be treated as interdependent parts of a single settlement, and if itwas clearly understood that no modification of the conditions inCase &quot; A&quot; would be made without the concurrence of both theBritish and American military representatives, the Foreign Secretarycould, he thought, be authorised to make final arrangements for ajoint Anglo-American approach to the Egyptian Government on thebasis which he had discussed with the President.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers view.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of a telegram (subsequently despatchedas Foreign Office telegram to New York No. 153 of9th March) informing the Foreign Secretary that, on theunderstandings to which the Prime Minister had referred,the Cabinet agreed in principle that a joint Anglo-American approach should now be made to the egyptian government on the basis which he had discussed with president Eisenhower.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the PrimeMinister of Australia of the outcome of the discussions which the Foreign Secretary had held in Washingtonregarding the suggestion that an American military officers should be associated with Field-Marshal Sir William Slimin the next stage of the defence negotiations with Egypt.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform theGovernments of all the older Commonwealth countries of the basis on which a joint Anglo-American attempt was now to be made to secure a comprehensive defencesettlement with Egypt.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th March, 1953.
