Washington with the United States Secretary of State and the French(Previous        Foreign Minister (Washington telegrams Nos. 1460, 1461, 1465, 1471,Reference:.     1472). , As a result of a plea from the German Federal Chancellor,C.C.

Ministers rather than Heads of Governments, with an agenda con-fined to the problem of Germany. The first business of this meeting would be to discuss means of creating the conditions in which free elections could be held in Germany.  This would be a different kindof Four-Power Meeting from that which the Prime Minister had hadin mind, but it would serve the purpose of establishing some direct-  contact with the Russians and to that extent it would maintain the momentum of our policy.  If we opposed this plan, we should have broken the unity of the Western Powers, destroyed any immediatechance of Four-Power talks of which we were the original advocates damaged the election prospects of Dr. Adenauer, and furtherjeopardised the prospects of French ratification of the european defence Community (E.D.C.) and the Bonn Treaties.   If, on theother hand, we agreed and the talks were successful, it might be found possible to expand their scope in the later stages, so that it wouldbecome appropriate for Heads of Governments to join the Meeting.If the talks failed, then we had M. Bidault&apos;s assurance that the FrenchGovernment would do all in their power to secure the ratification ofthe .E.D.C. Treaty and to press forward with other schemes ofEuropean integration.   The Minister of State felt that we had no option but to agree; but that our agreement should be subject to theunderstanding that the Americans would not offer any further con-cessions to Dr. Adenauer before the elections and that, whatever the\ .;       .      result of the Four-Power Meeting, the French would co-operater    1 actively in measures to integrate Germany with Western Europe.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime Minister.;; had considered these telegrams.   He inferred from them that theFrench and the Americans intended the Four-Power Meeting to end in a breakdown. He thought, nevertheless, that we could not avoidsupporting the proposal for the Meeting though it was important that its agenda and composition should not be so rigid as to exclude the possibility that Heads of Governments might attend in the later stages and that the scope of the agenda would then be widened.In discussion the following points were made: (a) The Lord President had already emphasised the seriousdangers of holding Four-Power talks on Germany before the E.D.C.Treaty had been ratified. He had given due warning to Mr. Dullesand M. Bidault that this might result in a re-united Germany looking to the East, which would be a source of great danger to the world.These arguments had not convinced the French or the Americans, andit was the general view of the Cabinet that, for the reasons given inthe telegrams, we must now agree to a Four-Power Meeting in advanceof French ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty.(b) The agenda of this Meeting would have to be confined tothe problems of Germany and Austria. It might, however, bepossible to give the impression in any public communique that, ifprogress were made, the talks would proceed to wider issues.  the question of guidance to the Press and the public should, however, beleft for further discussion when the final results of the Washington-;&quot;      talks were known.(c) Other Commonwealth Governments should be kept informed of the progress of the talks in Washington.(d) Every effort should be made to avoid a debate in Parliamentuntil after the Lord Presidents return.
317Esypt-   - .2.   The Minister of State referred to a series of telegrams fromDefence the Lord President recording the progress of conversations with theNegotiations.    United States Secretary of State about the Anglo-Egyptian dispute(Previous        (Washington telegrams Nos. 1468, 1469, 1470, 1473).   Mr. DullesReference:      had taken the unfortunate and embarrassing step of obtaining fromC.C. (53) 40th   General Neguib a statement of his present position in advance of theConclusions.    discussions with the Lord President.  General Neguib had accord-Minuted)       ingly sent a personal letter to the President of the United Statescovering his latest proposals for. the settlement of the dispute.Although the letter at first sight appeared to mark some advance inthe Egyptian position, the proposals were almost entirely unsatis-factory.   It was of the utmost importance that we should not bemanoeuvred into a position where the United States acted as an intermediary between us and the Egyptians, and that the Presidentsreply to General Neguib should not give the impression that we were willing to resume negotiations on the basis of General Neguib&apos;sproposals. The basis on which we were willing to resume negotiations had already been settled by the Cabinet.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although General Neguib now seemed willing to accept4,000 British technicians for the efficient operation of the Baseinstallations, his proposals for the command and^control of thesetechnicians and of the equipment and installations in their care were wholly unsatisfactory. No agreement on this point could be accept-able unless it made it clear that the British Commander had absolutecontrol over the British technicians and the installations and equip-ment in the Base, even though there was an Egyptian Commander ofthe Base area.(b) We should not depart from our views on the duration of theagreement or on our rights to the use of the Base in war, on whichthe Cabinet had approved a form of words on 8th July (C.C. (53)40th Conclusions, Minute 4).The Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;said that it was the clear viewof the Cabinet that we could not accept the United States government as a mediator., in this dispute and that we were quite unwilling to resume negotiations on the basis of General Neguib&apos;s proposals. TheMinister of State- would draft a reply to the Lord President on this basis and in the light of the points made in discussion. The PrimeMinister would wish to comment on the reply before its despatch.&apos; The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to reply to the. Lord president on the lines indicated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,subject to the approval of the Prime Minister.Persian Gulf. 3.   The Minister of State said that some days previously we hadTrucial suggested to the United States Government that President EisenhowerSheikhdoms. might propose to Ibn Saud that the deadlock at Buraimi might be(Previous resolved on the basis that both sides withdrew their forces, leavingReference: Buraimi under the supervision of a commission of three (one British,C.C.

This matter had now been raised in the currentThe Cabinet Agreed that the Lord President should be authorised to associate himself with the proposal for a Four-Power Meet-ing on Germany and Austria in September or October, and invited the Minister of State to inform him. of this decision and of the general sense of the Cabinets discussion.:
Coal 4.   The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Coal Board&apos;production . negotiations for the purchase of coal from Europe had now reached(Previous a stage at which there was a serious risk of their becoming knownReference: to the Press, and he therefore proposed that an official announce-C.C.(53)4lst ment of the Governmenfs decision to import this coal should be conclusions, made in the House of Commons that afternoon.Minute 7.) The Cabinet considered the draft of the proposed announcement,copies of which were handed round at the meeting. In discussionvarious amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Agreed that their decision to import large coal from europe should be announced in Parliament that afternoon, and invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to make theannouncement in the terms approved in the course of their discussion.discussions in Washington. The Americans were reluctant to put thissuggestion to Ibn Saud because they were convinced that, for reasons of prestige, he would not be prepared to withdraw his representative Buraimi in present circumstances. They would prefer to put tohim the alternative proposal that, while the arbitration was takingplace, British and Saudi forces should remain in the area on the under-standing that we lifted the blockade and that the Saudis discontinuedtheir attempts to suborn the local population;, that a commission ofthree (one British, one Saudi and one. neutral) should.,proceed to thearea with a view to ensuring that these conditions were carried out;and that the British and Saudi Governments should publicly announce their agreement to submit the frontier dispute to arbitration(Washington telegram No. 1467 of 11th July).The Minister of State said that he could not advise the Cabinetto accept the alternative proposed by the Americans. So long asTurki, the Saudi representative, remained in Buraimi, he would con-tin ue his efforts to stir up the local population against us. And itwould be damaging to our prestige to abandon at this stage our efforts to remove him from Buraimi. Our original proposal of simultaneouswithdrawal by both sides was not unreasonable, and the americans should be pressed to urge Ibn Saud to accept it.Discussion showed that there was some disposition in the Cabinetto endorse the American view that Ibn Saud would not be willing toaccept our original proposal. And some Ministers were inclined to favour acceptance of the American alternative, partly on that account and partly because they thought it inexpedient to join issue with the americans on this question at a time when we were seeking to reach agreement with them on matters of much greater moment. As against this, however, it was argued that we had decided to take a firm standover this frontier dispute and that, if we gave way at this stage, British influence and prestige would be seriously weakened throughout thearea. The potential value of the oil concessions made it speciallyimportant that we should maintain our influence there.The Cabinet Agreed that the Lord President should make one further effort to persuade the United States Government to urgeIbn Saud to accept the original proposal outlined in ForeignOffice telegram No. 2662 of 2nd July, but that he shouldnot press this request to the point of endangering theprospects of full American support on the other matters nowunder discussion in Washington; and invited the Minister ofState to arrange for instructions in this sense to be sent atonce to the Lord President.
