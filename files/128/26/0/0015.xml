Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Defence White Paper was to be debated in the House ofCommons on 5th March. The Cabinet agreed that this debate andthe corresponding debate in the House of Lords should be taken onMotions inviting approval of the White Paper.The Cabinet agreed that the Second Reading of the Judges&apos;Remuneration Bill should be taken in the House of Commons before easter.Hungary.Mr. EdgarSanders.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 14thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 75) on the proposal that Lee ment might be released in exchange for Edgar Sanders.The Foreign Secretary said that he had given further thought tothis problem since the Cabinefs discussion on 24th February. Hewas satisfied that there were no further sanctions which could beapplied against Hungary with a view to securing Sanders&apos; release.He recognised that, if the proposed exchange were carried through,there was some risk that Communist Governments might arrest other british subjects and hold them as hostages. He thought it unlikelythat this would happen in Hungary. There was perhaps a greaterrisk of its happening in China. He therefore proposed that, before a final decision was taken, Her Majesty&apos;s Representative in Pekingshould be asked to advise on this point.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question when theForeign Secretary had obtained the views of Her Majesty&apos;representative in Peking on the risks to which the proposed exchange might expose British subjects resident in China.Anglo-Soviet 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, because some BritishFisheries trawlers had recently sailed too close to Soviet territory, the SovietAgreement. Government had indicated privately their intention to denounce theAnglo-Soviet Fisheries Agreement. This would be greatly to our disadvantage; and, in order to bring pressure on the Russians to keepthe Agreement in being, he wished to be able to say that, if theydenounced this Agreement, we should feel compelled to denounce theAnglo-Soviet Commercial Agreement. He might have an oppor-tunity to use this threat in private conversations with the soviet foreign Minister at the United Nations Assembly.&apos; ; The President of the Board of Trade said that in principle he deprecated the denunciation of trade agreements. But he recognisedthat this particular Agreement was of less practical advantage to usthan the Fisheries Agreement; and he was therefore ready to agreethat the Foreign Secretary should have discretion to use the threat of denouncing it if he thought it necessary to do so for the purposeof preserving the Fisheries Agreement.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the SovietGovernment, if he judged it necessary to do so, that if theydenounced the Anglo-Soviet Fisheries Agreement we should feel compelled to denounce the Anglo-Soviet commercial agreement.
4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of. the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s memorandum (C. (53) 73) regarding the French suggestions for closer association between the United Kingdom and the european defence Community.The Foreign Secretary said that, in addition to the alterationsdiscussed at the Cabinets meeting on 24th February, he had sinceadopted some further suggestions made by the Minister of defence for minor drafting changes in the draft reply to the French Govern-ment which was reproduced in Annex D to C. (53) 73. It was hisconsidered view that this draft represented the furthest we could properly go to meet the French suggestions.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in paragraph 7 ofC. (53) 73; and authorised the Foreign Secretary to replyto the French Government in the terms of the drafts set outin Annexes D and E of that memorandum, subject to the amendments approved in the Cabinets earlier discussion on24th February and to such further drafting amendments asthe Foreign Secretary might think necessary.5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Vote onAccount, with its forecast of Government expenditure during thecoming financial year, had met with a favourable reception from parliament and the press. He acknowledged the help which he had had from his colleagues in reducing the volume of government expenditure. He was specially grateful for the notable contributionmade by the Minister of Food.More significant savings would have to be sought in the financialyear 1954-55. He looked for a substantial contribution as a resultof the examination now in progress into the scale and pattern ofdefence expenditure over the next few years. As regards civil expen-diture, he was considering whether something should not be said inhis Budget statement about the Governments attitude towards futureeconomies, and he proposed to discuss this with his colleagues onthe Ministerial Committee after his return from the United States.The Cabinet (1) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(2) Noted with appreciation the extent of the savings in Govern-ment expenditure which the Minister of Food had secured by his resolute and skilful conduct of the policy and administration of his Department.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (53) 70) and the Commonwealth Secretary(C. (53) 72) about our commercial policy in Europe..The President of the Board of Trade said that, partly owing tothe import quotas which we had found it necessary to impose, therewas imminent danger of a general reversal of current liberal tradepolicies in Europe. In his memorandum he proposed both short-term and long-term action to meet this situation.
(a) Short-term ActionIn order to forestall possible action by France and Italy whichwould be damaging to our interests he recommended that we should:(i) raise the tourist allowance forthwith from  25 to  50; (ii) state at the meeting of the Steering Board of the Organisation for european economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) on 4th March that we were urgently examining our import arrangements and that ministers would inform the Council of the results of this examination on23rd March.He suggested that an early announcement should be made aboutthe tourist allowance in order that people might have adequate timeto make plans for Easter holidays abroad.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer thatany increase in the travel allowance should be announced at the sametime as any relaxation of our import restrictions. It would be helpful to the Foreign Secretary and himself if they could make such anannouncement at the meeting of the O.E.E.C. Council on 23rd March.Meanwhile, detailed consideration could be given both to the amountof the increase to be made in the tourist allowance (he would himselfprefer not to go beyond  40) and to the nature of the relaxation of import restrictions, which in his view might cover goods to the valueof some  30 millions.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that Easter holiday travelneed not be regarded as a decisive factor in the timing of an announce-ment of an increased tourist allowance.The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed with the course recommended by the Chancellor provided that, at the O.E.E.C.meeting on 4th March, our representatives gave a sufficiently definiteindication of our intentions to prevent possible retaliatory action by france and Italy before 23rd March.The Prime Minister said that he would be strongly in favour of restoring the tourist allowance to the figure of  50 at which it had previously stood.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, at the meeting of the O.E.E.C. Steering Boardon 4th March, the United Kingdom representatives should state that we were urgently examining our import arrange-ments and that Ministers would be informing the Councilof the results of this examination at the Council meetingon 23rd March.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to submit to the Cabinet their detailed proposals regarding the tourist allowance andthe relaxation of import restrictions.(b) Long-Term action the President of the Board of Trade said that he was seeking no decisions from the Cabinet on long-term policy. He suggested (i) thatthe Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, during their forthcoming visit to Washington, should bear in mind the con-siderations outlined in his memorandum and should take soundingsof United States opinion on the major issues involved; and (ii) that officials of the Departments concerned should be instructed in the meanwhile to make a study of the tentative plan, mentioned in para-graph 8 of C. (53) 70, whereby European countries generally might agree upon a list of goods for which a wide common market withinEurope would be likely to strengthen efficiency and productivity andmight undertake to maintain liberalised trade in these goods save in exceptional emergencies.
Germany.Arrest of former Nazis.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that in the examination of the documents found in the possession of Werner Naumann and his associates enough evidence had been obtained to support an initialcharge of conspiracy against them. He had therefore authorised theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany to place theevidence before the Chancellor of the Federal Republic and to invitehim to consider whether he should arrange for proceedings to be instituted against Naumann in a German court. Although it was greatly to be hoped that Dr. Adenauer would adopt this course, theHigh Commissioner had been authorised to inform Dr. Adenauer,if he considered this desirable, that. the possibility of proceedings in a British court was by no means excluded. Once a charge had beenpreferred against Naumann, he would be entitled to private consulta-tion with his legal adviser, and it was possible that this situation wouldhave come about before 5th March when the appeals (against thedecision of the British authorities to withhold facilities&apos;for privateconsultation were due to be heard.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.FlIm 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theProduction.      President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 71) on the means of ensuringfinancial assistance for British film producers.The President of the Board of Trade said that British filmproducers found it impossible to earn, year by year, from the marketsavailable to them enough money to cover their total costs. since june 1950 they had depended on the British Film Production Fund,which was financed by a levy on box office takings, assisted by certain concessions in respect of entertainments duty. The levy now yieldedabout  3 millions a year. He was not in favour of making furtherentertainments duty concessions, and he believed that the only other means of inducing the exhibitors and producers to reach a voluntary agreement to replace the present arrangement when it expired inThe Commonwealth Secretary said that, in commercial policy,we seemed to have a real opportunity of responding to the pressure to which we were subject both from the Continent and from theUnited States to identify ourselves more closely with Europe. there seemed to be no reason why any European plan covering freer mutualtrade in named articles should not receive- the same exceptional treat-ment under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as had been accorded to the Schuman Plan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the Collectiveapproach to trade and payments must necessarily remain the principalobjective in the forthcoming discussions in Washington, the considera-tions put forward in C. (53) 70 and 72 would certainly not be overlooked.The Cabinet -(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to keep these considerations in mind in theirforthcoming discussions with United States representa-tives.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to arrange for officials of theDepartments concerned to make a detailed study of the tentative proposals in paragraphs 8 to 12 of C. (53) 70.
August 1954 was to threaten that, in the absence of a voluntary agreement, a statutory levy would be imposed. He sought authorityto make an early announcement to this effect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the Presidentsproposals.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make anannouncement on the lines proposed in C. (53) 71 and to take such steps as might be necessary and possible to have draftlegislation prepared.9. The Prime Minister said that he had now received from president Eisenhower a reply to the personal message which he had sent inviting his co-operation in the next stage of the defence negotiations with Egypt. President Eisenhower had reaffirmed his acceptance of the documents annexed to C. (53) 17 Revise as abasis for an Anglo-American approach to the Egyptian Government.But, on the suggestion that a military representative of the UnitedStates should be associated with Field-Marshal Sir William Slim inthe next stage of the negotiations in Cairo, he had said that he would prefer to reserve his final decision until he had had an opportunityfor personal discussion with the Foreign Secretary during his forth-coming visit to Washington.The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the text of the reply which he had sent to this message.The Cabinet Took note of this exchange of messages between the PrimeMinister and President Eisenhower regarding the resumptionof defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government.10. The Foreign Secretary said that he had had indicationsfrom various quarters that, in their forthcoming talks in Washington,he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be subject to strong pressure on various questions of Far Eastern policy. There was little doubt that the United States Administration would be anxiousto secure from their Allies some assurance that, if they could not make any more direct contribution towards the war in Korea, theywould at least co-operate in applying more effective economic sanctions against China. We must ourselves expect criticism of our commercial relations with China and of the use of British shipping in the China trade. It seemed likely that we should feel obliged tomake some concessions on these points in the interests of Anglo-American relations. He expected special criticism of three particular points which had been brought to his notice: Ci) the bunkering inBritish ports of foreign ships carrying strategic goods to China; (ii) theprovision of stores at Hong Kong to foreign tankers bound for china; and (iii) the freedom with which ships chartered by Com-munist China could gain access to the Hong Kong register.The President of the Board of Trade said that the extent of our participation in the China trade was widely misrepresented in theUnited States; and many of the particular criticisms could be effectively answered. It was important that we should not be rushedinto extending our restrictions beyond the point to which other european Governments were prepared to go. There was a real risk that, if we did, we should inflict no damage on the Chinese Com-munists and lose long-term markets to our European competitors.
The Prime Minister said that it was likely that some concession would have to be made to American feeling on this question. TheCabinet should consider the matter further at their next meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Trans-port, Fuel and Power and the President of the Board ofTrade to submit, for consideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting, a memorandum on the possibilities of imposing further restrictions on trade between the UnitedKingdom and China and on the use of British shipping inthe China trade.The 11.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was proposedCoronation. that during the Coronation Service Bracelets should be presented to(Previous Her Majesty in accordance with a tradition of the 17th century. The,Reference: Prime Minister of Australia, on hearing of this proposal, had .C. (53) 14th suggested to other Commonwealth Prime Ministers that the BraceletsConclusions, should on this occasion be provided by Dominion Governments.Minute 7.) It was likely that. the Governments of all the members of theReealia Commonwealth which owed allegiance to the Crown would wish tojoin in making this gift; and the Prime Minister of Canada had expressed the opinion that the United Kingdom Government shouldnot be excluded.The Cabinet agreed that it would not be in accordance with thecurrent constitutional relations between the various members of theCommonwealth that the United Kingdom should in this matter standseparately from the other members. It was preferable that all the member States which owed allegiance to the Crown should join inmaking this gift.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should be associated with the provision of Bracelets which were tobe presented to Her Majesty during the CoronationService.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to convey their views to the Prime Minister of Australia.CommonwealthEconomicConference.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)Mission ofMinisters to washington.12. The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary and theChancellor of the Exchequer were leaving that evening on theirmission to Washington, where they would be broaching with theUnited States Administration the financial and economic plans whichhad been evolved at the Commonwealth Economic Conference.These discussions, though preliminary and informal, might well prove to be of crucial importance for the future prosperity, not of thiscountry alone, but of the whole of the free world. He knew thathis Cabinet colleagues would desire him to express on their behalftheir good wishes to the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer for the success of their mission.The Cabinet warmly endorsed the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th February 1953.
