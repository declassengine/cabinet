United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany asking what legaljustification there was for Naumann&apos;s arrest, whether it was proposedto bring him to trial and, if so, on what charge, and indicating thathabeas corpus proceedings might be taken in respect of him.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Parliament 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that a number of Labour MembersBusiness in the had sought to place on the Order Paper of the House of CommonsHouse of a motion urging the Home Secretary to reconsider his decision thatCommons. he would not be justified in advising a reprieve for Derek WilliamBentley, who was under sentence of death for his part in the murder of a policeman at Croydon in November. It was, however, an established rule that Parliament was not competent to discuss theexercise of the prerogative of mercy in individual cases. The motionhad therefore been refused, and it was assumed that Mr. Speakerwould on the same ground decline to allow the matter to be discussed in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the.House of Commons in the following week.On 2nd and 3rd February general debates would be held on the consolidated Fund Bill, and the Opposition were expected to choose,as subjects for those debates, Housing and the commonwealth economic Conference.House of lords reform.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet were informed that, in accordance with their decision of 30th December, the Lord President had taken further steps to impress upon Lord Simon the undesirability of proceeding with his Bill for the creation of life Peers at a time when it was proposed to hold a three-Party conference on the general question ofthe reform of the House of Lords. Lord Simon was unwilling to forgo a Second Reading debate on his Bill; but it now seemed likely that, instead of pressing it to a division.; he would be content to move,at the end of the debate, that further proceedings on the Bill should be adjourned.The Cabinet took note of this statement.Overseas 4.

Egypt- 5.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 23rd October theSupply of       Cabinet had agreed in principle that delivery might now be made ofJet Aircraft.     a proportion of the jet aircraft which we had previously undertaken(Previous        to supply to Egypt.  Egyptian pilots had arrived in this country to reference:      fly these aircraft to Egypt, and some of them were due to be handedC.C. (52) 89th   over on 30th January.  He had thought it right to report this to theConclusions,    Prime Minister, and had now received from him a message askingMinute 5.)       that delivery of this aircraft should be delayed so that he might havean opportunity to discuss the matter further after his return toLondon.   Delivery could be delayed for a few days on technical grounds, and this was being arranged. It was, however, more difficultto know how best to deal with the Parliamentary Questions on thissubject which he had to answer on the following day.  He had beenproposing to give a reply based on the Cabinet&apos;s previous decision that a limited number of these aircraft might now be delivered; and,on the eve of the difficult negotiations which were about to be opened in Cairo on the future of the Sudan, he did not wish to give theimpression that the Government were about to reverse that decision.He could say that none of these aircraft had yet been handed over tothe Egyptians but, if he were pressed&quot;to give a date, he could hardlyavoid saying that some of the aircraft were due to be delivered very shortly.  If he gave that reply, it was possible that some members might seek to adjourn the House for the purpose of debating thematter.In discussion it was pointed out that, since the Cabinefs decisionof 23rd October, the attitude of the Egyptian Government had become more hostile to this country, and it might have a salutary effect on General Neguib to learn that these aircraft might not after all be delivered. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinetthat the Foreign Secretary should not give any public indication ofthis possibility before it was known what progress was being madein the impending talks with the Egyptian Government about theSudan or in advance of the discussion which he was to have with thePrime Minister after his return about the continued supply of arms to Egypt. It would be preferable that he should give non-committalreplies to the Questions which were to be put to him on the following day, even though this involved some risk of an adjournment motion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the delivery ofthese jet aircraft to the Egyptians to be delayed for a fewdays until he had been able to discuss with the PrimeMinister whether any further change should be made inthe policy of supplying arms to Egypt.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would give non-committal replies to the Parliamentary Questions on thismatter which he had to answer in the House of commons on the following day.Majesty&apos;s Government. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, he pro-posed to give the following reply to this Question: &quot; I accept full responsibility for the fact that these words appeared. But I freelyadmit that any estimate of the influence of individual newspapers isa matter of opinion, and not one upon which Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are called upon to form, still less to express, a collectiveopinion.&quot;The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the reply whichthe Foreign Secretary proposed to give to this Question.
The Coronation.Naval Review.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 95thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that on 11thNovember, when the Cabinet had approved the holding of a NavalReview at the time of the Coronation, he had estimated that between 15,000 and  25,000 would have to be spent on the entertainment ofdistinguished visitors. After going into the matter in more detail hehad come to the conclusion that 1,250 guests would have to be enter -tained and that it would be necessary for this purpose to hire threeliners at a total cost of  30,000. This had been reported to the PrimeMinister, who had approved the proposal.In the course of the discussion it emerged that, apart from theprovision to be made for Ministers, it would not be possible, underthe arrangements envisaged, to invite more than 60 Members ofthe two Houses of Parliament, with their wives, to see the Review.The Cabinet feared that serious disappointment would be felt in bothHouses if a larger proportion of Members were not invited to the review.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that no substantial reduc-tion could be made in the number of other guests, and that the only way of providing more accommodation for Members of parliament would be to charter a further liner at an additional cost of  14,000 or 15,000.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Lordof the Admiralty to consider and report to the PrimeMinister what arrangements could be made to include,among the guests at the Naval Review, a larger number ofMembers of the two Houses of Parliament.Sunday observance.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 29) setting out the advantages and disadvantages ofan enquiry into the reform of the Sunday Observance Acts.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the Governmentappointed a committee of enquiry, they would be expected to assume responsibility for dealing with its report. There was general support for the view that the Government should do their utmost to avoidsuch an enquiry.The Cabinet were informed that only a relatively small numberof Members of the House of Commons favoured the holding of an enquiry and that there was a good prospect that a majority wouldvote against the Second Reading of the Sunday Observance Bill.The Cabinet Agreed that the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forthe Home Department, who would speak for the Government. in the debate on the Sunday Observance Bill on 30thJanuary, should give no encouragement to the suggestionthat an enquiry should be held into the reform of the sunday Observance Acts.TransatlanticTelephoneCable.43722-18. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (53) 27) seeking approval of the proposedbasis of negotiation with the American Telephone and TelegraphCompany about the laying of a transatlantic telephone cable.B 3
The Postmaster-General said that the existing wireless telephone service to North America was already unsatisfactory and by 1960would be quite incapable of handling the estimated volume of traffic.The laying of a transatlantic telephone cable had recently become aneconomic proposition owing to the increased number of circuits which such a cable would now provide. The share of the initial capitalexpenditure which would be incurred by the Exchequer through our undertaking a joint project with the American Telephone and Tele-graph Company was estimated at  5 millions, but the project could resonably be expected to pay for itself eventually on the basis of present-day tariffs and continuance of the present rate of increase oftraffic. In addition, much of the cable required would probably be ordered in this country and a major share of the laying was likely tobe undertaken by the British cable-laying ship Monarch, and thiswould earn us dollars. He therefore recommended that we should seek agreement with the American Company for the laying of the cable on the basis that the American system would be used for themain transatlantic crossing but that (i) the British system would beused between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia; and (ii) any secondcable would eventually be laid to this country. The American system would cost rather more and be rather less efficient than the Britishsystem but adoption of the latter for the main crossing would involvedelay. If we declined to negotiate on the basis which he recom-mended, the Americans would probably proceed with the project in association with some other country and on the basis of a route lessadvantageous to us. In his view we should give Canada the oppor-tunity of participating in the project but should not press her to doso because her participation, although it would reduce our share ofthe capital cost, would also reduce our dollar receipts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he entirelysupported the Postmaster-General&apos;s proposals, he was not at presentprepared to agree that the project should be regarded as outside thecapital investmenrprogramme of the Post Office.The Postmaster-General said that as telephone development was already very much in arrears and was likely to become even more soin 1953-54, he would be very reluctant to agree that the cost of the project should be counted against the normal capital investment programme of the Post Office.There was general support for the proposals in C. (53) 27. Whileit was agreed that Canada should not be pressed to participate, it was recognised that, if she should show anxiety to do so, it would be undesirable on political grounds to seek to exclude her.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised discussions with the United States Governmentand, thereafter, negotiations with the American telephone and Telegraph Company about the construction of atransatlantic telephone cable on the conditions set out inparagraph 11 of the annex to C. (53) 27 and on the under-standing that the capital cost to the United KingdomGovernment would not, without Treasury approval, be permitted to exceed  5 millions, payable in sterling.(2) Agreed that the Canadian Government should be informed of the project before discussions with the United StatesGovernment were initiated.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePostmaster-General would discuss further the relation, ofthis project to the Post Office capital investment pro-gramme.
East/WestTirade.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 9.1stConclusions,Minute 4.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 21) drawing attention to a defect in the existing arrangements for controlling the supply of strategic goods to countriesin the Soviet bloc and to China. These arrangements did not preventstrategic goods from being consigned to an innocent destination anddiverted thereafter by trans-shipment in Continental ports to oneof the countries in the Soviet bloc or to China, and British merchantswere, in fact, known to be engaged in such transactions. Trans-shipment controls were the only effective remedy for this; but theother Continental countries in the Paris Group were unwilling to.introduce these unless all, including the Netherlands, introduced them at the same time; and the Netherlands Government were unwilling to impose them unless all other members of the Group applied thefinancial controls necessary to prevent their residents from partici-pating in these merchanting transactions. The Foreign Secretarytherefore recommended that we should agree to introduce financial control over dealings by persons resident in the United Kingdom instrategic goods not passing through this country, on condition thatthe other members of the Paris Group would agree simultaneously to introduce trans-shipment controls.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be most reluctant to introduce these financial controls, partly because theycould not be fully effective and partly because he was unwilling tointroduce further restrictions on the use of sterling at a time when we were trying to build up confidence in sterling and to createconditions favourable to a move towards its convertibility.The President of the Board of Trade agreed that financial controls were unlikely to be effective for this purpose. The Ministerof Materials also deprecated the proposal for financial controls, whichwould be inconsistent with the policy of returning to private enter-prise the international trade in metals and other materials.In further discussion the suggestion was made that the UnitedStates Government should be asked to consider whether they couldnot-bring further pressure to bear on the Netherlands Governmentwith a view to inducing them to introduce effective trans-shipmentcontrols. It was, however, argued that trans-shipment controlsinvolved delays to shipping, especially for ships carrying mixedcargoes, and could not always be made fully effective. The colonial secretary said that he would be in difficulty if it were proposed thattrans-shipment controls should be applied in Singapore and HongKong.The Cabinet considered that in all the circumstances further thought should be given to the possibility of adopting the alternative course of imposing control over transactions, viz., making it an offence for any person resident in the United Kingdom to engage in transactions involving the sale of strategic goods directly or indirectly to countries in the Soviet bloc or to China. They recog-nised, however, that legislation would be required for this purpose and would be controversial.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to consider and report to the Cabinetwhat measures could be taken, short of imposing the finan-cial controls suggested in C. (53) 21, to induce the Nether-lands Government to impose the trans-shipment controlsrequired to close the existing gap in the arrangements for controlling the export of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc and, if no other measures would suffice, whether legislation could be contemplated to impose the transaction controlsdescribed in paragraphs 7-9 of the Annex to that memorandum.
10. The Minister of Defence said that, to carry out the operation for protecting British lives in Cairo and Alexandria, an additionalbattalion would now have to be provided from the United Kingdom,to replace the battalion which had been sent to Kenya. This wouldhave to reach the Canal Zone within 48 hours of the start of theoperation; and, as it would take the battalion 48 hours to reach the canal Zone by air, he proposed that the 2nd Battalion, the GreenHowards, should forthwith be put on 96 hours&apos; notice for overseas service.The Secretary of State for War said that 96 hours&apos; notice wouldnot involve unduly stringent restrictions on the troops concerned.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not think there need beany objection to this. Action should be taken as unobtrusively aspossible and, if questions were raised, it could be said that a battalionhad to be ready to move at short notice in case of any emergencyarising overseas in the course of the cold war.The Cabinet-Agreed that the 2nd Battalion, the Green Howards, shouldbe put at 96 hours&apos; notice for movement to the Canal Zone.11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (53) 28)seeking approval of the terms of the Preface to the White paper to be issued at the close of the Conference on Central african federation.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) This Preface would make public for the first time the Govern-ment&apos;s intention to proceed with the Federation, provided that it was accepted at the referendum in Southern Rhodesia and by the legis-Legislatures of the other countries concerned (including the UnitedKingdom itself), in accordance with the Cabinefs decision of22nd December. Publication of the White Paper would thereforerelease the criticism of the Governments decision which was expectedboth in this country and in Africa.(b) Attention was drawn to the closing words of the second paragraph on page 3, viz., &quot; the association of the three territories would enable the Federation, when the inhabitants of the Territoriesso desire, to go forward with confidence towards the attainment of full membership of the Commonwealth.&quot;It was explained that, although these words went further than any previous public statement in holding out to the Federation theprospect of full membership of the Commonwealth, they were theleast that could be said, especially in view of Southern Rhodesia&apos;desire for some assurance that her constitutional progress would notbe prejudiced by entering the Federation. The eventual admission ofthe Federation to full Commonwealth membership would, of course,be dependent upon the agreement of all full members of the Common-wealth at the time.(c) The Foreign Secretary said that the penultimate sentence ofparagraph 2 might give undue encouragement to the advocates of federation in Europe. He would prefer that it should be redraftedon the following lines : &quot; No one of these Territories can be expectedto subordinate its own interests to those of one of the others for whichit has no responsibility and with which it is not politically associated.&quot;The Commonwealth Secretary undertook to commend this amendment to the Conference.
The Cabinet Subject to the point noted in paragraph (c) above, approved the Preface to the White Paper annexed to C. (53) 28.12. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the economic policy Committee had agreed that, in conjunction with the UnitedStates Government, we should invite the International monetary fund (I.M.F.) to join with us in seeking a solution to the problem ofBraziFs trading deficit with this country. The commonwealth secretary had been concerned lest the provision of sterling to Brazilby the I.M.F. might cause us embarrassment with other Common-wealth countries, especially Australia. This, however, was unlikelysince Brazil would incur a debt to the Fund, repayable in dollars,corresponding to the amount of sterling she would receive. This was likely to be some  12 millions; and it would almost certainly benecessary to fund a part of the remainder of BraziFs  50 millions debt.He was not in favour of buying Brazilian cotton at its present price:the position might be different when Brazilian legislation to introduce a free exchange market had come into force, although it was not yetclear that such a market would cover cotton. Our trade relations withBrazil presented a number of unsatisfactory features, for example, thevery substantial export credits outstanding on our exports. The best hope for improving the position generally seemed to lie in enlistingthe help of the I.M.F. on the lines proposed.The Paymaster-General said that he favoured saving ourselvesdollars by buying some Brazilian cotton, provided we could do so atthe American price. Further, if we were to return Brazil to theAmerican account area, as was also contemplated, might this not havethe result that Brazil would increase her imports from other countries,for example Germany, at the expense of her imports from us?The President of the Board of Trade said that it was doubtfulwhether the Government could force the Raw Cotton Commission to buy Brazilian cotton against its will. Moreover, if we boughtBrazilian cotton in these circumstances, we should be strongly pressed to make similar purchases from Egypt and Pakistan.- The Cabinet Endorsed the decision of the Economic Policy Committeethat the assistance of the International Monetary fund should be invited in seeking a solution to the problem ofBraziTs trading deficit with this country.Cabinet Office, SWA,27th January, 1953.Trade withBrazil.
