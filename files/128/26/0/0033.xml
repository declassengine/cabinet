Foreign Affairs. 2. The Prime Minister said that President Eisenhower hadTripartite spoken to him on the telephone at a late hour on the previous meeting. evening and had expressed a wish for an early personal meeting withhim and the Prime Minister of France. This suggestion had beenmade at the instance of the French Government who desired that,if it were accepted, a simultaneous announcement should be madein the three capitals in the afternoon of 21st May. In the course ofthe conversation it was provisionally agreed that the meeting, if held,might take place in Bermuda on or soon after .17th June.The Prime Minister had at once called into consultation theLord President, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the commonwealth secretary and the Minister of State. They had all agreed that itwould be right to accept this invitation. The Prime Minister had therefore confirmed in a further telephone conversation with thePresident his willingness to attend such a meeting; and he had obtained The Queen&apos;s permission to leave the country for this pur-pose. Other Commonwealth Governments had been informed. Itwas proposed that an announcement should be made to parliament that afternoon.Kenya. 1.   The Colonial Secretary reported to the Cabinet the impres-0?previous        sjons which he had formed during his recent visit to Kenya.Reference: The main favourable factors were that the disaffection had note.C.(53)2lst spread to any significant extent from the Kikuyu to other tribes;Conclusions, that the number of Kikuyu abandoning their Mau Mau allegianceMinute4.) was greatly increasing; that the authorities were receiving a muchgreater volume of intelligence about Mau Mau movements; and thatthe recruiting of loyal Kikuyu to Home Guard units was proceeding satisfactorily. On the other hand the Mau Mau were now operating in much larger gangs. Although this was to our advantage so far asthey could be engaged by the military or by regular police, the largergangs represented a serious threat to the smaller Home Guard posts.The Colonial Secretary said that the situation had improvedgreatly since his previous visit. The European community wereregaining confidence in the local Government, and the atmospheregenerally was much improved. If the authorities could now give afresh impetus to their activities and if, in particular, a few moreBritish troops could be provided, order might be fully restored in afew more months.Meanwhile there were serious delays in disposing of the criminalcharges awaiting trial by the courts, and the more extreme elements in the European community were demanding the application of methods of summary justice. He was not prepared to meet this demand, but he had arranged with the local Government for theestablishment of a system of emergency assizes to deal with theseCases under a slightly simplified procedure.The Prime Minister said that care should, be taken to avoid the simultaneous execution of any large number of persons who mightbe sentenced to death by these courts. Public opinion in this country would be critical of anything resembling mass executions. TheColonial Secretary said that there would be no question of executinganyone who had not been tried and convicted on a capital charge bydue process of law. But he would seek the advice of his cabinet colleagues if any question arose of carrying out simultaneously deathsentences imposed on more than, say, twelve persons.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary,
