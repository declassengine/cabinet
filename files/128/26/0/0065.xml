Trieste.(previous reference:CC. (53) 64thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that after the Cabinefs discussion on the previous day he had made a further effort to persuade theUnited States Government to accept a delay in making the proposedapproach to the Italian and Yugoslav Governments with a view tothe convening of a Five-Power Conference on Trieste. In response to these further representations the United States Government had put forward the compromise proposal that, while the approach should not be delayed, it should be made clear to both the Italian andthe Yugoslav Governments that no conversations would be initiatedwith a view to arranging the proposed appointments of Italians to administrative posts in Zone A until order had been completelyrestored in the area. The Foreign Secretary thought that this was areasonable compromise, and he proposed to accept it in substance.He would, however, prefer that the conversations about the transferof administrative posts should not open until the United States and united Kingdom&quot; Governments were satisfied that there was nofurther danger of disturbances in Zone A; and he would try to securethat this phrase was substituted for that suggested by the Americans.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to agree that the proposedapproach might now be made to the Italian and YugoslavGovernments with a view to the convening of a Five-power conference on Trieste, on the understanding that it wouldbe made clear to those Governments that arrangements forthe proposed transfer to the Italians of administrativeresponsibilities in Zone A could not now begin immediately,in view of the recent disturbances in the area.Tripartite 2.   The Prime Minister said that the French Government hadMeeting in now accepted the invitation to attend the meeting of the three HeadsBermuda. of Governments which it was proposed to hold in Bermuda from(Previous 4th to 8th December. Rumours of this meeting had already been reference: published in the Press, apparently as a result of premature disclosuresCC (53) 64th in Paris. It had been agreed that an official announcement should be conclusions, issued in the three capitals that afternoon.Minute 2.)The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Parliament 3.  The Cabinet considered the business to be taken in the judges&apos; House of Commons in the following week.Remuneration Discussion turned mainly on the question whether the secondBUI. reading of the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill should be taken on 18th(Previous November.   It had previously been proposed that discussion of thisReferences: Bill might be deferred until further progress had been made in theCC. (53) 54th current examination of the remuneration of Ministers and MembersConclusions, of Parliament; and some Ministers were still inclined to think that minute 7, there would.be a more favourable political atmosphere for discussion and 58th of this Bill if some agreement had first been reached between theConclusions, Parties on the remuneration of Members.  As against this it was minute 2.) argued that many Conservative supporters in the country would doubt;, the expediency of increasing Members&apos;remuneration at the presenttime, and that there was little reason to hope that any early agreement could be reached on this question between the Parties at Westminster.
East/west trade.Sale of Ships to soviet bloc.(previous reference:C.C.&apos;(53) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of the Admiralty(C. (53) 313) reporting the results of discussions in the Paris Group onthe proposed supply of certain trawlers to the Soviet bloc.The President of the Board of Trade said that our proposals hadbeen accepted by all the countries of the Paris Group except theUnited States, who had asked that we should postpone decision untildiscussions had been held on the general question of shipping control.From our point of view there was every advantage in executing these orders. Some of our shipyards would soon be short of work, and ifwe did not accept these orders they would be placed elsewhere. TheNaval Staff saw no strategic danger in supplying these trawlers toRussia and Poland. He therefore proposed that we should set a time-limit on the further discussions with the Americans and that, if no new arguments were produced, we should proceed to issue licences toshipbuilders to build up to thirty fishing vessels for sale to Russia andauthorise the owners concerned to sell five second-hand trawlers to poland.The Foreign Secretary said that, while he agreed generally withthese proposals, he thought that the time limit should extend to 18thNovember. That would give more time for the Americans to adduceany new arguments and, if they did so, for the Cabinet to review theposition.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals put forward by thePresident of the Board of Trade and the First Lord of theAdmiralty in C. (53) 313.(2) Agreed that action should be delayed until 18th November inorder to give the Americans time to bring forward freshobjections if they wished to do so.(3) Agreed that, if the Americans produced new argumentswithin the time limit, the position should be reviewed bythe Cabinet in the light of those arguments.If therefore the Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill were held back on this account it might be,delayed for a considerable time. Moreover, ifthe Government allowed the two questions to be linked together,they might thereby prejudice one of the main arguments in favour ofthe Judges&apos; Remuneration Bill, viz., that the position of the HighCourt Judges was not comparable with that of any other class of thecommunity.The Cabinet recognised that, if it could be established that theLabour Party in the House of Commons were not likely to offerstrenuous opposition to the proposals now embodied in the Judges&apos;Remuneration Bill, there would be a strong case for proceeding withthe.Bill in advance of any agreement on the remuneration of ministers and Members of Parliament.The Cabinet Decided that the second reading of the Judges&apos; Remunera-tion Bill should not be taken in the following week; butagreed that at their meeting on 19th November they shouldresume their discussion of the time-table for this Bill in thelight of further soundings which would be taken meanwhileregarding the attitude which the Labour Opposition were,likely to adopt towards it.
Privileges and immunities.InternationalTin Agreement.(previous reference:C.C.&apos;(53) 45thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Colonial Secretary(C. (53) 306) on the application of United Kingdom income tax and profits tax to an International Tin Council established in London.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it would beto our advantage if the United Nations Conference, opening atGeneva on 16th November, could be persuaded to accept an inter-national agreement for tin providing for the restriction of tin pro-duction and the creation of an international buffer stock to stabilise the market price. It was unlikely that the Americans, who were the biggest consumers of tin and had amassed a very large strategic stock of it, would support the conclusion of such an agreement. If, how-ever, the agreement were approved, it was greatly to our interest thatthe Tin Council should be located in London. Other countries couldnot be expected to agree to this unless they could be assured that theoperation of the buffer stock would be exempt from United Kingdomincome tax and profits tax. He therefore recommended that in this event an Order in Council should be made under the international organisation (Immunity and Privileges) Act, 1950, giving immunityin respect of the contribution of all Governments to the funds of theCouncil.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that there would&quot; be great advantage in locating the Tin Council in London, if the agree-ment were signed. He felt, however, that exemption from incometax and profits tax for the buffer stock funds should only be con-ceded if that was found to be the price we had to pay for persuadingother countries to agree that the Headquarters of the Council shouldbe in London.(b) The question whether an Order in Council would be neededmight be affected by the decision taken in a case now pending in theEnglish courts.(c) It might be suggested that the salaries of non-Britishemployees of the Tin Council should also be exempt from income tax.No encouragement should be given to this suggestion.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if a commodity agreement for tin were signed at Geneva, there would be every advantage in having themanagement of the buffer stock and the InternationalTin Council located in London.(2) Agreed that an offer to exempt the buffer stock funds from united Kingdom income tax and profits tax should bemade only if that were found to be necessary for securing agreement that the Headquarters of the Tin council should be established in London.(3) Took note that any suggestion for extending tax exemptionto employees of the International Tin Council would be resisted.television development.(previous reference:CC. (53) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Postmaster-General (C. (53) 311) proposing an amended version of paragraph 10and a small amendment to paragraph 11 of the draft White Paper on television development.The Postmaster-General said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, he had prepared a revised version ofthe paragraph of the White Paper dealing with the question whetherreligion and politics should be excluded from the television pro-grammes of the commercial companies.   His revised version, which
he had discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, left the pointopen for decision by Parliament, and went some way towards imply-ing that a free vote might be allowed on this particular issue.In discussion the point was made that the paragraph as nowdrafted would give an impression of indecision. If the Governmentbelieved that religion and politics could not in practice be excludedfrom these programmes, might it not be better to say so?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on reflection, hewould prefer to revert to his suggestion that religion and politicsshould be excluded from these programmes in the initial period oftwo or three years, while the new Corporation was getting into itsstride. This was the policy which had been applied in the early days of the B.B.C. It might be said in the White Paper that, as televisionwould be controlled by a public corporation, there was a strongercase for withdrawing the ban on politics and religion. The ban couldbe withdrawn either at once or after a period of testing the workingof the new arrangements. The White Paper could then go on tosay that the arrangements for permitting commercial broadcastingon these topics would embody the same safeguards as were now appliedto the B.B.C. A statement of this kind would leave the initiative inthe hands of the Government, both on the time at which broadcastson religion and politics would be allowed and on the method of votingupon this particular issue.There was general support in the Cabinet for this suggestion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to re-draft paragraph 10 ofthe White Paper in accordance with the suggestions madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to send the re-drafted paragraph for approval to the Foreign Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal.(2) Approved the proposed amendment of paragraph 11 of theWhite Paper as set out in C. (53) 311.(3) Authorised the Postmaster-General to publish the white paper on Television Policy, in the form of the draft annexed to C. (53) 289 (Revise) subject to the amendments to be made in accordance with Conclusions (1) and (2)above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th November, 1953.
