Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the  the House of Commons in the following week.House of During the week a debate was to be held on the EuropeanCommons. situation, with particular reference to Trieste; and the Cabinet con-sidered on which day this should take place. They thought that itshould be postponed for as long as possible, as there were some signs that the present tension over Trieste might decrease, and agreed thatit should be held on 28th October. This would mean that thecorresponding debate in the House of Lords could not be held beforethe Prorogation; but the Leader of the Labour Opposition in theHouse of Lords, who had been made aware of the Governmentsdifficulties, was willing that discussion in the House of Lords shouldbe deferred until the opening days of the new session.Egypt. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Egyptians had nowDefence rejected our proposals on the availability of the Base and on the wear-Negotiations,    ing of uniform.   They had said that they could not accept an obliga-(Previous        tion to make the Base available on a recommendation by the united reference:      Nations; and on the wearing of uniform they had produced an alter-C.C.

If we did so, there was still a chance that the egyptians would be brought to accept them.   If they did not, therewas no breaking-point which could suit us better than their rejection of an obligation to make the Base available on a recommendation bythe United Nations.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom Delegation in Cairo to tell the egyptian delegation that we had nothing to add to, or subtractfrom, the proposals which we had already made for a defence agreement.Evacuation of The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignMaltese. Secretary (C. (53) 295) drawing attention to the fact that there wereresident in Egypt between 7,000 and 8,000 British subjects of Malteseorigin and suggesting that in any plan for evacuating British subjects from Egypt if serious disorders broke out there, provision would haveto be made for removing such of these Maltese as wished to leave.The Foreign Secretary said that Malta would not readmit these people, and no other British Colony was prepared to receive them.It might therefore be necessary to bring to the United Kingdom thoseof them who wished to be evacuated from Egypt in an emergency.He did not ask for any. final decision at this stage, but he though this colleagues should be aware of the problem.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum C. (53)295.Trieste. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had gained the impression(Previous        that both Italy and Yugoslavia were becoming slightly less inflexibleReference:      over the Trieste dispute.   He had received advanced information ofC.C. (53) 59th   the French Foreign Minister^ latest ideas (Paris telegram No. 386)Conclusions,     which he found helpful; and he now intended to obtain AmericanMinute 2.)       and French agreement to a scheme by which the date of the transferof the administration of Zone A to the Italians would be kept flexible,although the decision would remain firm.   Jn the meantime, as suggested by M. Bidault, the task of the three Western governments would be to influence the Italian and Yugoslav Governments through
Certificationand detention of MentalPatients.(previous reference:CC. (53) 59thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Prime Minister said that he had been looking again atthe proposed terms of reference for the Royal Commission on thecertification and detention of mental patients, which the Cabinet had approved on 19th October. He thought that the wording should be adjusted so as to make it more clear that treatment without certifi-cation was not given without the consent of the patient.The Cabinet Agreed that the terms of reference for the Royal Corn-mission on the certification and detention of mental patientsshould be amended by inserting, after the words &quot; to betreated,&quot; the words &quot; as voluntary patients.&quot;East/west trade.(previous reference:CC. (53) 55thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (53) 294) suggesting that a public indicationmight now be given of the Governments readiness to consider some relaxation of the strategic controls on East-West trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that he was not atpresent proposing any drastic change of policy. The Governmentwould, however, be under political pressure from both sides of theHouse of Commons to show that they were ready to consider suchrelaxations as were justified by changes in the general strategicsituation and, in particular, by the conclusion of an armistice in korea. He therefore sought the Cabinefs authority to make anearly statement on the lines of the draft set out in paragraph 4 ofC. (53) 294.The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, this draft went too far in foreshadowing relaxation of the controls. We were now onthe point of opening private discussions with the United states authorities with a view to securing their agreement to some adjustment of the existing policy. Those discussions could not fail to be preju-diced if, before they started, we made a public statement whichwould be taken to imply that we favoured some substantial relaxation of the existing controls.The Lord President said that the French Government might also,be disturbed by such an announcement.   For, although an armisticehad been concluded in Korea, the situation in Indo-China had notimproved.... In further discussion it was agreed that the following amend-merits should be made in the draft statement suggested by thePresident of the Board of Trade:  (i) In the third sentence the words &quot; Russia and her satellites &quot;should be substituted for &quot; the Soviet bloc.&quot;diplomatic channels with a view to reaching a basis for an eventualFive-Power Conference. Although the decision to withdraw allied forces from Zone A still held good, it was important, if any solutionwas to be reached that the withdrawal of anything of effective military value should not begin yet, and he understood that instructions had now been sent to the Allied Commander in Trieste that he was notto withdraw anything of military value without further instructions.The Cabinet Endorsed the action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.
Tariff Policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:CC. (53) 59thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 20th October, he had urged the Australian Governmentto consider again whether they could not support, at the current session of the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) at Geneva, a compromise solution which would avoid Japan&apos;s provisional association with the Agreement. They had now replied that they were unable to modify their attitude towards a compromise solution and were resolved to abstain from voting on thequestion of Japan&apos;s association with the Agreement.The Foreign Secretary agreed that in these circumstances wecould do no more to further a compromise solution.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva that they should no longer support the attempt to find a compromise solution,but should abstain from voting on the question of Japan&apos;sprovisional association with the G.A.T.T.industrial disputes.Distribution of petrol and fuel Oil.7. The Minister of Labour said that the distribution of petrol and fuel oil in the London area had been virtually halted by an unofficial strike of tanker crews. The strike had arisen out of thedecision of the oil companies to transfer some of their distributionwork to sub-contractors, but the men were now putting forward as anadditional grievance the delay in settling an outstanding wage claim.Officials of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union were trying to get the men to return to work. In a statement which he would be making that afternoon, in reply to a Private Notice Question in theHouse of Commons, he would deprecate this unofficial strike andwould support the efforts which the Union were making to bring it to an end.The Cabinet were informed that, if the strike continued, bus services in London would have to be reduced by 25 per cent, and milkdistribution would also be affected. The situation would becomeserious unless the men could be got back to work within the next fewdays.The Cabinet agreed that, if the strike continued, there would beample justification for using publicly-owned transport, military and civil, for the distribution of petrol and fuel oil required for the purposeof maintaining essential services. The timing of such action would,however, need to be carefully judged so as to reduce to a minimum the risk of extending the strike to areas outside London.(ii) For the fifth sentence the following should be substituted :&quot; Although the security controls are not inflexible, it wouldnot be in our interests to vary them substantially unless or until we are sure that the circumstances which gave riseto them have changed.&quot;(hi) In the last sentence &quot; modifications &quot; should be substitutedfor &quot; relaxations.&quot;The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to make, inreply to Parliamentary Questions, an interim statement onEast/West trade in the terms of the draft set out in para-graph 4 of C. (53) 294 subject to the amendments noted inparagraphs (i)-(iii) above.
The Home Secretary said that the Official Committee on Emer-gencies had been reviewing the position and, on receiving their report,he would consider whether he should convene a meeting of the ministerial Committee.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.8. The Minister of Food said that Mr. H. Nicholls, M.P., had now given notice of a Parliamentary Question for answer on26th October asking whether oils and fats would be freed from control in the near future. Now that the matter was to be raised in this way in the House of Commons, it seemed to him to be impossible to with-hold from Parliament information which would be in the possessionof the farmers&apos; representatives and the food trades. He thereforesought the Cabinet&apos;s authority to announce, in reply to this question on 26th October, the Governments intention to decontrol milk products during the first half of 1954. He would of course arrangefor the farmers&apos; representatives to be informed in advance of the termsof the proposed announcement and of the reasons why it was thought necessary to make it.In discussion reference was again made to the fact that at themeeting with the farmers&apos; representatives on 12th October the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer had promised that no public statement wouldbe made about this decision while the farmers were considering theproposal that some of the powers of the Milk Marketing Boards mightbe restored. Should it not be ascertained whether the Chancellor was prepared to agree that, in the new circumstances, a public announce-ment of this decision could no longer be delayed? It was also suggested that notification of the terms of the proposed statement should reach the farmers&apos; representatives as far as possible in advanceof the date on which it was to be made.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Food to ascertain whether theChancellor of the Exchequer was agreeable that, in the changed circumstances, a public announcement should now be made Of the Governments intention to decontrolmilk products in the first half of 1954.(2) Subject to the Chancellors agreement, and to early advancenotice to the farmers&apos; representatives and the food trades concerned, authorised the Minister of Food to announce this intention in reply to a Parliamentary Question byMr. H. Nicholls, M.P., on 26th October.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd October, 1953.Food.Decontrol of milk Products.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 59thConclusions,Minute 6.)
