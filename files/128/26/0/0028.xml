1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.A two-day debate would be held on foreign affairs, probably on28th and 29th April.Persian Gulf. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterTheTrucial of Defence (C. (53) 128) describing the military measures which hadSheikhdoms.    been taken in the Trucial Sheikhdoms.(Previous The Minister of Defence explained with the aid of a map the dis-Reference:      positions of the Trucial Oman Levies and the Aden ProtectorateC.C.

Efforts to supply Turki and his eightyMinute 7.)      followers by truck convoys and camel trains had be frustrated; butthey could not be starved out completely as they could still obtain some food from the inhabitants of Buraimi. The only alternative would be to arrest and deport Turki, but this course would not betaken without further authority from the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said that he had had an exchange of letterswith King Ibn Saud, and Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador had now been summoned to go and see the King. For the present therefore thereshould be no extension of military measures.The Cabinet Took note of the memorandum bv the Minister of Defence(C. (53) 128).Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.Armed Forces. 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theOfficers&apos; Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 126) pointing out the difficultiesRetired Pay.     that would arise if further improvements were made in the retired pay(Previous        Qf officers who retired from the Armed Forces between the two wars.Reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he recognisedC.C. (53) 22nd the force of this claim, he was most unwilling to make any concessionsConclusions, in the immediate future. Concessions to these retired officers would minute 4.) inevitably provoke similar claims by retired civil servants, includingBritish members of the former Indian Services, and claims for increases in war pensions, industrial injuries benefits, National Insurance bene-fits and old age pensions. The Budget had given a certain measureof relief and the granting of concessions to particular classes would notbe in accordance with his general Budget policy.The Minister of Defence said that there was considerable feelingon this subject in both Houses of Parliament and, if the Governmentfailed to make the modest concessions which he proposed, they were likely to be forced ultimately into making much larger concessions.He was anxious therefore that immediate effect should be given tohis proposals, which did in fact confer benefits where they were most needed. Many officers of the middle and lower ranks had already&apos; had pension increases as a result of service in the last war. The classwhich was most severely hit was the class of officers who had been too old to give any service in the last war. The cost of his proposals was small and, as they benefited only elderly officers, it would diminish quickly.In discussion it was suggested that a distinction could be drawn between retired officers and other classes of pensioner. Men who had given long service in the Armed Forces and suffered hardship in thecourse of it had a special claim to consideration. The restoration ofthe 19.19 rates could be justified on the ground that an injustice wasbeing corrected.The Prime Minister said that, in spite of these arguments, therewas no doubt that these concessions to retired officers would, if made,provoke demands from other classes of pensioners which it would be44118 B 2
difficult to resist. He suggested therefore that no action should betaken for two or three months, during which it would be possible to judge the extent and nature of the pressure which might come fromother claimants.The Cabinet Agreed that no immediate action should be taken to improve the retired pay of officers who retired from the Armed Forcesbetween the two wars; and that their discussion of this problem should be resumed before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess.Atomic Energy 4.

(53) 132) recommendingC.C. (53) 27th the terms of an announcement about the setting up of LordConclusions, Waverley&apos;s Committee; and a memorandum by the Paymaster-Minute 4.) General (C. (53) 134) recommending an alternative form of announcement.The Minister of Supply said that he would prefer an announce-ment in the more general terms proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer. He feared that the Government would be open to criticism if they admitted that they had decided in principle to transferthis work to a non-departmental organisation before they had satisfied themselves that the transfer was feasible.The Paymaster-General said that the fact remained that theCabinet had taken this decision in principle; and the general state-ment proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would put LordWaverley&apos;s Committee in a false position and would do nothing to allay speculation and unrest among the staff. He hoped therefore thatthe Cabinet would authorise the fuller form of announcement whichhe was proposing.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared toaccept the form of announcement proposed by the Paymaster-General, so long as the direct reference to the decision in principle was omitted. The opening words of the announcement would then read: &quot; In order to secure the most rapid and economical develop-ment in the field of atomic energy, the Government have decided toset up a Committee . . . &quot;. The terms of reference themselves made it clear that the task of the Committee was to recommend the best method of transferring responsibility for atomic energy to a non-departmental organisation.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to make an announcement in theterms proposed by the Paymaster-General in C. (53) 134,subject to the omission of the statement that the Govern-ment had decided in principle that responsibility foratomic energy ought to be transferred to a form of non-departmental organisation.Atomic Energy. 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theFuture External Paymaster-General (C. (53) 129) recommending, on the basis of aPolicy. report by the Official Committee on Atomic Energy, an adjustment(Previous our external policy in atomic energy matters. .Reference: The Paymaster-General said that hitherto the keynote of ourC.C. (52) 61st policy had been co-operation with the United States on the basis of conclusions, the modus Vivendi of 1948 and joint purchasing arrangements for rawMinute 10.)     materials under the Combined Development. Agency.   In practice,
however, the restrictive attitude of the Americans had made any effective co-operation impossible. And, while we gained nothingfrom them, we were precluded from communicating to other commonwealth Governments (apart from Canada) informationderived even from our own researches. Meanwhile, South Africa and australia were becoming the principal producers of uranium ore.He therefore recommended that we should try to free ourselves fromthe restrictions of the modus vivendi and to seek close technical co-operation with Australia and arrange with them to meet our futureneeds of uranium, particularly for industrial purposes. Once we had made sure of our ground vis-a-vis the Australian Government, whoseapproaches had been rebuffed by the Labour Government in 1951,we should be in a position to adopt a rather stiffer line in ourdealings with the United States Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, before disclosing ourchanged attitude to the United States Government, we ought toinform the Canadian Government, who were closely concerned.Their discretion could be fully relied upon.There was general support in the Cabinet for the change of policy recommended by the Paymaster-General.The Prime Minister said that he was ready to communicate withMr. Menzies on the lines suggested in paragraph 10 (a) of C. (53) 129,He would also wish to consider asking President Eisenhower to agreeto the immediate publication of the Quebec Agreement of 1943,whose concealment by the previous Administration in the UnitedStates had contributed to the passing of the McMahon Act.The view was expressed that there might be advantages in notraising the question of publication of this Agreement until the time was ripe for a general approach to the United States government about our future relations in atomic energy matters.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the policy outlined in paragraph 10 (a) and (b) ofC. (53) 129.(2) Invited the Paymaster-General to prepare, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the commonwealth secretary, and the Minister of Supply, a draft of the message to be sent by the Prime Minster to the Prime.Minister of Australia as proposed in paragraph 10 (a) ofC. (53) 129.Uranium from The Cabinet also had before them a note by the Paymaster-Belgian Congo. General (C. (53) 130) covering a report by the Official Committee on atomic Energy on our future policy towards the Belgian CongoUranium Agreement.The Paymaster-General explained that the inter-GovernmentalAgreement of 1944 for the supply of Congo uranium, in which theUnited Kingdom was associated as an equal partner with the UnitedStates, and the current contract under the Agreement were due to expire in February, 1956, and it was necessary to decide whether ornot we should take part in the impending negotiations for the renewal of the Agreement. On balance he thought that it would be to our advantage to join in the negotiations, even though we might therebybecome committed to some future expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer also favoured our participation in the negotiations on the basis that it should be our aim to avoidaccepting responsibility for more than 10 per cent, of any expenditure incurred.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that the United Kingdom should take part in the impending negotiations for the renewal of the inter-Governmental Agreement on Belgian Congo uranium.
The Cabinet were informed that the United States delegation to the Council were anxious to hold a private meeting withMinisterial members of the United Kingdom delegation before the formal business of the Council began. They had suggested that thismeeting should be held in the afternoon of 22nd April. Some impor-tant divisions would, however, be taking place in the House ofCommons that afternoon, and it might be difficult for all the threeMinisterial members of the delegation who were members of theNorth Atlantic 6. The Cabinet discussed the line which United KingdomCouncil. Ministers should take on some of the questions likely to be raised atthe meeting of the North Atlantic Council which was to open inParis on 23rd April.There would be some discussion on developments in Soviet policy since the death of Stalin. It was agreed that Governments outsidethe Soviet orbit should welcome the more conciliatory attitude whichthe Soviet Government were now showing on certain internationalproblems, and should be ready to turn this situation to the advantageof the free world though it would be wise for the moment toassume that the ultimate objectives of Soviet policy had not been changed. The countries of the West should continue to build up their defensive strength and avoid unnecessary provocation. Bothin policy and in propaganda they should avoid any action that wouldgive the Soviet people the impression that, whatever conciliatorygestures their leaders might make, the Western world would remainimplacably hostile to them. Western firmness over a prolonged period might alter Soviet policy more radically by making it moredifficult for the Soviet Government to revert to aggressive tacticalmethods. It followed that the defence effort of the North AtlanticPowers should be maintained; that we should uphold the atlantic alliance and go forward with plans for European unity, notably thefull association of Western Germany with the Western Powers; andthat we should take advantage of the conciliatory mood of the soviet authorities in order to secure agreements on specific outstanding questions.It would, however, be unwise for the North Atlantic Council to announce at this stage any marked change in defence policy.Although the North Atlantic Powers might in fact accept someslowing down of re-armament programmes, it would be inexpedient to give publicity to this at the present time.As regards the European Defence Community, every effort should be made to secure firm undertakings, particularly from france, that the Treaty would be ratified during the summer. Anattempt should also be made to re-assure the Norwegians and the danes about the arrangements for the defence of Scandinavia.The Council should be urged to approve firm figures for the levels to which North Atlantic forces should be raised by the end of1953, and provisional figures for the end of .1954. They should alsobe asked to approve the general lines on which the next annual review should be conducted. We should take the opportunity of ascertaining whether the United States authorities would now beprepared to agree that a new approach should be made to the problemof assessing North Atlantic force requirements. It was possible that united States Ministers might themselves suggest that the defence programmes of the North Atlantic Powers should in future be basedon the assumption that international tension would continue for along period; and that the United States Government must them-selves reduce on this account their annual expenditure on defence.They might say that this reduction in their defence expenditure wouldtake the form of discontinuing or reducing defence aid to european countries. If so, they must be told firmly that any substantial reduction of their defence aid to this country must involve majoradjustments in our defence programme, and that we should need timeto assess the effects of such a reduction.
House of Commons to go to Paris before 23rd April. It might benecessary that the Minister of Supply should delay his departureuntil 23rd April, and that the American Ministers should be asked to defer until then any detailed discussion of supply questions affectingthe United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note of the line which the United Kingdom ministers would take on the subjects likely to be discussed at tiieforthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council.The Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 26thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof State (C. (53) 131) and the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment (C. (53) 135) on proposals for expenditure designed to upholdthe British case and to maintain British prestige in the Sudan.The Ministet of State said that the Electoral Commission mightpostpone the elections in the Sudan until the autumn. The egyptians would make full use of the intervening period to undermine British influence in the Sudan. He therefore sought authority for certain additional expenditure for the United Kingdom information office in Khartoum, for giving financial assistance to the Sudanese radiostation (Radio Omdurman) should this prove necessary, for re-open-ing the British Council office in Khartoum and for certain other expenditure with the same general object.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would be ready toagree to expenditure for these purposes at least on the scale contem-plated by the Minister of State, but it seemed to him important toavoid the necessity of a supplementary estimate, particularly for theBritish Council.The Prime Minister said that we had not yet finally abandoned the attempt to secure early elections in the Sudan. The Minister ofState should discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and there-after with him the exact nature of the publicity and other measuresto be taken if that attempt should finally fail, and the means ofdefraying their cost.The Cabinet Took note that the Minister of State would discuss with, theChancellor of the Exchequer and thereafter with the PrimeMinister the nature and financing of the measures to betaken to counteract Egyptian propaganda during the period before the holding of the Sudanese elections.Northern 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeIreland. Secretary (C. (53) 133) urging the case for helping the NorthernRelief of        Ireland Government in their efforts to reduce unemployment.Unemployment.       Tne fjome Secretary said that the Northern Ireland Government,.(Previous       which would have to face a general election soon after the reference:      Coronation, hoped to reduce unemployment, the rate of which inC.C. (52) 66th   Northern Ireland was five times as high as it was in Great Britain, by conclusions,    encouraging industrial enterprise.  They therefore wished to includeMinute 40      in their Budget, which was due on 5th May, a subsidy on industrialcoal designed to reduce the disadvantages from which theTndUstria-list in Northern Ireland suffered as compared with, his competitorsin Great Britain.  It was within the power of the Northern ireland government to introduce such a subsidy, but they proposed that itscost should fall ultimately on the Imperial Exchequer through areduction in the Imperial contribution, and they had therefore sought
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st April, 1953.our agreement. A working party of officials of the two Govern-ments had rejected the idea of such a subsidy on economic grounds,and there was little doubt that its introduction in Northern ireland would have awkward repercussions in Great Britain. It was difficultto see, however, by what other means the Northern Ireland Govern-ment could be given the help which they needed.The Chancel/or of the Exchequer suggested that the leastunsatisfactory way of relieving the serious situation in NorthernIreland might be to remit or to reimburse employers&apos; national insurance contributions. This would reduce labour costs, whose risewas largely responsible for the increase in unemployment. The costof such a scheme might amount to as much a  5 millions.The Minister of National Insurance said that remission ofemployers&apos; National Insurance contribution in Northern ireland would be bound to encourage the view, already held in some quarters in this country, that National Insurance should become an Exchequerliability and that the contributory principle should be abandoned.It would be dangerous from this point of view even to reimburseemployers&apos; contributions. It would be wiser to relate any subsidy to employers, not directly to National Insurance contributions, butto employers&apos; total wages costs or to numbers employed. TheParliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, supported this view.The Cabinet did not favour any scheme on these lines. they agreed that any subsidy to employers which carried no assurance that the money would, in fact, be used for the purpose for which itwas intended would be open to serious criticism and might haveembarrassing repercussions.In further discussion the view was expressed, on the one hand,that taxpayers in Great Britain would be critical of any arrangement which might appear to involve a permanent subsidy in aid of anunsound economic position in Northern Ireland. The properapproach to the problem was rather to take such practical measures as the placing of suitable Government orders, which might stimulateNorthern Ireland industries to engage more labour, or encouraging the linen industry by purchase tax adjustments, or providing employ-ment for ships&apos; fitters by arranging for the re-fitting of liners inNorthern Irish yards.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the working party&apos;sreport, from which the proposals alike for a coal subsidy and forremission of employers&apos; National Insurance contributions had beentaken, was an exhaustive document in which all other remedies hadbeen fully considered. Many practical measures to help NorthernIreland had already been taken, and the scope for further action ofthis kind was strictly limited. For example, the slips in NorthernIrish shipyards were fully committed to tanker building and in otherindustries in Northern Ireland there was little unused capacity whichcould absorb additional Government orders. The object of any fresh measures should be to provide some inducement to industrialiststo develop industry in Northern Ireland in spite of the handicaps of operating there.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their consideration of this matter at their next meeting.
