Armed Forces.Officers&apos;Retired Pay.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)Food Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 8thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food (C. (53) 174) pro-posing certain increases in the prices of butter, margarine and cookingfat, including lard.The Minister of Food said that the object of the proposed increases was to keep the food subsidies within the limit of  220millions announced in the Budget. If they had been introduced inJuly they would have brought the subsidies down to  215 millions,but if they had to be deferred until September  3 millions of thissaving would be lost. The effect on the cost-of-living index was calculated to be about -44 of a point. There might, however, be anincrease in the price of milk at about the same time and the priceof sugar was likely to rise by about \d. a pound when the subsidywas withdrawn. The total effect of all these changes might be a rise of one point in the cost-of-living index in October.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) .184) recommending that theproblem of a revision of officers&apos; retired pay should be remitted forfurther investigation by all the Departments concerned and that no decision should be taken until the autumn.The Minister of Defence said that he had understood that theCabinet had intended to reach a decision at their present meeting.A further deferment would mean that the Government would soon be faced with much larger demands and that their prestige and goodname would suffer in the meantime. He believed that it could be argued that the restoration of the 9  per cent, cut, which had been imposed in 1935, was in no way a departure from the principle ofcontractual pensions, since it would simply restore the terms of a contract made in 1919. The cut could be restored without legislation.In discussion it was agreed that there was a good case in equityfor restoring this cut, and that refusal to do so would damage the government&apos;s credit and might lead to a defeat in the House of Lords.On the other hand it was recognised that the restoration of thiscut would provoke pressure for further pension increases, notably forretired civil servants and police widows, more particularly as the government&apos;s case for declining to restore the cut had hitherto been based on the argument that this would open the way to other demands.In the next few months there would be critical negotiations on wagesclaims, and the tribunals and employers who had to handle these would be influenced by the Governmenfs attitude towards thesepensions claims. Any large increase in wages would seriously endanger the success of our export trade.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would re-examinethe problem in the light of the opinions expressed and bring, proposals before the Cabinet before the summer recess. He would, in particular,consider what was the narrowest range within which correspondingconcessions to other pensioners could be confined, and whether a distinction could properly be drawn between those concessions whichcould be made by admimstrative action and those for which legislation would be required. He would also consider what public statement could be made on this subject before the summer recess, even thoughaction was postponed until the autumn.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no improvement of officers&apos; retired pay should bemade before the autumn.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to submit to thema further memorandum, on the lines which he had indicated in the discussion, in time for a public statement to be made on this question before the summer recess.
Regency Bill.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 34thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 183) covering:  (a) a draft Bill to amend the Regency Acts;(b) a draft Message from The Queen;(c) draft Motions for Addresses from each House in reply to the message.The Home Secretary said that Clauses .1 and 3 of the draft bill attached to C. (53) 183 were designed to give effect to The Queen&apos;swish that the Duke of Edinburgh should be Regent in the event ofher death or incapacity before the Duke of Cornwall became eighteenand that the Queen Mother should be added to the list of personswho could act as Counsellors of State. The change in the Regencyarrangements which would be brought about by Clause 2 of the bill had not formed part of The Queen&apos;s expressed wishes. That clausewould have the effect that, in the event of The Queen&apos;s incapacity,the heir apparent or heir presumptive to the throne would succeedthe Duke of Edinburgh as Regent when he or she reached the age of eighteen, instead of twenty-one as provided by the Regency Act,1937. It seemed to him that in this matter also The Queen&apos;s wishshould be ascertained and met.The Cabinet expressed agreement with this view.The Lord President said that, in so far as the case for continuing to defer the assumption of the Regency until the age of twenty-one was based on the desirability of allowing time for the completion ofeducation, deferment was no less important in the case of the heirapparent or heir presumptive than in the case of other children ofthe Sovereign.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it would be necessary to notify other Commonwealth Governments of the decision eventuallyreached on this point, but it was not one on which these governments were likely to hold strong views.The following further points were made in the discussion:  (a) The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that the possibilitymight be considered of referring to the heir apparent in the Bill asDuke of Cornwall and Rothesay.(b) The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government should aim topass the Bill through both Houses before the summer recess. the detailed timing might be left to the Home Secretary, the lord president and himself.(c) The Commonwealth Secretary said that all the other Com-commonwealth Governments concerned had expressed agreement withthe proposed amendments of the Regency Acts and had indicated that they would not themselves legislate in advance of the event.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the criticalnegotiations on wages claims which were now in progress, he had agreed that these increases in food prices should be deferred until september. The Cabinet need not therefore take final decisions that day. The Minister of Food should bring the matter up again beforethe end of July, and should then report when the increases wouldhave to be notified to the trades concerned if they were to be broughtinto effect in the September rationing period.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Food to make a further report tothe Cabinet on these proposed increases in food pricestowards the end of July.
X% 7TelevisionDevelopment.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 36thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Postmaster-General and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 182 and 185)on the proposed statement of Government policy on television development.The Postmaster-General said that the primary aim of the draft statement annexed to C. (53) 182 was to ensure that, when the time came to take final decisions about the introduction of competitivetelevision, the Governments hands would be as free as was possiblehaving regard to the terms of the 1952 White Paper. The statementexplained how the B.B.C. would in any event remain intact and towhat safeguards any competitive television would be subject. Par-liament and the public would thereby be helped to form a soundjudgment on the question.In discussion it was suggested that the third paragraph of thedraft erred on the side of implying that the Government were retreat-ing from their earlier declaration of principle in favour of competitivetelevision. Should it not rather suggest that the crucial issue, onwhich Parliament and the country would be required to exercisejudgment in due course, was what safeguards could and should beapplied to competitive television? This would be in keeping with paragraph 8 of the White Paper. On the other side it was argued thatthe statement should not imply that Ministers were irrevocablywedded to their earlier decision, as this would be likely to intensifythe agitation against competitive television.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the statement muststrike the right balance between these two views. Only so could theGovernment ensure that their supporters in the House of commons would rally behind them if the Opposition forced the issue to a division before the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the last sentence of the third paragraph of thedraft statement attached to C. (53) 182 should be amended to read: &quot; The Government are pledged to submit for theapproval of Parliament the terms and conditions of anylicences which might be issued. The White Paper willenable the House and the country to exercise a properjudgment in this essential matter before any final decision is taken.&quot;The following points were also made in further discussion:  (a) The Postmaster-General wondered whether the Governmentwould be wise to include in the statement some reference to the possi-bility of introducing competitive television which was not dependentHe would need 48 hours&apos; notice of the date of delivery of the RoyalMessage in order that arrangements might be made for simultaneousannouncements in all Commonwealth capitals.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary:  (1) To take Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure-(i) on the detailed provisions of the Bill and, inparticular, on Clause 2; and(ii) on the terms of the Royal Message.(2) To settle, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and the Common-wealth Secretary, the detailed arrangements for the delivery of the Royal Message and the presentation of the Bill.
Parliament. 5.   Mr. S. Silverman, M.P., had given notice that he intended that day to seek leave to introduce, under the ten-minute rule, a Billto suspend the death penalty for five years. He had secured support for his Bill from some members of all Parties.on sponsored programmes. This possibility had been discussed inthe minority report of the Beveridge Committee.The Paymaster-General supported this suggestion.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this possibility wasnot ruled out by the terms of the draft statement, but that it wouldbe a mistake to make specific reference to it. It was by no meansclear whether it would be practicable to introduce competitive tele-vision except on a commercial basis and specific reference to thepossibility at this stage might create an impression that this was thesolution to the problem at which the Government were aiming.(b) The Cabinet were informed that a pamphlet setting out thecase for sponsored television had been prepared by the ConservativeCentral Office, but that its publication had been deferred pending adecision by the Government upon their future course of action.The view was expressed that, unless some publication in favourof sponsored television were issued, Government supporters wouldbe antagonised and a valuable means of informing public opinion would be lost. On the other hand, it was suggested that publicationof such a document would be inconsistent with the government&apos;s intention to create an atmosphere in which the public could exercisean objective judgment on the basis of the facts and that an ex panestatement would be particularly unfortunate.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that the Central office should refrain from publicity on this subject at any rate until the effectof the proposed Government statement could be assessed. It wouldbe for consideration at that stage whether or not it would be advan-tageous to publish an objective statement of the arguments for and against competitive television.(c) The President of the Board of Trade urged the omission fromthe draft statement of the reference to the possibility that licences issued to operators of television stations might specify &quot; the pro-portion, if any, of imported programme material to be permitted.&quot; Inhis view this suggestion, in its present form, would give rise to muchuncertainty and harmful speculation and it was far from clear thatit could, in fact, be put into effect.It was agreed that these words should be omitted from thestatement.(d) There was general agreement that the proposed statement should be published as soon as possible in order to forestall furtherpublic expressions of view based on incomplete knowledge of thefacts.In the course of the discussion agreement was reached upon anumber of further amendments to the draft statement attached toC. (53) 182.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal, tosettle the final form of the proposed statement in the lightof the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Agreed that the statement should be made on 2nd July, in theHouse of Lords by the Postmaster-General, and in theHouse of Commons by the Lord Privy Seal.
The Cabinet were informed that it would be contrary to prece-dent for a Government spokesman to intervene in a debate under theten-minute rule. A Government supporter would, however, bespeaking against the application; and there was reason to hope that,on a division, Mr. Silverman would fail to obtain leave to introducehis Bill.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Persian Gulf.TrucialSheikhdoms.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 37thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Minister of State said that our troops had now succeeded in dislodging, without the use of air power, the Saudi levies whichhad established themselves across our supply lines to Buraimi. Inthese circumstances it would be unnecessary to proceed further withthe action which the Cabinet had approved at their meeting on29th June.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Opening of 7.   The Lord President said that the Lord Great ChamberlainParliament. had asked for an indication of the Governmenfs view on a suggestion,Facilities for made to him by a Government supporter in the House of Commons,Television.      that facilities should be given for televising the Opening of Parliament.In a preliminary discussion there was little support for thissuggestion. It was argued that, as The Queen&apos;s Speech at the Open-ing of Parliament was a political statement, the occasion was not onewhich could suitably be broadcast or televised. Moreover, the pro-vision of facilities for televising the Opening of Parliament mightrevive pressure for the broadcasting or televising of the ordinaryproceedings of Parliament. Facilities were, however, given for press and newsreel photographs to be taken of the procession to the Houseof Lords; and it was for consideration whether this part of theproceedings might not also be televised in future.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to arrange for a memorandum to be submitted to the Cabinet setting out more fully the considerations which they should take into account in deciding whether facilities should be given for televising theOpening of Parliament.Civil Service. 8.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view theAppointment of time was ripe for the appointment of a Royal Commission to review-Royal the pay and conditions of all grades in the Civil Service.   It was nowCommission.    over twenty years since such a general review had been made; and theTreasury would be better able to handle particular applications forpay increases if they were able to relate these to up-to-date findingsby an independent and authoritative enquiry.The Cabinet Agreed in principle that there should be an enquiry by a royal Commission into the pay and conditions of serviceof all grades in the Civil Service; and took note that theChancellor of the Exchequer would consult with his cabinet colleagues regarding the choice of the Chairman of this commission.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st July, 1953.
