Parliament1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Flood Damage.FinancialAssistance.^previous reference:C.C. (53) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Home Secretary said that the Lord Mayor had shown some anxiety about the extent of the claims which might be madeon his Fund for compensation in respect of flood damage to businessproperty. He had recently discussed this with the Lord Mayor andhe was satisfied that there was no cause for alarm. The Minister ofAgriculture was proposing to recommend that the Exchequer should accept liability for compensation for damage to fences and crops inthe ground. There would be no justification for paying compensation to large industrial undertakings who had decided, as a matter ofpolicy, not to insure against the risk of flood damage to their premisesor stock. For the rest he believed that the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund which, with the Government contribution, was likely to reach 6 millions would be sufficient to meet all the claims which could properly be made on it.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.Coal Prices. 3. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that Mr. Robson-(Previous Brown, M.P., had given notice of a Question, for written answer that reference: day, asking that the proposed increases in coal prices should beC.C.

And a number of Government sup-Conclusions, porters in the House of Commons had tabled a Motion deprecatingMinute 5.) the price increases and calling for an enquiry into the structure and administration of the National Coal Board.The Minister said that the increased prices had already been introduced, with the authority of the Cabinet, and were now in opera-tion: there could be no question of withdrawing them. -Thesuggestion of an enquiry would not be well received by the miners and,if it met with any encouragement, was likely to hamper the jointefforts which were now being made by the Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers to secure increased production. he therefore recommended that the Government, should show no hesitation-tion in rejecting this suggestion and he would like to make that clear in his reply to Mr. Robson-Brown&apos;s Question. He circulated to theCabinet a draft of the reply which he proposed to give.The Cabinet were informed that, although a number of Govern-ment supporters had put their names to this Motion, other government supporters in the House of Commons had serious doubts about the expediency of holding such an enquiry at the present time.Opinion was divided, and it was arguable that the Government should lose no time in giving a lead against an enquiry. It seemed preferable to give a firm answer to Mr. Robson-Brown&apos;s Question than be pressed to find time for discussion of the Motion.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power, in reply to aQuestion by Mr. Robson-BroWn, M.P., to state briefly thegrounds for the recent increase in coal prices and, as regardsthe proposal for an enquiry, to say that this would serve no43914-3 B 2
the coronation.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 95thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Works (C. (53) 89) seeking approval of certain features of hisDepartments preparations for the Coronation, and a memorandumby the Financial Secretary, Treasury (C. (53) 90), submitting the latest estimates of total Government expenditure on the Coronation,In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Works said that, instead of providingluncheon for Members of both Houses of Parliament at public expense, it was proposed to accept as a charge on public fundsexpenditure of some  1,100 on additional lavatory accommodation in the Palace of Westminster and on the erection of an awning overthe terrace where Members of the House of Commons and theirguests would be accommodated. This arrangement would spreadover all Members, whether they were in the Abbey or not, a subsidy of less per head than would be spent on catering for other Abbeyguests. For Members of the House of Commons the proposed subsidy would not do more than reduce the cost of the luncheon from42s. to 36s.The Cabinet agreed that this expenditure from public funds would be justified.(b) The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that the largestincrease in Departmental expenditure revealed by the estimatesannexed to his memorandum concerned the War Office. this increase, from  290,000 to  412,000, was still under detailed Treasuryexamination, but was understood to be due to overtime payments to civilians at Ordnance depots, to victualling and to costs of travel.The Prime Minister said that this estimate should be subjected to rigorous examination. He suggested that the Minister of defence should look into it on the Cabinefs behalf.The Cabinet (1) Subject to Conclusion (6) below, took note of the revised estimates of Ministry of Works expenditure (Appendix IIIto C. , (53) 89) and of total Government expenditure(Annex to C. (53) 90) on Coronation preparations.(2) Agreed that a single Government reception for 2,000 guestsshould be held at the National Gallery on 30th May.(3) Approved the proposals in C. (53) 89 for catering for allguests in the Abbey at public expense and for incurringspecified expenditure in respect of the luncheon to beprovided for Members of both Houses of Parliament.(4) Invited the Minister of Works to support applications for licences to sell beer in the Royal Parks and in buffetsattached to stands along the route between the hours of12 noon and 5 p.m.(5) Agreed that the Minister of Works should meet the cost ofproviding accommodation and services for caterers in thebuffets attached to stands along the route.(6) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for War and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, whether any reduction could be madein the estimated expenditure by the War Office onCoronation celebrations.useful purpose at the present time and would hinder thejoint efforts now being made by the Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers to secure that increased production on which the future of the coal-mining industrydepended.
Korea. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minister(Previous of State (C. 53) 95) about an invitation from the United states reference: Government to Governments with forces in Korea under the UnitedC.C. (52) 100th Nations Command to nominate officers to serve on General MilitaryConclusions, Commissions for the trial of prisoners of war for crimes of violenceMinute 10.)      committed since capture.Trial of The Minister of State said that from one point of view thisPrisoners of invitation was embarrassing, as nomination of officers to serve on war. such Commissions might be represented as involving a departure fromthe principles of the Geneva Convention, 1949, which placed theresponsibility for the treatment of prisoners of war on a singleDetaining Power. On the other hand, the United States Governmentwere particularly anxious to have Allied participation in these trialsand the Secretary of State had pressed this request upon the foreign secretary personally.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he and the Secretaryof State for War thought it important that the United KingdomGovernment should adhere strictly to the provisions of the GenevaConventions, from which we had gained distinct advantages in thelate war.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that these Conventionswere not strictly applicable to the operations in Korea, which hadnot been formally recognised as constituting a state of war. More-over, it seemed unlikely that our enemies in a future war would payregard to the Conventions except in so far as observance of theirprovisions might be advantageous to them.The general feeling of the Cabinet was that any hypotheticaldisadvantages of acceding to the United States invitation were out-weighed by the importance of avoiding the impression that Common-wealth Governments were reluctant to bear their due share of thecommon responsibility for the operations of the United Nationsforcesin Korea.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, although the canadian government had felt some doubt about the American proposal whenit had first been made, they had since indicated that they regarded it as important that Commonwealth countries should adopt a com-mon attitude in this matter and that they should not find that theywere alone among the Allies in declining to accept this invitation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should accept theUnited States Governments invitation to nominate anofficer to serve on the General Military Commissions tobe established for the trial of prisoners of war for crimesof violence since capture in Korea.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to notify this decisionto those Commonwealth Governments with forces in korea and to suggest that they should take similar action.Privileges ofInternationalOrganisations.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 75thConclusions,Minute 6.)EuropeanNuclearResearchOrganisation.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (C. (53) 87).The Minister of State said that the purpose of his memorandum was to give the Cabinet early warning of the possibility that at a later date Her Majesty&apos;s Government might be faced with a request thatcertain privileges and immunities should be accorded to persons inthe service of the proposed European Organisation for NuclearResearch. It was proposed to suggest that the Convention estab-lishing the Organisation should include a clause under which the privileges and immunities to be accorded should be such as mightbe agreed between the Council of the Organisation and the member state concerned to be &quot; necessary for the exercise of the functionsof the organisation.&quot;
The Attorney-General said that our future freedom of action would be more fully protected if, in the clause suggested, the words&quot; if any&quot; were added after the words &quot; such privileges and immunities.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the draft of the relevant clause for inclusion inthe Convention establishing the Organisation. should be amended on the lines proposed by the Attorney-General.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, took note of C. (53) 87.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th March, 1953.
