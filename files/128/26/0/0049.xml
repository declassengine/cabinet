Egypt.      -&apos;\(Previous ;Reference:C.C.(53)48thConclusions, &apos;Minute 3.)2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by president (C. (53) 232) outlining the further instructions which he was &apos;&apos;proposing to send to. the United Kingdom Delegation in Cairo.The Lord President said that there were three outstanding points in. the defence negotiations on which the Delegation thought They ,would be obliged to make some concessions if any agreement wasto be reached with the Egyptians. It had become&apos; clear.. that the egyptians would not accept an agreement for an initial period of fiveyears continuing thereafter until, a satisfactory regional defence organisation had come into being; and that they.would only considera fixed period beyond three years if we were; prepared to reducebelow 4,000 the number of British technicians to be left in the base.&apos;;The Delegation believed that a ten-year agreement might be securedif we were to agree to run down the numbers of technicians on thefollowing lines:  .. ;(i) 4,000 to stay, for three years after the withdrawal ofcombatant troops (i.e., for A\ ye^rs after the date of theagreement);(ii) the numbers to be.reduced to 3,000 over the following two. :   years; ; &apos; &apos; .&apos; &apos;    .        &apos;(iii) the parties to consult then on the numbers to stay for theremaining 3\ years failing agreement, the technicianswould be withdrawn, but we should retain the right to.&apos;   inspect our stores and installations.In. other respects the Delegation would adhere to Case A, particularly as regards control of our own technicians, their right to wear uniform and to carry personal weapons, the control .of our property in the..base and the retention of staging rights!to which the Air Staff attached importance as a link with the Far East.&apos;; It was already agreed that ajoint Anglo-Egyptian Air Defence Organisation should no longer beincluded in Case A. &apos;.. &quot;* .&apos;
On the question of access to the base, the Lord President said,-that the Egyptians had held out strongly against allowing this either in the event of a major war or of an attack ohPersia or Turkey.It was difficult to / find any satisfactory definition of a major, warand it might be preferable to rely on some alternative formula refer-ring to action by the United Nations. He therefore proposed thatthe Delegation should put the following formula to the Egyptians:  &quot; In the event of United Nations action to resist an act of-aggression, or in the event of an attack on any Arab country..   by an outside Power, the base area shall be at the full disposalof the United Kingdom.. An attack on Turkey shall be regardedas an attack on an Arab country for the purposes of this Agree-. ment.  In the event of. an attack on Persia, or in the event of a threat of an attack on any of the above-mentioned countries,. there shall, be immediate consultation between the United.  Kingdom and Egypt.&quot; &apos;     .The.period for the withdrawal of British troops was estimated by the.Chiefs of Staff at eighteen months from the date of the-agree-ment and the Delegation expected that there might be some difficulty .with the-Egyptians over this. At present, however, it was not a pointin the negotiations; it would be a practical matter for discussionwhen&apos;the negotiations were &quot;completed. Equally, the American&apos;interest in the base at Abu Sueir. was a separate question/ /,.In discussion the following-points were made:   -   ,-&apos;.. (a) The new proposal for the duration of the agreement hadthe grave disadvantage that it provided no guarantee that&quot; any Britishtechnicians would-be left in the base after 6\ years, and-thereafter the base would not be of substantial use to British forces deployed .elsewhere in the Middle East. Could we not arrive at some agree-ment by which the progressive &quot;reduction of British technicians was somewhat slower and made dependent on an efficient system of train-ing Egyptians in substitution? It might,; for example, be possibleto persuade the Egyptians to agree that, in the last, 3-  years of aten-year agreement, one or two thousand British technicians shouldbe allowed to remain. . The Lord President agreed to consider thisproposal..&apos; (b) The right of inspection after the withdrawal of Britishtechnicians might well be used with advantage; but the fact remainedthat, as there was no prospect of a long agreement, efforts would haveto be made during the period of the agreement to remove valuable-stores and movable installations from the base. .... &apos; . x(c) The duration of the agreement would have, an effect upon-plans for the redeployment of British forces elsewhere in the middle east. Was it worth incurring the expense of this redeployment if therewas no guarantee that the base in Egypt would be available for themaintenance of these forces after 6\ years?. (d) It was only at Abu Sueir, which had been developed for the americans, -that American technicians could be- militarily useful.The Secretary of State for Air said that he would send the lord president a note on the position at Abu Sueir and on any other points which particularly affected the Royal Air Force.The Prime Minister said that it was the view.of the Cabinet thatthe United Kingdom Delegation in Cairo should have discretion tonegotiate on the terms proposed by the Lord President in C. (53) 232.They should, however,&apos;-be reminded - that we still hoped that firmdealing would result in a better agreement than that now proposed.. The Cabinet-      1  *       * ,\ : . &apos;&quot; Authorised the Lord President to instruct the UnitedKingdom Delegation in. Cairo on the lines proposed inC. (53) 232; but took note that he would first reconsider theproposals for reducing the numbers of British technicians inthe light of the. suggestions noted in paragraph (a) above.

The Colonial Secretary said that the situation in Kenya Had.       -Reinforcements, not improved as rapidly as had been hoped;,and General&quot; Erskine, -(Previous.&apos;.;.     Commander-iri-Chief,&apos; East Africa -Command, &quot;had &quot;asked for an reference: .    additional infantry brigade of three battalions, in order, to bring the 1C.C.(S3)33fd . situation more rapidly under control.;.&apos;,    .        ....&apos;.&quot;&quot;&apos;   v   .   y /Minute l.)&apos;-&apos;&apos; The Secretary of State for War said that the Chiefs of Staff con-     , ..&apos;        &apos;.       sidered that these reinforcements should not be found from the&apos; Canal  - .&apos;. &apos; &apos; &apos;   Zone,-since the. withdrawal of any forces from there at the present.&quot;:;   ;&apos;-\ ; time might be taken by the Egyptians as. a sign of weakness and might &apos;&quot;    have an unfortunate effect on the defence negotiations in Cairo. They &apos;   - ,. /-    &apos; --- . could, &quot;however, send a brigade headquarters and two- infantry  &quot;&apos;./- ; battalions from the United Kingdom, and could complete-the move&apos;- - &apos;.        -/by the middle of September. - .   ,&apos;   -. &quot;    &apos;;&apos;.,.  ; In discussion it was argued that the additional brigade head-     &apos;,. . quarters need not besent-and thatthe two additional battalions could.. effectively&quot; operate&apos; .under: the control - of the, existing brigade head- -.-\        quarters or directly under General Erskine&apos;s&apos;controh  It was con-tended in reply that control had to be exercised over wide areas and&apos;. ... that, in the conditions obtaining in. Kenya, it was-not practicable \ &apos;..&apos;   &apos;,:-&apos;; &apos; to control five or six battalions from a single brigade headquarters.:v-;&apos;.&apos;Y&quot;.- ---/The additional signals .facilities,of, a second brigade, headquarters. . would also be of great value. -.  ./ :.&apos;-&apos;/&apos;.   &apos;&apos;- -      &apos;-&apos;,&apos;,; &apos;-&apos; ,&apos;.&apos;-&apos;   &apos;,The Cabinet-,&apos;- &apos;.\!    &apos;&apos; , % - . &quot; -   * - &apos; &apos;, &quot;       &apos;-, - &apos; . . ... &apos; -&quot; --    - ..,&apos;-&apos;- &apos; (1).

Nigeria.(previous reference:C,C, (53) 34thConclusions,Minute 6.);&apos;-. &apos;5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the &quot;colonial secretary (C. (53) 235) on the course of the proceedings at the Con-ference on constitutional reform in Nigeria.The Colonial Secretary-said the Conference had reached a dead-lock over, the future government of Lagos.- The representatives ofthe Eastern, and Northern Regions of Nigeria were -unwilling thatLagos should be under the control of the Western Region, and desiredit to be separately administered as the Federal capital; There was no prospect of securing an agreed decision on this point, but he had succeeded in persuading the representatives of all three Regions thata decision would have to be taken on their behalf by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment. They had indicated, moreover, that they would acceptthe decision taken by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on this point. Inthese circumstances he recommended a somewhat more liberalsolution than that which he had originally put forward in his memo-randum. He now proposed that he, should inform the conference that Her Majesty&apos;s Government had decided that Lagos should bea Federal area administered by the Federal Government.&quot;V&apos;; The Cabinet-: &apos;&apos; * - . - -&apos;    -. --  &apos; -Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce to the Con-ference on the Nigerian Constitution that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had decided. that.

(53) 46thConclusions,Minute 9.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 231) explaining the nature of the forthcomingreview of Parliamentary constituencies to be made by the boundary commissions appointed under the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949. &apos; . -, In discussion the point was made that, when the results of this review came before Parliament, the Government might be asked tostate their intentions about the restoration of the University franchise.The Home Secretary said that he was preparing.a paper on that subject and would.circulate it to the Cabinet before the end of the recess.  .1 \ -    , &apos;   ,\The Cabinet-   - / &apos;&apos; Took note of the Home Secretary?s memorandum C.(53) 231.France.   V 7.   The Lord President said that it had been reported in theFinancial Press that the Electrical Trades Union,had decided to send a con-Assistance ^ tribution of  1,Q00 towards the funds of. Trade, Unionists now on for French&apos; strike in France. No formal application had yet been made for leaveTrade Unions, to transfer this money to-France, but application might be made and. other unions might follow suit. He proposed that&apos;any such applica-tions, if made, should be refused so long as the French strikes con--&apos; -: tinued. After the strikes were over, we could revert to our normal practice of allowing Trade Unions in this country to send financial, contributions to non-Communist unions in France. The principle of, &apos;    . - . m   suspending such contributions during, the period of a strike had been followed in 1948, when the Labour Government was in office; and&apos; this precedent could, if necessary, be quoted in support of the policy\ which he now commended to the Cabinet- *. -    .- &apos;:   -     The Cabinet- &apos; .       &apos;\     \&apos;Agreed that so long as the strikes in France continued no.   :   &apos;    facilities should be given for the transfer of funds from this- country to Trade Unions in France. -.    ;
.... 97    . - &quot; ; &quot; C.G. 49 (53) .8,   The Cabinet had before, them a note by the Lord President(subsequently circulated as C. (53) 236) covering:    -(i): a United States draft of a reply to the Soviet note of 4thV*v:--! August regarding the suggestion for a Four-Power Meet-: &quot;   ing of Foreign Ministers to discuss the future of Germany.&apos; : &quot; &apos;.-   and Austria;    .(ii) a telegram from Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Moscow,.    commenting on a; further Soviet note of 15th Augustmaking new proposals regarding the future of Germany;;    and        - .   . - -&apos; v&apos; (hi) a Foreign Office draft of a reply to the Soviet Governmentwhich took into account the proposals made in this laterSoviet note.The Lord President said that the second Soviet note was plainlydesigned to influence the forthcoming elections in Germany, and itmight now be&apos; necessary that the Western Powers should reply tothe first note before the elections. 1 He awaited Dr. Adenauer&apos;s final&apos;views on that point. he still considered, however, that the aim of the reply should be to secure the holding of a Four-Power Meeting, andhe thought that the American draft was. unduly controversial bothin tone.and in content. From that point of view it was fortunate thatthe American draft had been prepared before the second Soviet notehad been received; and he hoped that the Foreign Office draft,&apos; which took account of that second note, might be adopted as the basis forthe drafting work which was now to be undertaken in Paris by officials of the three Governments. He proposed two , small changes inparagraphs 2 and 3&apos; of the draft, viz. (i) that the Opening words ofparagraph 2 should be amended to read.: &quot; In their note of August&apos;4the Soviet Government made the suggestion that . . . .&quot;; and(ii) that the second, sentence of paragraph 2 should be transferred tothe end of paragraph 3. Subject to these changes he commended^ the-draft for approval by the Cabinet. &apos;In discussion it was agreed that the Foreign Office draft was greatly to, be preferred to the American and that every effort should-be made to secure that it should be adopted as-a basis for the draftingdiscussions which were about, to be held in Paris.The Prime Minister said that he was apprehensive about thestatement in paragraph 4 of the draft that &quot;a peace treaty can onlybe negotiated with a free all-German Government&apos;. . *. . enjoyingfreedom of action in internal&apos;and external affairs.&quot; If a unifiedGermany were allowed to achieve this degree of freedom before theconclusion of a peace treaty she would have nothing further to gain from such a treaty except&apos;the rectification of frontiers. Was thisconsistent-with her unconditional surrender in 1945? Germany was still, after all,. a defeated, divided and occupied country. . Would it not be wiser to omit the words which referred to &quot; freedom of action,in internal and external affairs &quot;?The Lord President said that a substantial measure of indepen-dence had already been given to Western Germany, which was nolonger treated as an occupied country; and we should.not wish togive the impression that we subscribed to the Soviet thesis -that, the&quot;Germans were still subject to-dictation by the Powers to which theyhad surrendered in 1945. He was under the impression that.the phrase &quot; enjoying freedom of action iminternal and external affairs &quot;had been used in earlier statements about. Germany&apos;s future; and,if this were so, great suspicion would be caused if we now used a comparable phrase from which those words were, omitted.In further discussion reference Was (made to a ^statement in anote addressed to the Soviet Government on 25th March, .1952, that&quot;the all-German Government ,should be free both before and afterthe conclusion of a peace treaty to enter into associations compatible with.the principles and purposes of the United Nations.&apos;&apos;   It..was
Ceylon,  : 9.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had been someIndustrial serious rioting in Colombo following a general strike organised byDisturbances, the local Communist parties. -The Ceylon Government feared&apos;that&apos; - there might be further outbreaks of violence, and they had asked our high Commissioner in Colombo whether, if the situation deterioratedand a formal.request for assistance were made, naval landing parties-from Her Majesty&apos;s ships now at Trincomalee could be made avail-,able to operate in aid of the civil power.Opinion in the Cabinet was divided on the response which shouldbe made to any such request.   Some Ministers thought it of special- importance that nothing should be done to blur the responsibility ofthe Ceylon Government for maintaining law and order. &quot;Othersthought that prompt assistance rendered by United Kingdom forces,at the request of the Ceylon Government, would serve to demonstrate- the readiness of members of the Commonwealth to help one another in times of difficulty. The.Cabinet were reminded that United King-dom troops had on two occasions operated in aid of the civil power in Newfoundland, when that territory was a self-governing Dominion.The Cabinefs conclusion was that, if a situation arose in whichthe Ceylon Government found it necessary to ask for assistance, by united Kingdom troops, naval landing parties from Her Majesty&apos;s ships already in the neighbourhood might be made available primarily for the purpose of guarding our own defence installations in the Island.The landing of these detachments would have some steadying effect,-   ;      and their deployment to guard our own installations would free- Ceylonese troops for other duties.4 -       &apos;       The Cabinet-   -      &apos;;      : -   ;     - &quot;,  .-.-   &apos;Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to give guidance to- the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Colombo,on&apos; . .; * -        . the fines indicated in the Cabihefs-discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.T,;     19th August, 1953.pointed out that this statement was qualified by the reference .tothe principles and purpqses of the United Nations.&apos; It was also&apos; suggested that similar statements contemplating freedom of actionin external affairs for a German, Government before.the conclusionof a peace treaty might have been made in a context assuming the &apos;existence of a European Defence Community; and that it was adifferent matter to make such a.statement in the unqualified termsused in the present draft.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the words &quot; and itselfenjoying freedom of action in- internal and external affairs &quot; shouldbe deleted from paragraph 4 of the draft unless it were found that similar words had been used, without &quot;qualification, in earlier state-ments on the position of an all german Government in the period before the conclusion of a peace treaty.The Cabinet  -(1) Invited the Lord President to review, in the light of their discussion, the wording of paragraphs of the draft replyto the Soviet notes of 4th and 15 th August on the pro-posal for a Four-Power Meeting on. the future of,.Germany.(2) Subject to conclusion (1) above,, agreed that the draft pre-* pared, by the Foreign Office would serve as a valuable- .&quot; basis for the forthcoming discussions with officials of theUnited States and French Governments regarding theterms of the reply&apos;to be sent to the Soviet notes.
