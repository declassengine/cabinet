Kenya.(previous reference:CC. (53) 50thConclusions,Minute 1.)Court-Martialof CaptainGriffiths.1. The Cabinet discussed the terms of a statement to be made,in reply to a Private Notice Question by the Leader of theOpposition, on the circumstances disclosed in court-martial pro-ceedings against a British officer, Captain Griffiths, on a charge of murder of an African in Kenya.The Secretary of State for War said that Captain Griffiths hadbeen acquitted by a court-martial on 27th November of a chargeof murdering an African on 11th June. The full report of theproceedings had not yet been received and he could not thereforebe expected to make any public comment on them. On theinformation contained in the reports so far received, he was inclined to think that Captain Griffiths conduct might render him liable tofurther proceedings. The urgent need, however, was to reassure theHouse of Commons and the public that incidents of this kind were quite exceptional, and to make it plain that General Erskine had infact issued a directive on 23rd June, soon after his arrival and while he was still in ignorance of this particular occurrence, deprecatingmost strongly any conduct towards Africans by the police or by theArmy which they would be ashamed to see used against their own people. General Erskine had also made it clear at a Press conference that he strongly condemned any form of competition in achievingcasualties amongst the Mau Mau. In fact official rewards had never been offered for killings.In discussion the following points were made: (a) Section 162 of the Army Act had the effect that CaptainGriffiths could be put on trial for murder before a civil court, despitehis acquittal by a court-martial, although it was believed that therewas no precedent for such a course. Apart from this possibility,there was nothing to prevent other proceedings being taken against him, e.g., for conduct unbecoming an officer, if the evidencewarranted it. Statements about the individual case could thereforebe avoided at this stage on the ground that the matter was in this sense still sub judice.(b) The statement should emphasise the fact that GeneralErskine had issued a directive against any form of brutal treatmentbefore he had known about the incident for which Captain Griffithshad been tried. On the other hand, it would be unwise to draw attention to his condemnation of organised competition in claimingcasualties, since this might be thought to imply that such a system had been widely adopted by the Army in Kenya.(c) Although this incident was believed to be exceptional, ifmight be made clear in the statement to the House of Commons that,if it was found after careful examination of the proceedings that therewas any evidence to suggest that this kind of conduct had been wide-spread or might recur, a military court of enquiry would be appointedby the Army Council to investigate the whole matter.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for War, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Minister of Labour andthe Attorney-General, to draw up a statement on the lines discussed.Later in the meeting a draft statement was put before the cabinet and approved subject to amendments.The Cabinet-Approved the terms of a statement to be made to the Houseof Commons on the circumstances disclosed in the court-martial proceedings in Kenya against Captain Griffiths.Sudan. 2.   The Foreign Secretary reported to the Cabinet the results of(Previous the Sudanese elections.   The National Unionist Party had gainedReference: 43 out of a total of 90 seats and were expected to gain a further 5,CC. (53) 34th thus giving them a majority over all other Parties.   Their successConclusions, had been largely due to the fact that the election had been fought on minute 3.) a religious basis, and the Mahdi&apos;s Party, the Umma, had had little
success even in the towns. The opponents of the National unionist party had failed to coalesce, and in several constituencies competition between Umma and the Socialist Republican Party had ensured the victory of the National Unionist Party candidate. Although theresult appeared favourable to Egypt, it was open to doubt whetherthe National Unionist Party, which would now presumably form theGovernment of the Sudan, would work for union with Egypt. Self-government had been promised to the Sudan some years before andthe elections were a natural consequence of this promise. Theagreement which the political parties had reached with the egyptian government in January, 1953, had made it necessary to hold theseelections as early as possible, or to risk incurring the hostility, notonly of the Egyptians, but of all the Sudanese political parties. Itcould not be said that the elections, or their result, were due to theAnglo-Egyptian Agreement on the Sudan which had been concludedearlier in the year. Nevertheless, the outcome of the elections wouldcertainty cause dissatisfaction among the Governmenfs supporters,and would stiffen the opposition to the conclusion of a defence agreement with Egypt.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.3. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute, the Prime Minister said that he had been considering there-deployment of British troops in the Middle East. The point ofcardinal importance was to obtain American agreement to a joint anglo-United States plan which would effect the best disposition of forces in support of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation andwould reassure public opinion in the United Kingdom. He hadsketched the outline of a possible plan, which was not dependent onour continued control and operation of the Canal Zone Base. Hewould ask the Minister of Defence to examine this plan.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would invite the viewsof the Minister of Defence on his suggested re-deployment of British forces in the Middle East on the basis ofan agreed Anglo-United States plan.4. The. Colonial Secretary said that the Kabaka of Buganda had now been deposed and was on his way to London by air. This newswould become public before the House of Commons met that afternoon. Should- he therefore make a statement in the House ofCommons that afternoon on the constitutional situation in uganda?In discussion the view was expressed that such a statement might give rise to a motion for the adjournment of the House which the speaker would be unable to resist; and there was no certainty thatthere would be sufficient Government supporters present to preventthe defeat of the Government. It was pointed out in reply that the adjournment could be moved on this question whether or not aGovernment statement had been made, and in these circumstances it would be better for the Colonial Secretary to make the statement and to take the risk that a motion for the adjournment would beallowed.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon on the depositionof the Kabaka of Buganda.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, 1953.Middle East.Defence Policy.(previous reference:C.C.
