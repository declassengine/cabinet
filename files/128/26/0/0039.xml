The Chancellor of the Exchequer read to the Cabinet a letterMinister,  .,,.. which he had received from the Prime Minister thanking them for the message of sympathy and good wishes which hud been sent to him on, their behalf titter their meeting on 29th June.Foreign Affairs.tripartite meeting,(previous reference: .C.C. (53) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the lord president on his general approach to the forthcoming tripartite meeting in Washington (C (53) 187) and on United Kingdom associa-tion with the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) (C. (53) 186).The Lord President said that, while the holding of Four-power talks remained the principal objective of our policy, the prospect of holding them had receded owing to the deferment of the projectedThree-Power Meeting in Bermuda and the approach of the German
elections, which made it desirable to avoid any move which would increase the feelings of uncertainty in Germany. The Prime minister had that day sent him a minute (which was read to the Cabinet andsubsequently circulated as C. (53) 194) suggesting that the twin aims of our policy in the immediate future should be the early ratification of the E.D.C. Treaty and agreement in principle to the holding of a four-Power meeting at the earliest suitable date. He agreed with this statement of our objectives and thought that they might best be advanced by securing agreement at the forthcoming talks in washington to the holding of a further tripartite meeting in the early autumn after the German elections; he would add a statement tothis effect to the summary of our objectives set out in paragraph 15of C. (53) 187. The French seemed at the moment to be entirelynegative in their outlook and to be mainly concerned with findingmeans of avoiding the necessity for adopting definite policies and decisions.The Minister of Housing said that the French had supported theE.D.C. conception so long as it had seemed likely to serve as an instrument for securing the permanent division of Germany. Now,however, that they were confronted with the possibility of a re-unified Germany as a member of the E.D.C., they were taking advantage of every possible means of postponing ratification of theTreaty. We ourselves had gone as far as we could reasonably beexpected to go in agreeing to associate ourselves more closely withthe Community. The incorporation of a re-unified Germany in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) might well prove to bea more satisfactory solution in the long-term, but for the momentthere could be no question of abandoning the E.D.C. conception. our main short-term objective must be the return of Dr. Adenauer&apos;sGovernment in the forthcoming German elections and, with the objectof facilitating this, we must not only maintain our support of theE.D.C. but encourage reasonable hopes of ultimate Four-Power talkswithout which there was unlikely to be any progress towards there-unification of Germany.Some discussion followed on the sanctions which might be invoked to induce the French to ratify the E.D.C. Treaty. There was general support for the view that we should ultimately have to makeit clear that the alternative to an E.D.C. was the admission ofGermany to N.A.T.O. Indeed, if Germany were unified, it would bebetter that she should be in N.A.T.O. than in E.D.C. The cabinet agreed, however, that no such ultimatum should be presented to theFrench before the German elections: at this stage the French could probably not be pressed to do more than make an early reaffLrmationof their intention to ratify the E.D.C. Treaty at the earliest practicabledate.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the forthcoming discussions in Washington on policy towards the Soviet Union and Germany the lord president should follow the general line indicated inC. (53) 187 and should seek agreement to the conclusionsset out at the end of the Prime Ministers note C. (53) 194.(2) Approved the recommendation in C. (53) 186 that the pro-posed arrangements for co-operation between the UnitedKingdom and the E.D.C. should be incorporated in a formal agreement, the text of which should be settled bythe E.D.C.

first anniversary of the coup d&apos;etat in Egypt on 23rd July; and hewould be less likely to adopt an inflexible attitude in this declarationif before then we had been able to indicate that we were ready to resume the negotiations. It was desirable that, before the negotiations were resumed, we should obtain an assurance that the United StatesGovernment would support us in the line which we proposed to take;and, if he were able to reach agreement with the Americans, he would arrange for General Robertson to return at once from Washington to cairo in good time for the Egyptians to make an informal approach to him before 23rd July.The Americans were likely to urge us to accept the proposals outlined in paragraph 2 of C. (53) 190. He would have to make itclear that these were quite unacceptable to us. He would seek to persuade the Americans to lend their support for one or other of thealternative proposals set out in paragraph 4 of C. (53) 190. Of thesehe much preferred Alternative I, though he was doubtful whether itwould be practicable to persuade the Egyptians to accept this in full.The Cabinefs discussion centred . on the proposals set out inAlternative I under paragraph 4 of C. (53) 190. The following points were made:  (a) These proposals made no explicit reference to the safe-guarding of the Suez Canal as an international waterway. Would.itbe possible, as suggested in Cairo telegram No. 996 of 5th July, toinclude among the conditions which would entitle us to re-enter and use the Base in the Canal Zone &quot; any impediment or grave threat tothe security of free navigation through the, Suez Canal&quot;?The Cabinet were informed that an agreement on the Suez Canalwas to have been negotiated separately with the Egyptian Govern-ment. If we negotiated this separately, we should be able to enlist the support of all the maritime Powers, many of whom would not be willing to support our claims in respect of the Base.Some Ministers felt that it would be difficult to justify to publicopinion a new defence agreement with Egypt which made no referenceto the Suez Canal. If a new agreement about the Canal were to be negotiated separately, it would be a great advantage if we were ableto announce it simultaneously with the other.(b) Paragraph (iii) of Alternative I would assure us the use of the base only in the event of aggression, or threat of aggression, against egypt. But we might well need to use the Base in a major war inwhich we had ourselves been the victims of aggression but no threathad yet developed against Egypt. Paragraph 7 of the original Case Acontemplated that we should have the use of the Base &quot; in war &quot;; andeven the American proposals, as outlined in paragraph 2 ofC. (53) 190, contemplated a private undertaking that the Base wouldbe available to. us &quot; in case of general war.&quot;The Lord President agreed that the formula suggested in para-graph 4 of his memorandum was too narrowly limited. He undertook to reconsider this point in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.(c) Was it clear that the British technicians who would be stationed in the Base under the proposals in Case A would be able todefend it against armed attack by the Egyptians? Was there not acase for retaining some fighting formations in the Canal Zone for thepurpose of defending the Base against Egyptian attack? In Cairotelegram No. 995 of 5th July it was suggested that the Egyptians mightmine some of the installations in the Base, and that we could onlyinsure effectively against this risk if we continued to maintain adequateforces in the neighbourhood of the Canal Zone.In reply it was pointed&apos;out that the Base could.not be defendedagainst an organised attack by the Egyptian Army unless we main-tained something like two divisions in the Canal Zone. There was no possibility of securing Egyptian agreement to this. Nor were we ourselves anxious to keep such large forces in Egypt. It was, however,our intention that the British technicians inthe Base should be military personnel and should carry personal arms. This Would mean that they
could not be overborne without an organised military operation. Andour safeguard against this would be to make it clear that such an operation would be regarded as an act of war.(d) It was proposed in paragraph (ii) of Alternative I that theagreement should remain in force for an initial period of five years.Would it not be preferable to ask for a ten-year agreement?The Lord President said that he would have preferred a ten-year agreement; but there seemed to be little chance of persuading the egyptians to accept a longer period than five years. The period would, however, be less important if agreement were reached on thefurther proposal that, at the end of the initial period, either party tothe agreement would be entitled to request discussion of its revision.For the agreement would then continue in force until a revised agree-ment had been drawn up to take its place.The Cabinet:  - ,(3) Invited the Lord President to reconsider the proposals out-lined in C. (53) 190, in the light of the points which hadbeen raised in the discussion, and agreed to consider hisrevised proposals at their next meeting on 8th July.Korea, The Lord President said that in the course of the forthcoming(Previous discussions in Washington consideration would have to be given to the reference: suggestion, favoured by the Indian Government, that the UnitedC.C.

If there was a final breakdown in the negotiations for anMinute 3.)       armistice, the position would have to be considered by the Assembly.But it was clearly desirable that the Americans should have every opportunity to reach prior agreement with the South Koreans; and,if they wished for further time for this purpose, he would certainlyi        be in favour of delaying the convening of the Assembly.There was general agreement with the view expressed by theLord President. .. ,Indo-China.

Commonwealth Governments should be informed of the line whichwe proposed to take in the forthcoming discussions in Washington.The Cabinet  , &apos;(4) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform all commonwealth Governments of the line which the lord president proposed to take, in the Washington discussions,on policy towards the Soviet Union and Germany; and authorised him to inform the Governments of the olderCommonwealth countries of the proposals which the lord president was intending to put to the United StatesGovernment regarding the resumption of defence negotia-tions with Egypt.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7 th July, 1953.
