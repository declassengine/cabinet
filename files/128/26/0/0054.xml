Hong Kong.(previous reference:C.G. (52) 80thConclusions,Minute 3.)Chinese Attackon H.M. Ship.1. The Lord President referred to an incident which had occurred near Hong Kong on 9th September, when a patrol vessel of the Chinese Communist navy fired upon a British ship (H.M.Motor Launch 1323) and killed seven of her crew. The Chinesehad claimed that the British ship was within Chinese territorial waters,was not flying the White Ensign, and had without provocation firedten rounds at the Chinese vessel. None of these statements was true. The British ship was flying the White Ensign and believedherself to be just outside Chinese territorial waters; her guns werenot even manned. A naval Court of Enquiry had been held and itsreport would be available within a day or two. In the light of thisreport we should consider what further steps could be taken to force the Chinese Communist Government to accept responsibility for thisapparent outrage and to make reparation for it.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Lord President.EgyptDefenceNegotiations.(previous reference:C,C. (53) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Lord President said that our final proposals for a defence agreement had been put to the Egyptians in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision of 16th September. It seemed unlikely that the egyptians would accept them. They were now making difficultieseven on points on which there had previously seemed a good chanceof reaching agreement. Thus, they were unwilling to accept theinclusion, in the preamble of the agreement, of a reference to freedomof transit through the Suez Canal; they were challenging the rightof British troops in the Base to wear uniform; and they were raisingobjection to the proposal that the Base should become available inthe event of United Nations action To resist an act of aggression.He thought it would be unwise to offer any further concessions tothem at this stage and, subject to the Cabinefs views, he proposedto intimate that the proposals now communicated to them representedour last word.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that British troopsin the Base must wear uniform when on duty, though they might,if desired, wear some distinctive shoulder-title. There was no reason why they should not wear civilian clothes off duty, and there mightbe some advantage in making it a rule that they should not wearuniform when visiting Egyptian towns off duty. .The Prime Minister agreed that we should make no further attempt to compromise with the Egyptians. Government supporters would find it difficult to accept the concessions already made, butthey would be more likely to regard them favourably if it could be explained, when Parliament reassembled, that we had informed the egyptians of our final terms for a settlement and that we were holdingfirmly to these.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord President to make it clear to the egyptians that the proposals recently made to them inpursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 16th Septemberrepresented our final terms for a defence agreement andthat we were not prepared to make any further concessions.Trieste.(previous reference:CC. (52) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (53) 268) setting out proposals for imposing a settlementof the Italo-Yugoslav dispute over Trieste.The Lord President said that the attitude of both Italy and yugoslavia towards the Trieste question had hardened since thebeginning of the year.   The Italian Prime Minister had publicly
demanded a Five-Power conference to arrange a plebiscite in thewhole Free Territory; and Marshal Tito had publicly demandedthat both Zones should be conceded to Yugoslavia, the city of Triestebeing itself made an international area. Both sides doubtless knew that their demands were unattainable, but there was little prospectof an agreed settlement. The United States Government were now,however, prepared to try to impose a settlement a course whichthey had previously rejected when it was suggested to them by theForeign Secretary about a year ago. The suggestion was that theUnited States and United Kingdom Governments should join in informing the Italian and Yugoslav Governments that the presentsituation could not be allowed to continue, and that it had there-fore been decided to bring about a settlement on the basis of theexisting zonal boundary by withdrawing British and American troops and handing over Zone A to Italian administration. At this stageMarshal Tito would be asked to give an adequate assurance thathe would not attack the Italians in Zone A. If he refused to give this assurance, or if the Italians refused to take over Zone A on this basis, the plan could be abandoned. If, however, the results of thefirst approach were satisfactory, the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States would publicly announce that their troops were being withdrawn and that the Italian Government wasbeing allowed to extend administrative and military control toZone A. The main difficulty about the plan was that Marshal Titowas unlikely to give the assurance we required unless he were told that we considered that the settlement should be permanent and thatwe would not support any fresh claims by either side. The americans had refused to make any acknowledgment to this effect, since they feared that, if they did so, the Italian Government would fall and thesituation would deteriorate still further. The Lord President saidthat, although there were risks that the plan might fail or might leadto armed clashes, he was satisfied that it would be even more dangerous to allow the situation to deteriorate as it certainly would do if no action were taken.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Marshal Tito was unlikely to give the desired assurance unless he were convinced that the settlement was intended to be final, andwithout his assurance the plan could not go forward. It would,however, be unwise to give him the impression that by refusing togive this assurance he had the power to defeat the plan.(b) If we alone made it plain that it was our view that thesettlement should be permanent, we should incur further odium withthe Italians. If, however, the Americans could be persuaded to makea similar statement, there was a good chance that both Italy and yugoslavia would accept the settlement. Further efforts should therefore be made, by messages from the Foreign Secretary and theLord President to the United States Secretary of State and from thePrime Minister to the President, to bring the Americans over to our point of view on this particular aspect of the plan.(c) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that there mustbe the least possible delay between the entry of Italian troops intoZone A and the withdrawal of the Allied troops. Dependants and stores must therefore be evacuated in advance, so that the troopsthemselves could be moved quickly at the last moment. It wouldbe preferable that the troops should leave by sea. A satisfactory plan for rapid evacuation could be made if the necessary shipping weremade available.(d) The Lord President said that the present proposal was thatthe initial approach should be made to the Italian and YugoslavGovernments on 6th or 7th October. The French Government must,however, be informed of our intentions in advance. There wasadmittedly a serious risk that they would pass the information directly
5 C.C. 54 (53*to the Italians. It was agreed that on this account the communication to the French Government should be delayed until very shortly beforethe approach was made to the Italians and Yugoslavs.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the plan proposed in C. (53) 268 for bringing about a de facto settlement of the Triesteproblem.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to urge upon the President of theUnited States that the chances of success depended uponwillingness of the Governments of both the UnitedKingdom and the United States to let Marshal Tito know that they regarded the settlement as permanent; and invited the Foreign Secretary and the Lord President tomake similar representations to the United states secretary of State.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of transport to concert a plan for the rapid evacuation of British troops,their families and their stores from the Free Territory of trieste.(4) Invited the Lord President to try to persuade the americans to defer making any communication to the French Gov-ernment about this plan until very shortly before the approach was to be made to the Governments of Italy andY ugoslavia.British Guiana.       4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (53) 261) on the current situation in British Guiana.The Colonial Secretary said that the elected Ministers in british guiana, who were under strong Communist influences, were takingevery opportunity to undermine the constitution and to further theCommunist cause. Some of them had been the moving force behind the strike which had paralysed the sugar industry, and they were evidently seeking to establish a totalitarian dominance over the terri-tory by penetrating the trade unions and local government. Theywere in close touch with the World Federation of Trade Unions inVienna. In these circumstances he had no doubt that it was necessaryto take away the Ministers&apos; powers, imprison the extremists andsuspend the constitution at the earliest possible moment. His latestadvice was that the situation was deteriorating daily; and theGovernor now doubted whether more than 50 per cent, of the policecould be relied upon. He himself felt, however, that if a British battalion arrived on the spot at an early date, the police would remainloyal. He therefore proposed that a battalion of the Royal WelchFusiliers should proceed at once to British Guiana, from Jamaica, ina cruiser and two frigates. They would arrive off Georgetown on 9th October. The cruiser would have to lie 15 miles off the port and the frigates would land the troops. As soon as the troops had landed, the Governor would take action under emergency powers toimprison the extremists and suspend the constitution.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In operations of this kind the risk of bloodshed was much lessif overwhelming force was deployed at the outset. That considera-tion suggested that it would be preferable to send two battalions toGeorgetown, rather than one. On the other hand, an additionalbattalion could not reach there before 20th October, and by that date the situation would have deteriorated further and the police mightno longer be reliable.
(b) A supplementary force of one battalion could be brought toreadiness in the United Kingdom and could sail with some of itsvehicles in an aircraft carrier on about 8th or 9th October. The onlybattalion immediately available for this duty was at half-strength,but there were three full-strength battalions in the Infantry Brigadewhich was being held as a reinforcement for Egypt.(c) No information of our intentions had yet been given to theGovernments of other Commonwealth countries or of the UnitedStates. It was, however, proposed that the Government of Canada,which had important commercial interests in British Guiana, shouldbe told of the plan twenty-four hours before it was put into operation.It was suggested that the Governments of Australia, New Zealand,the United States and possibly Venezuela, should also be told abouttwelve hours before the plan took effect. It was unlikely that therewould be any adverse reactions in the United States, where anti-colonial sentiments would in this case be off-set by anti-Communistsentiments. The Governments of India, Pakistan and Ceylon shouldnot be informed until the operation had begun.The Cabinet (1) Approved the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposals, outlined inC. (53) 261, for suspending the constitution of british guiana.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for a battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers to proceed at once to british guiana, from Jamaica, with a naval force of one cruiser and two frigates; and to make all the necessary prepara-tions to enable a further battalion to be sent at full-strength from the United Kingdom, in an aircraft carrier,if reinforcements proved to be needed.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to concert with the foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary arrangementsfor informing other interested Governments.british somali land.Grazing rights in Ethiopia.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president and the Colonial Secretary (C. (53) 263) proposing that negotiations should be opened with the Ethiopian Government witha view to securing for certain tribes in British Somaliland their traditional grazing-lands in adjacent Ethiopian territory.In discussion some doubts were expressed about the expediency of securing these rights by ceding territory to Ethiopia. Should wenot be open to criticism if we allowed the tribes resident in that territory to pass under Ethiopian sovereignty without any previous consultation with their rulers?The Prime Minister said that it would assist the Cabinet in reaching a decision if the details of the proposed negotiations werestudied in the first instance by a small Committee of Ministers.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of Lord President (in the Chair)Minister of DefenceColonial secretary minister of Housing and Local government financial Secretary, Treasury,to examine the detailed proposals set out in thememorandum annexed to C. (53) 263, and to report on them to the Cabinet.
Housing Policy.       6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister(Previous of Housing (C. (53) 259), the Lord Privy Seal (C. (53) 264) and the reference: Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 269) about the housing policyCC (53) 52nd embodied in the draft White Papers attached to C. (53) 250 and 251.Conclusions, The following aspects of the matter were covered in the courseMinute l.) of discussion:  (a) Should the policy embodied in the draft White Papers be put intoeffect?The Minister of Housing said that the policy was essentially onewhich would require time to prove itself effective and fair. If, as might be expected, the Bills were to receive the Royal Assent early next summer rents would thereafter begin to go up gradually as.landlords were able to show that the necessary conditions for increases were fulfilled. Although from the outset there was likelyto be some visible return for the rent increases in the form of actualrepairs and improvements being carried out, the policy was one which,at least in its early stages, would be capable of being misrepresentedin the country: it would be less easy for the Opposition to adopt analtogether hostile attitude to it in Parliament.The Cabinet recognised the risks inherent in the policy that itwould involve the Government in some immediate unpopularity andthat rent increases, by giving rise to increases in the cost of living,might prejudice their efforts to encourage restraint in wage claims.It was, however, the general view of Ministers that these risks, seriousthough they were, should not deter them from carrying out whatthey and a considerable body of responsible opinion in the countryregarded as necessary and right, and that the Government stood to gain in the long run from a successful attempt to stem the decay ofthe stock of existing houses.The Cabinet-(1) Re-affirmed their approval of the general lines of the housing policy set out by the Minister of Housing and theSecretary of State for Scotland in C. (53) 250 and 251.(b) TimetableThe Minister of Housing said that, on further consideration, he recommonded that the White Papers should be published immediatelyafter the delivery of The Queen&apos;s Speech on 3rd November. Thiswould enable them to be discussed during the Debate on the Address.The Second Reading debates could then take place before Christmas.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the White Papers should be presented to Parlia-ment at the opening of the new Session.(c) Title of White paper the Minister of Housing said that the proposed title of his white paper &quot; Housing: A Comprehensive Policy &quot; now seemed to him tobe rather too wide in its implications. He would prefer to call it&quot; Houses: The Next Step &quot; and to cover in it nothing which was notto be covered by the Bill.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the title of the White Paper to be presented bythe Minister of Housing should be &quot; Houses: The NextStep.&quot;(d) The Maximum Permitted Rent IncreaseThe Minister of Housing said that, as the cost of repairs was now estimated to have risen to about three times the amount of thestatutory deduction for rating purposes, the logical course would be
to make the maximum permitted rent increase equal to twice thestatutory deduction. Hitherto, he had shrunk from this coursebecause of the size of the increase which it would impose upon the lowest rents. He had now reached the conclusion, however, that thedifference between one-and-a-half times and twice the statutorydeduction was of relatively little significance from the point of viewof the acceptability of the rent increases to the general public, butthat knowledgeable opinion would be critical of the adoption of onlyone-and-a-half times the statutory deduction as the determinant ofthe maximum permitted rent increase. He therefore now favouredadopting twice the statutory deduction. The safeguard that no rentwould rise above twice the existing gross value of the house for rating purposes would, of course, remain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the Minister of housing&apos;s recommendation on this point.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the maximum permitted rent increase should be equal to twice the statutory deduction for rating purposes.(e) The Landlords Obligations&apos;The Minister of Housing said that the conditions on whose fulfil-ment it was proposed to insist before rents would be allowed to risewere an essential feature of the scheme, without which there wouldbe no effective answer to the suggestion that the Government were putting money into the pockets of the landlords. The effect of theamendment of paragraphs 38-40 of the draft White Paper proposedin C. (53) 264 would be to cover this matter in general terms, leaving the detailed provisions to the Bill. He would hope to devise a formula which would meet satisfactorily, not only the case of the land-lord who was prepared to spend a specified sum upon repairing his property in order that he might qualify for a rent increase, but also thecase of the &quot; good landlord &quot; who had never let his property get intodisrepair. The test would be one applied once and for all but itwould be at least an earnest of good intentions.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had explained inparagraphs 3-8 of C. (53) 251 his reasons for not wishing to imposean expenditure test in Scotland, where it might well make his Billunworkable. He would like authority to endeavour to uphold thedifference between the English and the Scottish schemes in this respect.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that an expenditure test on the lines contemplated by the Minister of Housing should be applied in Englandand Wales but not in Scotland.(/) GeneralThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would wish todiscuss with the Minister of Housing the exact terms of the referenceto be made in the White Paper to the housing subsidies and the sug-gestion in his memorandum that something ought also to be said about emergency housing.The Cabinet-^(6) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss certain detailed points arising on the draft white paper with the Minister of Housing.(7) Approved the amendments to the draft White Paper set outin C. (53) 259 and 264.
Judges&apos;Salaries.       7.   The  Cabinet  considered  a memorandum by  the Lord(Previous        Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofReference:      State for Scotland (C. (53) 266) covering a draft of a Bill to increaseC.C. (53) 47th   the remuneration of Judges of the High Court.Conclusions, In discussion of the draft Bill the following points were made: -Minute 5.) ^        Cabinet agreed that the increased remuneration shouldnot apply retrospectively.(b) The form of the Bill should be adjusted so as to avoid theneed for a Schedule setting out the increased salaries in tabular form.(c) The salaries payable to the Lord Chancellor and the lord chief Justice, while they should be higher than those payable to the holders of other offices covered by the Bill, could be somewhat lower than was proposed in the draft Bill annexed to C. (53) 266. TheLord Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should settle,in consultation, what would be the appropriate level of remunerationto be included in the Bill for the holders of these two offices.(d) The Queen&apos;s Speech should include a reference to theGovernments intention to proceed with this measure during theforthcoming session. The timing of the introduction of the Bill could,however, be considered later in the light of progress made with thecurrent consideration of the remuneration of Ministers and Membersof Parliament.The Cabinet Decided to proceed in the forthcoming session with legis-lation to increase the remuneration of Judges of the HighCourt on the general lines proposed in C. (53) 266, subjectto the points noted in paragraphs (a)-(c) above; and agreedthat this legislation should be mentioned in The Queers-Speech at the Opening of that session.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,2nd October, 1953.
