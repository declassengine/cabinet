Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business which was likelyto be taken in the House of Commons in the following week.From the point of view of the Parliamentary time-table therewould be advantages in holding during that week the proposed debate on Foreign Affairs. The Prime Minister felt, however, that, fromthe angle of international relations, it might be preferable to postponethat debate for a few days longer. He undertook to discuss this ques-tion further with the Lord Privy Seal before the time came to announce the Parliamentary business for the following week.Transport. 3.   The Cabinet took note that the Transport Bill had nowTransport Bill,   passed through all its stages in both Houses of Parliament.   They(Previous        expressed their appreciation of the skill and patience with which the reference:      Minister of Transport had conducted the Parliamentary proceedingsC.g. (52) 9lst    on the Bill.Conclusions,Minute 2.)London The Cabinet considered a proposal that a Committee should beTransport appointed to consider what practical measures (if any) could be takenExecutive.       by the British Transport Commission and the London transport executive to secure greater efficiency and economy in london transport.The Cabinet were informed that this proposal had been approvedby the Home Affairs Committee. Questions relating to charges wouldbe excluded from the proposed enquiry, since these fell within thejurisdiction of the Transport Tribunal. In discussion it was suggestedthat the words &quot;if any&quot; should be deleted from the terms of referenceproposed by the Minister of Transport.Foreign Affairs. 1. The Prime Minister drew attention to a newspaper report ofthe reply sent by the Soviet Foreign Minister to a proposal, made bythe Congress of the Peoples for Peace, for the conclusion of a peacepact between the Soviet Union, the United States, the United King-dom, France and Communist China. M. Molotov had said that theSoviet Government approved this proposal: being convinced thatthere was no dispute or unsettled issue which could not be settledpeaceably on the basis of mutual agreement between the countries concerned, they were ready to co-operate with the Governmentsof other States in strengthening world peace and security.The Prime Minister said that, if there was to be any such meetingof Great Powers, he would prefer that it should be limited to theSoviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom, who could take up the discussion at the point at which it had been left at theend of the Potsdam Conference in 1945. It was in any event unlikelythat the United States Government would be willing to be repre-sented at any such meeting which included representatives of communist China.In discussion it was pointed out that proposals for a Five-Powerpeace pact had formed part of Communist propaganda for some time past; and that M. Molotov had done no more than endorse a proposalto this end submitted by the Congress of the Peoples for Peace, whichwas a Communist-controlled organisation. More significance could have been attached to his statement if it had been made, of his own initiative, in an official offer to the other Governments concerned.The Cabinet agreed that it would be premature to draw any conclusions from this announcement, and that it would be unneces-sary for the Government to volunteer any public statement about itat this stage.
The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport to announce, in replyto two Parliamentary Questions for answer that afternoon,that a Committee would be appointed to consider means ofsecuring greater efficiency and economy in london transport; and approved the terms of reference proposedby the Minister, subject to the amendment suggested in discussion.NorthernIreland.Relief ofUnemployment.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 28thConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 133 and 141) discussing possible means of helping the Northern Ireland Government in their efforts to reduce unemployment.The Home Secretary said that examination had shown that thepractical measures suggested during the Cabinets last discussion ofthis matter would have little immediate effect on the employment situation in Northern Ireland. It therefore seemed necessary to con-sider what attitude we should adopt if, as seemed likely, the NorthernIreland Government were to press for the inclusion in their forth-coming budget of a subsidy on industrial coal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the substantial fall inthe amount of her Imperial contribution was a measure of NorthernIreland&apos;s serious plight, which justified our giving her some further assistance. He did not favour the suggested coal subsidy and would prefer that our assistance should take such practical forms as mightbe agreed upon in discussion with Northern Ireland Ministers.The Minister of Fuel and Power recalled that between 1940 and1950 there had been a coal freight subsidy which had coveredScotland and south-west England as well as Northern Ireland. It was likely that the reintroduction of a coal subsidy in Northern ireland would give rise to a demand for its extension at least to Scotland.It was explained that, although the rate of unemployment inScotland was not comparable with that in Northern Ireland, a casecould be made for such assistance, at least to the Scottish Highlandswhere heavy unemployment was avoided largely by movement ofredundant labour to other areas.The Minister of Supply said that, if authority could be given forthe placing of certain War Office orders for clothing which had recently been suspended for financial reasons, it would be possible to spend in Northern Ireland an additional  300,000 providing imme-diate work for some 400 people.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would consider urgently whether in present circumstances the placing of these particular orders could be approved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that financial assistance should be afforded to the Northern Ireland Government in their efforts to reduce unemployment.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to discuss with Northern Ireland Ministers theamount of such assistance and the particular uses to whichit should be put.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider urgently,and inform the Minister of Supply, whether he was prepared to authorise the immediate placing of the addi-tional War Office orders for clothing mentioned inparagraph 4 of Annex A to C. (53) 141.
Atomic EnergyOrganisation.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 28thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinet had approved on 21st April the form of the proposed announcement aboutthe current enquiry into the organisation for supervising atomicresearch and production, it had been suggested to him that he might with advantage add an introductory paragraph in the following terms: &quot; As the House knows, considerable strides have been madein the development of methods for using atomic energy for industrial purposes and these aspects are now coming very much to the fore.Various countries on this side of the Iron Curtain are devoting a notable effort to this new field, either for warlike or for peacefulpurposes, and I do not think there is one in which the work is organised on departmental lines.&quot;In discussion it was agreed that the first of these two sentencesshould be adopted as an introduction to the draft announcementalready approved. The second sentence need not be included in theoriginal statement, but it might well be used in reply to supplementaryQuestions.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would adjust, in the lightof their discussion, the announcement which he was to makein the House of Commons that afternoon on the currentenquiry into the organisation for supervising atomic research and production in this country.government organisation.regional organisation.(previous reference:C.C.(53)llthConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (53) 127) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (C. (53) 140) on proposals to reduce the number and size of regional offices of Government Departments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a means of achieving a further reduction in the numbers of civil servants inaccordance with the Governments declared policy, he was recom-mending the closing of all regional offices in Cambridge and Reading(and possibly, later, in Newcastle and Nottingham also) and the com-bination of the regional offices of the Board of Trade and the Ministryof Supply (and possibly, later, of other Departments) in the remain-ing regional headquarters towns. The Prime Minister had stated inthe House of Commons on 26th February that the regional organisa-tion was under examination to see whether economies could besecured and that it was hoped to make a definite announcementbefore long.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that hewould deprecate any weakening of his Departments regional organisa-tion at a time when the success of the Governments housing pro-gramme still hung in the balance. His regional officers were able toput to good use both their close contacts with local housing authori-ties, many of whom were not in sympathy with the Government, andtheir working relations with colleagues representing the Ministers ofLabour and Works.The Minister of Labour said that his regional officers performedno less valuable a function in helping to maintain industrial peace.Moreover, without an adequate regional organisation, it would bedifficult for his Department to supervise properly its local offices,which numbered some 1,200.In discussion the following further points were made:  (a) The President of the Board of Trade, the Minister of Supplyand the Minister of National Insurance said that, in spite of the valueof the regional organisation, they were ready to accept the proposedwinding up of the Cambridge and Reading regions.
North Atlantic 7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a brief report on theCouncil, proceedings at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council which had(Previous        been held in Paris from 23rd to 25th April.Reference: In the formal meetings of the Council, all the countries repre-C.C. (53) 28th   sented had unanimously endorsed the view that, despite the uncer-Conclusions,     tainties about Soviet foreign policy since the death of Stalin, thereMinute 6.)       should be no relaxation of the effort to strengthen the defences of thewestern world.In private meetings which they had held with the British and theFrench representatives, United States Ministers had been somewhat less encouraging. They had made it clear that we must expect asubstantial reduction in defence aid from the United States to Europe.So,far as concerned the United Kingdom, general economic aid wouldbe discontinued and assistance would be given only in the form of off-shore purchases and possibly some temporary finance for purchases of United States commodities. The Chancellor said that, accordingto the best estimate he could make at present, this would involve onlya slight worsening of our dollar balance of payments in the current year, but it would affect our position more seriously after the middleof 1954. Therefore, in speaking to the Council on the proposed goalsfor North Atlantic forces, he had made it clear that his acceptance ofthe provisional goals proposed for the-end of 1954 was subject toreservations about continued United States assistance and a satisfac-tory defence contribution from Germany.United States Ministers had also indicated privately that it wouldbe some time before they could make any positive contribution towards the reduction of restrictions on world trade. It was evidentthat they were faced with serious divisions of opinion within the republican Party on external economic and defence policy; and thatwe should be well-advised to base our plans on the assumption thatthey v/ould be unable for some time to come to give the full co-operation and support which we had hoped to secure from them.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Housing Policy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 27thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (53) 139) proposing a plan for carrying out the Gov-ernments &quot; grand design &quot; for housing.The Lord Privy Seal said that the plan favoured by the CabinetCommittee on Housing Policy was that a Rating and Valuation Billshould be enacted this session and that legislation to give effect to theremainder of the Governments housing policy should be deferred(b) Serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of attempting to close regional offices in Newcastle and to administer thepresent Northern Region from Leeds.(c) The Minister of Supply said that the combination of hisDepartments regional offices with those of the Board of Trade was acceptable to him in principle but would need careful working out inpractice.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider his proposals in C. (53) 127 in the light of the cabinets discussion.(2) Agreed that, in the meanwhile, such practical steps as couldbe taken to reduce the regional organisation of Depart-ments should be put into effect without special publicity.
Commonwealth 9. The Commonwealth Secretary referred to the speech whichAffairs. the Prime Minister, of India had recently made at Amritsar in whichIndia. he had said that Africans were struggling against exploitation,repression and colonialism and that Indian sympathies were entirely with them. He had circulated to the Cabinet a note (C. (53) 138) ofthe representations which he had made to Mr. Nehru about thisspeech, through the High Commissioner for India in London and through our High Commissioner in New Delhi. He was glad tosay that he had now received a reply from Mr. Nehru which wasconciliatory in tone, and he would circulate this to his colleagues.South Africa. Meanwhile, however, the Archbishop of Canterbury had per-mitted himself to make some public references to racial policyin South Africa which had given equal offence to the Union Govern-ment. He understood that he would shortly receive a formal protestabout this from the Prime Minister of South Africa, and it wouldprobably be necessary for him to make appropriate representations tothe Archbishop.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the commonwealth secretary.10. The Prime Minister said that he would be glad if his col-leagues would consider whether anything could be done to relieve the strain imposed upon Members of the House of Commons, of both parties, by the narrowness of the Government majority. Some ease-ment in this direction would be all the more desirable if, as seemed likely, opinion amongst Government supporters ruled out anyresponse to the Opposition^ recent approach on the subject ofMembers&apos; salaries. It might be profitable to study the procedures ofother Parliaments, and some Committee of enquiry might possibly be established to consider the problem.Parliament.House ofCommonsProcedure.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)until the 1953-54 Session. The draft of a White Paper on the whole subject would be brought before the Cabinet before the end of July;selected members of the Conservative Party should then be told in confidence of the Governments intentions at a suitable stage; and aResolution should be arranged at the Conservative Party Conferencein reply to which the Governments plans could be adumbrated. TheWhite Paper would be published at the end of October and discussed in the Debate on the Address, the necessary Bill or Bills being intro-duced immediately thereafter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although a Rents bill would help to increase confidence in the Governments financial policy and the stability of sterling, he reluctantly recognised thenecessity to defer its introduction until the coming Session. Hewould wish to discuss with the Minister of Housing in good time how the programme for new houses might best be adjusted when the target of 300,000 houses in a year had been achieved.The Minister of Housing said that deferment of the Rents bill was regrettable but inevitable. As he had informed the Cabinet on16th April, it was his intention to shift the emphasis from the building of new houses to the repair or demolition of old houses once the300,000 target had been attained.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (53) 139.
The Lord Privy Seal said that the procedures of the House ofCommons had been subjected to a searching examination by a SelectCommittee as recently as 1945-6. In his view the current difficulties were due, not so much to faults of procedure, as to the mood of theOpposition. He would, however, consider the Prime Ministerssuggestion.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th April, 1953.
