185C.C. 81 (S3)EgyptSterlingBalances.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that under theterms of the Agreement made in 1951 Egypt was entitled to draw 5 millions of her sterling balances on 1st January in each year. Anadditional  10 millions could be drawn in the course of the year, andthis was normally transferred to the account of the Bank of Egypt atthe beginning of each year. Failure to release the  5 millions on1st January would involve a direct breach of an international agree-ment and a consequent loss of confidence in sterling. He would prefer that the  10 millions should also be released on 1st January.On a previous occasion we had withheld this release for several months and this device of delay could doubtless be adopted again.The Bank of England, who would handle the transaction, could findmeans of imposing a short delay; but the Government would find itembarrassing to explain the delay and it could not be justified for long.The Prime Minister said that he was most reluctant to see this money paid to Egypt at a time when she was showing such hostility tous. He was particularly embarrassed at the thought that this shouldbe done when, with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s concurrence, he had been pressing the President of the United States to delay the grant ofeconomic aid to Egypt. If we now released sterling balances, as pro-posed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, we might lay ourselvesopen to the reproach that we were trying to win from the Egyptiansfavours which we wished to deny to the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States administration would appreciate the difference between the two transactions. Weshould be repaying debt in accordance with an international agree-ment; but the United States were being asked to postpone giving newmoney for development projects in Egypt which would bring benefits to American engineering contractors. He agreed with the Chancellorof the Exchequer that to withhold the promised instalments of Egypfssterling balances might lead to a loss of confidence in sterling. Itmight, in particular, prompt other Arab countries, notably Kuwait,to withdraw sterling balances which were not governed by any formal agreement.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the  5 millions due on 1st January should be released inaccordance with the terms of the Agreement. The further  10millions should, however, be withheld for a time until it becamepossible to judge more clearly the probable course of the defence negotiations and of our general relations with Egypt.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that  5 millions of Egypfs blocked sterling balancesshould be released on 1st January, 1954, in accordancewith the Sterling Releases Agreement.(2) Took note that - the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange with the Governor of the Bank of England to defer for as long as possible the release of the further 10 millions due in 1954.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 80thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Prime Minister said that he thought the time had now cometo bring to a head the defence negotiations with Egypt. He suggestedthat, unless the Egyptian Government agreed in the very near future to accept our latest proposals, we should declare that after a specifieddate these proposals would lapse and we should regard ourselvesas free to make our own plans. We should then begin to carry out a vigorous and effective redeployment of our forces in the middle east.The Minister of Defence suggested that, if negotiations broke down, we should at once begin to dismantle the Base and remove from it everything which could be removed regardless of its value.
sixOverseasInformationServices.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (53) 359) giving the preliminary views of the lord privy Seal, the Minister of Labour and himself on the Report ofthe Drogheda Committee on Overseas Information Services.The Home Secretary said that his Committee intended tocontinue their consideration of the Drogheda Report, but they had thought it right to submit their interim recommendation on the levelof expenditure on overseas information services in the financial year1954. While they had been impressed by the arguments in favourof some expansion of these services, they had come to the conclusionthat in view of the urgent need for limiting Government expenditure at the present time there should be no general expansion of these services in 1954-55. Within the total figure adjustments could bemade between Departments, or between the different services of asingle Department within its own total, so that the best use couldbe made of the money available.The Foreign Secretary said that during each of the last fiveyears reductions had been made in the Governments expenditureon the overseas information services and these successive cuts had produced a damaging confusion and uncertainty about the futureof these services. It was with the object of arriving at some settled and effective policy that the Drogheda Committee had beenappointed. Its members had been carefully selected: they werepeople of mature judgment and experience: they had devoted monthsof study to the problem and they had produced a valuable report which for the first time provided a definite plan for the effective useof overseas information services. These services formed part of ourcold-war strategy and were recognised as such by the Chiefs of Staff,who had expressed the view that the expansion of the services wasnecessary to offset the curtailment in the strength of the armed forces.If the Cabinet were willing to leave cold-war propaganda entirely to the United States, that at any rate would be a workable policy.If, however, we were to continue our efforts we should do so to thebest of our ability and in accordance with the general principles ofthe plan worked out by the Drogheda Committee.This might well take a year. In the meantime we should not reduce our forces by degrees but should, at a time of our own choosing,withdraw them all at the same time in a carefully planned military operation. We should thus keep the initiative and deny the egyptians any opportunity of attacking us during the withdrawalperiod.The Foreign Secretary said that, though some government supporters would welcome the breaking off of the defence negotia-tions, it was not to be assumed that they would also welcome the consequent withdrawal of our forces from Egypt. If we withdrewwithout an agreement, we should have lost the right of return andmight have weakened our influence with other Arab States. It wouldcertainly be possible to bring the negotiations to a head, as the egyptians had refused to accept our formula for the reactivationof the Base and this was the most favourable breaking-point from our point of view. He would wish, however, to consider the variouscourses which were now open to us and the advantages and dis-advantages of each.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to resume their discussion of the defence negotiationswith Egypt on the basis of a memorandum, to be circulated by the Foreign Secretary, summarising theadvantages and disadvantages of the various courses nowopen.
187 CC. 81 (S3)The Colonial Secretary supported the views expressed by theForeign Secretary and stressed the difficulty of countering anti-british propaganda in the Colonies without financial provision for informa-tion officers working under the direction of the United KingdomGovernment. It was, in his view, a false economy to look forretrenchment in these services. In British Guiana, for example, thecost of sending a British battalion might have been saved if informa-tion services had been available in the Colony to counter thesubversive propaganda of Mr. Jagan.The Minister of Labour said that he was in no doubt about thevalue of expenditure on overseas information services, but he con-sidered that, in view of the pressing need for economy, this was notthe time at which to embark upon an expansion of these services.When defence programmes and social services programmes werebeing curtailed, it did not seem justifiable to expand overseas informa-tion services. He believed that within the existing total figure ofexpenditure there could be curtailment of some services which wouldmake it possible to expand the more important services; and it was with this in mind that the Home Secretary&apos;s Committee had recom-mended a greater flexibility in expenditure between departments and within Departments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was unfortunate that the terms of reference given to the Drogheda Committee hadnot invited them to take account of the need for economy. He would find it difficult to agree to any expansion of overseas information services at a time when he was finding it impossible to obtain anysubstantial reductions in the estimates of the spending Departments.He hoped that some redeployment of the services of each Departmentmight bring more effective results without any increase in totalexpenditure.The Prime Minister said that he did not see how an expansion of overseas information services could be defended at a time when most damaging sacrifices had to be demanded from the Armed Forces. Itwas, however, clear that the Cabinet were not yet ready to reach adecision on this subject.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thelevel of expenditure on the overseas information services in 1954.Valuation for 3.   The  Minister of Housing recalled that the  ValuationRating. Department of the Board of Inland Revenue had for some time past been carrying out a comprehensive revaluation of property for ratingpurposes. They had by now reached an advanced stage in theirsurvey. But, before the new valuations could be brought intooperation, certain technical adjustments would have to be made inthe rating system. Legislation would be needed for this purpose;and it would be convenient if that opportunity were taken to provide that the new assessments should not, as on previous occasions, bepublished some months before the new rate was struck by localauthorities but that the two operations should be carried throughsimultaneously.The Cabinet were informed that the Governments legislative programme was already so congested that there would be little prospect of passing this further legislation in the current Session.The Minister of Housing said that in these circumstances it seemed unlikely that the new valuation could be brought into effect
Housing 4.   The Minister of Housing said that, from the number of repairs and amendments which had been tabled, it seemed likely that the LabourRents Bill. Opposition in the House of Commons were planning to adopt a(Previous deliberate policy of obstruction with a view to preventing the passageReference: of the Housing Repairs and Rents Bill.

He would, however, defer proposing atime-table until it was abundantly clear that the Opposition were deliberately applying obstructionist tactics.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Housing.industrial disputes.shipbuilding and engineering industries.(previous reference:CC. (53) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (53) 363) drawing attention to the effects which the settlement reached in the railway wages dispute was likelyto have on the course of wages claims in other industries.The Minister of Labour said that the consequences of a railway strike would have been very serious and the settlement reached was,in his view, a lesser evil. It represented, however, a victory for the extremists; and it would increase the difficulties of dealing with Wagesclaims in other industries. In the shipbuilding and engineering industries the wages dispute was now in an acute phase. Proposalsfor arbitration would certainly be rejected by the trade unions. Itwas useless to attempt the normal processes of conciliation, as theemployers were unwilling to make any offer. Thus, the only actionopen to him was to appoint a Court of Enquiry. Although there wasno possibility of securing unanimous acceptance of this by either side,he believed that it would be welcomed by the more moderate tradeunion leaders and by some of the employers. He would be seeingrepresentatives of both sides on the following day; and, subject to anything that emerged from those conversations, he proposed there-after to appoint a Court of Enquiry under a strong Chairman. It was just possible that this action on his part might lead to a postponement of the ban on piecework and overtime. It might also promote a division of opinion among the trades unions concerned.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the course which the Ministerof Labour was proposing to follow in handling the wagesdispute in the shipbuilding and engineering industries.crichel down 6.   The Cabinet had before them  a memorandum by theEnquiry. Attorney-General (C. (53) 361) on the extent to which Counsel repre-senting the Ministry of Agriculture at the forthcoming enquiry intothe procedure adopted in disposing of a former Air Ministry bombingrange at Crichel Down in Dorset should be instructed to insist uponor to waive the customary privilege of the Crown in regard todisclosure of official documents.before 1956. The Board of Inland Revenue should therefore be advised to plan the completion of the revaluation on that basis.The Cabinet- -Took note of this statement by the Minister of Housing and agreed to consider this matter further at a subsequent meeting.
The Cabinet were informed that about one-third of the formerCrichel Down bombing range had previously belonged to the father-in-law of a certain Commander Marten. It had been acquired atthe outbreak of war under threat of the use of compulsory powersand on payment of a suitable price together with a substantial sum for &quot; injurious affection.&quot; When the range was no longer requiredby the Air Ministry, the land had been handed over to the agricultural land Commission, who had farmed it on behalf of the Ministry ofAgriculture. At a later stage the Ministry had decided to dispose ofthe land and had been advised that, in the interests of food production,it should continue to be farmed as a single unit and for this purpose should be equipped with buildings at substantial expense. Comman-der Marten and others had asked for an opportunity to buy the land,but their applications had been disregarded and it had been decidedto sell the land to the Commissioners of Crown Lands, who had subsequently entered into a binding contract with a certain Mr.Tozer, who had taken possession of the land as a tenant. Theseproceedings had given rise to local accusations of malpractice by officials, and in these circumstances the Minister of Agriculture had announced in the House of Commons on 11th November that a public enquiry would be held by Sir Andrew Clarke, Q.C., with the detailedterms of reference reproduced in paragraph 2 of C. (53) 361.The Minister of Agriculture said that, at a preliminary hearingthat morning, Sir Andrew Clarke had agreed to adjourn the openingof the enquiry from 4th January to 21st April. This would give theGovernment more time in which to consider, not only the difficult questions raised in C. (53) 361, but the wider possibility of modifying the present policy governing the disposal of land compulsorily acquired, but no longer required, for public purposes.The Home Secretary said that a Sub-Committee of the HomeAffairs Committee, over which he had presided, had considered the implications of the forthcoming public enquiry into this matter. Theyhad felt no doubt that the Government must adhere to the decision that a public enquiry should be held, in spite of the difficultiesdescribed in C. (53) 361. On the question of Crown privilege it was his view that the Government should stand by the disclosure of inter-departmental correspondence which had already been made, but should try to avoid making available additional documents, includingDepartmental minutes and advice from officials to Ministers. he recognised, however, that it might be necessary for the Governmentto indicate their readiness to consider on its merits any request forfurther information that might be made as the enquiry proceeded.The Lord Chancellor said that the terms of reference for this enquiry were unusually wide and would make it exceedingly difficult for the Government to attempt to withhold information withoutexposing themselves tq the criticism that they were stultifying theenquiry which they had themselves ordered.The Attorney-General said that, at the preliminary hearing that day, Sir Andrew Clarke had indicated that he would expect to beprovided with all information necessary to enable him to conduct the enquiry effectively.On the question of the policy governing the disposal of landcompulsorily acquired for public purposes, the view was expressed,and found support, that, while no hard and fast rule could be laiddown, it should be generally recognised that, unless there was someclear reason to the contrary, a former owner of land or his repre-sentative ought normally to be given an opportunity to recover hisland when it was no longer required for the purpose for which it hadbeen acquired.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary&apos;s Committee, with the additionof the Lord Chancellor, to continue their investigation bothof the policy governing the disposal of land compulsorily
acquired for public purposes and of the extent to whichadvantage could properly be taken of the doctrine of Crownprivilege in the forthcoming Crichel Down Enquiry, and tosubmit their findings and recommendations to the cabinet before Parliament re-assembled.Japan.Trade with the sterling Area.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 77thConclusions,Minute 7.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer made an oral report on theprogress of the current negotiations with the Japanese on trade and payments questions. Pie proposed that the United Kingdom delega-tion should now be authorised to accept proposals for increased imports of Japanese goods into the United Kingdom to the value of 3-35 millions in 1954. This concession had been made possible byNigeria&apos;s agreement to reduce its demand for Japanese goods in 1954from  15 millions to  10 millions. As regards credit, the Chancellorproposed that the delegation should avoid making any specific offerbeyond suggesting that Japan should continue during the first threemonths of 1954 to buy sterling with dollars from her reserves.The President of the Board of Trade said that these proposals would involve admitting to the United Kingdom about  2 millionsworth of grey cloth for re-export and a quantity of miscellaneousgoods which Japan had been unable to sell here since before the war.This would give rise to some political difficulties; but he agreed thatthese must be accepted in the general interests of sterling area trade.The Cabinet Agreed that in the current negotiations with the Japaneseon trade and payments questions the United kingdom delegation should be authorised to accept proposals forincreased imports of Japanese goods into the United King-dom to the value of  3 35 millions in 1954; and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to instruct the delegationaccordingly.8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President(C. (53) 358) reporting the recommendations of the Committee whichthe Cabinet had appointed on 2nd October to review the basis of theproposed negotiations with the Ethiopian Government for the purposeof securing, for certain tribes in British Somaliland, their traditionalgrazing-lands in neighbouring Ethiopian territory.The Colonial Secretary recalled that in their earlier discussion the Cabinet had been doubtful about the expediency of securing these rights by an.exchange of territory. As a result of the Committee&apos;discussion he was now prepared to adopt a basis of negotiation withthe Ethiopian Government which would not involve any exchange of territory. He would instruct the negotiators to seek, in the first place,an extension of the status quo for a period long enough to give realsecurity of tenure. If this attempt failed, they would be authorised tonegotiate for a 15-year lease of the grazing-lands, either at an annualrent or in return for a capital sum. If neither of these offers was accepted, some territorial exchange might have to be considered; butthe negotiators would not be authorised to offer this without further reference to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals set out in the memorandum annexed to C. (53) 358; and authorised the Colonial Secretary to open negotiations with the Ethiopian Government on thebasis there indicated.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th December, 1953.british somali land.Grazing rights in Ethiopia.(previous reference:C.C.
