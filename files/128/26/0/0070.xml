The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet the draft of thestatement which he proposed to make, in reply to parliamentary questions in the House of Commons that afternoon, on the claim of certain retired Service officers to the restoration of the 9\ per cent,cut imposed on their pension rates in 1935.The Cabinet Approved the terms of the statement which the PrimeMinister proposed to make, subject to verbal amendments suggested in their discussion.Gold. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in the absence of theSoviet Chancellor of the Exchequer, he wished to report an interestingPurchase for transaction in gold which the Bank of England had that morningSterling. been authorised to undertake.  There was reason to believe that theSoviet Government were willing to sell  12/13 millions worth of goldfor sterling without premium. Purchase of this gold, if it could be bought without premium, would be a satisfactory method of increas-ing our gold reserves. And the Russians would doubtless use the sterling for purchases in the sterling area. There was no politicalobjection to this transaction, and it had sound economic advantages.The Foreign Office and the Treasury had therefore authorised theBank of England to make a bid for the gold.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Tneste- 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Italian Government had(Previous        now virtually accepted our proposals for a conference, though theyReference:      were still insisting that, if the conference failed, we should revert toC.C. (53) 67th   the decision of 8th October. This condition he had declined to accept,Conclusions,    on the ground that one should not enter any conference in the minute 3.)       expectation of failure.   The Yugoslav Government had been moredifficult, but he was trying again to convince them that a conferenceoffered the best hope of a satisfactory solution.  He believed thatthere was now a good chance that the conference would take place.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.North atlantic council.Association ofMembers ofParliament withthe north atlantic treaty organisation.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 50thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 320) suggesting measures for building up Parlia-mentary interest in the Atlantic Alliance.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not favour the establish-ment of a Parliamentary body as part of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.). This was primarily an organisation for defence, and the bulk of its work was unsuitable for public discussion.Meetings between Members of Parliament of N.A.T-0. countries could, however, help to promote mutual understanding and to develop the sense of an Atlantic community. He suggested, therefore, thatour representative on the North Atlantic Council should be instructedto make it clear in future discussions on this subject that the UnitedKingdom Government thought it right-(i) to encourage Members of Parliament to interest themselvesin Atlantic co-operation and to increase their contacts withN.A.T.O., e.g., by visits to N.A.T.O. military and civilheadquarters;B 2
television development.(previous reference:CC. (53) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Lord President said that he had been considering whether the proposals in the White Paper on Television Policy mustbe put forward, in the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords,as representing a policy to which the Government were finally com-mitted or whether it would be open to him to promise further con-sideration of alternative proposals which might be put forward inthe debate. He would welcome the Cabinefs guidance on this point particularly as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had said, in apublic speech on 18th November, that the Government had not taken a final view and invited an expression of public opinion on the pro-posals in the White Paper. One alternative plan which was likely tobe advanced in the House of Lords debate was that television shouldbe provided by two public corporations operating in competition with one another but neither deriving revenue from advertisements. Thatsuggestion could be effectively answered by explaining that under sucha system all viewers would have to pay double the present licence fee and only half of them would have the advantage of a secondprogramme. But some speakers might put forward the alternative oftwo public corporations operating in competition, one of whichderived its revenue from advertisements. This could be represented as a reasonable compromise between the varying views held on thisquestion, and he might be able to avoid a hazardous division in the lords if he could promise that the Government would consider it.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that this alternative hadbeen considered and rejected by the Ministerial Committee on Tele-vision Development. It &quot;would have involved an Exchequer invest-ment of  5 or  6 millions in the new corporation, and the Chancellorof the Exchequer had been unwilling to hazard so much public money in a speculative enterprise. Some Ministers had also considered thata scheme on those lines would have had too Socialist a flavour tosatisfy those Government supporters who had originally pressed thecase for commercial television. In these circumstances the lord president could hardly welcome this alternative as a new suggestionmeriting serious consideration: he could, however, make the point that it had not previously been put forward by those opposed to com-mercial television and, while showing no special enthusiasm for it, he might promise that it should be considered further.The Cabinet agreed that in the forthcoming debates in bothHouses Government spokesmen should adhere to the principlesenunciated in the White Paper particularly the principle that anytelevision programmes alternative to those of the British broadcasting corporation should be financed mainly by advertisements, so as to(ii) to welcome the initiative taken by the unofficial conferencesat Oxford and Copenhagen for the creation in eachN.A.T.O. country of ah Atlantic Committee representativeof many sides of national life, including Members of Par-liament, and for the development of an InternationalAtlantic Federation based on these national committees;(hi) to encourage Members of Parliament of N.A.T.O. countries to meet together and to develop an informal association;(iv) to leave the initiative for such meetings to the Members ofParliament, but to authorise N.A.T.O. to help andco-operate.The Cabinet Endorsed the proposals put forward by the foreign secretary in C. (53) 320, and invited him to send instruction in this sense to the United Kingdom representative on theNorth Atlantic Council.
avoid any additional charge to the viewer. On the detailed applica-tion of those principles, however, the Government were not finallycommitted to all the proposals outlined in the White Paper: theywould be ready to adjust the details in the light of public reactions tothe White Paper, as reflected in the debates in Parliament.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in framing his reply to the forth-coming debate in the House of Lords on commercial tele-vision, to be guided by the views expressed in the cabinets discussion; and took note that at their meeting on 26thNovember the Cabinet would have a further opportunity to review the position, if necessary, in the light of the speechesmade during the first day of that debate.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (53) 329) on the forthcoming introduction of a newconstitution in British Honduras.The Colonial Secretary said that the new constitution had been based on the recommendations of an independent Committeeappointed in 1947. Elections under it were due to be held in March1954. He had thought it right to bring this to the Cabinefs noticeas the situation in the Colony had some unwelcome similarities tothat in British Guiana. There were, however, some significant differ -ences, notably that there would continue to be an official majority on the Executive Council. The People&apos;s Party was violently anti-British and, though not known to be affiliated with internationalCommunist organisations, was believed to be supported by theGuatemalan Government, which had Communist tendencies and had for many years pressed a claim to British Honduras. But it was by no means certain that the People&apos;s Party would gain a majorityat the elections: there was a strong Roman Catholic element in theColony which, though inclined to be anti-British, was strongly opposed to anything savouring of Communism. Even if the People&apos;party were successful at the elections, the situation was not likely tobe as serious as that which had developed in British Guiana. TheGovernor could be given emergency powers: there would be anofficial majority on the Executive Council, and departmental respon-sibilities could be withdrawn from the elected members without a breach of the constitution: and the single company of UnitedKingdom troops now stationed in the Colony would be sufficientto preserve order and., to deter any intervention from Guatemala.In these circumstances the Colonial Secretary recommended that nochange should be made in the arrangements for introducing the newconstitution. The dangers of deferring its introduction were certainlygreater than those involved in allowing it to go forward in accordancewith existing plans.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Colonial Secretary. Attention was, however, drawn to the argument in paragraph 8 (b) of C. (53) 329 that, if the introduc-tion of the constitution were delayed, the United Kingdom Govern-ment would be suspected of having changed their liberal policy towards constitutional advance in the Colonies. This consideration,it was suggested, should not prevent the Government from exercisingdue caution in guiding the evolution of Colonial territories towardsindependence or from exercising a restraining influence whencircumstances warranted it.The Cabinet-Agreed that there should be no modification of the plans for bringing the new constitution of British Honduras intooperation in the spring of 1954.
industrial 7.   The Minister of Labour said that the 24-hour token strikeDisputes.        in the shipbuilding and engineering industries was likely to take placeShipbuilding    jn the following week.  It was possible that some at any rate of theand Engineering men would not cease work in response to the strike notice; and thereindustries.       seemed little risk that the strike would be prolonged, as it was now(Previous        so near Christmas. He was not proposing to invite any of the partiesReference:^     to the dispute to confer with him at this stage.  Employers would beCC. (53) 67th   unwilling to make any offer to meet the men&apos;s demands under theConclusions,    threat of a strike.  And, as the workers had decided against askingMinute 9.)       hjm to appoint a Court of Enquiry, there was no reason to believethat, if he appointed one, they would accept its findings.  He there-fore proposed to take the line, in any public statement which he mightbe called upon to make, that intervention by him, for which neither side had asked, would not serve any useful purpose at the presenttime.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour,and approved the line which he proposed to follow for thetime being in relation to the wages dispute in the ship-building and engineering industries.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,24th November, 1953.
