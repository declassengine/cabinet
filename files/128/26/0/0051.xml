DunkirkMemorial.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (C. (53) 243) regarding the form of thewar memorial to be erected at Dunkirk.The Secretary of State for War said that when the Cabinet had discussed this question in February 1952 they had deferred a decision and invited him to raise it again in the summer of 1953. The imperial war Graves Commission would be able to erect from their ownfunds, at a cost of  23,000, a memorial at Dunkirk to the men whodied in the campaign of .1939-40 and had no known place of burial.If, however, it was thought that a more elaborate national memorialshould be erected to commemorate the Dunkirk operation, theCommission would need a grant from the Exchequer of about 77,000.The Cabinet-Decided that the Imperial War Graves Commission should proceed with their proposal for a memorial at Dunkirk,estimated to cost  23,000 and to be paid out of funds available to the Commission.Egypt.defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 50thConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Parlia-mentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C. (53) 249)describing the present state of defence negotiations with Egypt.The Prime Minister said that it now seemed possible that wecould come to some agreement with Egypt on the outstanding points in the negotiations the number of technicians, the duration of theagreement and the availability of the base; but great care wouldbe needed in presenting any such agreement to Parliament and thepublic. The omission of any reference to freedom of transit throughthe Suez Canal would certainly attract criticism, as it was the popularbelief that this was the main purpose of our military base in the canal Zone.General Sir Brian Robertson said that there were still severalobstacles to the conclusion of a defence agreement. Thus, the egyptians had not yet agreed that British technicians in the baseshould wear uniform; they had not accepted our view of the numbersof British technicians to remain after three years; they had not agreedthat it would take eighteen months to withdraw British forces; andthey had not undertaken to go beyond a five-year agreement. Hethought, however, that they might be induced to accept a seven-year agreement made up of (i) eighteen months for the withdrawal ofcombatant troops; (ii) three further years with 4,000 technicians;(iii) two-and-a-half years with a smaller number of technicians orinspectors. They would agree to any form of words which madethe reactivation of the base dependent upon action by the united nations to resist an act of aggression or upon, an attack on anymember of the Arab Mutual Security Pact. They would not, how-ever, agree to automatic reactivation in the event of attacks on Turkey or Persia. He thought it probable that the Egyptians would agree to some reaffirmation, perhaps in the preamble of the agree-ment, of their existing obligations for allowing freedom of transitin the Suez Canal, but he did not think they could be induced toinclude in the agreement any extension or variation of these obligations.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was likely that we should need the help of the United states in persuading Egypt to accept the points still in dispute. The UnitedStates might be less willing to lend this support if we sought toinclude in the agreement any full definition of future rights of transit
Situation in the canal Zone.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 31stConclusions,Minute 8.)through the Suez Canal. They were particularly sensitive on thispoint because of their own position with regard to the Panama Canal.(b) The opinion was expressed that, even if no absolute settle-ment of the Suez Canal problem could be included in the defence agreement with Egypt, there would be some advantage.in getting intothe preamble of the agreement some general formula about freedomof transit through the Canal. This would go some way towardsreassuring public opinion in this country, and it would open the way for fuller negotiations at a later stage in which all interested maritimePowers might take part.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that there no longer seemed to be any serious objection of principle to the conclusion of a defence agree-ment with the Egyptian Government on the general linesnow envisaged by the United Kingdom Delegation in cairo, as outlined in C. (53) 249, if some suitable referenceto the Suez Canal could be included in the preamble tosuch an agreement.(2) Appointed a Cabinet Committee consisting of Lord Privy Seal (Chairman).Commonwealth Secretary.Colonial Secretary.Minister of Transport.Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.together with Lord Leathers and General Sir BrianRobertson, to make recommendations on the points still outstanding in the defence negotiations with Egypt andto consider, in particular, the possibility of including inthe preamble to the agreement an appropriate formulaabout the international rights of passage through the suez canal.(3) Agreed to consider the report of this Cabinet Committee attheir next meeting.The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C. (53) 246) covering a memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff on themeasures that would be needed if the situation in the Canal Zonedeteriorated.The Minister of Defence said that, although the situation in the canal Zone had become easier during the past year, there was always the clanger that the Egyptian Government might stimulate hostileactivities against British troops. Experience had shown that wide-spread security measures were needed to deal effectively with out-breaks of violence and that these measures might have to be put intoforce at very short notice. The Chiefs of Staff had therefore recom-mended that the Cabinet should delegate authority to the PrimeMinister, the Acting Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence,to bring into force the military measures in Egypt which would be needed in an emergency. They suggested also that, if the situation inthe Canal Zone deteriorated, there might be advantage in issuinga formal warning to the Egyptian Government about the maintenanceof law and order.The Prime Minister said that he did not think it necessary forthe Cabinet to do more than take note of the points raised by theChiefs of Staff in their memorandum. If the situation did in factdeteriorate, it might well be desirable to issue a formal warning tothe Egyptian Government, and and at that point it might also benecessary to authorise the Commanders-in-Chief in the Middle east to put in hand widespread security measures; but this situation could be faced when it arose. If the situation deteriorated so rapidly
that a full Cabinet could not be summoned to consider it, the PrimeMinister would take upon himself the responsibility for giving thenecessary instructions. It should not be forgotten that there wereeconomic and financial sanctions which could be applied to Egyptwithout having recourse to active intervention by British forces. Itwas open to us to block Egypfs sterling balances and to control the flow of oil to Cairo.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that Egypt&apos;s useof sterling was already controlled by a severe sterling release agree-ment. So long as there was hope of a successful conclusion to thedefence negotiations, it would be better not to depart from thisagreement, On the other hand, he did not wish at the present stage to consider increasing the extent of economic and financial aid to egypt, as suggested by Her Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires in Cairo.That was a question which could be further discussed as the defence negotiations proceeded.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff(C. (53) 246).3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence (C. (53) 245) seeking approval of the main features of a proposed new Defence Agreement with the Governmentof Burma.The Minister of Defence said that the Burmese government wished to replace the present Defence Agreement (Cmd. 7240 of1947), which was due to expire on 3rd January next, by a new agree-ment on the lines of the draft annexed to his paper. The mainchange would be the substitution of a British instructional team, tohelp with the training of Burma&apos;s armed forces, for the existing british Services Mission, whose functions were advisory. Burmawould continue to procure military material from this country, buther requirements would no longer be scrutinised by British military representatives in Rangoon. The value of the proposed agreement would be insignificant from a narrow military point of view, but onwider strategic, political and economic grounds the Chiefs of Stafffavoured its conclusion. The Burmese would meet the cost of allthat they received under an agreement, and the position of ourinstructional team should be acceptable provided that it was not made subject to Burmese control.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the draft agreement annexed to C. (53) 245 represented themost which the Burmese Government hoped to obtain from an agree-ment, and it should be possible to make the terms of any new agree-ment more acceptable to us during the course of negotiation.The Secretary of State for War said that it was particularly im-portant that the Burmese should be pressed to concede sufficiently attractive terms of service to enable us to staff our instructional teamby volunteers including, if necessary, retired officers and men. Hewould be most reluctant to agree that the team should be staffed toany extent by means of compulsory posting.The Prime Minister said that, in spite of Burma&apos;s unsatisfactoryrecord, the balance of advantage appeared to lie on the side of retaining, if possible, this link with her armed forces. The size of theproposed instructional team should not, however, exceed the size of the existing Mission.
The Cabinet Agreed that negotiations should be undertaken with theGovernment of Burma for the conclusion of a new defence agreement on the general lines proposed in C. (53) 245.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-dent (C. (53) 247) discussing the line which should be taken by theUnited Kingdom Delegation if the question of China&apos;s representation at the United Nations were raised at the forthcoming session of theGeneral Assembly.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, since this memorandum was circulated, Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington had discussed the matter with the UnitedStates Secretary of State. Mr. Dulles was unwilling to accept our suggestion of a resolution postponing consideration of this question until the Assembly had been able to consider the position in the lightof developments resulting from the establishment of a Political Con-ference on Korea. It seemed likely that, despite our representations,he would continue to favour a resolution postponing considerationof this question for a further year. This was the formula which hadbeen adopted in earlier years, when Chinese Communist troops were fighting against United Nations forces in Korea; and public opinion in this country would expect that some account should now be taken of the fact that an armistice had been concluded. It was therefore proposed that, if the Americans insisted on bringing forward a reso-lution in those terms, we should abstain from voting. But our delegation would be in a more difficult position if some otherDelegation put forward, as an amendment, an alternative resolution on the lines of that which we had ourselves suggested to the americans. In that event it might perhaps be difficult for us to abstain from voting on the amendment.The Prime Minister said that he strongly endorsed the statement,in paragraph 5 of C. (53) 247, that it would be unwise&apos; to subjectAnglo-American relations, so soon, to a second strain comparable tothat which arose from our proposal that India should be a memberof the Political Conference on Korea. We should be well-advised togo to great lengths to avoid any further cause of Anglo-Americanmisunderstanding at the present time. It was natural that, after allthe losses and suffering which they had endured in the Korean war,the Americans should feel reluctant to see Communist China take herseat in the United Nations; and we should make due allowance forthe strength of this feeling, which was not likely to be influenced by considerations of logic or expediency.In discussion it was agreed that we should avoid voting against the americans on this question on this occasion. Further attempts shouldbe made, between now and the opening of the Assembly, to find some compromise formula which both we and the Americans could support.The Americans might perhaps be willing to accept a resolution whichwould have the effect that consideration of this question would be postponed for one year or until there had been a settlement of out-standing issues in Korea, whichever was the earlier. If, however,these attempts should fail and the Americans brought forward aresolution proposing postponement for one year, we should abstain from voting. If some other Delegation should bring forward aresolution on the lines indicated in paragraph 2 of C. (53) 247, and the americans decided to vote against it, we should also abstain from voting; for we must avoid a situation in which we and the Americansvoted in opposite lobbies on this question.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to continue the search for a form ofresolution regarding Chinese representation in the united nations which could be supported by both the UnitedKingdom and the United States; and asked him, inparticular, to ascertain whether the United States would support a resolution postponing this question for oneyear, or until there had been a settlement of outstanding issues in Korea, whichever was the earlier.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom Delegation at the general assembly should be instructed that they should in no circumstances vote against the United States delegation on this issue; that they should not vote in favour of aresolution postponing consideration of this question fora full year; and that they should abstain from voting inany circumstances in which this became necessary inorder to avoid an open conflict of view with the UnitedStates Delegation.Farm price review.(previous reference:CC. (53) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the agriculture Ministers (C. (53) 248) recommending that a request from the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.U.s) for a special farm price review should be rejected.The Minister of Agriculture said that the N.F.U.S hoped toobtain from such a review increases in guaranteed prices to compen-sate them for recent wage increases costing  14  millions in a full year. Account had, however, to be taken of the extent to which increased costs would be offset by a relief on feeding stuff prices,which would be lower than had been assumed when prices had been fixed at the last annual review. The net increase in farmers&apos; costs would be, in fact,  8f millions or only  6J millions for commoditiescovered by the review. In these circumstances he and his colleaguesrecommended that a special review should be refused, although thiswould undoubtedly cause some dissatisfaction among farmers andmight give rise to accusations that the Government were departing from the principles of the Agriculture Act, 1947. He hoped thathe might have discretion about the form and timing of any announce-ment. It would be an advantage if this could be associated with anannouncement of the Government^ policy on the prices of cereals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there was little doubtthat a special review could be justified by the terms of the agriculture act and that rejection of the request for it would upset the farmers.While he supported the recommendation of the Agriculture Minis-ters, he must warn his colleagues that, as a corollary, he would almost certainly find it necessary to make rather larger concessions to the N.F.U.S than he would otherwise have made in respect of theprice of cereals and certain other commodities now under discussion.The Cabinet-Authorised the Agriculture Ministers to inform the N.F.U.that their request for a special farm price review could notbe entertained.
industrial 6.   The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, informedDisputes. the Cabinet of the latest developments in the strike called by the(Previous Electrical Trades Union.   A further attempt was to be made, at a reference: meeting at the Ministry of Labour that afternoon, to secure agree-C.C. (53) 24th ment between the two parties to the dispute; but this was unlikelyConclusions, to succeed and, if it failed, a Court of Enquiry would at once be minute 12.) appointed to make a report on all the relevant facts.   It did notElectrical follow, however, that this would necessarily bring the strike to an end.Trades Union. The Prime Minister welcomed the proposal to appoint a Courtof Enquiry. He thought it important that there should be a fullpublic exposure of the new and sinister techniques adopted by thisUnion, in calling out on strike selected workers in undertakings ofspecial importance to the national economy. These innovationsmight with advantage be debated in the House of Commons, when parliament re-assembled, even though the strike was then over.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.The Cabinet. 7.   The Cabinet agreed that, unless urgent business required(Previous an earlier meeting, their next meeting should be held on Thursday,Reference:      17th September.C.C.
