Pakistan. . 1.   The Commonwealth Secretary drew attention to telegramsConstitutional regarding the possibility of early constitutional developments inDevelopments., Pakistan (Karachi tele grams Nos. 1161 and 1176 of 4th and 7th August(Previous and &apos; telegram No. 840 of .5th August&quot; from the CommonwealthReference: Relations Office to Karachi). The Prime Minister had&apos; endorsed theC.C. (52) 103rd views expressed in the outgoing telegram of 5th August, and wishedConclusions, to supplement it by a personal message to the Prime Minister of minute 3.) Pakistan.. The Commonwealth Secretary read to the Cabinet the text of a message which the Prime Minister was proposing to send.The Cabinet- - .Took note of this exchange of telegrams and of the personal., &quot;&apos; message which the Prime Minister was proposing to send to the Prime Minister of Pakistan.Four-power meeting.(Previous .Reference:CC(53) 45thConclusions,Minute 6.)2.   The Lord President said that the Cabinet would now havehad an opportunity to study the terms of the Soviet reply to the invitation, extended to them as a result of the Tripartite Meeting in washington, to attend a Four-Power Meeting of Foreign Ministers todiscuss the future of Germany and Austria. The Soviet reply wasunhelpful, and suggested that StalhVs death had not led to any funda-mental change in Soviet foreign policy. It was evidently designedto exploit such differences as existed between the three western powers. This view was shared by official opinion in Paris. The firstreactions of the State Department were, however, more favourable:they were disposed to favour a reply blandly accepting the Sovietnote and suggesting a time,and place for the Four-Power Meeting.This was a surprising reaction, which appeared to overlook manyof the difficulties raised by the Soviet note; and the Lord president said that he had at first been disposed to bring those difficulties to thenotice of the United States authorities. He and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had, however, had an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Prime Minister on 8th. August. The Prime Minister had thought it would be unwise for us to appear to be suggesting to the americans a more severe attitude towards the Soviet response thanthey would otherwise have been disposed to take. We had notoriginated the suggestion of a Four-Power Meeting of foreign ministers, and there was no need for us to take the initiative in suggesting how best to answer the Soviet response to this invitation.If therefore we wished to draw attention to the difficulties posed bythe Russian note, it would be wiser to do this by putting questions to the Americans rather than by offering positive suggestions regard-ing the form of the reply. The Lord President said that, in the lightof the Prime Minister^ comments, he had prepared a revised draftof his proposed telegram to Washington, and copies of this were handed round at the meeting. Since this was prepared, however, hehad had some conversation with the United States Charge d&apos;Affairesin London and, on hearing from him that the Secretary of State was now returning to Washington, he had said that he would welcome an early indication of his personal views on the matter. It might therefore be preferable to await ah expression of Mr.&quot; Dulles&apos;s views before sending, a telegram on the lines of the draft which he had prepared- . iAs regards the further stages, the Lord President said that, when, the three Governments had reached agreement on the substance ofthe reply to the Soviet note, the detailed drafting could best be under-taken by a small committee of officials; and he was disposed to accept,the American suggestion that this work should be done in Paris.On the question of timing, he had no doubt that it would be expedient to postpone the reply until after the German elections.   The Sovietnote could riot fail to give offence in Germany, and it was unlikelythat the reply of the Western Powers would provide better propagandafor our friends in Germany.44736--2 .   .       &apos; B 2
Suez Canal. 3.   The Cabinet considered a report by the Lord President(Previous ; (C. (53) 227) on the course of the preliminary discussions which had reference: , been undertaken on the possibility of obtaining from the EgyptianC.C. (52) 75th Government firmer guarantees regarding the freedom of navigationConclusions, through the Suez Canal.                                                    1   &apos;Nllllul&quot;&quot; &quot; &apos; The Lord President said that the French Government had suggested that preliminary discussions should be held with the UnitedStates Government before any wider approach&quot; was made to the maritime Powers generally. As a&quot; result it had been ascertained that..&apos; the United States Government would be unwilling to take part in anymultilateral approach to the Egyptian Government on this subject.Their proposal was that at an appropriate moment a singleAmbassador should ask the Egyptian Government to issue a unilateral declaration re-affirming the principle of freedom of navigationthrough the Canal and that the maritime Powers should then takecognizance of this declaration. In his view, this proposal was open... to serious objections for the reasons set,out in paragraph 5 of his report.  He therefore / proposed that,&apos; in concert with the Frenchi Government, we should make a further effort to persuade the UnitedStates Government to join in a&apos;multilateral approach to the Egyptianson this question: We should at the same time make it clear that, ifthey would not join with us in this, we should wish to consult other..   i Commonwealth Governments- and we and the French would hold&apos; ; ourselves free to approach the other maritime Powers.In discussion the question was raised whether the security of the canal and the right of international passage through it, should not atonce be brought within the scope of our current defence negotiationswith the Egyptian Government. Against this it was argued that it: &apos; . ; . would be wiser to keep the two negotiations separate. In the defence negotiations we were seeking facilities to maintain the base in the- .       In discussion there was, general agreement that the reply to the- Soviet note should be deferred until after the German elections.  Itwas also agreed that our object.should be to ensure the success of- this project for a Four-Power Meeting or, if it failed, to make itapparent that responsibility for the failure rested with the Russians.The main difficulty would doubtless be to phrase our acceptance insuch terms as would avoid giving the impression that we acceptedthe premises underlying the arguments in the Soviet note. On this,we might well leave the initiative to the United States Government,so long as we.could be sure that they appreciated the difficulties.There was therefore much to be said for-sending an immediatemessage to Washington on the general lines of paragraphs 1-3 of thedraft circulated at the meeting but deferring the points set out in theremainder of the draft until Mr. Dulles&apos;s personal views were known..&apos;- After further discussion it was agreed that, subject to the PrimeMinisters approval, a telegram should at once be sent to Washington/ suggesting (i) that, the reply to the Soviet note, should be deferred until after the German elections and (ii) that the reply should be anacceptance of a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers, with sugges-tions regarding the time and place of the meeting. As regards theform of the reply, the telegram should say that we awaited theexpression of Mr. Dulles&apos;s views, hut it should make the point thatcare would be needed to avoid giving the impression of accepting the whole of the Soviet thesis.     V1       ,The Cabinet  .   &apos; - - &apos; .Asked the Lord President to prepare a draft telegram&apos;to&apos;.,   - v Washington on the lines indicated in the course of their discussion and invited him to submit this for the PrimeMinister^ approval before despatch.
New Hebrides. 4. The Cabinet had before&quot; them a memorandum by the Lord: ^President, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary(C. (53) 225) recommending that an attempt should be made to reach- an agreement with the French Government on a revision of the 1914Protocol establishing the Anglo-French Condominium over the New. -    . . Hebrides.The Colonial Secretary said that the Condominium had neverworked satisfactorily.   In 1950 the Australian Government had suggested that our responsibilities in the territory might be, trans-ferred to them; but, before practical arrangements could be made,   , for the transfer, they had asked that it should be deferred for at least two years. The Australians; were not likely to accept this responsi-bility so long as the territory had to be administered on the basis ofthe existing Protocol. It was therefore proposed that we should seek to persuade the French Government to agree that the British andFrench resident Commissioners in the New Hebrides should, without commitment to either Government, jointly examine the revision ofthe Protocol, which at present seriously impeded effective administra-&apos; tion. Meanwhile we should tell the Australian Government that wewere making this approach to the French and should try to discoverwhether there was any likelihood of their being prepared in the future to take over our responsibilities in the territory.., 1       ; The Cabinet- ..    &apos;(1) Endorsed the proposals in C. (53) 225.    ; &quot;(2) Invited the Lord President to suggest to the French Govern-ment that the British and French resident Commissioners.; in the New Hebrides should jointly examine, without com-commitment to either Government,  the revision of the- Protocol.. &apos;    ,(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to inform the NewZealand and Australian Governments of this approach,and to try to find out if there was any likelihood that the,     -&apos;     &apos; Australian Government would be willing to take over&apos;      United Kingdom responsibilities-in the territory. iIsrael. -:. - 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (53) 228) covering a draft of a despatch to her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington instructing him to approach/    the United States Government about the role of Israel in the defence-        &apos;      of the Middle East. -Canal Zone fpr a limited period for purposes unconnected with theright of international passage through the Canal. If we were now to argue that the base was necessary to the security of fhe Canal, wecould hardly be content with an&apos;agreement of relatively-short dura-tion. Moreover, it. would be most unwise to introduce a new andcontroversial element into the defence negotiations /at this stage, ifwe could avoid doing so. &apos;        &quot;*    ,   The Cabinet ; ,    ^   .&apos;., -&apos;      (1) Authorised the Lord President to arrange for . a further approach to be made to the United States Government on, , the lines proposed in paragraph 7 of C. (53) 227.(2) Invited the Lord President, to arrange for the preparation of instructions to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo againstthe possibility that the question of further guaranteesregarding the freedom of navigation through the suez canal might have to be raised in the course of the current. defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government.
The Lord President explained that this draft had been prepared in pursuance of the conclusion, reached by the Defence Committee on 6th May, that we should hold secret discussions with the United StatesGovernment and seek to secure their support for our policy regardingthe part to be played by Israel in the defence of the Middle East. Hehad, however, some doubts about the wisdom of making such an approach to the United States Government at the present time. Ifany of the Arab States should learn that we contemplated building up Israel&apos;s armed strength, this could not fail to prejudice our current negotiations with Egypt and might lose us the good will of the arab states. We ourselves were not in a position to offer the financial andeconomic aid which Israel would need if she were to play the partdesigned for her in Middle East defence, and it was doubtful whetherthe Americans could be persuaded to accept fresh commitments inthis area. In any event the facilities we should need in Israel couldhot be finally determined until the!outcome of the Anglo-Egyptiannegotiations was known. In these circumstances he wondered whetherit would not be wiser to hold up the suggested approach to the UnitedStates. Government until further progress had been made with thedefence negotiations with Egypt. -In discussion there was general agreement that, in spite of thevalue of a strong Israeli contribution to Middle East defence, it wouldbe wiser to defer for the time being the suggested approach to theUnited States Government on this matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasised the importance of avoiding any Exchequer commitment for. economic or financial aid to Israel. He wished therefore to reserve his position on the form ofthe approach eventually made to the United States Government onthis matter.The Cabinet- .Agreed that the suggested approach to the United States Govern-ment on the role of Israel in Middle East defence should be deferred until further progress had been made in the defence negotiations with Egypt.Korea.&apos;(previous reference:C.C. (53) 46thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the report of the unified Command in-Korea had now been published, and certainnewspapers, were accusing the Government of bad faith in failing to disclose to Parliament, before it rose, the terms of the declarationregarding the possible consequences of a breach of the armistice.The Minister of State said that, in accordance with the CabinetVdecision of 28th July,- he had explained to the Leader of the Opposi-tion and Mr. Herbert Morrison the manner in which the warningdeclaration would be published and the circumstances which made ifimpossible to inform Parliament of its terms before the beginning ofthe recess. Neither had questioned the propriety of the procedure which was being followed.The Cabinet-  .Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Foreign Office:, to give the necessary guidance to the Press regarding themethod of publication of the warning declaration on thepossible consequences of a breach of the armistice in Korea.Civil Defence.        7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMan-Power.     Minister of Labour (C. (53) 222) reporting the conclusions of a ministerial Committee appointed by the Defence Committee to, V estimate the numbers of whole-time men needed by the police and
civil defence, services in the first year of a future war and torecommend a scheme for meeting this need.The Minister of Labour said that his Committee had cpnsideredmeans of finding the 300,000 additional men estimated to be needed for these purposes on the outbreak of a future war. They had con-cluded that an appeal for volunteers was unlikely&apos; to succeed inpresent circumstances, and that compulsory enrolment for peacetimetraining was not politically practicable. A possible means of meeting a part of the requirement was to allocate some 25,000 men from theRAT. National Service Reserve to civil defence training in 1954 andcomparable numbers in the next few years. These were men who,while required by the R.A.F. for their full two-year colour service,would not be needed for R.A.F. duties during the first twelve monthsof a future war and were not being called up for annual reservetraining. This transfer would, however, require legislation, either inthe Navy, Army and Air Force Reserves Bill or in a separate Bill;and the Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers felt strongly that the introduction of such legislation would invite radical criticism of the National Service Act. The Minister of Labour said that inthese circumstances it might be worth considering&apos; whether all -National Servicemen could not be given some training in civil defenceduties in the course of their two years&apos; National Service.The Home Secretary admitted the difficulties&apos; of introducing legislation but emphasised the gravity of the problem. Those whohad already volunteered for civil defence training in peace were com-mitted to part-time service in war only, and there was no civil defence Reserve in existence to undertake whole-time duties. Atsome stage some solution of this problem would have to be found.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not believe itwould be practicable to introduce in the near future legislation on thelines indicated in C. (53) 222. He was attracted by the idea putforward by the Minister of Labour that all three Services should-give&quot;some civil defence training to their National Servicemen in the courseof their two years&apos; colour service. Although this would not meet theHome Secretary&apos;s desire to have a Civil Defence Reserve availablefor full-time duty on the outbreak of war, it would mean that in afew years there would be a large number of able-bodied men in thiscountry who had had some basic training in civil defence duties. Itcould be considered later whether some of these men could be ear-marked for whole-time civil defence duty in war.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) It might be difficult for the three Services to find time and opportunity to give the necessary training in civil defence during thetwo years of National Service. The. Navy took a very small numberof National Servicemen,, and the Army had cut down their basictraining to the minimum in order to enable National Servicemen toundertake essential duties overseas. . .(b) It was probable.that in the early stages of a war the armed forces in the United Kingdom would have to act in aid of the civil power and undertake what amounted to civil defence duties. Experi-ence had4 shown that they were likely to perform these duties more effectively if they had received even a short period of training.The Cabinet  - ,(1) Withheld approval of the proposal for legislation enabling. 25,000 men from the R.A.F. National Service Reserve tobe transferred to civil defence.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to examine, in consultation&quot;with the Home Secretary and the Service Ministers, the praticability of giving some civil defence training to- National Servicemen in. the course of their two years&apos;service; and to submit a report on this matter to theCabinet,

Atomic Energy 9. The Cabinet had before them a .nqte by the Secretary of theOrganisation. Cabinet (C. (53) 208) covering&apos; the! Report of the Committee which,(Previous under the Chairmanship of Lord Waverley, had worked out a detailedReference: . plan for transferring the responsibility for atomic energy from theC.C. (53) 29th:, Ministry of Supply to a non-departmental form1 of organisation.Conclusions,. They also had before them memoranda by the Paymaster-General,-r/Minute.5.) ; the Minister of , Supply , and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (53) 214, 223 and 226) commenting,on the Report of the WaverleyCommittee.      -/,...&apos; i-The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherthe Atomic Weapons Research Establishment (A.W.R.E.) should betransferred, along with the remainder of the atomic energy organisa-tion, to the proposed new Corporation. This had been recommendedby the Waverley Committee, but the Chancellor ofN the Exchequer
and the Minister of Supply had both expressed, in their memoranda,doubts about the expediency of entrusting to an independent cor-poration the responsibility for the development and production of atomic weapons.The Paymaster-General said that he hoped the Cabinet would accept the findings of the Waverley Committee on this point. TheChairman and members of the Committee had all had wide admin-istrative experience, and two of them had special knowledge of the atomic energy organisation; they had gone into this point with great care and had, in particular, considered all the objections set out inthe memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Supply; and they had come to the firm conclusion that the balanceof advantage lay in favour of transferring AW.R.E. to the proposed new Corporation. The Paymaster-General said that he himself hadno doubt that this was the right solution. Separation of A.W.R.E.from the rest of the project would destroy the whole balance of theorganisation proposed by the Waverley Committee. Separationwould also be wrong in principle.. For it was admitted that the typeof fissile material best suited for industrial use was not the type best suited for use in atomic weapons. A corporation concerned only with the industrial application of atomic energy would be biased infavour of producing the material most suited for industrial use. Therewas, therefore, some risk that, if responsibility for A.W.R.E. remainedwith the Ministry of Supply, the Ministry might eventually feel obliged to create its own facilities for the manufacture of fissile material with the result that, in the end, there would be two atomic energy projects, neither of which could be fully efficient. separation of A.W.R.E. from the remainder of the project was bound to leadto duplication of effort or loss of efficiency. On the other hand,transfer of A.W.R.E. to the new Corporation would not deprive theMinister of Supply of any part of his responsibility for weapondevelopment. The new Corporation would be responsible only forthe development and production of the atomic core for inclusion inatomic weapons; and responsibility for the devlopment and produc-tion of all other parts of the atomic weapons would continue to rest with the Ministry of Supply.The Minister of Supply said that in his view it was unsound todraw so sharp a distinction between the atomic core and the remainder of the atomic weapon. The core was surrounded by a mass of high explosive and by a highly complex system of detonators; and theefficiency of the weapon turned on a high degree of inter-dependencebetween these three elements. It might on this account be concededthat development of the weapon as a whole must rest with theMinistry of Supply, even though the production of the atomic corewas undertaken by the new Corporation. But all experience had shown that it was wrong in principle to divorce development fromproduction; and he would himself prefer to retain responsibility forthe whole of the work of A.W.R.E. His view was determined solely by considerations of efficient organisation. There were, however,other considerations which the Cabinet should not overlook. Thus,the legislation required would be far more controversial if the powersof the new Corporation were to extend to the manufacture of atomic weapons: the Opposition would then be able to represent this as a first step towards the private manufacture of atomic arms. More-over, if the Corporation were confined to the civil aspects of atomic energy and basic atomic research, it would be possible to give theman even greater measure of freedom and independence than was proposed in the Report of the Waverley Committee. There wouldbe no difficulty in practice in requiring the Corporation to produce the quantities of fissile material required for military use; for the division of the Corporation^ effort, as between civil and military purposes, would in any event need to be determined by a CabinetCommittee. For all these reasons the Minister recommended that inthe first instance at any rate responsibility for A.W.R.E. should not
be transferred to the new Corporation. This need not prevent theGovernment from reviewing the position again at a later date, whenthe Corporation had been established.t Discussion showed that the majority of the Cabinet were dis-inclined to abandon the main principle of organisation recommendedby the Waverley Committee. Ministers felt obliged to give great weight to the conclusion reached on this point by a strong committeewhich had gone into the matter in detail and had paid regard toall the considerations advanced on either side of the argument.They were also impressed by the Committee&apos;s conclusion that themilitary effort would be dependent on the industrial and could notbe satisfactorily separated from it. This certainly was true of otherweapons, e.g., aircraft and tanks, whose development would havebeen far less satisfactory if it had been carried out in isolation fromcomparable civilian work. It was inevitable that in time of peacescience and industry should devote their main efforts to civil purposes,and the development of military weapons and equipment was boundto suffer if it were isolated from civilian industry. At the same time,Ministers felt serious doubts about the recommendation of theWaverley Committee that the new Corporation should deal directly with the Service Departments over the supply of atomic cores foratomic weapons. They accepted the view of the Minister of Supplythat the Services were entitled to look to a single supplier for atomic weapons, and that the Ministry of Supply should, as the sole supplier,be responsible for the efficiency of the weapons as a whole. IfA.W.R.E. were to be transferred to the new Corporation there mustbe an effective link between the Corporation and the Ministry ofSupply, and Ministers thought that further consideration should begiven to the nature of that link. It was possible that a satisfactory solution might be found along the lines suggested in paragraph 23 (i)of C. (53) 223, on the basis that the Ministry of Supply, while remain-ing responsible to the Service Departments for complete atomic weapons, would sub-contract to the Corporation the task of develop-ing and producing their nuclear components.After further discussion it was agreed that the general schemeof organisation recommended in the Report of the Waverley Com-mittee should be adopted, but that the Paymaster-General and theMinister of Supply should consider what means could be devised,within that general scheme, of ensuring that the Service departments could look to the Ministry of Supply as their sole supplier of completeatomic weapons.In the course of the Cabinefs discussion the following points were also made:  (a) It would be for the Prime Minister to determine whichMinister should assume general responsibility for the proposed new corporation.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, for the reasonsindicated in paragraph 5 of C. (53) 226, he could not accept thesuggestion in paragraph 54 of the Report of the Waverley Committeethat no financial adjustments should be made between the new corporation and the Defence Departments.The Paymaster-General said that he would be content with any arrangements on this point which could be agreed between theMinistry of Defence and the Treasury.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the salaries paidto senior employees of the new Corporation must not be seriouslyout of scale with those paid by other public corporations.The Paymaster-General said that he&apos; saw no reason why thisshould give rise to any special difficulty.(d) The Waverley Committee had contemplated that the new corporation would not be responsible for the procurement of rawmaterials. The Cabinet thought it would be preferable, however, that
the day-to-day work of procurement should be undertaken by theCorporation subject to suitable arrangements to ensure that theGovernment retained control over negotiations with foreign Govern-ments and over matters of policy involving national security.(e) The Waverley Committee had made no detailed recom-mendations regarding security precautions in respect of staff employed by the new Corporation. The Home Secretary said thatthe responsible Minister would in the last resort be accountable toParliament for these security questions; and he would therefore needsome power to give directions to the Corporation on these matters.Some rights of appeal would also have to be conceded to the staff;and it was desirable that appeals should, if possible, be handled bythe same advisory tribunal which dealt with similar appeals by civilservants. He did not think that the extension of these securityprocedures to staff employed by a public corporation need give riseto any irresistible demand that these procedures should be extendedto private contractors working on secret Government work.The Cabinet (1) Accepted in principle the general scheme outlined in theReport of the Waverley Committee for the transfer ofresponsibility for atomic energy to a public corporation;but asked the Paymaster-General and the Minister ofSupply to consider what means could be devised, within that general scheme, of ensuring that the Service Depart-ments could look to the Ministry of Supply as their solesupplier of complete atomic weapons.(2) Asked the Paymaster-General and the Minister of Supply,in the event of their failing to reach agreement on thepoint noted in Conclusion (1) above, to refer any out-standing differences to the Lord Privy Seal who would,if necessary, reconvene the Cabinet Committee which had previously considered the question whether, in principle,responsibility for atomic energy should be transferred toa non-departmental organisation; and took note that theCabinet Committee, if required to consider any outstand-ing differences between the Paymaster-General and theMinister of Supply, would be able to consult, not only with the Ministers concerned, but with Lord Waverleyand the members of his Committee.(3) Agreed that the result of these further consultations shouldbe reported to the Prime Minister and to the cabinet before the end of August.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask the PrimeMinister to determine which Minister should assumegeneral responsibility for the proposed new Corporation.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theTreasury and the Ministry of Defence to give further-consideration to the financial arrangements mentioned inparagraph 54 of the Report of the Waverley Committee.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th August, 1953.
