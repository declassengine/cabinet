Regency.(previous reference :C.C. (53) 43rdConclusions.Minute 1.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to thefollowing Question by Lieutenant-Colonel Lipton, M.P., for answer on Wednesday, 22nd July:   &apos;&quot;To ask the Prime Minister whether he has yet reached a decision on the introduction of legislation to amend the regency Act, 1937.&quot;Consideration had been given to the possibility of preventingdiscussion by replying on the lines that such legislation would onlybe passed in pursuance of, a Royal Message and that,&apos; as the house would be aware, no such Message had been received. The Houseauthorities had, however, advised that such a line would not be supported by the precedents. The Prime Minister considered thatthe Government should now announce their intention to introduceamending legislation and favoured a reply in the following terms:  &quot; Amendment of the Regency Act, 1937, has been underconsideration since shortly after The Queen&apos;s accession and wasamong the matters discussed with Commonwealth PrimeMinisters when they were here&quot; for the Coronation. It is theGovernment^ intention to introduce a Bill before Her Majesty-  leaves on her Commonwealth tour.&quot; ,An attempt might be made to,secure the- co-operation of the,Leaders of the Labour, and Liberal Parties in limiting the scope ofSupplementary Questions. .   ,The Cabinet expressed their approval of the draft reply and ofthe proposed approach to the Opposition Parties.The Cabinet- &apos;        - 7.        .   &apos; ,(1) Invited the Chancellor of the , Exchequer to reply toLieutenant-Colonel Lipton&apos;s Question inthe termsrecorded above. J(2) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments that this announcement was to be made on the following day.Road and Rail 2.   The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinet that theTransport.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (53) 198) submitting for approval the recommendationsof a Committee under his chairmanship oh the proposed developmentof Gatwick Airport.The Lord Chancellor said that his Committee had concludedunanimously that the case for &quot;developing a &quot;main alternate&quot; toLondon Airport had been fully established; that neither Stansted norBlackbushe, the only practicable alternatives *to Gatwick as the&quot; main alternate,&quot; was in fact suitable for development; and that there-1 &apos; &apos; . B 2
was therefore no alternative to the development of Gatwick in spiteof the heavy cost and the disturbance to local interests, particularly to Crawley New Town. The Committee accordingly &quot;invited theCabinet to confirm their earlier decision that Gatwick should be developed and to approve the immediate publication of the draft white Paper attached to C. (53) 198.The following were the main points raised in discussion:  (a) The Paymaster-General asked whether the need for an alter-hate airport could not be avoided by developing the arrangements fordispelling fog at London Airport.It was explained in reply that these arrangements were not onlycostly but could not be entirely relied upon. In any case a &quot; mainalternate &quot; was required, not only as a diversionary airport in adverse weather conditions, but also to cater for the prospective increase in air traffic.      &apos; ,(b) The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that if thedevelopment of Gatwick could be deferred for a year or so it mightbe a valuable element in a reserve of public works to be undertaken in va period of trade recession.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that the &quot;main alternate&quot;was required to be in operation by 1956-57 and, if it were decided nowto develop Gatwick, work on it would continue for a number of years.In any case the labour force required for its development would notbe significantly large at any stage.(c) The Cabinet were informed that the Secretary of State for&apos;Scotland had asked that the White Paper should contain some assurance to Scottish opinion that the development of Gatwick wouldnot prejudice the development of Prestwick Airport.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that he was ready to include in the White Paper a reference to the fact that the Governmentadhered to their intention to develop Prestwick as Britain&apos;s secondinternational airport.(d) The Lord Chancellor said that the Cabinet might considerthat the sentence beginning &quot; Even if at some future date . . . .&quot; in the paragraph on Blackbushe on page 7 of the draft White Paper wasambiguous and would be better omitted.It was explained that the purpose of this sentence was to make itclear that the fact that Blackbushe was to be developed by the UnitedStates Air Force for use in war did not mean that it could equally wellbe developed for use as a &quot; main alternate &quot; civil airport in peace.It was agreed that this point must be covered in the White Paper butthat the wording of the sentence should be reconsidered.(e) The Cabinet were informed that the Government were com-mitted to holding some form of local enquiry if, as was inevitable,local objections were raised to the proposed development..The Lord Chancellor said that his Committee had accepted theview of the Minister of Housing and the Minister of Civil Aviationthat any enquiry must proceed on the basis that the government&apos;s decision to develop Gatwick was not open to question and that thepurpose of the enquiry was to see whether any adjustments could bemade in the detailed scheme of development to meet local objections.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing, suggestedthat local feeling would be mollified if the White Paper were to indi-cate that,a local enquiry would be held before any final decisions, were taken. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that national policy must be decided before any local enquiry was held and that this should be made clear in the White Paper.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, subject to the points made in. discussion, the Cabinet were in agreement with the recom-mendation that development of Gatwick Airport should now beallowed to proceed.   The proposed expenditure upon it must, of
3^oForeign Affairs. 4. The Lord President gave the Cabinet an account of hisTripartite discussions in Washington with the United States Secretary of State,Meeting. Mr. Dulles, and the French Foreign Minister, M. Bidault. The objects(Previous    ,   which he had set himself to secure from these discussions were:Reference:      (i) to obtain a public reaffirmation of Western Policy on Germany;C.C. (53) 39th   (ii) to give support to the German Federal Chancellor in view of theConclusions,    forthcoming elections in Western Germany; (iii) to bring pressureMinute 3.)      to bear upon the French Government to ratify the European defence community (E.D-C.) and Bonn Treaties before any Four-Power talks with the Soviet Union; (iv) to prevent any embarrassing initiatives byMr. Dulles; (v) to give strength and cohesion to the North atlantic alliance (N.A.T.O.); and (vi) to persuade the Americans to leave theway open for Four-Power talks between Heads of Governments.Generally speaking, these objects had been achieved.   It had been impossible to persuade the French to ratify the E.D.C. Treaty beforeFour-Power discussions, but they were at least committed to it in- ;   1       principle. There had been complete harmony of view on the attitude to be adopted towards the Soviet Union and the satellites and overthe need to strengthen N.A.T.O.   Mr. Dulles had been extremelyhelpful.  It had not been possible to make progress with the sugges-tion that there should be a Four-Power meeting of Heads of governments without Agenda, but agreement had been reached onthe terms of an invitation to the Russians to attend a meeting ofForeign Ministers of - the Four Powers to discuss Germany and austria.Germany. The Lord President said that the Americans had been persuaded(Previous        to join in this offer of a Four-Power meeting on Germany largelyReference:      because of pressure from Dr. Adenauer, and because of rumours that.C. (53) 42nd   the Russians were themselves enquiring whether accommodationConclusions,    could be made available in Switzerland for a Four-Power meeting.Minute l.)       He had done his utmost to get agreement that the E.D.C. treaty should be ratified by the French before a Four-Power meeting washeld; but M. Bidault had made it clear that no French Governmentcould ratify the Treaty in present circumstances, and Mr. Dulles had accepted that position. There was no doubt, however, that Americanpatience was being sorely tried by the delays and hesitations of theFrench, and there.was a real danger that, unless they gave early proof of willingness and ability to take more positive action, the Americans. might withdraw from Europe and rely on a peripheral defence.In discussion on Germany the following points were made:  (a) If Germany was to be unified, it would be best that she should, be unified within E.D.C.; for this would go some way to ensure thatshe did not again emerge as a strong and aggressive independentcourse, remain subject to the normal Treasury scrutiny and he must also stipulate that the Ministry of. Civil Aviation&apos;s expenditure onWorks, Land and Buildings should not exceed  5\ millions in 1954-55and  6 millions in 1955-56.  *The cabinet-- - v(1) Confirmed their earlier decision that Gatwick Airport shouldbe developed as the &quot; main alternate &quot; to London Airport.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air, the Minister of Civil aviation and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Housing, tosettle amendments to the draft White Paper to meet thepoints noted in paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) above.(3) Subject to Conclusion (2) above, approved the draft white paper attached to C. (53) 198 and authorised the Ministerof Civil Aviation to publish it during the course ofthe week.
Power.   The alternatives, were to admit a unified Germany toN.A.T.O., which would leave her free to build up her independent&apos;    * strength and to leave N.A.T.O. when she desired, or to neutralise thewhole of Germany which was a solution unacceptable to the Western,       Allies.&apos;    :,: -   ,-     , &apos; - &quot;   &quot; &apos;(b) In view of American susceptibilities, it would be wiser in theforthcoming debate in Parliament^ to refer only in the most general terms to the need to give the Soviet Union security.    Directreferences to Locarno or the Anglo-Soviet Treaty were likely to be-     misunderstood. . &apos; , &quot;Korea. The Lord President said that there had been no time for a full(Previous        discussion on Korea and the Far East.  These questions had been reference:      considered at a single meeting only, and at that time the reportCC. (53) 40th   of,the talks between the Presidents special envoy and Syngman RheeConclusions,    had not been received.   Mr. Dulles evidently felt, however, that he Minute l.)       had obtained satisfactory assurances from Syngman Rhee aboutthe armistice. Plis idea was that the political conference following the.    armistice should be limited to a period of 90 days and that, if at theend of that time the Communists were making no effort to bring abouta settlement, the conference should be broken off. This was designedto prevent the Communists from protracting the negotiations inter -minably as a cover for building up their military strength in Korea.The Americans, like ourselves, were pledged to seek the unification of Korea, but Mr. Dulles did not expect the political conference to achieve more than a temporary stabilisation on the present divided/ basis. Fie hoped that unification as a neutralised State might follow in five to ten years.  Mr. Dulles did not seem to think it likely thatthe South Koreans would themselves break the armistice conditions,v. especially as the Americans had committed themselves to signing amutual security pact with South Korea and had promised a, large amount of economic aid. If the Communists broke the truce, then he hoped that the United Nations would once again take united action.     &apos; &apos;&quot; to support the restoration of peace and security.&quot; He had suggestedthat, as the communique issued after the Washington talks contained a reference to the consequences of a breach of the armistice, it wouldbe unnecessary to make use of the warning declaration by sixteencountries. Mr. Dulles had been reluctant to dispense altogether withthis declaration, but had undertaken to consider whether it need be published.In discussion on Korea the following points were made:  (a) If the political conference were broken off after 90 days theproblem of Korea would presumably be referred once again to the&apos; Assembly of the United Nations.(b) The question. of the continuation of strategic controls on trade with China had been left open. Mr. Dujles had at one stagesuggested that these controls might.be retained until a final settlementhad been reached in Korea, but it had been made clear to him thatwe could not at this stage agree to so&apos; long a continuance of these. ,        controls.(c) The text of the report of Senator McCarthy^ Committee on trade with China was not yet available, and it would therefore bebetter not to volunteer any detailed answer to its criticisms of UnitedKingdom policy in the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons.It might be possible to make a fuller statement on this in the House ofLords debate in the following week. - \: .Egypt.

He had conferred with the Minister ofState since his return, and he was satisfied that it would be inexpedient,for us to agree to any course which might be taken to imply that. Ibn Saud&apos;s representative, Turki, had any right to remain in Buraimi.In all the circumstances he believed that our best course would beto leave matters as they now stood maintaining our own claims, andconceding none of the Saudi claims, even though this meant that weshould lose the present opportunity&apos;of a reference to arbitration.willing to negotiate on the basis of General Neguib&apos;s proposals. the americans had remained critical of our attitude towards the problemsof the Middle East, which they regarded as reactionary; but, although they had not undertaken to underwrite our proposals, they had in theend agreed to approve the principles underlying them. Ultimately,the President had sent a helpful reply to General Neguib, in whichhe had criticised the weak points.of his plan and had refrained fromselecting points for praise. General Robertson had now returned to cairo, where he was available to resume talks with the egyptian government, either formal or informal; and it might be wise that thisshould be made known publicly. His instructions were to stand firm on the proposals already approved by the Cabinet, but the lord president wondered if the Cabinet would reconsider their earlier view on the duration of any agreement reached with Egypt. The Ameri-cans: had suggested that it would be easier to secure a limitedagreement for a period of ten years.In discussion on Egypt the following points were made:  (a) In view of. the greater degree of co-operation now being offered by the Americans it would be a mistake to make any public statement to the effect that we desired to conduct these negotiationswith Egypt alone and that we would not admit the United States asmediators in the dispute.(b) The question of a tep-year time limit to any agreement reached with Egypt needed further consideration:- Could provisionbe included in it for the renewal of the agreement at the end of tenyears, or was it to be understood that at the end of the period we hadno option but to abandon our position in the Canal Zone?The Cabinet- &apos;  - &quot;(1) Expressed their appreciation of the Lord Presidents efforts in the discussions with Mr. Dulles and M.
