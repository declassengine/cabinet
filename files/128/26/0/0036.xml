2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Colonial Secre-tary&apos;s memorandum (C. (53) 167) on future assistance for colonial development and welfare after the termination of the colonial development and Welfare Acts on 31st March, 1956.The Colonial Secretary said that his intention was to ask colonial governments and other authorities concerned for material on which her Majesty&apos;s Government could decide what further funds shouldbe made available for Colonial development. He hoped that it wouldbe possible to introduce the necessary legislation during the first halfof 1954. He would at the same time wish to assure Colonial Govern-ments that money not spent under the present Acts might be carried forward beyond 1956, and to add that, where it was absolutely necessary, plans could proceed on,the assumption that further funds would be provided by the United Kingdom in due course. This powerof advance authorisation would, however, be limited to a maximum of  7 millions and would only be exercised with the concurrence ofthe Treasury. None of this sum would be spent before 1956. Hewould like authority to make an early statement in Parliament tothis effect, and he would at the same time take the opportunity of explaining the arrangements already made for providing special fundsup to  3 millions for rice investigations in the Colonies.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) The money provided under the Colonial Development and welfare Acts was devoted to development in the public sector e.g., geological surveys, education, public health, &amp;c. and not toprojects suitable for private investment. One of the results of thiskind of development was to attract private investment for commercialenterprise.(b) Only some 30 per cent, of the sterling balances held by theColonies was available for use in development schemes, but theColonies would be urged to make the greatest possible use of their sterling balances so far as the nature and purposes of those balancespermitted.(c) It was suggested that, if British companies engaged in develop-ment in the Colonies were allowed the benefit of colonial taxationreliefs, more private capital would become available for investmentColonialDevelopmentand Welfare.(previous reference:C.C.

Korea  and  would   strengthen  the  hands   of  the   Americans.Meanwhile, it was important that the Commonwealth division in korea should not find itself isolated with a South Korean division on each of its flanks. On one side at least it should be flanked by an american division.The Minister of Defence said that a Brigade Headquarters, two infantry battalions and a regiment of artillery could be brought toa state of readiness in Hong Kong. If shipping were available, itwould take about two weeks to complete the move to Korea. Anadditional battalion, drawn from the ten battalions at present consti-tuting the Commonwealth division, could be added to this Brigadeon its arrival in Korea. He would check the present position of theCommonwealth division. During his visit to Korea about a year agoit had been placed between two American divisions.The Cabinet Agreed that instructions should be given to a Brigade in hong Kong to hold itself ready to move to Korea on receiptof further orders.

The Prime Minister referred to the message addressed to himMessage from   by the Federal Chancellor of Western Germany about the events inthe Federal      Berlin and the need to restore unity and freedom to the whole german chancellor.      people.  He intended, in reply to Dr. Adenauer&apos;s message, to refer(Previous       to the practical proposals put to the Soviet Government in the NoteReference:      from the Western Powers of 23rd September, 1952, which providedC.C.

Hewould add to the reply some complimentary reference to the efforts made by Dr. Adenauer in pursuit of the task which he had defined in his message as one of restoring &quot; unity and freedom to the wholeGerman people in such a way that they may serve the peace ofEurope.&quot;Armed Forces. 4. The Minister of Defence said that the agitation for a revisionOfficers&apos; of officers&apos; retired pay was increasing in both Houses of Parliament.Retired Pay.    There was a strong feeling that justice was not being done to a certain(Previous        class of retired officers, and the Government were losing the good-Reference:      wiu 0f some of their staunchest supporters.   His modest proposalC.C. (53) 28th   was that the 9\ per cent, cut which had been imposed in 1935 should conclusions,    be restored to 359 British officers, and some portion of it to 5,000 orMinute 3.)       6,000 other officers, including retired officers of the Indian (fighting)Services.   The total cost of this restoration would be approximately 200,000 a year and, as &quot;most of the officers concerned were elderly,this sum would rapidly diminish.   He felt that, unless this smallconcession were made, the Government would soon be faced with much larger demands.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The opinion was expressed that to grant this concession would be to open the way for further large demands from various classes of society at a time when it was of critical importance thatdemands for wage increases should be resisted. It was pointed out,on the other hand, that the concessions made on the pensions ofofficers&apos; widows in the previous year had not had this effect. More-over, it could justifiably be argued that the concession was not related to the cost of living, but was simply intended to correct an injustice.(b) The concession proposed conferred far greater benefits on those of higher rank and could be interpreted, therefore, as a departure from the principles of the 1952 Pensions Increase scheme in Colonial development. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatattention had been drawn to this point in the interim report of theRoyal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income; but,although he had by no means closed his mind to providing induce-ments by some form of taxation relief, he would prefer to await thefull report of the Royal Commission in the autumn and to defer any legislation that might be required until 1954.The Prime Minister said that he agreed with the terms of thestatement which the Colonial Secretary intended to make in Parlia-ment, but suggested that he should add some reference to the relatedquestion of attracting private capital and to the attitude taken by theChancellor on the question of tax concessions.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make a statement inParliament in the terms of the draft attached to C. (53) 167,subject to the additions suggested by the Prime Minister.
television development(previous reference:C.C. (53) 35thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Post-master-General (C. (53) 177) covering a.revised draft of the proposed statement of Government policy on television development, andfurther memoranda by the Minister of Housing (C. (53) 178), thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (53) 179) and the Postmaster-General (C. (53) 180).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Governmenfsobject must be to find a course which, on the one hand, would avoidabandoning at this stage their declared aim to introduce a measure of competition into television and, on the other hand, would provide an opportunity for public opinion to become better informed aboutthe questions at issue. The Government could well justify somepostponement of final decisions by reference to the quickened publicinterest resulting from the televising of the Coronation ceremony. Atpresent the nature of the Governmenfs detailed plans for competitivetelevision was largely unknown to the public and was subject to serious misrepresentation. Public opinion might well undergo amarked change when the limited nature of the proposed experiment in commercial television, and the stringent safeguards to which itwould be subject, were revealed. The purpose of the impendingstatement of Government policy should be to make known that theB.B.C. were being allowed to proceed forthwith with certain of their development projects,,, and to state as objectively as possible thegeneral lines on which it was proposed that commercial televisionshould operate, if it were eventually decided to issue the necessarylicences. The kernel of the proposed statement was in paragraph 7of the draft attached to C. (53) 177, which promised a further white paper in the autumn and made it clear that the Governmenfs object was to enable both Parliament and the country to exercise a properjudgment in the matter when the time was ripe.The Postmaster-General expressed agreement with this suggestedcourse of action and readiness to make any necessary modifications to the draft statement which he had circulated. The Cabinet mustrealise, however, that only an immediate decision to proceed with theintroduction of sponsored television would enable it to come intooperation in October 1954, the date mentioned in C. (53) 180. Everymonth&apos;s delay in reaching a final decision would mean a corres-ponding delay in its introduction and the likelihood that, if it wereeventually introduced, the public would be unable to form a reliablejudgment upon its performance before the next General Election.which was designed to apply available funds to the relief of hard-ship. It was pointed out in reply that officers who had served formany years with great distinction and reached high rank in the armed forces deserved greater rewards. Moreover, the case for this con-cession stood by itself and should not be judged in relation to otherpensions schemes.The Prime Minister said that it was evident that the agitation in both Houses of Parliament might well lead to difficult debates andcritical divisions. He suggested that the Chancellor of the exchequer should consider the problem once more and recommend a solution,so that a final decision could be taken by the Cabinet at its firstmeeting in the following week.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor &quot;of the Exchequer to reconsider thequestion of concessions on officers&apos; retired pay and to reportto the Cabinet at its first meeting in the following week.
The Assistant Postmaster-General said that, if a statement ofGovernment policy were made on the lines now proposed, the Gov-ernment would inevitably be pressed to say whether or not they stillstood by the policy laid down in the 1952 White Paper and theOpposition in the House of Commons would certainly insist on a debate. The proposed statement should in his view be designed to reassure Government supporters and inform public opinion before such a debate took place.Further discussion revealed general support in the Cabinet forthe making of an objective public statement of the kind outlined bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer. This statement should indicate noweakening in the Governments attachment to the principle of introducing an element of competition into television but should suggest that the time was not yet ripe for taking final decisions on thevarious issues arising.- It should be designed to remove miscon-exceptions, to allay anxieties by explaining the limitations and safeguardsto which competitive television would be subject, and to provide a firm foundation on which public opinion could exercise a soundjudgment in due course. So far as possible, the Government should avoid incurring fresh commitments of any kind at this stage.Paragraph 7 of the draft statement attached to C. (53) 177 appeared toleave the position conveniently open and did not rule out the sub-mission of the issue to a free vote in the autumn if, when the time came, that appeared to be the most appropriate course. If: theOpposition in the House of Commons were to table a Motion onsponsored television before the recess and force it to a division, itshould be possible for the Government to rally Government sup-porters by moving a suitable amendment based on this policy. Itshould also be possible to avoid a division on the main issue in theHouse of Lords where opinion was undoubtedly hardening againstcompetitive television.The following detailed comments on the draft statement attachedto C. (53) 177 were made in the discussion:  (a) Instead of saying in paragraph 3 that the government intended &quot; that the B.B.C. should have a good start,&quot; it would bebetter to indicate that it was the intention that no one should have access to an alternative programme until the great majority of peoplehad access to one.(b) The President of the Board of Trade asked that para-graph 6 (iii) should be omitted, the point in question being reservedfor consideration in connection with the draft of the proposed white paper.(c) It was suggested that the reference in paragraph 6 (vi) to thetelevising of religion and politics would be better omitted from any public announcement to be made at this stage.(d) Generally, the&apos; language of the draft statement should bemade more conditional-for example, &quot; may &quot; should be substitutedfor &quot; will &quot; in line 4 of paragraph 7.The Prime Minister said that he remained in favour Of allowing the main issue to be decided by the free vote of Parliament. Thiswas the traditional course in relation to matters of conscience. Theissue was one on which the Government were not committed bytheir election pledges and it would be regrettable if they were defeatedupon it or only carried their proposals by a narrow majority. Ameasure of delay was clearly desirable in order that public opinion might form a sound judgment on the basis of the facts, and thematter was not of such a kind that delay would be in any way injurious to the country. Nothing should be said publicly which would preclude the Government from resorting to a free vote if they should wish to do so at a later stage.
The Cabinet Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Lord Privy Seal and theMinister of Housing, to revise the draft statement attachedto C. (53) 177 in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and tosubmit a final draft for the Cabinefs approval.Parliament. 6.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th June. 1953.
