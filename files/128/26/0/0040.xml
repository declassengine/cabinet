Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of Hong Kong-(Previous had expressed concern at the decision to hold a Brigade in Hong KongReference: ;in readiness to move to Korea.   He feared that this would causeC.C.(53)3^ . serious alarm in the Colony,, The Colonial Secretary asked whetherConclusions,&quot; . the situation in Korea still demanded the alerting of this Brigade.- The Minister of Defence said that the Brigade was now at short notice to move and that, from the point of view of the troops, this situation could, not continue indefinitely. He suggested .that in &apos;present circumstances the Brigade could be stood down and that,if the situation in &quot;Korea changed again, it.-should be alerted once more. He emphasised, however,.that overseas garrisons must be - &apos;,regarded as part pf a strategic reserve available for use where opera-tional urgency required, and not as firmly committed to one particular area.   &apos;It was the general view of the,Cabinet that there was no longer any need to hold the Brigade in Hong Kong at short notice to move,but that we should pot withdraw the offer to make it available if required.&apos; /\ v. &apos;The Cabinet-^-1 i      . - ,1 -       Agreed that it was no longer necessary to hold a Brigadein Hong Kong at short notice to move to Korea,.and invited- the Minister of Defence and the Colonial/Secretary to, give instructions accordingly.   &apos;    &apos;; - ,        .    .
East-West 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the&apos; Colonial,Trade. Secretary, the Secretary of.State for Co-ordination, of Transport, FuelBritish Shipping and Power, and the Minister of Transport (C. (53) 176) regarding thein the China - enforcement in the Colonies of the Order. made earlier in the yearTrade. under Defence Regulation 46 to regulate the employment of British&apos;(Previous        ships in trade with China or North Korea.Reference: The Cabinet were informed that this Order extended to ColonialC.C. (53)35th   ships, but.proceedings for contravention of it could be taken only in conclusions,.   the United Kingdom; and in the event of an offence by a ship operated. Minute 5.)      and, managed from a Colony, there might be no one in this country against whom proceedings could be taken. This situation might have/    &apos; .  been remedied by an Order in Council under Section 4 (2) of the; ,       Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939,. providing that persons, offending against the Order might.be apprehended, tried and punished- .&apos;; in the Colonies. The Law Officers had, however, advised that it was open to doubt whether there was still power to make, an Order inCouncil under-that section; and, if this course were not open, the,only alternative was to&apos;introduce special legislation empoweringColonial courts to enforce this licensing control. .In discussion there was general agreement that the introductionof special legislation for this purpose should, if possible, be avoided.
Egypt- ,4.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Lord Presidents (Defence memorandum (C. (53) 190) on the proposals which might be put&apos;Negotiations, forward on the resumption of the defence negotiations with the(Previous Egyptian Government.   They also had before them a note by the..Reference: , Prime Minister (C. (53) 192) covering a memorandum by GeneralC.C. (53) 39th Sir Brian Robertson on certain aspects of the proposed defence agree-Conclusions. ment, and a note by the Lord President (C. (53) 196)&apos; covering a reportMinute 3.) from the Prime Minister of Pakistan on his recent discussions on thissubject in Cairo.                j.The Lord President said that in the light of the Cabinefs dis-cussion on 6th July he had considered further what words might beused in the agreement about our rights, to the use of the Canal ZoneBase in war. He now proposed That the following formula should besubstituted for paragraph (iii) of Alternative I as set out inC. (53) 190: &quot; In the event of a major war, or aggression or threat of aggression against Egypt by an outside Power, the base area shall beat the full disposal,of the contracting parties. An aggression, or threat:. of aggression, by an outside Power against Turkey, Persia or any Arab&apos;: State shall be regarded as a threat of aggression against Egypt for thispurpose.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that, this formula might be inter-preted as meaning that in certain of the circumstances envisaged inthe first sentence the base would be available only to the Egyptiansand not tc ourselves. In fact, what we desired was to ensure that&apos; the basf? would always be made available to. us in a war in whichwe were involved; but it was recognised that the Egyptians wouldbe unwilling to accept any form of words which made this explicit.: After discussion it was agreed that it would be helpful from thispoint of view if the concluding words of the first sentence of the new. &apos; formula were amended to read &quot; the base area shall be at the fulldisposal of both the contracting parties,&quot;&apos;. NThe Cabinet- . &apos;(1) Agreed that the following should be substituted for para-&apos; v    I &apos;&apos;.v graph (iii) of Alternative I in C. (53) 190: .&quot;In the event, of a major war, or aggression or threat of aggression,The Attorney-General said that, while it was open to doubt whetherthe power still existed to make an Order in Council under Section 4 (2)of the Act of 1939, it was possible that, if such an Order were made,its validity would not be challenged by a Colonial court. It was thegeneral view of the Cabinet that the risk of such a challenge shouldbe accepted. .The President of the Board of Trade said that, if such an Orderin Council were to be !made, it might, with advantage extend to pro-ceedings for contravention of the proposed controls&quot;over transactionsmade abroad for the despatch of goods to China or North Korea.The Cabinet  &apos; , ,(1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to take the necessary steps for the, making of an Order in Council under Section 4 (2)of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, 1939, enablingproceedings to&apos;be taken in the Colonies for contraventionsof the Order under Defence Regulation 46 regulating theemployment of British ships in trade to China or north korea.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider, in consultationJ with the President of the Board of Trade, whether this order in Council could be so framed as to extend to theproposed controls over transactions made abroad for thex/, despatch of goods to China or North Korea.
European      .&apos;      5.   The Lord President said that the French Ambassador had-Defence       :;i called on him that morning to say, apparently under instructions, that community.     his Government, while favouring the proposal for a Four-Power(Previous        Meeting and continued co-operation for the defence of WesternReference:      Europe, would have great difficulty in proposing the early ratificationCC (53) 39th   of the Treaty establishing the European Defence Community (E.D.C.)Conclusions, .   how that the prospect of a united Germany had been reopened.  the minute 3.)       Lord, President had said in reply that the French Foreign Ministermust expect to be strongly pressed, in the/forthcoming talks, in washington,, to do his utmost to secure the early ratification of theE.D.C. Treaty. . , &apos;       .This communication from the French Government suggested,however,, that the prospects&apos;of early ratification of the Treaty were&apos;     . not bright. . -i .. - ;  .The Cabinet-&apos; ,    v. &apos;&apos;       &apos; -,     ; . . Took note of this statement..&apos;Treaty with 6.   The Minister of State recalled that our interim agreementsLibya. with Libya would expire at the end of July and that, if we wished to(Previous        maintain our position in Libya, a permanent treaty must be concludedReference:     &quot;before the end of the month.  It was of great political and strategicC.C. (53) 14th   importance that we,should maintain bur influence in Libya.   FromConclusions, ,. the discussions which he had held with the Libyan Prime Minister,Minute 5.)       who was now in London, it was clear that a twenty-year treaty couldbe concluded if we were prepared to make some concessions to the libyan point of view, particularly on the removal of British troops from their existing installations in Tripoli and Benghazi.&apos; The Secretary of State for War said that the Chiefs of Staff had considered hitherto that.we ought to ^maintain an armoured brigadein Libya; and, if we were compelled to abandon within five yearsour existing barracks and workshops &quot;in the towns, we should be&apos; unable thereafter to maintain a force of.this size in Libya., It was estimated that the cost of building the necessary accommodationoutside the towns might total as much as  20 million; and, even if/ . we were prepared to incur this expenditure, the limitations of localresources would make it difficult to carry out more than about 1 million of work a year. It thus appeared that we should be compelled to rest content with a smaller garrison than that which theChiefs of Staff had previously considered to be the strategic minimum.The Secretary of State,for Air said that the immediate need of*      the Royal Air Force was to secure facilities for the redeploymentin Libya of the two or three squadrons which were likely to be with-.   drawn from Egypt.  Their&apos; long-term requirement was for a base atEl Adem and for staging facilities at Idris airport. It was not thought.   i&apos;     that, there would be difficulty in securing these facilities.&quot;    against Egypt by an outside Power, the base area shall,be at the full disppsal of both the contracting parties. an aggression, or threat of aggression, by an outside Power&apos; against Turkey, Persia or any Arab State shall be regardedas a threat of aggression against Egypt for this purpose.&quot;(2) Invited the Lord President, in his forthcoming visit to, -     Washington, to seek to persuade the United StatesGovernment to support us in reopening defence negotia-&quot; tions with the Egyptian Government on the basis of theproposals set out in Alternative I. in C. (53) 190 amended in accordance with Conclusion (.1) above.
,5 ;&apos;&apos; &apos; ..&quot; 21 C.C. 40 (53)  .- In further discussion it was pointed out that the size of the british garrison in Libya should not be finally determined in advance of decisions ,on our long-term strategy in the Middle East. While it. was&apos; important to secure the right to station British troops in Libya,&quot;this should be done in such a way as to avoid pre-judging ultimatedecisions about the number of troops which we should wish, to keepthere. The Minister of Defence said that the size of the garrisonwould be determined largely by the amount of accommodation avail-able, and it seemed unlikely that we should be able to persuade the libyan Government to allow, us to retain existing accommodation,&apos;- or be willing to find the money to build new accommodation,sufficient to provide for forces as large as those which the Chiefs ofStaff had hitherto wished to maintain in this .area.&apos; The Cabinet  . .(1) Recognised the importance of concluding a permanent treaty with Libya before the expiry of the interim agreementsat the end of the current month.(2) Authorised the Minister of State, in his current negotiationswith the Prime Minister of Libya, to get the best agree-&apos; ment he could about the retention of existing military  ,   ;,   \ installations in Libya. &apos; &apos;    &apos; &apos;(3) Agreed in principle that the ultimate size of the British\ &apos; - &apos;  garrison in Libya would have to be, determined by the capacity of the existing installations which we were ableto retain, and the amount of expenditure which we wereprepared to incur in constructing alternative installations&apos;outside Tripoli and Benghazi; and invited the Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer, in consultation with the service ministers, to settle a limit for works expenditure on behalfof the Services in Libya in future years. -(4) Took note that the. Chancellor of the Exchequer would deter-&apos; mine later, in consultation-with the Minister of State, the&quot;amount of the subsidy payable to the Libyan Government.&apos;;&apos;.&apos;      &apos;   under the&apos; Treaty.        ,    .   &apos;.(5) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit to the Cabinet indue course an appreciation of the future, deployment of;British forces throughout the Middle East.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,8th July, 1953.
