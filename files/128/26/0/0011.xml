Parliament. . .        l.   The Cabinet were informed of-the business to be taken in..... the House of Commons in&apos;the following week.The programme proposed did not meet all the requests of the..&apos; . . Opposition, who had asked for a half-day debate on the export ofjet aircraft. But it was likely that, after the statement which theForeign Secretary was to make that afternoon, the Opposition would ask that facilities.should be given for a debate on the future of theSudan. If so, this debate could be held on 18th February; and theexport of jet aircraft could be .left to be debated on an eveningadjournment. &apos;.1 -The Coronation.Seating in theAbbey,    (.(Previous &apos;.Reference:C.C.

The Cabinet were informed of the results of the preliminaryenquiries made in pursuance of their decision of 13th Novemberregarding the allocation of the- seats available in Westminster Abbeyon Coronation Day for Members of Parliament and their wives. Thenumber of Members who had taken advantage of the alternative offer of seats outside the Abbey was such that it would be possible to allocate the seats available inside the Abbey without recourse to a ballot.. -
Civil Service. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum  by thePolitical - Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (52) 327) submitting proposals for activities. amending the rules governing the political activities of members ofthe Civil Service.This question had been reviewed by an independent Committee,under the Chairmanship of Mr-. J. C. Masterman, appointed by theprevious Government.   The Committee&apos;s report, published in June1949, had provoked strong protests from the Staff Side of theCivil Service National Whitley Council; and the previous Govern-fnent had initiated discussions, through the machinery of the whitley council, to see what modifications of the Committee&apos;s proposals could be devised for submission to Ministers.   The report of theCouncil was annexed to C. (52) 327.   This accepted the general principle of the Masterman Report that certain grades in the CivilService should have complete political freedom, while other gradesshould abstain from any public expression of views which mightassociate them with a political Party; but it introduced the furtherrefinement of an intermediate class which would be eligible for partialfreedom to engage in political activities to an extent to be determinedby particular Departments.   The recommendations put forward onbehalf of the National Whitley Council had been agreed between thetwo sides, save for two minor recommendations by the Staff Sidewhich the-Official&apos;&apos; Side had&apos;been unable to accept, viz!, (i) that juniorexecutive grades and analogous grades should be included in the intermediate category, and (ii) that all Civil Servants should be free to canvass, in Parliamentary- or local government elections.   The. Chancellor of the Exchequer recommended that on these two points- the reservations of the Official Side should be upheld/In discussion it was pointed out that the special rules mentionedi in paragraph 15 of the report annexed to C. (52) 327 would also have- to be applied in the Scottish Departments corresponding to the ministries of Housing and Eocal Government, Education and Health.
The Cabinet (1) Accepted, subject to Conclusion (2) below, the schemerecommended by the. Civil Service National whitley council for regulating the political activities of CivilServants.(2) Rejected the proposals of the Staff Side of the Council on(i) the inclusion of the junior executive grades andanalogous grades in the proposed intermediate categoryand (ii) canvassing.(3) Authorised the Chancellor of the, Exchequer to inform theLeaders of the Labour Opposition, in confidence, of these new rules for regulating the political activities of CivilServants.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for these new rules to be promulgated in the form of a White Paper.5. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that the National Coal Board and the National Unionof Mineworkers were expected to reach agreement that day on theminers&apos; wages claim and, in that event, the Chairman of the coal board would forthwith hold a Press Conference at which he wouldstress the urgent need for increased productivity in the industry. Asa result of the discussions held since the Cabinet had considered. thematter on 10th February, it was now proposed that the Coal board should be authorised to raise coal prices by the full 10 per cent,estimated to be required, with effect from 2nd March. An annourice-ment to this effect would need to be made by the Board not later than20th February and it was proposed that this should be on the linesof the draft which had been handed round at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting.The Minister of Labour said that, while he did not wish to raisefurther objection to the course proposed, he felt bound to warn hiscolleagues that his arguments for avoiding any increase in the cost-of-living index had been reinforced by the decision taken by theEconomic Committee of the Trades Union Congress on the previous day to urge upon the Chancellor of the Exchequer the importance of preventing anyancrease in living costs. When account was also taken of recent and prospective increases in the numbers of unemployed,he could not view the prospects of industrial relations in the latter part of 1953 without considerable apprehension. It was, in his view,important, in presenting to the public these increases in miners&apos; wagesand in coal prices, to avoid emphasis on the automatic reflection of increased wages costs in increased prices, since this would tendto weaken the hands of employers in conducting future wage negotiations.In discussion it was suggested that the closing words of the draft announcement should be amended to make clearer the extent to whicha 10 per cent, increase in coal prices was expected to eliminate theNational Coal Board&apos;s accumulated and accruing deficits.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the National Coal Board should be authorisedto increase coal prices by 10 per cent, from 2nd March.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for. Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and other Ministers concerned, to recon-., sider in the light of the discussion the wording of the,draft/announcement of this decision..&apos; :   . .   % :
Steel Prices. 6.   The Minister of Supply said that it was very desirable that(Previous        any announcement of increased coal prices should be followed as soonReference:    &apos; as possible by an announcement of the consequential increases inC.C. (52) 17th   steel prices.   In 1952 the steel industry had been prevented fromConclusions,    recouping itself for increased production costs to the extent of someMinute 8.)        19 millions, and the future health of the industry required that onthis occasion it should be free to pass on the whole of the additional cost of its coal. The high profits recently earned by the industry hadbeen based mainly on high export prices, which were now tending to decline; and, if extraneous engineering activities were left out of account, the industry&apos;s profits were by no means excessive.   Thefuture development plans of the industry assumed that  30 millions would be amiable annually from earnings for the purposes of capital- developmc, - The Cabinet considered that all the relevant facts should be more closely examined before a decision was taken in this matter.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Supply to submit to,the economic policy Committee a memorandum setting out in full the case, , for increasing steel prices as a result of the proposed increase&apos; in the price of coal.Government 7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-Organisation, cellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 54) inviting them to decide in principleMinistry of that the functions of the Ministry of Pensions should be distributedPensions. between the Ministry , of National Insurance and the Health:, Departments. .The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfied thatthis change could be justified on grounds both of economy and of efficient organisation. It might, however,, if announced alone, giverise to.some political criticism. For this reason he would prefer to announce it in conjunction with other changes now under considera-tion, namely the amalgamation of the Ministry of Transport and theMinistry of Civil Aviation and certain adjustments in the regional organisation which had been created during the war by various departments. He hoped that, in four to six weeks&apos; time, all theseproposals would have been carried to a stage at which they couldbe embodied in a single announcement. Meanwhile, it was important that there should be no premature disclosure of the plans affectingthe future of the Ministry of Pensions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the functions of the Ministry ofPensions should be distributed between the Ministry of. National Insurance and the Health Departments, as pro-posed in C. (53) 54.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to&apos; announce,this change in due course in conjunction with the other changes in Government organisation now under considera-^   tion which he had mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion.National Health 8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofService. the Exchequer (C. (53) 58) on the composition and terms of reference(Previous of the Committee which was to review the cost of the National HealthReference:      . ServiceConclusions The President of the Board of Trade said that he doubted whetherMinute 7.) &apos;     tlie revised terms of reference set out in C. (53) 58 made it sufficiently
clear that the task of the Committee was to find means of reducing thecost of this Service. ;.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 3 of C. (53) 58 regardingthe composition of the proposed Committee on theNational Health Service.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle the precise terms of reference for the Committee in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade and the health ministers.Heraldic Arms 9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-for Wales. tary. (C. (53) 53) reporting the findings of a Committee of the privy council which had been appointed to consider how the desire forsome further heraldic recognition of Wales could best be satisfiedwithout&apos;any alteration in the Arms of the United Kingdom. The Com-mittee had recommended that the existing Royal Badge for wales should be embellished by enclosing it in a scroll surmounted by a royal&apos; Crown.The Home Secretary said that the Badge had been recognisedsince 1801; and the embellishment now proposed would go some wayto meet the desire of Welsh people for some further heraldic recogni-tion of the Principality i He desired to ascertain his colleagues&apos; viewson this recommendation informally before it was submitted to her majesty.The Minister of Food said that the Welsh people would have preferred some recognition of Wales in the Royal Arms, but the pro-&apos;posal put forward in C. (53) 53 would go some way towards meetingWelsh feeling in this matter.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that further considera-tion should be given to the suggestion, put forward in paragraph 10of&apos;C. (53) 53, that the proposed Badge might be added to the flags of welsh regiments.&apos; No corresponding privilege had been accorded to scottish regiments.i The Cabinet (1) Expressed informal concurrence in the view of the Com-mittee of the Privy Council that the desire of the peopleof Wales for further heraldic recognition of Wales coiildbest be met by embellishing the existing Royal Badge for wales with a scroll surmounted by a Royal Crown, asproposed in C. (53) 53.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would take The Queen&apos;pleasure on this proposal informally before it was for-mally submitted for Her Majesty&apos;s approval.Education.(Previous;Reference:C.C. (52) 45thConclusions,Minute 2.)Expenditure onadult studies.10. The Cabinet, had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (53) 57) regarding a proposed reduction inthe grants made to unofficial bodies providing facilities for adulteducation in subjects such as economics, literature, psychology andthe arts.The Minister of Education said that the publicity given to this,proposal had resulted from a premature and unauthorised disclosureby one of the unofficial bodies concerned. In consequence the pro-posal had not been fully explained to the public and had attracted
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th February, 1953.undeserved criticism. In preparing this part of their Estimates theMinistry was bound to hold some confidential discussions with the unofficial bodies concerned before the Estimates were officially sub-mitted to- the Treasury; and this inevitably involved some risk ofpremature disclosures which were embarrassing to the Government.On this occasion the unofficial bodies concerned had asked that adeputation should be received to discuss, the proposed reductions;and it should be possible to arrange for a public statement to be made after the deputation in, which the. unofficial bodies would join indeprecating the premature publicity which had been given to theseproposals.In discussion it was pointed out that the fees charged for these courses were often very low. There was no reason why the proposed reduction in the grant need result in.the abandonment of the courses.There should be no difficulty in. making good the difference by a moderate increase in the fees. ,     - .. v : ..;The Cabinet-..- -   , : Took.note of C.
