7**3 S1. The Cabinet considered the latest developments in british guiana.The Colonial Secretary said that it had hitherto been intended that, as soon as British troops were deployed in the territory, theGovernor should take the following action:  (i) assume emergency powers under the Order-in-Council madeat Balmoral on 4th October;(ii) remove  the Ministers&apos;  portfolios under  the emergency powers;(hi) publish a statement of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policyand announce the intention to suspend the constitution;(iv) arrest the leaders of the People&apos;s Progressive Party.Suspension of the constitution could not be effected without Parlia-mentary action at Westminster and must, therefore, await thereassembly of Parliament. Under the emergency powers now avail-able, however, the Ministers could in the meanwhile be relieved oftheir responsibility, although they would technically remain Ministersso long as the constitution remained in force.The Royal Welch Fusiliers had now landed at Georgetown.Their reception had been friendly and the situation in the town was entirely calm. In these circumstances the Governor had urged that,while action under (i)-(iii) above should be taken as planned, noarrests should be made unless there were further developments inthe situation. He (the Colonial Secretary) remained of the opinionthat there was ample justification for immediate arrests, but he agreedthat it would be inexpedient to make the arrests at the presentmoment, when there had been no public disorder in the Colony. Hehad, therefore, with the Prime Ministers approval, instructed theGovernor to proceed with the action summarised in (i)-(iii) abovebut to await developments before making any arrests and, if possible,to refer to him before making them (Colonial Office telegram No. 78to Sir A. Savage of 8th October).The Prime Minister said that he had no doubt that this was theright course. Removal of the Ministers&apos; portfolios and suspension of the constitution could be abundantly justified on the ground that ministers had been given a fair trial but had demonstrated that theirmanagement of the Colony&apos;s affairs could only lead to its ruin. Itwould, however, be very much harder to justify arresting and detain-ing men who would of necessity remain Ministers for the time beingif they were not to be charged with any specific offence and conditionsin the Colony remained quiet.There was general support in the Cabinet for the course whichit was now proposed to follow, although it was recognised that this might well make it necessary for the troops to remain in the territoryfor a longer period. It was also recognised that, if the ministers were left at liberty after being relieved of their functions, they wouldbe likely to make as much capital as they possibly could out of theposition and might seek to stir up disaffection by agitation andpossibly strike action. While it was agreed that it would not bepolitic to arrest them at the moment, Ministers considered that theyshould not be allowed indefinitely to flout the Government of theColony and Her Majesty&apos;s Government before the eyes of the world.The Minister of Defence asked whether the battalion of Argylland Sutherland Highlanders which was about to leave this countryfor Georgetown should still proceed thither or be diverted to Jamaica,and whether the move of the battalion of the GloucestershireRegiment, which was due to sail from Liverpool on 14th October forJamaica, should be cancelled.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the instructions sent to the Governor of british guiana in Colonial Office telegram No. 78 of 8th October.British Guiana.(previous reference:CC. (53) 55thConclusions,Minute 1.)
23CX. 56 (53)(2) Agreed that the projected move of the Argyll and SutherlandHighlanders to Georgetown should proceed on the under-standing that they could be diverted to Jamaica en routeif the development of the situation in British Guianaappeared to justify this course.(3) Agreed that no overt action should be taken for the timebeing in regard to the proposed move of the FirstBattalion of the Gloucestershire Regiment to Jamaica, onthe understanding that the position should be reviewed in three to four days&apos; time.Trieste. 2.
