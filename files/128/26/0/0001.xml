Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 107thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 6) summarising the latest developments which hadtaken place in the Persian oil dispute, as a result of conversations in tehran between the United States Ambassador and Dr. Musaddiqand discussions in London with Mr. Byroade of the State Department.The Foreign Secretary said that in some respects these develop-ments were encouraging. Dr. Musaddiq was now ready to agree that compensation should be determined by arbitration of the Inter-national Court of Justice under terms of reference based on anyEnglish nationalisation law; and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company(A.I.O.C.) were willing that the arbitration should be based on the.principles laid down in the Coal Nationalisation Act. The proposed terms of reference were set out in the Annex to C. (53) 6. AlthoughOr. Musaddiq was insisting that the dispute should be regarded as one between the Persian Government and the A.I.O.C., he was readyto conclude the arbitral agreement with the United Kingdom Govern-ment. There thus seemed to be a reasonable prospect tnat agreement could be reached on a means of settling the compensation question by arbitration. If so, we should have secured one of the points ofprinciple to which we had attached importance throughout the dis-pute. We were also concerned, however, to ensure that satisfactory arrangements would be made for future sales of Persian oil; and onthis point the situation was rather less satisfactory. Dr. Musaddiqhad evidently been induced to accept arbitration by the prospect ofobtaining from the Americans an advance of $.100 millions against future oil deliveries to an American Government agency for defence purposes. The Americans seemed to be willing to make over as muchas $50 millions of this as a first instalment, and were reluctant tomake this conditional upon any agreement for future commercialsales of Persian oil. The total advance of $100 millions would suffice to keep Persia going for about two years; and there was an obviousrisk that, if Dr. Musaddiq could obtain a substantial proportion ofthis without conditions, he would be less concerned to arrange forthe early resumption of normal commercial sales of oil. We had,however, a direct interest in securing this, for, although 25 per cent,of the proceeds of the oil to be supplied to the American Governmentagency was to be held in a neutral account against the arbitration award, the bulk of that award would have to be found from normal commercial sales of Persian oil in future years. It was therefore inour interests that the proposed advance of $100 millions should bepaid in instalments, that the first instalment should not be undulylarge and that it should be accompanied by an agreement to open negotiations for future commercial sales of oil. These sales mighthave to be conducted through a new international company, regis-tered in Switzerland, in which the shares would be held by theA.I.O.C, Shell, and French and American oil companies. TheA.I.O.C. would have something less than a half share in this con-sortium, but they and Shell would together have control over it.The details of this arrangement were at present being worked out inconsultation with representatives of the United States Government.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Comment was made on the proposed terms of reference tothe arbitration tribunal as set out in the Annex to C. (53) 6. It was argued that paragraph 1 (b) of these was ambiguous, since it did not make it clear that it was for the tribunal to determine what numberof years&apos; purchase should be adopted. The Cabinet were informedthat on this point the suggested terms of reference were modelled on those used in determining the compensation to be paid on the nationalisation of the coal mines in this country, and that these hadbeen settled in agreement between the Labour Government and thecoal-owners. As Dr. Musaddiq had suggested that the terms of refer-ence should be based -on some English nationalisation law, it was desirable that the wording should deviate as little as possible from thatof some existing statutory precedent.
The Cabinet agreed that further legal advice should be obtained on this point.(b) Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s reluctance to discuss arrangements for futurecommercial sales of oil might be due in part to discussions which hehad held with an American named Marcus who claimed to have con-cluded a contract to buy a large proportion of the available persian oil on behalf of an organisation called the United States MarketingCouncil Inc. and to make an advance payment of $50 millions to thePersian Government. There was reason to believe that Mr. Marcusmight at one stage have received some encouragement from the UnitedStates Government; but he was unlikely to obtain any support from,the large American oil companies and from our point of view it was most important that- the Persians should see that he would be unableto make good his promises. Dr. Musaddiq might then be more readyto accept the fact that future commercial sales must be conductedthrough the principal oil companies, including the A.I.O.C.(c) From our point of view it was important that the americans should not offer as much as $50 millions as a first instalment of their advance against future oil deliveries. We should prefer that any advance should be conditional upon an agreement by Dr. Musaddiqto open negotiations for future commercial sales. If we could securesimultaneous agreement on arbitration, on arrangements for futurecommercial sales of oil and on the first instalment of the Americanadvance, we might be able to agree that this first instalment shouldbe as much as $50 millions. If, however, the three parts of the bargaincould not all be concluded simultaneously., we should urge the americans to agree that the first instalment of their advance shouldnot exceed $30 millions or at most $40 millions. And in that event we should press for some assurance that discussions would be openedwithout delay about the arrangements for future commercial sales.(d) We should also seek an assurance that the remaining instal-ments of the $100 millions would not be paid until satisfactory arrangements were in operation for normal commercial sales of persian oil through an international company in which the A.I.O.C.held a substantial interest. It was unlikely that the Americans couldbe persuaded to agree that payment of the further instalment shouldbe made conditional on this; but it might be possible to agree uponseparate, but related, time-tables for the payment of the remaininginstalments and for the resumption of normal commercial sales, whichwould have the result that commercial sales would be resumed beforethe whole of the $100 millions had been paid.(e) We should lose no time in welcoming Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s offer to refer the question of compensation to arbitration by the Inter-national Court. An interim message welcoming this should thereforebe sent to him through the United States Ambassador in Tehran,while the other aspects of the problem were still under considerationbetween ourselves and the Americans. It might be stated, in thisinterim message, that there was no substantial difference between theBritish and the Persian attitude towards the role which the Inter-national Court might play in reaching a settlement of the question ofcompensation by impartial arbitration; and that, as an agreement onarbitration was an essential preliminary to any general settlement ofthe dispute, the United Kingdom Government would welcome themaking of informal contact with the International Court concerningthe suggestions for arbitration put forward by Dr. Musaddiq. Itmight also be stated in the message that the United Kingdom Govern-ment were interested to hear of the recent conversations which theUnited States Ambassador had had with Dr. Musaddiq and that theother points which had emerged from those conversations were being very closely studied in London.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Ministerof Labour, the Attorney-General and the Minister of Fuei
Road and Rail 2. The Minister of Transport said that the British TransportTransport.

Increases in fares. fares in the London area would account for  6 millions of this.   It(Previous        could not be said that London fares would be disproportionate to reference:      those in force in the rest of the country; but it was the fact that theC.C.

The Transport Tribunal had not yetannounced the dates on which it would begin its hearings of thisapplication, but it would be politically preferable that its findingsshould not be brought into operation until towards the end of May.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Transport.Central African       3,   The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the ConferenceFederation.      Gn Central African Federation strong objections had been raised to(Previous        the original proposals for the constitution of the African AffairsReference:      Board.   This had been envisaged as an extra-Parliamentary body,C.C. (52) 107th nominated by the Governor-General and the Governors of eachConclusions,     territory.   The Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, however, had- Minute 4.)       urged at the Conference that the duties of the proposed Board shouldinstead be entrusted to a select Committee of the Federal Parliament,composed of the six members elected and selected two from each territory to represent African interests in the Parliament.   Thissuggestion seemed to have considerable advantages.   It could 1 be argued with force that the persons best qualified to prevent any unfairdiscrimination against Africans were those members of the federal parliament who had been chosen as representatives of african interests; and, as there was a shortage of persons suitably qualified,it would be difficult to find members of an extra-Parliamentary body in addition to these chosen members.  Moreover, a separate AfricanAffairs Board would not be fully employed and would doubtless finditself from time to time in conflict with the six Members of Parliamentspecially elected to represent African interests.   In general it couldbe said that the new proposal offered better safeguards for african interests.  It would certainly help to ensure that the referendum in southern Rhodesia would approve the Federation Scheme.   It wasalso supported by the representatives of Northern Rhodesia.  On theother hand, the Opposition in this country would represent it as a concession to public opinion in Southern Rhodesia and would argue that members of a Parliamentary body would be subject to politicalpressures and less able to take a detached and objective view.The Colonial Secretary supported this proposal.and Power to review, in the light of the Cabinefs dis-cussion, the wording of the proposed terms of referenceset out in the Annex to C. (53) 6.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for an interimmessage to be sent to Dr. Musaddiq through the UnitedStates Ambassador in Tehran on the lines indicated inparagraph (e) above.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, together with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Co-ordina-.tion of Transport, Fuel and Power, to see the UnitedStates Ambassador in London and Mr. Byroade of theState Department to urge on them the points noted inparagraphs (b)-(d) above.
The Cabinet-Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to accept, onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government, the modifiedproposals put forward by the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia for the safeguarding of African interests in, theconstitution of a Central African Federation.The Cabinet.(previous reference:C.C.

The Foreign Secretary suggested, and it was agreed, thatduring the remainder of the Parliamentary recess the Cabinet should meet once a week only, on Wednesdays at 11 a.m., unless othermeetings were required for the despatch of urgent business.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th January, 1953.
