Death of 1.   The Cabinet expressed their sorrow at the death of HerQueen Mary.    Majesty Queen Mary.They invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a wreath to besent on their behalf to the Funeral of Her late Majesty.9 They were informed of the arrangements for the Lying in state in Westminster Hall from 29th to 31st March, and for the Funeralat St. George&apos;s Chapel, Windsor, on 31st March.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the Lying in Stateof Queen Mary, no sittings of Parliament would be held on Monday,30th March. This had necessitated some rearrangement of theParliamentary business for the week; but it was still proposed that parliament should adjourn for the Easter recess on Thursday,2nd April.Germany.denfence contribution.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 53rdConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 112) on the progress of the negotiations with theGerman Federal Government about their financial contribution to defence in the year ending June 1954 and their contribution towardsthe costs of Allied forces in Germany after the ratification of theTreaty establishing the European Defence Community.The Foreign Secretary said that it was desirable that these nego-tiations should be brought to a satisfactory conclusion before themeeting of the North Atlantic Council in April. He therefore pro-posed that President Eisenhower should be asked to impress on theGerman Federal Chancellor, during his forthcoming visit to Wash-rngton, the importance of reaching an early settlement on both thequestions now under negotiation; and that, after Dr. Adenauer&apos; return from Washington, a further approach should be made to himon behalf of the three Governments with the object of reaching anearly agreement, both on the total German contribution and on the costs of the Allied forces in Germany.The Foreign Secretary added that there was some reason tobelieve that the German Federal Government might be willing tomake some contribution towards infrastructure costs before theestablishment of the European Defence Community.The Cabinet-Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals as summarised in paragraph 4 of C. (53) 112.commercial policy.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 21stConclusions,Minute 5.)Relaxation ofRestrictionson Trade withWesternEurope.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the announce-ment to the Council of the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.) on 23rd March of the relaxation of ourrestrictions on trade with Western Europe and of the raising of ourtourist allowance had not only forestalled retaliatory action by Franceand Italy, which we had been fortunate to avoid, but had markedlyimproved the general atmosphere in the O.E.E.C. There was now a real possibility that member countries whose financial position was strong, for example, Germany and Belgium, would follow our leadin easing restrictions; and French policy had been publicly revealedin an unfavourable light. These results were in his judgment sufficientto justify the risk to our balance of payments from the relaxationswhich we had made.44015-2 B 2
Common-wealthEconomicConference.Congo Basin 5.   The Colonial Secretary said that in 1890, 1895 and 1919 the treaties. United Kingdom Government had joined in signing Treaties designedto protect the interests of the inhabitants of territories in the CongoBasin in such matters as the control of traffic in liquor and arms.Some of the provisions of these Treaties were no longer justifiable,but there was no prospect of securing the agreement of all parties,which included Russia, to their abrogation or amendment. In thecircumstances he sought the approval of his colleagues for a policyof quietly disregarding those provisions of the Treaties which could not longer be justified.The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed with the policy pro-posed. The Cabinet should, however, recognise that it involved some risk that our departure from the strict letter of these Treaties wouldbe exploited by those who were concerned to criticise &quot; Colonialism &quot;in the United Nations.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to disregard those pro-visions of the Congo Basin Treaties which could no longer be justified.Territorial 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting with BritishWaters: fishing interests which he and the Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Iceland Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, had held on the previous dayFisheries had brought them no nearer to a solution of the Iceland fisheriesDispute. dispute. - The attitude of the trawler owners had hardened possibly(Previous        through the intervention of Mr. Dawson, a British business man whoReference:      had concluded a private deal with the Iceland Government for theC.C. (53) 16th   marketing of Iceland fish in this country and they had declined to conclusions,    give any undertaking that they would raise the landing ban after a minute 7.)       ruling had been given by the International Court. They adhered tothe position that they would abide by any decision given in thismatter by the Over-fishing Commission.  Unfortunately, the iceland government were not prepared to accept adjudication by this commission, and it had in any event no power to impose its willon either of the parties.  He would like to discuss with some of hiscolleagues what further action was open to the Government topromote a settlement of the dispute, and whether any statement onthe situation ought to be made to Parliament before the Easter recess.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss with some of hiscolleagues, and to advise the Cabinet, whether a statement on the position now reached in the Iceland fisheries dispute should be made in the House of Commons before the easter adjournment.The Council had also accorded a good reception to the statements which the Foreign Secretary and he had made about the outcome of the Commonwealth Economic Conference and of their subsequent discussions in Washington on the approach to a multilateral systemof trade and payments. Those member countries &apos;whose economic prospects were favourable had indicated a readiness to follow anylead which we might give in the direction of convertibility ofcurrencies, while the response of certain other countries, including the scandinavian, had tended to be more cautious. Even the lattercountries, however, had been reassured by our offer to proceed inco-operation with our European partners.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
The persian gulf.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 9.)The TrucialSheikhdoms.PersianSeizure ofIslands.7. The Foreign Secretary said that as a matter of courtesy he wished to inform the United States Government some 48 hoursbefore we took the military measures in respect of Buraimi which theCabinet had authorised on 17th March. It was desirable that these measures should be taken as soon as possible.The Minister of Defence said that the unloading of the vesselHumphrey Gale near Sharjah had been delayed by bad weather, butthe expedition should be ready to move on 31st March or 1st April.He would inform the Foreign Secretary as soon as he had received a reply to a message he had sent emphasising the need for speed and asking for a firm date for the completion of the preparations.The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to telegram No. 138from Bagdad reporting that the Iraqi Government had learned thatthe Persian Government contemplated sending troops to four islands in the Persian Gulf, two of which belonged to Sheikhs in friendly relations with us. He was encouraging the Iraqi Government to disclose this information, which was likely to increase Iraqi suspicionsof Persia. He also hoped that two frigates could be made availablein the Gulf in order that we might be in a position to intervene, ifnecessary.The First Lord of the Admiralty confirmed that two frigateswould remain in the Gulf for the time being.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Germany.Arrest of former Nazis.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 20thConclusions,Minute 2.)8. The Foreign Secretary said that the German federal chancellor had now undertaken to institute criminal proceedings inthe German courts against Werner Naumann and his associates. Apublic announcement to this effect was to be made by Dr. Adenauerthat day. The Foreign Secretary read to the Cabinet a draft of thestatement in which he proposed to announce this to the House ofCommons.The Cabinet approved the terms of the statement which theForeign Secretary proposed to make, and expressed their apprecia-tion of his handling of the situation. The outcome fully justifiedthe action which the United Kingdom High Commissioner had taken,,with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s approval, in arresting Naumann and his associates.industrial disputes.Austin Motors.(previous reference:C.C.C53) 13thConclusions,Minute 8.)9. The Minister of Labour said that the strikers at the AustinMotor Works in Birmingham were holding a mass meeting that after-noon. It was unlikely that they would then decide to return to work,,in spite of the Company&apos;s announcement that strikers who had notreturned by 27th March would be regarded as having resigned fromthe firm&apos;s employ. The Trades Union Congress had advised theNational Union of Vehicle Builders, which had called the strike, thatthey should advise the strikers to return to work and thereafter invitethe Minister of Labour to investigate their grievances. He had indicated that he would be ready to consider on its merits any requestwhich might be made to him on behalf of the strikers after they had returned to work. A solution of the present impasse might still bepossible, however, as the executive of the Union was meeting on thefollowing morning and the Austin Motor Company had indicated that strikers returning to work at any time during the course of that day would be retained in the Company&apos;s employ.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.
european defence community.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing (C. (53) 108) and the Foreign Secretary (C. (53) 111) onthe attitude of the United Kingdom Government towards the estab-lishment of the European Defence Community.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not dissent from the view,expressed by the Minister of Housing, that we should not make further concessions to the French for tne purpose of facilitating theestablishment of the European Defence Community. He was notin fact proposing to offer any further concessions. The factor whichwould now exercise most influence on the French Government waslGermany&apos;s ratification of the Treaty. The ratification had been passed by the Bundestag, and was likely to be passed by the upper house shortly after Easter. In these circumstances there was no occasion at present for the United Kingdom Government to reconsider their present policy of working for the early ratification of the treaty as the quickest method of obtaining a German contribution towardsthe defence of Western Europe. The questions raised in the memo-randum by the Minister &quot;of Housing were addressed to a situationin which France was unable to ratify the Treaty. As things nowstood, this situation seemed less likely to arise.The Cabinet Took note of C. (53) 108 and 111; and reaffirmed theirpolicy of working for the early ratification of the treaty for the establishment of the European Defence Community.the coronation.Naval Review.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 5thConclusions,Minute 6.)11. The Prime Minister said that it had come to his notice that,while other guests invited to the Naval Review were to be giventransport and entertainment free of charge, Members of the two houses of Parliament were to be asked to pay their railway faresbetween London and Portsmouth. The benefit which this would bring to public funds would be small in comparison with the dis-content which it would arouse among Members; and he hoped thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer would be able to agree that members and their wives, like other distinguished guests, could be transportedto and from Portsmouth at public expense.The Cabinet were informed that the reason for the arrangementoriginally proposed was that, as Parliament would have to vote themonies necessary for public expenditure on the Coronation, thearrangements should not appear to give special financial advantage to Members. It was the view of the Cabinet that Members need noton this account be treated differently from other distinguished guestsat the Naval Review.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reconsider theproposal that Members of Parliament attending the NavalReview should be required to pay their railway fares between london and Portsmouth.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th March, 1953.
