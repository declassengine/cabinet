Parliament. 1.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of corres-Estimates pondence which he was having with Sir Ralph Glyn, M.P., aboutCommittee. the desire of the Estimates Committee that certain of their members should visit Egypt in order to take evidence on the spot about thescale of defence expenditure in the Middle East, including the valueof the stores held there by the Services and the plans for the con-struction of headquarters accommodation in Cyprus. Such a visitwould not be opportune at the present time, when we were seeking to resume defence negotiations with the Egyptian Government; and,apart from that consideration, he believed that the Select committee could obtain in London all the information which they needed onthese matters. Sir Ralph Glyn had been informed to this effect, buthe was not wholly satisfied with this reply and it was possible thathe might approach other members of the Government.The Cabinet agreed that the Estimates Committee should be discouraged from proceeding with their suggestion that certain oftheir members should visit Egypt in order to take evidence on thelevel of defence expenditure in the Middle East.Kenya.parliamentary privilege.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(C. (53) 19) covering a memorandum by the Attorney-General onthe question whether Parliamentary privilege could properly be claimed in respect of a communication sent to Members of parliament in this country complaining of the administration of justice in Kenya.The Attorney-General said that it was most desirable that the speaker should confirm his provisional ruling that the proceedings for contempt of court which had been taken against Mr. D. N. Pritt,Q.C., in the Supreme Court at Nairobi afforded no prima facie caseof breach of privilege which would warrant a reference to the Com-mittee of Privileges. For the reasons given in his memorandum,however, he did not consider that the Speaker should be urged to rule that Parliamentary privilege did not extend to anything said ordone in connection with the administration of justice in Kenya, or that reference to the Committee of Privileges should be avoidedbecause it would involve interference with a court of law. he recommonded rather that the Speaker should be urged to deal withthe matter on the merits and to confirm his provisional ruling thatin the action taken against Mr. Pritt nothing had been done which involved any interference with the privileges of Members of the Parlia-ment at Westminster. He had already given the Speaker a record ofthe proceedings in the Supreme Court at Nairobi; and he had good reason to believe that the Speaker would in fact take the view whichhe had set out in the memorandum annexed to C. (53) 19.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the memorandum annexed toC. (53) 19 and of the action taken by the Attorney-General.Central African 3. The Commonwealth Secretary said that, as a result of theFederation. discussions in the Conference of representatives of. the Govern-ments concerned, there Was good reason to hope that agreement would shortly be reached on the terms of a constitution for a central african Federation. He now wished to submit for the cabinet&apos;s approval his proposals for announcing the results of the Conferenceand enacting the legislation which would subsequently have to be passed by the Parliament at Westminster.It was proposed that the details of the agreed scheme shouldbe promulgated simultaneously in all the countries concerned. this meant that publication must be delayed for several days after the(previous reference:C.C. (53) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)
end of the Conference. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s views, the Common-wealth Secretary would announce, in reply to Parliamentary questions that afternoon, that a White Paper would be presented as soon aspossible after the end of the Conference but that no indication of itscontents could be given meanwhile. It was contemplated that theWhite Paper would be available to Members of Parliament on th February and published in the morning newspapers on 6th February. This meant that, after the Conference had ended,Members would have to wait about a week before its results became known.The referendum in Southern Rhodesia would be held late inMarch or early in April; and the legislatures of the other territories would be asked to approve the scheme at about the same time. Ifapproval were obtained in all the territories, the Federal structureshould be brought into being in August; and for this purpose theenabling legislation would have to be passed by the Parliament at westminster before the summer recess. It would be preferable thatthe contentious part of the Parliamentary proceedings should havebeen completed before the Coronation. The main controversy would arise on the Second Reading of the Bill and in any preliminary debate on the White Paper which might be held, at the request of theOpposition, on a Supply Day.The Lord Privy Seal said that in planning the legislative pro-gramme he had taken account of the need to pass this legislationbefore the summer recess, and there should be no difficulty in arranging for the House of Commons to take the Second reading of the Bill before the Coronation.&quot; .The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward by the commonwealth secretary for promulgating the results of the Conferenceon Central African Federation, and for dealing with thelegislation which would have to be enacted thereafter bythe Parliament at Westminster.4. The Minister of Agriculture said that he would be glad tohave the Cabinet&apos;s views on the terms of an assurance which he wished to give to the farmers regarding the Governments determina-tion to maintain the stability in agriculture which had been providedby the system of guaranteed prices and assured markets established under the Agriculture Act, 1947. The Chancellor of the exchequer had spoken of the farmers&apos; desire for some general reassurance onthis point when the Cabinet had discussed on 14th January the schemefor ending the controls over feeding-stuffs and cereals, and the cabinet had then approved the line which he was proposing to take at asmall private meeting with their representatives later that day. TheMinister said that the atmosphere had been substantially improved by that meeting; and, largely as a result, he had been successful inallaying these anxieties at a larger meeting he had held with the farmers&apos; representatives two days later. He and the Chancellor had,however, been asked for a written aide-memoire of the governments intentions which the farmers&apos; representatives could use for thepurpose of reassuring their constituents. The document prepared forthis purpose was being used at farmers&apos; meetings which were being held that day in Scotland and in Northern Ireland. The meetingof the English farmers was to take place in the following week; andthe Minister had now been asked to make a public statement before then in the terms of the aide-memoire. He thought it would bedifficult to refuse this request; and he suggested that the statement should be made in the course of the press conference which ministers would be holding on the following day to explain the White Paper
on the scheme for ending the controls over feeding-stuffs and cereals.If that opportunity were taken to make the statement, it should not receive undue publicity.The Minister of Food said that he did not care for the mannerin which farmers&apos; representatives had sought to extract this publicassurance from the Government by asking first for a statement which they could- use in their negotiations and, having obtained this,implying that they could not rely upon it unless the Governmentwere prepared to give it the added authority of a public government statement. Moreover he was very doubtful whether it would be wisefor the Government to place publicly on record the statement, whichhad been included in the aide-memoire, that they proposed to continuethe system of price reviews &quot;with a view to ensuring realistic andeconomic price guarantees designed to encourage the required pro-duction.&quot; He feared that some of the farmers would read into theword &quot; economic &quot; a meaning which the Government did not intendit to bear, and would subsequently bring forward charges of breach of faith if at future price reviews the Government proposed prices for some products which did not provide an ample profit for the producer. He himself would not have thought that any publicassurance of this kind was needed. He did not believe there was any widespread lack of confidence among farmers. Since it had become known that the Government intended to restore a free market in eggspoultry keepers had substantially increased their orders for chickens.This did not seem to bear out the suggestion that agricultural pro-duction would decline unless the farmers were given some freshpromise of guaranteed prices and assured markets.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, as this aide-memoirehad been given to the farmers&apos; representatives, an atmosphere of dis-trust was likely to be created if the Government now declined therequest that they should give a public assurance on the same lines.It was also agreed that the press conference on the scheme for ending the controls over feeding-stuffs and cereals would afford a suitable opportunity for making such a statement without undue publicity.As regards the terms of the statement, Ministers considered that the phrase &quot; realistic and economic price guarantees,&quot; which had been inserted in the aide-memoire at the suggestion of the farmers&apos; repre-sentatives, was open to misinterpretation and likely to give rise to difficulties in the future. On the other hand, as a document containingthis phrase had already been used at farmers&apos; meetings in Scotlandand Northern Ireland, it would be dangerous to omit this phrasefrom the public statement unless some convincing explanation of itsomission could be given. It might perhaps be possible to substitutesome other phrase based on the wording of the Agriculture Act, 1947.Alternatively, the sentence containing this phrase might be linkedmore closely with the preceding sentence by adding at the beginningthe words &quot; In accordance with this policy.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that some public assurance should begiven regarding the Governments intention to maintainthe stability in agriculture which had been provided bythe system of guaranteed prices and assured marketsestablished under the Agriculture Act, 1947, on the linesof the aide-memoire which had already been given to the farmers&apos; representatives; and authorised the Minister ofAgriculture to make a statement on this matter at the press conference which was to be held on the following day to explain the scheme for ending controls over feeding-stuffs and cereals.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Food,to determine in the light of the Cabinets discussion the precise wording of the statement to be made on thismatter by the Minister of Agriculture.
Coal.Miners&apos; Wages.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Foreign Secretary reported that the comprehensive pro-posals for a settlement of the oil dispute with Persia had been acceptedby the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and by the Americans. TheUnited States Ambassador in Teheran had now put these proposals to Dr. Musaddiq, who had rejected them and was making alternative proposals which appeared to be unacceptable. The Foreign secretary said that he had no intention of departing from the comprehensiveproposals, except possibly in minor matters of drafting, and he was doing his best to persuade the United States Government to be equallyfirm. He would send a message on the subject to the new UnitedStates Secretary of State.The Cabinet Took note of the position.Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that, following the Cabinet&apos;s dis-cussion on 14th January, he had consulted further with some of his cabinet colleagues about the precise terms of the proposals to be put to the Egyptian Government regarding the future safeguards for theSouthern Provinces of the Sudan. The alternatives which H.M.Ambassador in Cairo had, as a result, been authorised to put tothe Egyptians were set out in Foreign Office telegrams to Cairo,Nos. 86, 96 and 97. These were not welcomed by H.M. repre-sentatives in Cairo or Khartoum, but he was satisfied that it wouldnot be expedient at this stage to go beyond the limits there indicated.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.5. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that &quot;the negotiations on the current wages claim bythe National Union of Mineworkers had reached a critical stage.The National Coal Board had offered an increase of 6s. per week for about 140,000 of the lower-paid workers in the industry. this offer had been rejected by the National Union of Mineworkers, whohad proposed instead an increase of 15s. per week for about 420,000men. This proposal could not be accepted. It was certainly not justified by existing circumstances in the industry: the Tribunalsrefusal of the original demand had been followed by a slackening of effort and a loss of output. The Union now realised that they musteither agree to go to arbitration or accept the Board&apos;s offer of 6s.He thought it likely that they would adopt the latter course but make no effort to check the trouble which would follow in certain coalfields.In that event there was a risk of some loss of output but not, hethought, of any general stoppage of work. He recommended theCabinet to support the National Coal Board in refusing to make any advance on their present offer.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that anyfurther concession by the National Coal Board on this occasion mightwell start a further round of applications for wage increases.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should support the action ofthe National Coal Board in refusing to make any further concession in their current wages negotiations with theNational Union of Mineworkers.
Germany.(previous reference:C.C.&quot;(52) 76thConclusions,Minute 4.)Arrest of former Nazis.8. The Foreign Secretary said that for some time past theBritish authorities in Western Germany had been aware of theactivities of a group of former leading ex-Nazis who had been plottingto regain political power. With his knowledge and approval the HighCommissioner had decided that the ringleaders of the group shouldbe arrested, under the powers reserved by the revised occupation statute, so that there activities might be further investigated. Thearrests had been satisfactorily carried out, and a large number of documents had been seized. Until these had been examined, andfurther enquiries made on the basis of them, it would not be certainlyknown how widespread the plot had been or what contacts had beenestablished between this group and agencies in other countries. Thearrests had inevitably caused some political embarrassment to theChancellor of the Federal Republic, and it was natural that in his public statements he should have refrained from expressing approvalof the action taken by the British authorities. The Foreign secretary had, however, thought it right that the activities of this group shouldbe checked while the British authorities still had power to take5executive action. If this had been left until all powers had been&quot;transferred, the Federal Government would probably have been reluctant to make any drastic move until the conspiracy had assumedmore formidable proportions.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.9. The Colonial Secretary said that he proposed to authorisethe use of a new tear gas, known as B.B.C., in Malaya. This gas,the only effect of which was lachrymatory, would be used in the jungle to divert bandits into other routes or to deny portions ofthe jungle to them. It was possible that, when it became known that this gas was being used in Malaya, there would be criticism from some quarters, and he had therefore thought it right to bring his proposal to the notice of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Approved the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposal to authorisethe use of a new tear gas in operations against bandits in malaya.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th January, 1953.Malaya.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 49thConclusions,Minute 2.)
