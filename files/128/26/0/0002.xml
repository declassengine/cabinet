Egypt-defence negotiations.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 91stConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (-53) 17) reporting the results of discussions withdiplomatic and military representatives of the United States Govern-ment regarding the basis on which defence negotiations might be resumed with the Egyptian Government.The Foreign Secretary said that these discussions had been basedon a memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff which had been approvedby the Defence Committee on 11th December. The United states representatives had agreed that negotiations with Egypt should be opened on the basis set out in that memorandum as Case &quot; A,&quot; whichwas the most acceptable from the military point of view. The papersannexed to his memorandum had been accepted by the United states representatives, subject to approval by their Government. If thatapproval were forthcoming, it was contemplated that the UnitedStates and United Kingdom Ambassadors in Cairo would make ajoint approach to the Egyptian Government.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that an arrangement on the basis of Case &quot; A &quot; was the minimum required to ensureeffective joint defence of the Middle East. Any less satisfactory arrangement would mean that there would be too long an interval between the outbreak of war and our recovery of full use of the base.If defence negotiations were resumed, we should doubtless be underpressure to withdraw our troops rapidly; and he therefore stressed thepoint that the evacuation of combatant troops could not be completed in less than eighteen months without serious waste of material andhardship to our forces.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) In paragraph 7 of C. (53) 17 it was stated that British troops could only be withdrawn from Egypt &quot; in order to pave the way forthe re-establishment of confidence between ourselves and Egypt.&quot;This sentence seemed open to misinterpretation. It might be takento mean that we were willing to withdraw troops merely for the pur-pose of securing Egyptian goodwill.The Foreign Secretary said that his intentions were more clearly stated in paragraph 9 (b) of the memorandum. He was not proposing to agree to the withdrawal of British troops until the Egyptians fortheir part had indicated their readiness to co-operate in a regionaldefence organisation and negotiations to that end were proceeding satisfactorily. He agreed that paragraph 7 of the memorandum should be amended so as to make this1 more clear.(b) The Chiefs of Staff were concerned lest, if the negotiationsbroke down, there should be a renewal of guerilla activities in Egypt.We should not have sufficient forces in the Middle East to deal withthat situation, especially if it coincided with the trouble in the Sudanor in Irak. Nor had we reserves in the United Kingdom from which to reinforce the Middle East. If therefore that situation should arise,it might be necessary to embody some Territorial Army formations.(c) The Chiefs of Staff were anxious that the&apos; United StatesGovernment should not supply military equipment to Egypt beforethe negotiations were resumed. It would be preferable that military supplies should be withheld until the Egyptian Government had shown themselves ready to co-operate in a Middle East defence organisation.The Foreign Secretary, said that an Egyptian purchasing corn-mission was already in the United States negotiating for about$10 millions&apos; worth of equipment. He had impressed on United Statesdiplomatic representatives the advantages of delaying delivery of these supplies; and he hoped that he might have persuaded them to releaseno more than $5 millions&apos; worth in the first instance and to make further instalments dependent upon the progress of the defence
Sudan.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 107thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary drew attention to telegrams fromKhartoum (Nos. 26 and 28 of 12th January) reporting the agreement which had been reached between the Sudanese.political parties andthe Egyptian Government. This had greatly increased our difficultiesin reaching a satisfactory understanding with the Egyptian Govern-reassessment . There was clearly no time to be lost, and he had thereforesent a telegram (No. 67 of 13th January) to H.M. ambassador in Cairo and to the Governor-General in Khartoum asking fortheir views on three possible courses of action.&quot; There was little chanceof obtaining Egyptian agreement to the first of these, which was thatincluded in the draft agreement already handed to the egyptian government. It was, however, possible that the Egyptians might accept his second proposal that no decision should be taken now about the Governor-GeneraFs special responsibilities towards theSouthern Provinces, but that this should be left for later decision bythe Sudan Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government were likely to be exposed to strong Parliamentary criticism if they appearedto be abandoning their special responsibilities for the SouthernProvinces. It might be wise to explain to Government supporters inthe House of Commons the prospects of securing suitable safeguardsby action taken in the Sudan Parliament. -The Foreign Secretary said that he would consider whether asatisfactory formula could be elaborated on the basis of para-graph 3 (b) in his telegram No. 67 to Cairo. No decision could betaken until he had received a report of the discussion which H.M. Ambassador in Cairo was about to hold with General Neguib;but prompt decisions might then be required and it would be useful if he could have the help of a small Cabinet Committee which couldbe convened more easily in an emergency.The Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of:  Foreign Secretary (in the Chair),Lord President,Lord Privy Seal,Commonwealth Secretary,Colonial Secretary,to deal on their behalf with urgent questions arising in con-nection with the Sudan.negotiations. It would be useful if the Chiefs of Staff would supple-ment his endeavours by conveying their views on this point to theUnited States military authorities.The Cabinet(1) Approved the papers annexed to C. (53) 17 as a basis for the resumption of defence negotiations with the egyptian government.(2) Agreed in principle that, subject to the concurrence of theUnited States Government, the United Kingdom and united States Ambassadors in Cairo should make a jointapproach to the Egyptian Government on this basis, at a mount to be determined by the United Kingdom and united States Governments.(3) Approved the remaining recommendations in paragraph 9 ofC. (53) 17.(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would seek the PrimeMinisters endorsement of these conclusions.
territorial waters.IcelandFisheriesDispute.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 16) proposing the next step in the Iceland fisheriesdispute; a memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(C. (53) 4) reporting the result of discussions with representatives ofthe fishing industry; and a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (C. (53) 11) reporting that it would be impracticable to revoke the open general licence for the import of fish from Iceland.The Foreign Secretary said that it now seemed clear that the least objectionable course would be to seek to induce the Iceland Govern-ment to agree to an approach to the International Court limited tothe Faxa Bay issue. There was some reason to believe that the iceland government might agree to this limited reference and it was theopinion of the Foreign Office legal advisers that the United kingdom had some chance of obtaining a satisfactory verdict on it.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) This limited submission to the Court would not help theScottish fishermen, who did not fish in Faxa Bay.(b) Care should be taken to avoid prejudicing our general position with regard to the delimitation of territorial waters. some ministers would have preferred for this reason that no submissionshould be made to the International Court until the United StatesGovernment had indicated their views on the general question. Itwas recognised, however, that there was less risk of prejudicing thegeneral position if the Faxa Bay issue were alone referred to theInternational Court. In framing the terms of reference to the Courtcare would be taken to avoid appearing to make any concession onthe general question.(c) No further efforts should be made to induce the fishing industry to remove its ban on landing Iceland fish in this country.There was in fact no immediate difficulty about the supply of fish,and any further pressure on trawler owners might well lead to astrike, especially at this time of the year.The Cabinet--(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to approach the iceland government with a view to inducing them to agree to a reference to the International Court on the Faxa Bay issueonly.(2) Took note that it was impracticable to revoke the open general licence for the import of fish from Iceland.animal feeding-stuffs.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 96thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture and the Minister of Food (C. (53) 12) reporting theresults of their discussions with representatives of the farmers and thetrades concerned on the scheme for withdrawing the exchequer subsidy on animal feeding-stuffs and bringing to an end rationing,price control and Government-trading in feeding-stuffs and cereals.The Minister of Agriculture said that the farmers were apprehen-sive about this scheme, and fearful that it might prove the first step in a process Which would eventually deprive them of the price and market guarantees which they enjoyed under Part I of the agriculture act, 1947. They would take no responsibility for the estimate of demand for feeding-stuffs and were unwilling to accept the Govern-ment&apos;s assurances that supplies would be adequate. Despite theattitude of the farmers, however, he still believed that the scheme wassbund and that it should be brought into operation.The Minister of Food said that the trade would have to face muchgreater difficulties than the fanners, and he was encouraged by thefact that of the twenty-two trade associations concerned only two
had been definitely hostile to the scheme. Delay in ending the control would not reduce the difficulties. Under the scheme the flour subsidy would disappear, but there would continue to be a subsidy and price control for bread made from national flour. This arrangement mightimpose some hardship on those who baked at home, since they wouldbe using unsubsidised flour, but the numbers involved were small andthe additional cost to them would not be very great. There was also some risk that bakers might use small quantities of the- subsidisednational flour for purposes other than baking national bread; buthe was considering means of reducing this risk without increasingthe price of the national bread.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, despite the political difficulties which might arise from the attitude of the farmers, hethought that the scheme should be brought into operation. It wasthe Governments policy to free the economy and there was a real danger that, without an effort of will, controls would become apermanent part of the national life. He thought it should be possibleto make clear to the various interests concerned that cereals and wheatwould be brought into the annual Farm Price Review and that therewas no intention on the part of the Government to go behind the agriculture Act of 1947. On the question of supplies he had agreed with the Minister of Agriculture to allow extra imports of cereals tothe value of  10 millions, though he did not propose to reveal this figure to the farmers. If additional imports were required, he pro-posed to give importers the greatest possible freedom, consistent withour balance of payments needs, to purchase their requirements onthe most favourable commercial conditions. He would arrange forthe details of this proposal to be discussed with the Board of Tradeand the Commonwealth Relations Office, as well as the Ministry ofFood. He was also prepared to make available an additional  ^million a year for four years to the Marginal Production Scheme, inorder that small producers of milk, pigs and eggs might receive some financial easement. It would be necessary for him to defend theposition of the Government at a meeting that evening with representa-tives of the National Farmers&apos; Union, who were tending to take upthe uncompromising position that, unless they could be assured of guaranteed prices and markets, they would withdraw their support forthe Government. He proposed to tell them that each scheme ofdecontrol would be judged separately on its own merits; but he wouldassure them that the Government had no intention of going behind the agriculture Act of 1947, and that further measures of decontrol wouldnot be taken without due consultation with them. He thought that by this method the Government could avoid a head-on collision withthe National Farmers&apos; Union.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) Was it necessary to require millers to add to their whiterflour the significant nutrients needed to safeguard nutritionalstandards? The Cabinet were informed that the millers would make no difficulties about this, and it would be well received by those whowere anxious to maintain nutritional standards.(b) The trade, after a long period of control, would find difficultyin raising the necessary finance to support its own free operations, andthis would lead it to seek to curtail the credit at present extended to farmers. The Minister of Food said that he had this difficulty inmind and was discussing possible alleviations with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that a statement of the length and complexity of the draft in Appendix I of C. (53) 12 would be betterpresented to Parliament as a White Paper. There was general agree-ment with this view. Ministers wishing to suggest amendments ofthe draft might communicate them to the Minister of Food.
The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision to proceed with the scheme for thedecontrol of feeding-stuffs and cereals.(2) Invited the Minister of Food, in consultation with the agriculture Ministers, to arrange for these proposals tobe embodied in a White Paper, which should be presentedsoon after Parliament had reassembled.Marketing of 5.   The Minister of Agriculture said that the proposed schemeEggs. for the decontrol of eggs was arousing even more hostility among the(Previous farmers&apos; representatives than the scheme for decontrolling feeding-Reference: stuffs and cereals. The farmers were determined not to lose any ofC.C. (52) 95th the advantages which they obtained under the Agriculture Act of conclusions, 1947, and were seeking in particular to preserve long-term stabilityMinute 3.)      in egg supply and demand.   They had prepared an alternative schemefor a Producer Marketing Board which they wished the Governmentto consider.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he doubted whether aProducer Marketing Board would be able to check the black market in eggs. It was, however, right that the Government should examinethe alternative scheme proposed by the farmers, and this would be in line with the general principles which he had suggested for dealingwith questions of decontrol during the discussion recorded in thepreceding Minute. The decontrol of eggs should be examined on its merits in consultation between the Government and the farmers.The Cabinet-Took note that, before proceeding to put into operation theproposals for ending the existing controls over the price and allocation of eggs, the Minister of Food and the agriculture ministers would examine the alternative scheme for a Pro-producer Marketing Board put forward by the farmers&apos;representatives.Coronation.Food Supplies.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 106thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (C. (53) 13) reviewing the state of food supplies for the coronation period.The Minister of Food said that he would be able to give a bonusof 1 lb. of sugar on the ration, with an appropriate share to caterers,and to allot some additional sugar and fat to food manufacturers forthe production of potato crisps, toffee apples, &amp;c, without any additional cost. He proposed also to allow bona fide organisers of street parties to receive all rations on the catering scale duringCoronation week. There were only two points on which he asked fora decision by the Cabinet. He would like to give an extra 4 ozs. of margarine and cooking fat, but this could only be done by theexpenditure of million in non-sterling non-dollar currency. Hewould also like to allow the traditional practice of ox-roasting,provided that it Was undertaken by responsible bodies only.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he approved theproposals put forward by the Minister of Food.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals made by the Minister of Food inC. (53) 13 regarding the supply of food during the Coronationperiod.
Persia.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (53) 18) summarising the position reached in the persian oil dispute as a result of discussions between Ministers and UnitedStates representatives on 13th January.The Foreign Secretary said that the Americans were in agreementwith the terms of each of the draft documents attached to his memo-randum, namely:  Terms of Reference of the Arbitration Tribunal (Annex A).Arbitration Agreement (Annex B).Agreement between the Defence Materials Procurement Agency(D.M.P.A.) and the Government of Iran (Annex C).Exchange of letters between the United Kingdom and IranianGovernments on the lifting of the oil embargo andimmunity for Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) vessels(Annex D).Covering Memorandum (Annex E).They expected Dr. Musaddiq to insist on the insertion of the words&quot; acting on behalf of the A.I.O.C.&quot; after the words &quot; the Governmentof the United Kingdom &quot; in the opening sentence of the ArbitrationAgreement (Annex B). We had hitherto refused to agree to the insertion of these words but would be prepared to do so if this should prove essential to the conclusion of an agreement.It had not proved possible to link the payment of instalmentsof the $100 millions to be advanced to the National Iranian oil company (N.I.O.C.) by the D.M.P.A. to the progress of negotiationsfor future commercial sales of oil through an international organisa-tion. Payment of instalments was, however, to be conditional onD.M.P.A. being satisfied about the availability and quality of the oilproducts or crude oil to be shipped and the suitability of port, loadingand other essential facilities. The Americans had, moreover, assuredus and their assurance was formally on record that in practicecontinued payment of instalments would be conditional on progress with the negotiations on future commercial sales, to whose successful conclusion they attached great importance. In return for this assurance we had agreed that the initial payment by D.M.P.A. shouldbe $50 millions.Subject to the final agreement of the A.LO.C, the Foreign Secre-tary proposed to invite the Americans to proceed on the lines proposed. It was the intention that the covering memorandum(Annex E) and the other draft documents (Annexes B, C and D)should be initialled in Teheran by Dr. Musaddiq and the United states ambassador and in London by representatives of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government. As soon as we were satisfied that the initialling in Teheran had taken place we shoulddespatch a Government representative to Teheran to sign the finaltexts there, and the D.M.P.A. agreement would be signed by theUnited States Ambassador at the same time. The Americans wouldbe in a position to bring some pressure to bear upon Dr. Musaddiqby making it clear that, if the agreement was not completed by20th January the date of the change of Government in the UnitedStates he might risk losing the advance which he was hoping toreceive.The Attorney-General said that he regarded it as important that,when the terms of reference of the Arbitration Tribunal came to bepublished, it should be made abundantly clear that they had beenaccepted by the legal advisers of the A.I.O.C.The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and power said that the A.I.O.C. were now satisfied with the proposed terms of reference: in particular, they had welcomed the use of theword &quot; enterprise.&quot;
The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the draft documents annexed toC. (53) 18.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to proceed on the lines pro-posed, as soon as the final agreement of the A.I.O.C. wasforthcoming.8. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that he had thought it right to give the Cabinet theearliest possible warning that an early increase in the price of coal was inevitable. If, as now seemed likely, a wage increase of the orderof 6s. a week was awarded to lower-paid workers in the industry,a 10 per cent, increase in the price of coal would be required andshould be introduced at the earliest possible date. A 10 per cent,rise in the pithead price would mean an average increase of 5s. 6d.in the cost per ton to consumers generally : there would be an increaseof 6s. to domestic consumers and 5s. 9d. to the railways.The following points were raised in discussion:  (a) There should be no public reference to the intention toincrease prices until the wages issue had been settled.(b) Any increase in coal prices should be announced as soon aspossible after the announcement of any wage increase, in order tobring it home to public opinion that increases in the wages of one section of the community had to be paid for by the community as awhole.(c) The increase in coal prices would almost certainly be followedafter an interval by an increase in gas prices. This might be fore-shadowed in the initial announcement about coal prices.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and Power to submit at an early date amemorandum containing his considered proposals for increasing the price of coal.Coal Prices.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)Atomic Energy        9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordOrganisation.    Privy Seal (C. (53) 8) presenting a report of the Committee which(Previous        they had appointed on 6th November, 1952, to review the argumentsReference:      for and against transferring responsibility for atomic research andC.C. (52) 93rd   production from the Ministry of Supply to a non-departmentalConclusions,    organisation.   The Committee recommended the Cabinet to decideMinute 5.)       in principle that this responsibility should be transferred to an appro-priate form of non-departmental organisation if means could be found of overcoming the technical and Parliamentary difficulties involved;and suggested that, as contemplated in the Cabinefs earlier discussion,a small body of experts should now be appointed to devise a suitable form of organisation and detailed plans for effecting the transfer. TheCommittee also proposed that, when the report of the experts hadbeen received, an attempt should be made to enlist the support of theLabour Opposition for the proposed transfer, in case it should fall to them to complete it.In discussion reference was made to the difficulties which might arise in the transitional period before the transfer was complete. the experts should be invited to give special attention to these difficulties and to seek means of overcoming them.There was general agreement in the Cabinet with the recom-mendations put forward in C. (53) 8. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he regretted the Committee&apos;s findings.   He
Alan NunnMay.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 108thConclusions,Minute 6.)10. The Cabinet were informed that Alan Nunn May was willing to remain in this country if suitable employment could befound for him, and that the Ministry of Labour were helping him to look for a suitable post in medical research work.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Iron and Steel 11.   The Minister of Supply said that the proposal to includeindustry.        foundries within the ambit of the new Iron and Steel Board had(Previous        encountered strong opposition from the interests concerned.   MuchReference:      of this was due to misunderstanding of the Governments intentions.C.C. (52) 90th   He had discussed the provisions of the Bill on 13th January with conclusions,    representatives of employers and trade associations of the industriesMinute 4.)       principally affected.   He had explained that, while the Governmentadhered to their decision to include the foundries in the Bill, he intended to introduce amendments, in pursuance of the assuranceshe had given to Parliament during the Second Reading debate, whichwould be designed to ensure that the Board&apos;s powers were limitedto those strictly needed for the performance of its duties and to avoid any unnecessary encroachment on the affairs of the engineering industry.   He had secured agreement to an announcement which included the statement that &quot; after a full discussion the unanimousconclusion was reached that, short of excluding the foundries fromthe Bill, the Governments revised proposals would remove, as far aspossible, existing anxieties and objections.&quot;   It could be expectedthat opposition to this feature of the Bill would not now be pressed.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.regarded the atomic energy project as primarily a defence project and, as such, suitable for control by a departmental organisation. Hesuggested that this problem might be referred to the proposed bodyof experts without a prior decision of principle. It was, however, thegeneral view that Ministers should at this stage decide in principle infavour of transferring this responsibility to a non-departmental formof organisation, so that clear directions could be given to the proposedbody of experts who would be expected, not to consider again thearguments for and against transfer, but to devise satisfactory meansof overcoming the difficulties which it involved.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that responsibility for atomic research and production should be transferred from the Ministryof Supply to an appropriate form of non-departmental. organisation.(2) Agreed that a small body of experts should be appointed to devise means of effecting this transfer.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would report their conclusions to the Prime Minister, so that he might settle the composition and terms of reference of the proposedbody of experts.
and Titles.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 31stConclusions,Minute 5.)The Royal Style 12. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda (C. (53) 10and 14) on the changes which it was proposed to make in the form ofthe Royal Style and Titles, following the consultations which hadbeen held with other Commonwealth Governments.In the first of these (C. (53) 10) the Lord Chancellor, the HomeSecretary and the Commonwealth Secretary reported the agreement which had been reached in December with the Prime Ministers andother representatives of Commonwealth Governments who were then in London for the Commonwealth Economic Conference. annexed to that memorandum was the text of an Agreed Minute in which those representatives had placed on record their acceptance of theprinciple that each member of the Commonwealth should in futureuse for its own purposes a form of Title which suited its own par-ticular circumstances but retained a substantial element common toall, and indicating the forms of Title which each of the Governmentsconcerned would recommend for use in their country. It had beenagreed that these changes should be brought into operation by theissue of separate but simultaneous Proclamations before the Corona-tion. The substance of this agreement had been published in a communique issued on 13th December.This memorandum also contained recommendations regardingthe Latin version of the new Title for use in the United Kingdom andthe Latin inscription to be used on the United Kingdom coinage.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the agreement which had been reached withother Commonwealth Governments regarding the changes to be made in the form of the Royal Style and Titles.(2) Agreed that subject to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure the Latinversion of the new Title for use in the United kingdom should be: Elizabeth Seeunda, dei Gratia Britanniarumet Ceterorum Regnorum Suorum et Terrarum Regina,Consortionis Populorum Princeps, Fidei Defensor; andthat the Latin inscriptions for use on United Kingdomcoinage should be: Elizabeth II D.G. Reg. Fid. Def.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, when Her Majesty&apos;pleasure was known, to inform other commonwealth governments of the Latin version of the Title which wasto be used in this country, and of the Latin inscriptionwhich was to be used on the United Kingdom coinage., With the second of these memoranda (C. (53) 14) the HomeSecretary submitted for the Cabinefs approval drafts of a white paper briefly explaining the changes to be made in the form of the title and of the Legislation which would need to be passed inpursuance of this agreement by the United Kingdom Parliament.In discussion the following points were raised:  :(a) It was pointed out that the form of the Title for use in theUnited Kingdom would not be prescribed by Parliament. Therefore,in the last sentence of the first paragraph of the draft White Paper,the reference to &quot; the will of Parliament&quot; was not wholly appropriate;and it would be preferable that the opening words of the sentence should be &quot; It is contemplated that, subject to the passage of the RoyalTitles Bill and Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, the Title for use in thiscountry will be . . . .&quot;(b) In the Parliamentary proceedings on the Bill some ScottishMembers were likely to argue that, as the first Elizabeth had not beenQueen of Scotland, it was not appropriate that Her Majesty shouldbe styled &quot; Elizabeth the Second &quot; in a Title intended for use through-out the United Kingdom. It would be an effective reply to this argument that in all the other self-governing countries of theCommonwealth which owed allegiance to the Crown a Title was tobe adopted which described the Sovereign as &quot; Elizabeth the Second.&quot;
(c) It would be appropriate that the Opposition should be con-suited before the introduction of the Bill. This opportunity shouldbe taken of securing their concurrence in the proposal that, to suit the convenience of the Parliamentary time-table, the Bill should be intro-duced in the House of Lords.The Cabinet (4) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C. (53) 14subject to the amendment noted in paragraph (a) above,and authorised the Home Secretary to present it toParliament.(5) Approved the Royal Titles Bill in the form annexed toC. (53) 14 and authorised its early introduction in theHouse of Lords, subject to Conclusion (6) below.(6) Invited the Home Secretary to consult the Leaders of theOpposition Parties in the House of Commons on the termsof the Royal Titles Bill before its introduction, and to invite their concurrence in the proposal that it should beintroduced in the House of Lords.Leasehold 13.   xhe Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeReform.
