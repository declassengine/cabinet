Foreign Affairs. 2. The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister, whenTripartite postponing his projected meeting in Bermuda with the President of theMeeting. United States and the Prime Minister of France, had suggested to(Previous        President Eisenhower that the Lord President might pay an early visitReference:      to Washington for an intermediate exchange of views.  This sugges-C.C. (53) 34th   tion had been welcomed in Washington, and the United StatesConclusions,    Secretary of State had now proposed that the Lord President should minute 4.)       arrive in Washington on 10th July, that they should be joined by theFrench Foreign Minister on 13th July and that, after the lord presidents departure, further bilateral discussions should be held between the Americans and the French.  These would be informaltalks, which might be described as intermediate and preparatory tothe projected Three-Power Meeting.In discussion there was general support for the suggestion thatthe Lord President should pay an early visit to Washington. there seemed to be some disadvantages in the proposal that the americans should hold bilateral discussions, with ourselves and with the French,before and after the tripartite meetings and it might be preferable thatthe talks should be held &quot;on a tripartite basis throughout.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in a statement about the Prime Ministersabsence which was to be made in the House of commons that afternoon in reply to a Private Notice Question bythe Leader of the Opposition, a general reference shouldbe made to the possibility that the Lord President would attend an early interim meeting of Ministers in Washingtonat which representatives of the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, United States and France would discuss certainurgent problems of common concern to the three countries.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the United StatesGovernment to be informed that, while we should prefer that the proposed talks should be held on a tripartite basisfrom the outset, the Lord President would be willing to fall in with the arrangements proposed by the UnitedStates Secretary of State.The Prime 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime MinisterMinister. was suffering from severe over-strain and was in need of a completerest. His doctors had advised him to abandon his proposed journeyto Bermuda and to lighten his duties for at least a month. TheBermuda Meeting had therefore been postponed, with the concurrence of the United States and French Governments.During his absence the Prime Minister would continue to receivethe more important official papers, and decisions on major questionsof policy would be referred to him. The Minister of State wouldhandle the day-to-day business of the Foreign Office, but would con-suit as required with the Lord President, who would assist the PrimeMinister in the conduct of foreign policy. The Chancellor of theExchequer would preside over meetings of the Cabinet; and he andthe Lord Privy Seal would share the responsibility for making anystatements or answering any questions in the House of Commons on matters of general Government policy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements for the conduct of public business during the Prime Ministers absence.(2) Placed on record their deep regret at the Prime Ministersabsence, and asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer to convey to him on their behalf an expression of their sinceresympathy and good wishes.
miKorea.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 36thConclusions,Minute 1.)Persian Gulf. 4.   The Minister of State said that Saudi levies under SheikhTheTrucial Obaid had now established themselves across the lines along whichSheikhdoms. we were supplying our troops in Buraimi. The local commander(Previous thought that it might be necessary to use air power, as well as groundReference: troops, to dislodge them; and he had asked for authority to makeCG. (53) 28th an air attack against them, with a limited use of bombs and machine-Conclusions, gun fire. The Minister of State thought that this might well provokeMinute 2.)       an unfavourable public reaction and, while he agreed that these leviesmust be dislodged, he recommended that this should be done by methods short of air attack.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for a message to besent at once to the Saudi Arabian Government stating thatwe could not tolerate this interference with the lines ofcommunication to our troops in Buraimi and that we pro-posed to take the necessary steps to dislodge these leviesunder the command of Sheik Obaid.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider what action would be required to dislodge these levies by methodsshort of air attack.United Statesand CanadianLoans.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 104thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C. (53) 181) proposing that negotiations should be opened with the United States Government with a view to the deletionof Section 6 (iii) of the United States Loan Agreement (Command6708).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on balance, he favoured this attempt to secure a radical revision of the Agreement,by which we should secure greater benefit in the long run than if weconcentrated on obtaining waiver of interest payments in 1953. If.however, the wider negotiations made no progress, we could open the question of the 1953 instalment; and he proposed that we should in any event ask the International Monetary Fund to undertake thepreparatory work for the provision of a certificate under Section 5 (b)of the Agreement.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the prospects of persuading the United States Government at this stage to seek theapproval of Congress for a radical revision of the Agreement. Itwas, however, agreed that there could be no disadvantage in takingthe matter up with the Americans on the lines proposed by theChancellor.3. The Minister of State said that an informal proposal hadbeen made by the Prime Minister of India that the United nations assembly should be convened to consider the current situation in korea. Discussion in the Assembly at this stage was not likely to hasten the conclusion of an armistice in Korea, and v/ould provide anunwelcome opportunity for the reopening of other controversialquestions relating to the Far East.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to inform the United kingdom representative at the United Nations that the United King-dom Government were not in favour of the proposal to convene the United Nations Assembly at this stage to discussthe situation in Korea.
The following particular points were raised:  (a) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should be given some discretion about the timing of his approach to the United StatesGovernment. He had recently been instructed to approach themregarding the relaxation of the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; and it might be undesirable that two difficult questions of this kind should be under negotiationsimultaneously in Washington.(b) Special care should be taken to avoid any public disclosurethat negotiations were proceeding in Washington with a view to a revision of the Agreement.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals set out in paragraph 10 of C. (53) 181.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to be instructed accordingly.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theCanadian Government to be kept informed of this approach to the United States Administration.Education. 6.   The Cabinet were informed that on 1st July the House of(Previous        Commons was to debate a report on the Education Services by the reference:      Select Committee on Estimates, and that the Opposition had tabledC.C. (53) 24th   a motion inviting the House .to approve that report.  The report was conclusions,    a somewhat critical document, and it would be embarrassing to minute 8.)       the Government if the House endorsed it without comment.  It wastherefore agreed that the Government should table an i mendmenthaving the effect that the motion would invite the House, while accepting the report, to welcome at the same time the action already taken by the Government.The Cabinet invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Education, for the tabling of an amendmenton the lines indicated in the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th June, 1953.
