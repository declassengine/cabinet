Civil AviatioB.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 95thConclusions,Minute 2.)Flights byMembers ofParliament.1. The Prime Minister said that his attention had been drawn toa proposal that a party of forty Members of Parliament should makea demonstration flight in one of the new Viscount aircraft which wereshortly to be put into commercial service by British European Air-ways. It had seemed to him that this proposal held no publicadvantage and considerable political risks. He thought it indefensiblethat large numbers of Members should be unnecessarily exposed tothe risk of flying in new types of aircraft. He had therefore asked theMinister of Transport to arrange for this project to be abandoned.The Minister of Transport said that on this occasion he had beenable to meet the Prime Ministers wishes by negotiation with british european Airways, which was under his control. But it was possiblethat private companies, or aircraft manufacturers, might in future seek to arrange similar flights; and, if it was desired that some limit shouldbe imposed on the number of Members of Parliament who were to flyon such occasions in a single aircraft, the limit should be settled, andin the main enforced, by the political parties themselves.After discussion it was agreed that, if in future Members of Parlia-rnent were asked to participate in demonstration flights in new types of civil aircraft, not more than four Members (two&quot;from each of themain political parties) should fly in a single aircraft. The cabinet invited the Chief Whip to discuss with the Opposition, through theusual channels, whether they were content that this limitation shouldbe imposed, and by what means it could best be enforced.Japan. 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Common-Trade with the wealth Secretary (C. (53) 88), and by the Economic Secretary to the sterling Area. Treasury (C. (53) 91) regarding the current state of Japan&apos;s trade with(Previous        the sterling area.Reference: The Commonwealth Secretary said, that Japan was now in sub-C.C. (53) 8th stantial deficit with the sterling area and that, in accordance with conclusions, the terms of our Sterling Payments Agreement with Japan, we were minute 6.) bound to take all reasonable steps to prevent or correct this lack of balance. This meant that there would have to be some reduction ofthe restrictions on Japanese imports into the sterling area. It wouldbe politically difficult to allow imports of cheap Japanese cloth intothe United Kingdom at a moment when the Lancashire textile tradewas doing its utmost to compete with the Japanese in cheap cloth.It would also be very much against our interests to ask Australia andNew Zealand to remove restrictions which they had recently imposed on Japanese imports. The Japanese could, however, increase their sterling earnings if the Colonies were allowed in 1953 to increase their&quot;imports from Japan by about 20 per cent., and if imports into HongKong and Singapore for re-export outside the sterling area werelicensed freely, subject to the necessary strategic controls. It was unlikely that these concessions would satisfy the Japanese, but at leastthey offered a starting-point for negotiations. It was desirable, thatit should be a condition of any concessions that the Japanese should undertake to refrain from imposing further restrictions on importsfrom the sterling area.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was no doubt that any relaxation of import restrictionson Japanese goods in the United Kingdom would meet with serious criticism. On the other hand, it was in the interests of the sterling area as a whole that there should be a balance in the trade between the sterling area and Japan, and that Japan should conduct the major part of her trade in sterling. This view had the support of the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had telegraphedtheir opinions from Washington (Washington telegram No. 520).(b) The Americans would certainly find it hard to understandhow we could at one and the same time continue to impose import43914-2 b 2
Education.Expenditure onAdult Studies.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 11thConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (53) 82) covering a copy of a letter in which Sir VincentTewson had conveyed to the Prime Minister the concern of theTrades Union Congress at the proposed reduction of the grants madeto unofficial bodies providing facilities for adult education in subjectssuch as economics, literature, psychology and the arts.The Prime Minister said that this letter was written on theassumption that a decision had already been taken to reduce thesegrants. He read to the Cabinet a draft of the reply which he proposedto send. This made it clear that no such decision had yet been taken,that the enquiries which the Minister was making were designed toensure that value was obtained for the money spent, and that ingeneral the Government were fully seized of the important contri-bution which adult education made to the national life.The Minister of Education said that, subject to one or two smallamendments, she fully endorsed the terms of the reply which thePrime Minister proposed to send to this letter.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Education Estimates,which were now being printed, would show that in the coming financial year a reduction of  27,000 was to be made in the grants for this type of adult studies, though the expenditure on adulteducation as a whole would show an increase. If the current politicalcriticisms were to be handled on the basis that no decision had yetbeen taken to reduce the grants made for adult studies of this kind,the provision for them made in the Estimates for the coming year should not be less than that made in the preceding year: indeed,there would be some advantage in making a slightly larger provision.restrictions on Japanese goods without any justification on balanceof payments grounds, and try to persuade them to extend good-creditor policies towards us.(c) The Japanese would find it virtually impossible to give ahundertaking to refrain from imposing further restrictions on sterling area imports, since their own balance of payments difficulties were so great that they would be obliged to resort to further import restric-tions in some form. There was, however, no reason why we shouldnot ask for some assurance at the start of the negotiations.(d) The Paymaster-General pointed out that the Japanese hadaccumulated a considerable dollar surplus and that they might beinvited to use this surplus to buy sterling. &apos; It was urged, on the otherhand, that this would be contrary to the spirit of the Sterling payments agreement.The Prime Minister said that the proposals put forward in theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s paper could be regarded as a starting-point for the negotiations. If, as seemed likely, they proved unaccept-able to the Japanese, our negotiators should be instructed to make every effort to dissuade them from imposing further restrictions, andto report back the minimum terms which they thought necessary tosecure a settlement.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to instruct our negotiators in tokyo (i) to put forward as a starting-point for the negotia-tions the proposals contained in the memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (53) 88, paragraphs 5 and 6);(ii) to press the Japanese to agree in return to refrain fromimposing further restrictions on imports from the sterling area at the present time; and (iii) to report back if theseproposals were rejected, and suggest the minimum termsnecessary to secure a settlement.
Education. 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary(Previous of State for Scotland and the Minister of Education (C. (53) 55), the reference: Paymaster-General (C. (53) 86) and the Financial Secretary, TreasuryC.C. (53) 18th (C. (53) 94) on the question whether legislation should be introducedConclusions, to increase the contributions payable to teachers and educationMinute 3.) authorities towards the cost of teachers&apos; superannuation.Teachers&apos; ^ne Cabinet were informed that these contributions were notSuperannuation Pa^ *nt0 any superannuation fund but were appropriated in aid of&apos; the Education Votes against which the superannuation benefits werecharged. The Teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts contemplated, how-ever, that contributions should meet the cost of benefits; and theGovernment Actuary had estimated that, owing largely to increases in teachers&apos; salaries, there would be an actuarial deficit of about 188 millions on 31st March. It was proposed that the accountsshould be balanced by raising the contribution rate from 10 per cent,to 12 per cent, of salary, which would meet about  68 millions of theactuarial deficit, and accepting the remaining  119 millions as a long-term liability on the Exchequer.In discussion it was pointed out that this legislation would be opposed, not only by the teachers, but also by the education authori-ties, who had asked that, before amending legislation was introduced,there should be a comprehensive review of the working of the teachers&apos; Superannuation Acts. The Cabinet were also informed thatthe Parliamentary time-table would not in any event permit of this legislation being passed during the current session. It would admittedly be difficult to explain the actuarial calculations on whichthe proposals for increasing the contributions were based; and some ministers doubted whether those calculations were in all respectsdefensible. The position would be clarified and some of the oppo-sition to increasing contributions might be reduced if an enquiry intothe working of the Acts could be hold, as the education authoritiesdesired, before the legislation was introduced; and, if the Bill couldnot in any event be taken until the following session, there would betime to hold such an enquiry. Meanwhile, the Government would benefit by their experience in Parliamentary discussion of the cognateproblems which were dealt with in the local Government Super-annuation Bill now before Parliament.This would not prejudice the Cabinefs ultimate decision on theamount of the expenditure actually to be incurred, which would notbe taken until the Minister of Education had completed her examina-tion of the facilities which the unofficial bodies concerned were proposing to provide for these adult studies in the coming year.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would reply to the TradesUnion Congress in the terms of the draft which he had read to the Cabinet, subject to some minor amendments to be suggested by the Minister of Education.(2) Agreed that the Education Estimates for the coming year should include provision for grants for adult studies ofthis type slightly larger than the provision made for themin the preceding year; and invited the Financial Secretary,Treasury, to arrange for the Estimates to be adjustedaccordingly.(3) Agreed to consider what grants should actually be made inrespect of these services in the coming financial year whenthe Minister of Education had completed her examinationof the facilities which the unofficial bodies concerned were proposing to provide for these adult studies.,
Kenya. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the(Previous Cabinet (C. (53) 92) covering a report by the Chief of the ImperialReference: General Staff on his recent visit to Kenya, and setting out theC.C. (53) 3rd conclusions reached by the Defence Committee on consideration of conclusions,     this report.minute 2.) jne prlme Minister said that the Defence Committee had agreedto recommend to the Cabinet that arrangements should be made toenable one infantry brigade headquarters and two infantry battalionsto leave the United Kingdom for Kenya in the near future. Theyhad also agreed that arrangements should be made for the earlydespatch to Kenya of three Harvard aircraft from Southern rhodesia and further transport aircraft from Aden. He hoped that the cabinet would endorse these recommendations.In discussion attention was drawn to the further recommenda-tions made by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff for the estab-lishment of a small emergency Council, facilities to enable theGovernor and the Provincial and District Commissioners to enlargetheir contacts, the extension of the regular police force and of the intelligence organisation, and the expansion by the Colonial Govern-ments concerned of their battalions of the King&apos;s African Rifles. TheColonial Secretary indicated that he accepted these recommendations.The Cabinet-(1) Confirmed the decisions taken by the Defence committee regarding the despatch of reinforcements to Kenya.(2) Approved the further recommendations made by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff in paragraph 11 (a)-(d) ofthe Annex to C. (53) 92.Armed Forces.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 104thConclusions,Minute 3.)Concessions forMarriedServicemenOverseas.6. The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that in accordancewith the decisions of the Defence Committee special allowances wereto be made to married men in the Army and the Royal Air Force whowere serving overseas without their families. The question had arisenwhether these allowances should be extended to married men in theRoyal Navy who were serving overseas, without their families, in naval establishments ashore. The cost would be  100,000 in a year.The concessions should not be allowed to prejudice discussions whichwere now proceeding between the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe First Lord of the Admiralty about special overseas allowances formen serving afloat.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he hoped the cabinet would authorise an immediate concession to men serving ashore in naval establishments overseas without waiting for the conclusion ofthe current discussions on allowances for men serving afloat. Thesmall amount of money involved could be found within the existingEstimates, and the number of men concerned was very small.The Prime Minister said that conditions had not changed in theNavy as they had in the Army and in the Royal Air Force.   TheThe Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation amending the Teachers&apos; Superannua-tion Acts should not be introduced during the current session.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Education to arrange for an enquiry to be instituted,on the lines desired by the education authorities, into theworking of the existing Acts governing the superannuationof teachers.
Navy was based on a system of long-term engagements and was essentially an overseas Service. Concessions made to the Army andthe Royal Air Force were therefore not necessarily applicable to theNavy. If the rates of pay of men serving ashore were increased, itwould be difficult to resist claims for similar allowances for men serving afloat. He thought it would be wiser to leave matters as theywere. He was willing, however, that the Minister of Defence should discuss the matter with the First Lord of the Admiralty and theFinancial Secretary, Treasury, to see if any acceptable solution couldbe proposed.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to discuss with the FirstLord of the Admiralty and the Financial Secretary, Treasury,the question of extending to married men serving in royal navy establishments overseas the overseas allowances madeto married men in the Army and the Royal Air Force.7. The Colonial Secretary said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision of 3rd March, he had discussed with the Minister&apos; of Housing and the Paymaster-General what increase in the price of milk should be offered to dairy farmers in the current review of farm prices. The Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Food had attended these discussions. All these Ministers had supported thefollowing recommendations:  (i) The total award which the Minister of Agriculture proposedto make in the Farm Price Review was  16 - 9 millions. No matter what the course of the negotiations, there should be no increase of this total.(ii) The Minister of Agriculture should insist, as an essential part of any agreement, that there should be no increase in the supportprice for cereals, a significant under-recoupment of the increased costs of pig-raising, a reduction in the price of wool, and a level of supportprice for eggs below what the farmers wished.(iii) The total sum which the Minister of Agriculture proposedto award for the increased costs of milk production was approximately 5 millions. It would be more in the national interest if this sumwere devoted to the encouragement of increased beef production. If,however, the farmers insisted that some contribution should be madeto milk, the Minister of Agriculture should offer in the first place Id.a gallon and should be empowered to increase this to \d. if the nego-tiations made this essential. He should not, however, offer an increaseof more than \d. a gallon for milk without further reference to theCabinet.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations made by the colonial secretary as set out above, and authorised the Minister ofAgriculture to continue his negotiations with the farmerson this basis.8. The Secretary of State for Air said that the Danish Govern-ment now proposed to hand back to the Polish Government at anearly date the Russian MIG-15 aircraft- which had been flown intoDenmark by a Polish pilot who had sought asylum in thai country.He understood that the aircraft was to be handed back on 16th March.This gave little time for examination by experts, and no opportunityfor testing the aircrafts flight capabilities. Moreover, the danish government had so far refused permission for any examination ofthe aircraft by British or American experts.
In discussion it was pointed out that strong pressure was being brought to bear on the Danish Government to return this aircraft to poland. It was reported that the Poles were seizing Danish fishing vessels as a reprisal. It might therefore be difficult to persuade the danes to delay any further the return of the aircraft, but every effort should be made to induce them to agree that it should first beinspected by British and American experts.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to bring further pressure onThe Danish Government to delay the return of the MlG-15aircraft to Poland for as long as possible; and in the mean-time to grant full facilities for its inspection and, if possible,for the testing of its flight capabilities by British and american experts.Colonial Office, S.W.1,10th March, 1953.
