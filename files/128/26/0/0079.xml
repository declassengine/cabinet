S7J+industrial disputes.Railways.(previous reference:CC. (53) 78thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Minister of Labour said that the British transport commission had informed him that morning that they were now prepared to modify the offer which he had reported to the Cabineton the previous day, in the hope that it might prove acceptable tothe National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.). They were ready tostate that, in their review of the wage and salary structure, they would start their examination by hearing the case for the lower grades;and, while they could not take decisions on those until they had completed the whole review, they would be prepared to hold a pre-liminary meeting before Christmas and to pursue the matter with allspeed thereafter. The Minister had arranged to see representativesof the N.U.R. that afternoon and would make every effort to persuade them to accept this amended offer. The Chairman of the commission was satisfied that some further improvement would have to be madein the pay of the lower grades, and he believed that the cost of asettlement would be heavy. He saw no early prospect of recoupingthis by increased efficiency.The Prime Minister said that he had been wondering whetherthe Government might not help in this by relieving the Commissionof some part of the interest charges with which they had been saddledon nationalisation. If a part of the capital sum were transferred tothe National Debt, the Railway Staff National Tribunal could then beinvited to review railwaymen&apos;s wages in the light of this improve-ment in the financial position of the railways. A dramatic gestureof this kind might avert the threatened strike. Could it not be justified on the basis that the price paid to railway shareholders on nationalisa-tion had laid on the nationalised undertaking an intolerable burdenof fixed interest?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the facts would not support this argument. The fixed interest charge which the national-ised undertaking had to meet was about  30 million a year; butthe annual charge on the railway companies before nationalisation,in fixed interest and dividends, had averaged about  35 millions.Even if, for the purposes of this argument, dividends on ordinary shares were excluded, it would probably be found that the fixedinterest charges were little greater now than they had been beforenationalisation. If some or all of the capital sum were transferredto the National Debt, the interest payable would come into theBudget above the line; and, if this operation were undertaken forthe purpose of improving railwaymen&apos;s wages, this would be seen tobe a direct Exchequer subsidy in support of wages in a nationalised industry. This would indeed set a dangerous precedent for the future.The Chancellor added that he would continue to consider whether there was any other means by which he could help to put the Corn-mission in a position to improve the earnings of the lower grades of railwaymen.The Home Secretary said that, in order to complete theirpreparations for maintaining essential services during a railway strike,some Departments would shortly need to enter into consultation withoutside interests. The Ministry of Transport would wish to makedetailed plans with the British Transport Commission and with british european Airways; and the Ministry of Health were anxious to consult with Regional Hospital Boards. If, however, these consulta-tions were held, it was not certain that they could be kept secret; anddisclosure of the fact that the Government were already preparing tomaintain essential services might prejudice the efforts which were still being made to avert the strike. The Minister of Labour said that, fromthis point of view, he would prefer that no decision to begin these consultations should be taken until the following day.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the present state of the negotiations in therailway wages dispute.45391-1b 2
5ysTelevisionDevelopment.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 77thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Cabinet considered what line the Government spokes-men should take, in the concluding stages of the House of commons debate on television policy, in dealing with the Opposition^suggestion that the Government might discuss with representatives ofthe other political Parties the possibility of,reaching some agreementconsistent with the principle of a public television service.The Home Secretary said that this suggestion should be rejected.It would be a mistake, at this late stage in the controversy, to throwthe whole issue open for discussion between the Parties. TheGovernment should stand firmly by the two principles underlyingtheir White Paper, viz., that in television the monopoly of the british broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.) should be broken; and that commercial companies operating television programmes in compe-tition with the B.B.C. should derive at least some part of theirrevenue from advertisements. The Government should invite theHouse of Commons to endorse these two principles in the division atthe end of the present debate. It could be made clear that, once this had been done, the Government would be ready to consider, in thepreparation of the necessary legislation, any detailed suggestions thatmight be put forward.The Cabinet Endorsed the views expressed by the Home Secretary and invited him to speak in this sense in replying to the debate inthe House of Commons later in the day.Egypt. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that, in pursuance of their defence decision of the previous day, arrangements had now been made for negotiations.    private meetings tobe held, before the Foreign Affairs debate on 17th(Previous        December, at which the military facts underlying the GovernmenfsReference:      policy in the current defence negotiations with Egypt would beC.C.

Ten of the minute 2.)       leaders of this group had been invited to attend a private dinner that evening at which General Sir Brian Robertson would explain theposition to them.  A larger meeting of about 40 Members, including some belonging to the Foreign Affairs group of the conservative party, would be held on 16th December, outside the Plouse ofCommons: the Minister of Defence would speak at this meeting, theLord Privy Seal would preside and the Secretary of State for war might also be present.The Chief Whip said that there was some risk that, despite these arrangements, a motion critical of the Governmenfs policy mightbe tabled before the meetings had been held. The Prime minister thought that no special steps need be taken to prevent this thoughit was to be hoped that, as a result of the meetings, fewer Govern-ment supporters would add their names to the motion and nonewould wish to press it to a division.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider whether there were any means by which he couldassist the British Transport Commission to meet the claim for improved wages for the lower grades of railwaymen.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to determine, in conjunction withthe Minister of Labour, when consultations could safely beundertaken with outside interests on the measures necessary to maintain essential services in the event of astrike.

Inland 4 y/he Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Postmaster-Telegraph GeneraFs proposals (C. (53) 340) for increased charges for inlandService. telegrams. They also had before them a further memorandum by(Previous the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (53) 353) suggesting certain reference: variations in the proposals put forward by the Postmaster-General.C.C. (53) 77thConclusions. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he acceptedMinute 6.) &apos; tne neec&apos; ror increased charges, he feared that the proposal to increasethe minimum day-time charge from Is. 6d. to 3s. would meet withwidespread criticism. He therefore proposed that the minimum,charge should not exceed 2s. 6c/., or preferably 2s., and that the bulkof the increased revenue required should be raised by increasing thecharge for words additional to the first 12. He also suggested thatthe Press should pay the full cost of their telegrams.The Postmaster-General said that he was willing to considerwhether further revenue might be raised from the Press. But he feared that the other suggestion was not practicable, since the great bulk of the ordinary telegram traffic consisted of messages of 12 wordsor less.In further discussion it was recognised that this proposed increasein telegram charges was likely to provoke substantial criticism. Itwas suggested that the impact on public opinion might be less if theincrease were announced as part of the Budget, when it would take its place among other changes affecting personal habits and expenditure.As against this it was argued that the inclusion of this change in theBudget might revive the criticism that the Treasury were using PostOffice services as a means of raising revenue, instead of allowing themto be operated on a commercial basis.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the minimum day-time charge forinland telegrams should be increased, certainly to 2s. bcl.and possibly to 3s.; and approved the other changes in telegram charges proposed by the Postmaster-General inC. (53) 340, subject to his consideration of a further increase in the charges for Press telegrams.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Postmaster-General, to decide whether the standard,minimum charge should be raised to Is. 6cl. or to 3s., andwhether this and the other changes proposed should be announced in the Budget or separately from it.The Cabinet Took note of the arrangements which hud been made toexplain, to Government supporters who had shown anxiety about the outcome of the current defence negotiations with egypt, the military facts underlying the government&apos;s policy in the conduct of those negotiations.
Kenya. 6.   The Secretary of State for War said that he had consultedCouriMartial with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General on the questionof Captain whether further proceedings could be taken against Captain Griffiths.Grilliihs. It vvas their opinion that, on the evidence brought out during his trial(Previous for murder, charges could be brought against him for attemptedReference:       murder, or for causing grievous bodily harm, or for causing bodilyCC. (53) 77th    harm contrary to Section 18 of the Army Act.   These charges would conclusions,     relate to the second African, for whose murder Captain GHfhths had minute?..)        not been tried.   The question whether further charges should be preferred against him rested in the discretion of the Commander-in-Chief in Kenya.-. The Legal Department in Kenya which advised theCommander-in-Chief, would, however, be informed that it was theview of the legal authorities in this country that these charges would lie and il would be for the Commander-in-Chief to decide whetherall or any of them should be preferred.The Cabinet Took nole of this statement by the Secretary of State forWar.I rial of Naval 7.   The Prune Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to theKaunas in sentences imposed on two sailors in the Royal Navy who had recentlySingapore. been convicted in Singapore for robbing a taxi-driver. One had been sentenced to ten strokes and two years&apos; rigorous imprisonment, andthe other to ten strokes and four years&apos; rigorous imprisonment. Thetwo men seemed to have been advised not to appeal. These weresevere sentences, and public opinion in this country might be outragedat this degrading treatment of British sailors.
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the two men had been convicted of robbery with violence and sentenced by a British judge in a British civil court. They had been defended by an Englishbarrister. They had been discouraged from appealing because itwas thought that their sentences might be increased on appeal especially if it was disclosed, as it had not been at the original trial,that their naval records were highly unsatisfactory and that theircrime was deliberately planned in advance. The Hogging would be administered by the civil police: it could not be administered bytheir own ship&apos;s company, even if the civil authorities would agree tothis, since flogging had been abolished in the Royal Navy.The Colonial Secretary said that he had called for a report onthe matter, but he would be very reluctant to offer the Governor anyadvice on his responsibilities in connection, with the exercise ofclemency in a criminal case.The Flome Secretary said that robbery with violence was rightlyregarded as a very serious offence. In this country he would certainly not be disposed to interfere with a sentence of two or four years&apos;imprisonment for such an offence as this.The Cabinet Took note that the Colonial Secretary would report to thePrime Minister whether the Governor of Singapore decidedto mitigate, by the exercise of clemency, the sentencesimposed on these two British sailors.Uganda 8.   The Colonial Secretary said that it now seemed likely thatProtectorate.    the ex-Kabaka of Buganda, on the advice of his English friends,(Previous        would abandon his opposition to the demands made upon him, and reference:      give the assurances for which he had been asked.   In the meantime,&quot;CC. (53) 76th   however the Governor of Uganda had had sent home by the handConclusions,    0f his Chief Secretary a full report on the ex-Kabaka&apos;s private life.Minute 1.)       The facts disclosed in this report put it quite out of the question thatthe ex-Kabaka should be allowed to return to his country.   TheColonial Secretary said that he would take steps to make these factsknown, in confidence, to Government supporters who were encouragement-aging the ex-Kabaka to give the required assurances in order tofacilitate his return, and to the Archbishop of Canterbury, who hadintervened with the same object. To the ex-Kabaka himself he would say that, as he had broken faith before, his word could no longer beaccepted and he could not return to Buganda.   In defending thisdecision in Parliament, he would use the same argument and would avoid direct reference to. the further facts now in his possession aboutthe ex-Kabaka&apos;s private life.   He was seeing the ex-Kabaka on.17th December but, if the required assurances were then offered, hewould not pronounce a final decision until about a week later.   Inthe meantime, the Governor of Uganda had reported that thesituation in the Protectorate was satisfactory and that a new Kabakawould probably be elected in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the Colonial Secretary&apos;s intention to refuse toallow the ex-Kabaka to return to Buganda.(2) Approved the course of action proposed by the colonial secretary and the line which he intended to take in defending his decision in Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th December, 1953.
