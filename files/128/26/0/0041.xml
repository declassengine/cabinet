2oyParliament        - l.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that, in a debate on 16th July on the economic&apos;, v &apos;,1      development of under-developed countries, the Government spokes-men should be the Colonial1 Secretary and a Foreign Office Minister.Parliament. 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that Opposition Leaders had nowSalaries of   &apos;   agreed that the proposed Select Committee to review the remunera-Members..       tion of Members of the House of Commons should be a fact-finding(Previous  &apos; ,   body with no authority to make recommendations.  It was contem-Reference:    , plated that the motion to appoint a Select Committee would be putC.C. (53) 3lst   down by a group of back-benchers of all parties and approved with-Conclusionsr    out debate.  He invited the. views of his colleagues on three alterna-Minute3.)      -five draft motions, one by the All-Party Members&apos; Committee,another by the Opposition, and a third which he had himself prepared in consultation with the Chief Whip: , This third draft was in thefollowing terms:--; &quot; That a Select Committee be appointed to consider/andreport upon the nature-and extent of the expenditure incurred by Members of this House in the performance of their duties and&apos; . upon the practice of Commonwealth and foreign Parliaments&apos;Tor meeting comparable expenditure incurred by their Members, . &apos; &quot;    in this field.&quot;i , The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this1 draft seemed tobe the most suitable of the three, though it might perhaps be improved by the inclusion of a reference to the Members&apos; Fund. If the cabinet agreed, steps would be taken to try to obtain support for this draftfrom the Opposition Leaders and from Government supporters.,. &apos; The Cabinet-&quot; - . &apos;.V ,-; , -- &quot;&quot;&quot;, Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord privy seal to ascertain informally whether there would be a sub-&apos;. . stantial measure of support in1 all Parties for a motion onthe lines of.the draft set out above, subject to the inclusion&apos;   - of a reference to the Members&apos; Fund; and, if so, to arrange-       1 for it to be tabled by a number of back-benchers of all.   .  Parties. : : , &apos;-&apos; :Television&apos; 3. The. Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he. hoped that,Development. at the discussion on television development which Ministers were(Previous having with the 1922 Committee that evening, it would be possible&apos;Reference: to satisfy the Committee on the basis of the statement made inC.C. (53) 38th Parliament on 2nd July. Government supporters seemed likely, how-Conclusions, ever, to press for (i) confirmation that the Government still favouredMinute4.) the principle of competition in television; and (ii) freedom to engage in publicity in favour of competitive television.&apos; : On the first point, he proposed to take the line that the Govern-&apos;  . ment still stood by the 1952 White Paper but that, in conformity.withthe terms of that document, the final decision would be taken whenthe conditions of licences were submitted to Parliament. He would&apos; point out that, if. the Government had tried to force matters to a finaldecision at this juncture,&apos;they might well have been defeated and thatthe ultimate decision would depend on how good a case could be,established for issuing licences and how effectively&apos; that case was presented. .    .        &apos;..On the second point, there could be no question of attempting to&apos; discourage or.curtail propaganda by the Party&apos;s newly-formed Radio&apos;/. and Television Committee. , But publicity by the Conservative Central

The, Cabinet should considerbefore the summer recess suggestions by the Postmaster-General -regarding the general line to be adopted in the further White paper which was to be presented in the autumn.The Cabinet  -&apos; -   -    &apos; -  -(1) Approved the line: which.the Chancellor of the Exchequer&quot;. proposed to take in discussing &quot;this question with Govern-&apos; ment supporters in the 1922 Committee.(2) Invited the. Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the. v   Commonwealth Secretary to arrange that Party publicityon this question.should be kept within the limits proposed&apos;       :   by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
27C.C. 41 (S3)Recognition of.Post (Mice StairAssociations.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 32nd .Conclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Minister of Labour&apos;said that, in pursuance&apos; of the cabinets conclusion of 19th May, he and the Postmaster-General had met members of the Executive of the 1922 Committee and of theLabour Committee of the Conservative Party and had explained tothem the difficulties which would arise if recognition were accorded to the Engineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association(E.O.T.A.). They thought that they had satisfied these government supporters that there was a strong case oh -merits for declining to accord recognition to E.O.T.A. But it was evident that some members of the. Party in the House of Commons would feel difficultyin supporting a decision to withhold recognition, because of the pledges which they had given when in:opposition.The-Chief Whip said that in the circumstances it was desirablethat the two Ministers should explain the position at a full meetingof the 1922 Committee&apos;.     .   . ......The Cabinet-Invited the Chief Whip to arrange for . the Minister ofLabour and the Postmaster-General to explain to the 1922Committee the reasons for the Governments intention to withhold recognition of -&quot; breakaway &quot; unions in the&apos; PostOffice.Coal&apos;-&apos; 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryProduction. - of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and the(Previous - Minister^ Fuel and PowerPC. (53) .193) suggesting that the NationalReference:   * Coal Board should&quot; be authorised to import 1 million tons of largeCC. (53) 35uV coal from Europe.              -        conclusions, .,. The Cabinet were informed, that the Coronation celebrations,,&apos;Minute 3.). and. the additional week&apos;s annual holiday which the miners were now
taking for the first time, would together have the effect of reducingcoal production by about 4-7 million tons.&apos; In addition, there hadbeen some loss of output through poor attendance; and there had also been a fall in open-cast production. Meanwhile, industrial con-sumption of coal was increasing. . As a result we were now threatened with a shortage of coal, particularly large coal, in the coming winter.To avert this it would be necessary either to curtail the export of coalor to import large coal from Europe.&apos; Curtailment of exports wouldinvolve the cancellation of contracts and would impair the long-termprospects of our export trade in coal. It was therefore recommendedthat the National Coal Board should be authorised to import a limited amount of large coal from Europe.   . :  ,In discussion there was general agreement that, in the circum-stances disclosed in C. (53) 193, it would be justifiable to import alimited amount of coal from abroad. It would &quot;however be a shock to public opinion in this country to find that we were again obligedto import coal, and the presentation of this decision would need care-ful handling. This point was stressed in a minute from the PrimeMinister, which was read to the Cabinet. It was important, fromthe point of viewof foreign policy, that the imports should be drawn from countries included in the European Coal and Steel community and not from Poland. The Commupity had already discussed theadvantages of exchanges,of different types,of coal between  differentEuropean countries; and the importation of large coal from Europecould be presented as part of that association between the UnitedKingdom and the Community which the Government had under-Taken to foster. This opportunity should also be taken to stress theneed, for-increased output by the miners in this country.The Cabinet-        &apos; &apos;(1) Authorised, the Minister of.-Fuel and Power to import,through the agency of the National Coal Board, not morethan .1 million tons of large coal from countries includedin the European Coal and Steel Community; but took-. , ; note that the Minister would not in the first instanceauthorise&apos;the Board to &apos;buy &apos;more than \ million tonsand would use his discretion to7buy only so much of theremaining \ million tons as proved necessary to supple-,.   ment prospective home supplies.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power to concert with the Commonwealth Secretary and the lord privy Seal the form and timing of the public announce-ment. of this decision, bearing in mind the points of presentation mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion.Discussion then turned on the long-term prospects of coal pro-duction in this country.&apos; &apos; Serious-misgivings were expressed about these, and the following particular points were made:  (a) Increased mechanisation was changing the proportion oflarge and small coal within our total production. But no corres-ponding change was taking place in the pattern of demand. A serious situation was bound to arise unless the National Coal Board were able to produce a higher proportion of large coal or some consumersaccustomed themselves to,using more small coal. It was possiblethat the Coal&apos;Board concerned themselves too much with total pro-duction, and not enough with the production of the particular types and qualities required.&apos;&apos; &apos;  &apos; &apos;(b) The country as a whole was extravagant in its use of coal.The British railways made&apos;greater use&apos;of large coal than any railwayselsewhere in the world. And there was certainly great extravagancein the domestic consumption of coal.(c) In recent years The. Coal Board had spent less on capital investment, in proportion to, output, than any other country in
8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum&apos; by thePresident of the Board,of Trade (C..(53) 195) suggesting methods ofenlisting United States support for a modification of the rule of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) prohibiting!Commonwealth countries&apos; from increasing margins of preference intheir trade with one another.&quot; . .\,     i, -     ,&apos;   , &apos;v The President of the Board of Trade said that the operation of&quot;the &quot; nornew-preference &quot; rule in the G.A.T.T., combined with theobligations under &apos; the Ottawa&apos; Agreements -Act, had the effect of&apos;freezing the United Kingdom tariff. This was a matter of increasingconcern, as we sought to substitute a system of tariffs for a systemof quotas. The immediate problem was to give effect to the cabinets decision to impose horticultural tariff s, which could not be done unless we obtained a waiver of the -V no-new-preference &quot;. rule. We were unlikely to , obtain this waiver at the meeting of the G.A.T.T. inSeptember without United States support and we should not secure this support without making&apos; considerable concessions.H.M. Ambassador had already held informal, discussions with the americans at.which he had offered two concessions: (i) not toapply the waiver to items on.which the duties were for the timebeing &quot; bound &quot;; and (ii) to attach to the waiver a clause providing that if waiver of the rule led in any particular case to a substantialdiversion of trade from a foreign to a Commonwealth country, theforeign country would be entitled to seek authority in the G.A.T.T.to suspend equivalent, concessions or obligations towards us., these concessions had proved insufficient to win American support and he now proposed that H.M. Ambassador in Washington should alsobe authorised to offer to exclude from the waiver goods which werecharged with duty under the Ottawa Agreements Act..    ..\    ,.,In discussion the following points were made:-..&apos; (a) The offer of the additional concession would rob the waiver ofa&apos;considerable amount of its value and was less than the rest of theCommonwealth had expected us to ask , for. On the other hand,other Commonwealth countries. would not themselves suffer by its inclusion.&apos; (b)-It was doubtful whether the Americans would support outrequest, even if this additional concession were offered. It was agreed,however, that if the Americans refused-1 their support, we should be free to try-to negotiate a waiver at the meeting of the G.A.T.T. inEurope. The Chancellor of&apos;&quot; the Exchequer said that more wouldhave to be spent on development in the mining&apos; industry, and hewas ready to consider proposals to that end.; (d) There was evidently need for a more vigorous policy in developing our coal resources, and Ministers must consider all practi-cable measures for that purpose,.including measures for increasingthe efficiency of the National. Coal Board.(e) Though supplies of deep-mined coal must continue for a timeto be supplemented by open-cast production^ we should not rely upon the latter as a permanent element in our coal production policy.It should be our aim to dispense with it at the earliest possible opportunity and, meanwhile, to ensure that it did not involve avoid-able loss of good agricultural land! &apos; -V -The Cabinet     ,;       C ,(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power tosubmit, before . the summer recess, a memorandum on1 the long-term prospects of coal production and consump-tion&apos;taking account of the various points raised in the\       Cabinefs discussion-. .
mm1 ; -   September in any way in which we. thought best, and should not be\   -     .: r     . , bound by concessions which we had suggested in discussions with the:       Americans.     . -   /-&apos;..  (c) The view was expressed that it might be preferable to continue&apos;    - quota protection for another year, or to seek to secure tariff adjust-&apos; .      :    ... :   ^-merits,, by. ad. hoc individual negotiation until a more favourable opportunity arose for securing American support for a general waiver. ,:- .; This might occur if the Americans decided, as a result of a study oftheir external economic policy, to propose a general re-negotiation, of the G.A.T.T.  It was. pointed out, on the other :hand, that quota- &apos; protection would not satisfy the National Farmers&apos;Union, who hadalready been told that we had decided in favour of a tariff increase,that we should never obtain tariff adjustments by individual negotia-tion without unacceptable sacrifices and loss of time, and that therewas no guarantee that the Americans.would seek to re-negotiate the, G.A.T.T. Moreover, the matter was urgent, since it would be difficult: - to resist pressure from the National Farmers- Union and from government supporters beyond the end of the year.     . ., . The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the balance of opinion in the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of authorising the President ofthe Board of Trade to seek to secure American support by offering to&apos; exclude from the waiver goods which were charged for duty under the ottawa Agreements Act,   - ...The Cabinet- t   . , ^ \- Agreed that H.M. Ambassador in Washington should now.        ; be, instructed to try to secure American support for a. -     waiver of the &quot; nornew-preference &quot; rule under the G.A.T.T. :^ : - ... by offering, in addition to the concessions already proposed,&apos; ]i        &apos; to exclude from the waiver goods which were, charged for..  &apos; duty under the Ottawa Agreements Act. ^ &quot; &apos;., ,Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,. &apos;   9th July, J953..
