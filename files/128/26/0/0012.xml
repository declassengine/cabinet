Sudan. 1,   The Foreign Secretary recalled that in the Anglo-Egyptian(Previous Agreement on the future of the Sudan the choice which was ultimatelyReference: to be made by the Sudanese Constituent Assembly on self-determina-C.C. (53) 10th tion was expressed as a choice between affiliation with Egypt or conclusions.) complete independence. After the statement which he had made onthe Agreement in the House of Commons on 12th February he hadbeen asked whether the Sudan would be free at that stage to choosesome form of association with this country. He had said in reply that this was included within the alternative of independence; for anindependent country had the right to apply for membership of theBritish Commonwealth or for association with it. This reply hadreceived unfavourable notice in Egypt; and General Neguib had nowdeclared that he would regard the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement asinvalidated if any attempt were made to bring the Sudan within theBritish Commonwealth. Captain Waterhouse, M.P., had given notice that he would raise this matter in the House of Commons that afternoon. The Foreign Secretary said that he had no alternative but to adhere to his earlier statement that if, when the time came, theSudan opted for independence it would be open to them thereafter to apply for membership of the Commonwealth. He recognised,however, that his repetition of this view might occasion furtherunfavourable comment in Cairo.The Cabinet-Endorsed the line which the Foreign Secretary proposed tofollow in dealing with further questions in the House ofCommons about the possibility of the Sudan&apos;s futureassociation with the British Commonwealth.Egypt. 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignDefence Secretary (C. (53) 17 Revise) on the resumption of defence negotia-Negotiations. tions with Egypt, which they had previously considered on(Previous 14th January, and a further memorandum by the Foreign SecretaryReference: (C. (53) 65) summarising some of the main arguments in favour ofC.C. (53) 2nd seeking an agreement on the lines indicated in his earlierConclusions,    memorandum.Minute l.) The Cabinet first discussed the nature of the proposed agreementoutlined in C. (53) 17 Revise. It was emphasised that what was contemplated was a general settlement comprising (i) a phased withdrawal of British troops from Egypt;(ii) maintenance of the military base in the Canal Zone in peaceunder conditions which would enable us and our Allies tohave immediate use of it in war;(iii) an Anglo-Egyptian organisation for the air defence of Egypt;(iv) Egypfs participation in a Middle East Defence Organisation;and(v) a programme of military and economic assistance to Egyptby the United Kingdom and the United States.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) These proposals should be presented as five interdependentelements in a single settlement. In particular, our offer to withdrawBritish troops from Egypt would be dependent on Egyptianacceptance of the other proposals.(b) Special importance was attached to the second and fourthof these proposals. It was essential that we should receive effectiveassurances that the base in the Canal Zone would be readily availableto us in a future war. For this purpose it was most desirable that weshould secure Egyptian agreement to the conditions set out in Case&quot;A&quot; on page 7 of C. (53) 17 Revise. Neither Case &quot; B&quot; norCase &quot; C &quot; would give us a sufficient certainty of being able to make effective use of the base in war.   It was also important that the British
technicians and others who would run the base installations in peaceshould be members of the Armed Forces entitled to wear uniform and to carry personal arms. If this point could be secured, we might even be content to accept rather smaller numbers than those suggestedin paragraph 4 of Case &quot;A.&quot;(c) As regards the fourth proposal, the proposed Middle east defence Organisation must be something more than a paper plan.We should not agree to withdraw our troops from the Canal Zoneuntil the Egyptians had given practical proof of their readiness tomake this Organisation a reality. The withdrawal of British troops from Egypt could not be defended against political criticisms in thiscountry unless it were possible to present the Middle East defence organisation as an imaginative and practical alternative to thecontinued maintenance of a British garrison in the Canal Zone.(d) If we were to satisfy the French and the other maritimenations of the world that free passage through the Suez Canal would continue to be safeguarded, we must be able to show that somesatisfactory alternative would be substituted for the protectionhitherto afforded by the presence of British troops in Egypt.(e) Much would turn on the international character of theorganisation proposed for planning the defence of the Middle East.The United States should be closely associated with this from the outset. The precise composition of the Middle East Defence Organ-isation would, however, need careful thought. In particular, were there not difficulties in including all the Arab States while excludingIsrael? Might this not be regarded as a concentration of power against Israel? On this point The Foreign Secretary said that an association including the United States and the United kingdom could not reasonably be regarded by Israel as an association hostile to their interests.(/) In connection with the point noted in the preceding paragraph the Foreign Secretary drew attention to a telegram from Amman(No. 92 of 16th February) reporting a proposal of the Jordan Govern-ment that a British brigade might be permanently stationed in Jordan.In discussion it was pointed out that this might have considerable advantages for us, both strategic and financial; and that it need notbe assumed that Israel would necessarily be hostile to it. TheCabinet agreed, however, that no final decision should be taken onthis proposal at the present time.The Cabinet next considered the procedure for resuming thedefence negotiations with Egypt.The Prime Minister said that in his view the first need was to assure ourselves that we should have the full sympathy and supportof the United States Government in the approach wnich we were proposing to make. We were not asking them to give us any military assistance in Egypt at the present time: we ourselves had ampleforces there to deal with any situation which might arise. But theyshould understand that we were not prepared to be bullied or cajoledinto withdrawing our troops from Egypt unless we secured in returnsatisfactory alternative arrangements on the lines indicated inC. (53) 17 Revise. These would together form a settlement which wecould accept; but they must be taken as a whole and we should notbe prepared to see them whittled away in the course.of negotiation.He would wish to be satisfied, by an exchange of personal messageswith the President, that the United States Government would give their whole-hearted support to an attempt to reach an agreement withthe Egyptians on this basis. Secondly, he was doubtful whether theBritish and American Ambassadors in Cairo should be left to handleby themselves the next stage in these negotiations. These were, after all, defence negotiations; and he would prefer that two prominentmilitary figures, one British and one American, should handle themjointly with the two Ambassadors. Field-Marshal Sir William Slimwould be a very suitable person to lead the British side of the negotiations-ating team, if Her Majesty were willing to allow him to defer taking
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (53) 60) containing proposals for revising the definition of mutiny and the penalties for it, which might be communicated tothe Select Committee on the Army and Air Force Acts in response totheir request for a statement of the Governments views on this point.The Secretary of State for War said that, although death was atpresent the maximum penalty for all offences of this nature, the death sentence had in fact been imposed on only three of the 1,700 men con-victed of mutiny in the Army since 1939. If the offences for whichthe death penalty might be imposed were restricted on the lines pro-posed, it might reasonably be expected that the law on this subject would operate more effectively.In discussion there was some support for the view expressed bythe Secretary of State for War.The Solicitor-General said that paragarph 5(i) of C. (53) 60 would bring the Army and Air Force Acts into line with the Naval discipline act, but the onus placed on the prosecution by paragraphs 5(ii) wouldbe likely to make conviction for that type of offence very difficult.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if there were any ques-tion of amending the Naval Discipline Act, it would be necessary to consult other Commonwealth Governments.Army and AirForce Acts.Offence ofMutiny.up his appointment as Governor-General of Australia and theAustralian Government could be persuaded to agree to this. he hoped that President Eisenhower might be persuaded to nominatesomeone like General Bedell Smith or General Ridgway to representhim in the discussions. With two such military men, working in association with the two Ambassadors, an impressive weight of Anglo-American influence would be brought to bear on the Egyptians.The Foreign Secretary and The Commonwealth Secretary warmlysupported the Prime Ministers proposals for handling the next stage of these negotiations.The Cabinet -(1) Reaffirmed their approval of the papers annexed to C. (53) 17Revise as a basis for the resumption of defence negotia-tions with the Egyptian Government.(2) Approved the Prime Minister^ proposal that the next stage of the conversations in Cairo should be undertaken byleading military figures, one British and one American, in association with the British and American Ambassadors.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would take steps to ascer-tain whether Her Majesty would be willing that theAustralian Government should be asked to agree thatField-Marshal Sir William Slim should defer taking up his appointment as Governor-General in Australia so that he might first undertake this special duty; and that, subjectto Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, the Prime Minister would put this suggestion in a personal message to the Prime Ministerof Australia.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would send a personal message to President Eisenhower inviting him to co-oper-ate, in the manner outlined in the discussion, in a joint anglo-American approach to the Egyptian Government.(5) Agreed that, until an understanding had been reached withthe United States Government on the procedure now envisaged, no indication should be given to the egyptian government of the basis on which we were prepared to resume the defence negotiations.
The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers to reconsider the proposals in C. (53) 60 in consultation withthe Law Officers, and to submit the matter again to theCabinet.Supplementary &apos; 4. The Chancellor of -the Exchequer said that he was concernedEstimates. about the number and amount of the Supplementary Estimates whichhe had been obliged to take in the current financial year. There werenot less than 55 of these, and they totalled  226 millions. Many ofthem, it was true, were due to circumstances beyond the control ofthe Departments concerned. But some had been made necessary byfaulty estimating of the amounts of Exchequer subsidies or grants tobe paid to outside bodies in the course of the year. He proposed toask Departments to exercise greater care in framing their estimates in future. He asked for the support of his colleagues in ensuringcloser estimating with a view to reducing the need for supplementary estimates.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Hungary. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the. Edgar Colonial Secretary (C. (53) 52 Revise) about the proposal to exchangeSanders. Lee ment, a Chinese Communist woman now awaiting the outcome(Previous of her application for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee ofReference: the Privy Council against the death sentence imposed upon her force.C. (53) 4th terrorist activities in Malaya, for Mr. Edgar Sanders, a British subjectConclusions, who was serving a sentence of imprisonment in Hungary on a chargeMinute 7.) of espionage.The Colonial Secretary said that, in view of the objections whichthe High Commissioner in Malaya had raised to the proposed exchange, he did not now favour our intervening if Lee ment&apos;application for leave to appeal to the Privy Council was dismissed though, if the Sultan of Perak later commuted the death sentence,the possibility of an exchange might then be reconsidered. If, how-ever, the application for leave to appeal were granted, we mightendeavour to keep the question of an exchange open with the hungarian Government and, if the appeal were ultimately allowed,the High Commissioner should then be asked to agree to the exchange.The Cabinet were informed that the Judicial Committee of the privy Council were expected to take a decision that day on theapplication for leave to appeal. If leave to appeal were granted, itwould probably be some four months before the outcome of the appeal would be known.The Foreign Secretary said that it was unlikely that the possibilityof an exchange could be held open with the Hungarian Governmentfor that length of time.The Cabinet Agreed to consider this matter again as soon as the PrivyCounciFs decision was known.
6. The Lord Chancellor said that, at a meeting of the coronation Committee of the Privy Council on the previous day, the leader of the Opposition had suggested that at the appropriate stage in the Coronation ceremony the Speaker of the House of commons should do homage to Her Majesty on behalf of the commonalty ofthe United Kingdom. This suggestion raised serious issues andthe Committee had appointed a sub-committee, which includedMr. Attlee, to consider these.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if the sub-committee reported in favour of any modification of the ceremony on the lines suggested by Mr. Attlee, it would be necessary to consult all other commonwealth Governments about it. Past experience showed thatany attempt to depart from tradition in these matters gave rise to problems which could not easily be solved, and very little time nowremained for the discussions between the Governments which wouldbecome necessary.The view was expressed, on the other hand, that, although theexisting form of the Peers&apos; homage would not be suitable for use bythe Speaker, it would be more in keeping with present constitutionalrealities if the allegiance of the commonalty could be signified duringthe Coronation ceremony through, for example, a suitable obeisancemade by Mr. Speaker on their behalf.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.the coronation.The Homage.Flood Damage. 7. The Cabinet considered drafts of two Government MotionsGovernment to be tabled, for the debate in &quot;the House of Commons onMotions.        19th February, on the damage suffered from tempest and flood in thiscountry and in Holland and Belgium on the night-of 31st January/1st February.The Cabinet were informed that a Motion in similar terms tothose of the first of these would also be tabled in the House of Lords.The Cabinet (1) Approved the two draft Motions subject to the deletion ofthe words &quot; to them &quot; in line 5, and the substitution ofthe word &quot; warm &quot; for &quot; grateful&quot; in line 6, of the first draft Motion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to show the draft Motionsprivately to the Opposition Leaders before they weretabled in the House of Commons.Financial The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that arrangements wereAssistance. were now in train to put the administration of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Fundon a sounder basis. In that event he would feel justified in asking the Fund to accept broad responsibility for the payment of com-pensation for loss or damage, and in making to the Fund a Govern-ment donation of the order of  1 million. This would leavecompensation for the rehabilitation of flooded farm-land and workon coast defences to be financed separately.The Home Secretary said that in the debate on 19th february the Government spokesman should be as forthcoming as possible onthe subject of financial assistance and should be able, in particular,to announce the amount of the Governments contribution to theLord Mayor&apos;s Fund. He hoped that before the Cabinefs meetingon 19th February he would have obtained some estimate, howevertentative, of the total damage for which compensation would berequired as a basis for determining what should be the Governmentscontribution. This could hardly be less than the  1 million whichthe Government had subscribed in 1947.  During the debate he also
LynmouthFund.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 77thConclusions,Minute 1.)Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1953.proposed to say that a Committee would be appointed to consider what long-term measures should be taken to guard against a recur-rence of flooding on the rare occasions when tide and wind conditions were the same as they had been on the night of 31st January-lst February.The Minister of Agriculture said that estimates of the agriculturalloss incurred, which was due more to the effect of salt water onflooded land than to the losses of stock, ranged from  10 to 40 millions.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to decide at their meeting on 19th February whatsum the Government should contribute to the lord mayor&apos;s Fund.The Home Secretary said that he understood from LordFortescue, the Lord Lieutenant of Devonshire, that no suitable usecould be found for the remaining  500,000 of the Fund raised by the lords Lieutenant of Devon and Somerset for the relief of loss andsuffering caused by the floods of August 1952. He was inclined tothink that the Government would be justified in exploring thepossibilities of enacting an agreed Bill to vary the trust deed of thisFund in such a way as to enable the available surplus to be transferredto the present Lord Mayor&apos;s Fund.In discussion the view was expressed that this proposal mightwell be found to involve serious difficulties.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that this proposal should not be pursued for thepresent.
