electoral reform.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 98triConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had considered, in consulta-tion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what reply he should give to the deputation from the Liberal Party on the question of electoral reform. He believed that there might be a case at some&quot; later stagefor considering the introduction of proportional representation in thelarger cities. But the experience of other countries suggested thatproportional representation increased the difficulties of securing stablegovernment; and this was certainly not&apos;a favourable moment forexperiments in electoral reform.- There was general agreement with this view.&apos;- The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would give no encourage-ment to the proposals of the Liberal Party for experiments in electoral reform.Formosa. 1.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the statement made bythe President of the United States on 2nd February, in his message to Congress on the State of the Union, that the&apos;United States SeventhFleet, which had been enforcing the neutralisation of Formosa sincethe outbreak of the Korean war, would no longer be employed toprevent the Chinese Nationalists from launching attacks against the mainland of China.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been warned in advance that this statement was to be made and he1 had at once made known- to the United States Government the concern felt by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and their apprehension that the&apos; decision would have unfortunate political repercussions without compensating militaryadvantages. He now thought it necessary to announce that these representations had been made to the United States Government.  He. read to the Cabinet a statement which he was proposing.to make onthis point in the House of Commons that afternoon.- .:, The Cabinet Approved the terms of the statement on Formosa which theForeign Secretary proposed to make in the House of Com-mons that afternoon.
CommonwealthEconomicConference;(previous reference:C.C. (52) 105thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 22 and 38) regardingthe form of the communication to be made to the United StatesGovernment on the results of the Commonwealth Economic Confer-ence. It was proposed that H.M. Ambassador should in the firstinstance give to the appropriate authorities in Washington an indication of the proposals which were formulated at the Confer-ence, and that for this purpose he should hand in a memorandum in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (53) 22 subject to the modi-fications proposed in C. (53) 38&apos;, This would be done about ten tofourteen days before the forthcoming visit of the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to Washington.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In the addition proposed in paragraph 2 (a) of C. (53) 38, itwas an understatement to say that &quot; some modification&quot; would berequired in the existing financial arrangements in Western Europe.It would be preferable to use the phrase &quot; some changes.&quot;
House of lords reform.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 5thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister.(C. (53) 39) covering a draft letter to the Leaders of the opposition parties inviting them to co-operate in a three-party conference onthe reform of the House of Lords. This draft had been preparedby the Lord President in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of30th December.The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested that he mightdiscuss this matter with Leaders of the Labour Opposition before these invitations were sent. He was reluctant to do this, for he hadgood reason to believe that the Labour Party would urge that theconference should be postponed until late in the life of the present parliament. From the point of. view of fulfilling the pledges whichthey had given at the election, it was better that the Governmentshould issue the invitations and have them declined, rather than find themselves in the position of being prevented, by the results of preliminary consultations with the Labour Party,, from taking anyovert step to convene the conference.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it was also desirable thathe should be able to say, in the debate in the House of Lords.that afternoon on Lord Simon&apos;s Bill for the creation of life Peers, that theseinvitations were about to be issued.The Cabinet       iInvited the Prime Minister to write to the Leaders of theOpposition Parties, in the terms of the draft annexed toC. (53) 39, inviting them to co-operate in a three-party conference on the reform of the House of Lords.Public 6. The Cabinet had before.them a memorandum by the Chan-Expenditure, cellor of the Exchequer (C. (53) 31) emphasising the need to reduce(Previous the level of Government expenditure and making specific proposalsReference: for reductions in the Estimates for the coming financial year. TheyC.C.(52)84th also had before them a memorandum by the President of the BoardConclusions, of Trade (C. (53) .34) asking whether the cuts envisaged by the Chan-Minute l.) cellor were sufficient to provide the necessary alleviation of the burdenof taxation upon industry.(b) In the same paragraph it might be over-optimistic to statethat &quot;it was the firm belief&quot; of the United Kingdom Governmentthat a plan could be framed to strengthen the Western Europeaneconomy. It would be wiser ko say merely that it was the aim of theUnited Kingdom Government to ensure that such a plan was made.(c) The subject discussed in paragraphs 26 and 28 of the mainmemorandum (C. (53) 22), though it was an essential part of the pro-posals, was put forward very tentatively. Misunderstanding mightwell arise from the excessively cautious phrases used about the degreeof flexibility which would be allowed. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that there had been no intention to modify the originalconception of this part of the proposals, and he would reconsider the wording of paragraphs 26 and 28 of the memorandum.The Cabinet- .(1) Approved the draft memorandum (C. (53) 22) as amended by C. (53) 38 and subject to the. points made in their discussion.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct H.M. Ambas-ambassador in Washington to hand the memorandum,as so revised, to the United States Government someten to fourteen days before the arrival of the foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer in washington.(3) Approved the proposal made in paragraph 3 (c) of C. (53) 38.
In discussion it was pointed out that the general objectives of theGovernments economic policy--the expansion of world trade and the convertibility of sterling-could not be achieved unless the competi-tive power of British industry was preserved and strengthened. Butit was abundantly clear that the efficiency of British industry couldnot be maintained, still less increased, unless means, were found of reducing the burden of industrial taxation. It was therefore urgently necessary to secure some substantial reduction in the level of Govern-ment expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he accepted that view, he was satisfied that in the short period remaining beforethe Government presented the Estimates for the coming financial year it would not be practicable to devise larger economies than those whichhe had proposed in C. (53) 31. Further substantial savings could besecured only by major changes of policy; and he hoped that these changes would be made hi time to reflect themselves in the estimates for .1954-55. Ministers had already undertaken a review of the scale and pattern of the.country&apos;s defence effort in future years: an enquiry was now proposed into the level of expenditure on the national health Service: proposals for a modified housing policy would shortly come before the Cabinet; and he intended to consider whatlong-term economies could be made in the education services. he hoped that the result of all these reviews would be brought intoaccount in framing the Estimates for the financial year 1954-55. Hewould be glad if he could have the assistance of a small committee ofMinisters to review the specific proposals which he had put forward for 1953-54 and to consider what other measures could be taken tosecure a. larger reduction in the volume of Government expenditure inthe years ahead.In further discussion the following particular&apos; points were raised:  (a) The Minister of Agriculture said that, in paragraph 9 ofC- (53) 31, it was assumed that the farm prices to be fixed at the forth-coming Annual Review would not recoup the farmers for the wholeof their increased costs. He recognised that for certain items theprices fixed might not cover the whole of the increased costs; but hecould not at this stage agree that the Government should aim at asettlement which, as a whole, failed to cover the increased costs.(b) The Minister of Materials said that he had hoped that a Jargerprovision might be made for expenditure in 1953 on building upstrategic stocks of food and materials. This expenditure was notinflationary, and strategic stocks could be regarded as supplementingthe gold and dollar reserves.        &apos;!(c) The proposed change in the charge for prescriptions under theNational Health Service was an interim measure designed to hold theposition until more radical methods could be devised for checkingabuse of the pharmaceutical service. The Secretary of State forScotland asked that further consideration should be given to thepossibility of providing that only one fee should be payable when twodrugs were prescribed for a single complaint.(d) It was arguable whether the reductions proposed in C..(53) 31should be disclosed in the Estimates or held back until they could be announced together in the course of the Budget, debate. The.Minister of Food said that for technical reasons it would be preferable that the proposed changes in food prices should be announced at thetime of the Budget. The Minister of Agriculture asked that the adjust-ments affecting the farmers should not be disclosed in advance of theforthcoming Annual Review of farm prices. The Minister of Healthsaid that he would prefer that the proposed change in the charge forprescriptions should be taken into account in the Estimates, as he wished to bring it into operation On 1st March.    ,
The Cabinet Appointed a committee consisting of      . ;Chancellor of the Exchequer (Chairman),Ldrd Privy Seal,Commonwealth Secretary,Secretary of State for Scotland,President of the Board of Trade,.    Paymaster-General,Minister of Food,to review, in the light of the discussion the proposals put&apos; ,. forward in C- (53) 3.1 for reducing Government expenditurein the coming financial year, and thereafter to consider what further measures could be put in hand with a view to securingfurther reductions in Government expenditure in the years ahead.national health Service.&apos; (previous reference:C.C. (52) 63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (53) 30) recommending the appointment of asmall independent committee to review the present and prospectivecost of the National Health Service and to consider means of limitingits increasing cost to the Exchequer.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was desirable that the appointment of the committee shouldbe announced by the Health Ministers.(b) The terms of reference should not be such as to empower thecommittee to comment on other branches of Government expenditure,but they should be so drawn as to encourage the committee to seekmeans of reducing the Exchequer cost of the Health Service.(c) The Cabinet should have an opportunity to comment on theproposed membership of the committee. .The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a committee should be appointed to review thecost of the National Health Service, on the general lines suggested in C. (53) 30.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, after consultationwith the Health Ministers, to submit for the cabinet&apos;s approval the proposed membership of the committee andrevised terms of reference for it.Sudan. 8.   The Foreign Secretary said that since the Cabinefs discussion(Previous       on 20th January he had discussed with some of his Cabinet colleaguesReference:,     the developments which had taken place in the negotiations with theC.C (53) 3rd    Egyptian Government on the future of the Sudan.   It was plainlyConclusions,    desirable that elections for a Sudanese Parliament should be heldMinute 7.)      before the onset of the rainy season; and his colleagues had agreedthat on this account the negotiations should&apos; be brought to a definite conclusion in the near future.  This meant that a determined effort must be made to secure some satisfaction from the Egyptians on thetwo major points still outstanding,. viz., the safeguards for theSouthern Provinces and the arrangements for replacing British officials in the Sudan. He had therefore prepared a draft telegram conveyingfurther instructions on these points to H.M. Ambassador in Cairo.Copies of this draft were handed round at,the meeting.   This. ,      made it clear that, as regards safeguards for the Southern Provinces,
Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared to agree either(i) that these should be left to be prescribed by the Sudanese Parlia-ment, or (ii) that Article 100 should be retained in the Statute ina form which would give the Governor-General powers in respectof any or all of the Provinces but would require him to exercise those powers in accordance with the advice of his Commission. The draft telegram also put forward a fresh suggestion regarding the replace-ment of British officials in the Sudan, viz., that the Egyptian pro-posals on this point should be accepted if the Egyptians agreed thatthe detailed preparations for the exercise of self-determination by theSudan should be made subject to supervision by some form of inter-national commission which would, at the appropriate time, advise onthe replacement of British officials in the Sudan.The Cabinet-Approved the instructions which the Foreign secretary proposed to send to H.M. Ambassador in Cairo (subse-quently despatched as Foreign Office telegram No. 2.18 of3rd February).Cabinet Office, S:W:i,3rd February, 1953.
