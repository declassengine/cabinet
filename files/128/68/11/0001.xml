CONFIDENTIAL1.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe immediate cause of the fighting between Iraq and Iran was Iraq&apos;sterritorial ambitions, over the Shatt-el-Arab in particular, and herdissatisfaction with the Algiers Agreement of 1975.    Behind this layPresident Saddam Hussain&apos;s worries about the Iranian regime&apos;s effortsto export revolution in the form of Islamic fundamentalism (which alsoexplained the degree of support he was receiving from other Arabcountries in the region);   and his ambitions to dominate the Middle East(which given his extremist views would be an unwelcome development inrelation to the prospects for an Arab/Israel settlement).    Events hadconfounded the original expectation of an early end to the fighting. TheIraqis appeared to have underestimated the tenacity of Iranian resistance.The Iranian air force was still flying over 100 sorties a day and theIraqis&apos; oil installations had been at least as seriously damaged by thefighting as had the Iranians&apos;.    The Iraqis&apos; advance had now given thema stranglehold on most of Iran&apos;s supplies both of crude and of refinedoil.    None the less Iran had rejected President Zia of Pakistan&apos;sattempts at mediation and seemed determined to continue fighting. TheIraq attack had rallied the nation behind the leadership, and the Iranianscould well sustain effective resistance for some time.    Mediation byIslamic countries remained the best hope for a settlement.    The reactionof the United Nations (UN) had been singularly unimpressive. TheSoviet Government, however, seemed to be seeking to exercise amoderating influence, no doubt because of their important interests atstake In each of the protagonist countries.    There was therefore littleimmediate risk of confrontation between the super powers.    But therewas a real danger that the fighting would spread, eg if Iraq attackedBandar Abbas or the Gulf Islands and Iran retaliated by closing theStraits of Hormuz.    It would not take much to frighten internationalshipping away from using the Straits.    That would have a very seriouseffect on oil supplies, and it would continue to be the object of diplomacyto prevent it happening.   For the moment, however, there had been noadverse effect on oil or shipping movements in relation to Gulf Statesother than Iran and Iraq.    The International Energy Association (IEA)had issued a reassuring statement after its meeting on 1 October and thespot market for oil remained calm.    The cessation of Iraqi oil pumpingto the Mediterranean had brought the total loss of Iraqi and Iranian oilexports to about 3.8 million barrels per day.    Japan, India, Italy,France and Brazil were among the countries most directly affected,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that British oil supplieswere not at present affected.    Stocks were high, and United Kingdomproducers on the North Sea Continental Shelf would give priority to theUnited Kingdom market.    Such priority would be ruled out if at somefuture stage shortages elsewhere led to the implementation of the IEA&apos;ssharing arrangements; on the other hand failure to implement sharingarrangements in such circumstances could lead to a violent priceexplosion.    In consultation with other Departments concerned heproposed to set in hand contingency studies on when that situation mightbe expected, on various hypotheses, to develop; and on the implicationsfor British policy and interests at that stage,1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn the course of a brief discussion it was pointed out that there mightbe serious implications for international law and for the future of theUnited Nations if world opinion remained unwilling to condemn Iraqfor what seemed a clear case of aggression.    The crisis had alsorevealed alarmingly how little the minor Gulf states seemed to beaware of the vulnerability of their position.    It was to be hoped thatgreater realism would now develop.    More generally, the concentra-tion of immense oil wealth in so few hands seemed bound to be a majorfactor for instability in the Gulf region and for international hostilitytowards the wealthy few.   At present, however, the West rather thanthe oil producing states remained the prime target for criticism bymost of the poorer developing countries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that during her recent visit to Greece theGreek Government had emphasised that, unless their application forreintegration into the military structure of the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation (which had been made as long ago as 1977, but remainedblocked by the attitude of Turkey) could be approved within the next fewmonths, Greek public opinion might insist that it be withdrawn, and thefuture of United States bases in Greece would then be in doubt.THE PRIME MINISTER said that her subsequent visit to Yugoslaviahad been welcomed by the new Government in Belgrade as an earnestof support in the aftermath of Marshal Tito&apos;s death.    They werenaturally worried abeut  the situation in Poland and uncertain aboutthe possibility of comparable developments elsewhere in Eastern EuropeThe Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatthe Council of Ministers (Fisheries) had succeeded on 29 September inreaching agreement on comprehensive conservation measures for theCommunity.    Many of these measures were similar to ones which theUnited Kingdom had been operating nationally but for which she hadbeen criticised by the European Court.    They included control overindustrial fishing in the North Sea where the Minister of State,8,        Mr Buchanan-Smith, had negotiated a favourable arrangement with theDanish Government.    The agreement on conservation measuresrepresented a significant step forward and suggested that there was agood possibility of agreement being reached on a revised CommonFisheries Policy (CFP) before the end of the year; although difficultproblems on quotas and access still remained to be negotiated.In a brief discussion, it was noted that the leaders of the fishing industryhad expressed satisfaction with the agreement on conservation measures.They were now very anxious for a comprehensive settlement beforethe end cf the year.    They recognised, at any rate in private, that theterms were likely to fall short of their publicly expressed demands.The Scottish Nationalist Party had so far been unsuccessful in turningthe industry against the Government&apos;s approach; but, if the leaders ofthe industry came out in strong public opposition to the terms of a finalsettlement, it might be difficult to secure a satisfactory vote in theHouse of Commons.    The leaders of the industry were aware that, ifthey overdid their opposition to the Government&apos;s approach they mightprevent a settlement being approved, an outcome which they themselvesrecognised would not be in the best interests of the industry.3CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the meetings which she andother Ministers had had with President Giscard d&apos;Estaing and theirFrench counterparts in Paris on 19 September there had been a clearintention on both sides of improving Anglo-French relations; this hadbeen evident both in the discussions and in the subsequent Pressconference.    The aim appeared to have been achieved;  since themeeting, progress had been made on a number of Community issues,previously blocked by the French, on which the Minister of Agriculturewould be reporting.    On 7 October the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) would be discussing the arrangements to give effect to theagreement of 30 May on the reduction of the United Kingdom Budgetcontribution, and it was hoped that outstanding differences with theFrench in this area could also be resolved.
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reportedthat at the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 30 September theFrench had eventually dropped a series of reservations about thearrangements for sheepmeat, and agreement had been reached that theCommunity system, together with the arrangements for imports fromthird countries, would come into effect later in the month.    The outcomewas wholly satisfactory to the United Kingdom and had also beenwelcomed by the New Zealand Government.    The Council had alsoapproved better arrangements for imports of New Zealand butter in 1980.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theCommit;sioii had dissociated itself from the recent decisions of theCouncil of Ministers (Budget) on the draft Community Budget for 1981.At the Council meeting, the United Kingdom secured adequate arrangerments for her Budget refunds and had at least maintained the proportionof the Budget devoted to non-agricultural expenditure.    The outcome wasunlikely to satisfy the European Parliament, they would be reluctant toreject the Budget as they had done last year, but the possibility couldnot be excluded.    If no Budget were adopted before the end of the year,there would be delay in securing the repayments due to the UnitedKingdom under the Budget settlement. .In a brief discussion it was noted that, in the context of budgetrestructuring, the British Government shared the same desire as theCommission and the Parliament to see the proportion of the Budgetdevoted to agriculture reduced.    It would be important not to appearto be acting contrary to this objective.    There were however limits towhat could be achieved in 1981.    It would not be in British interestsfor the Budget to be rejected, and it would be helpful if the Commissionand Ministers could diminish the political tension between the Counciland the Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office2 October 1980CONFIDENTIAL
