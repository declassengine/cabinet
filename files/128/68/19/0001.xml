CONFIDENTIALMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thelES House of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the Opposition might wish to raise the issues coveredby the Yellowlees Report on the medical examination of immigrantsduring the half-day debate on immigration arranged at their request forThursday 4 December.    The Report, which was likely to be highlycontentious because of its implications about the effect of immigration onhealth and secial conditions, would have to be published in full, but thiscould not be done in time for the debate.    The Home Secretary shouldendeavour to ascertain from the Opposition spokesman on home affairswhether what the Government had so far said about the conclusions of theReport was likely to form a major part of the debate, and, if so, topropose to him that it should be deferred until after the Report had beenpublished.The Cabinet -Invited the Home Secretary to approach the Oppositionspokesman on home affairs on the lines indicated inthe Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaton Namibia agreement had now been reached to hold a meeting of all theinterested parties in January, probably in Maputo.    This wasencouraging, but prospects were still very uncertain.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Ridley, was atpresent in the Falkland Islands and engaged in talks with the islanders.In the light of a somewhat misleading headline on the Islands&apos; future inThe Times of 26 November, it would be made clear in Parliament thatthe Government regarded the wishes of the islanders as paramount.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadjust authorised expenditure of a further  80, 000, from the fundsavailable to him for disaster relief, in addition to the help which Britainhad already provided in the context of the recent earthquake in Italy.This meant that all requests from the Italian authorities had been met.In the light of doubts which had been expressed he would seek to ensuresuitable publicity in Britain for the help that was being given.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,at its meeting on 25 November, the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) had failed to agree on arrangements for imports of New Zealandbutter following the end of the present arrangements on 31 December 1980.The French Foreign Minister had refused to agree to any commitmentbeyond one year, despite earlier indications that the French could haveaccepted a two-year arrangement.    They were seeking to link this andother decisions with the budget restructuring exercise.    The Germanrepresentative had reneged on the position taken up previously by theGerman Government in the Agriculture Council and on the assurancesthe Federal Chancellor had given to the New Zealand Prime Minister tosupport a three-year arrangement.    The matter would now to back to theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture), although he had warned hiscolleagues on the Foreign Affairs Council that the Prime Minister mightnow raise the question at the forthcoming meeting of the EuropeanCouncil.In a brief discussion it was noted that, if no agreement were reachedbefore the end of the year, the Commission would probably in practiceallow the continued entry of New Zealand butter on preferential terms;but the future would remain uncertain, and the French Government wouldbe in a position to exploit the situation in connection with next year&apos;sTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thelatest developments in Poland appeared to have increased the danger ofthe Polish Government deciding, perhaps in the near fv.ture, that theycould not go on giving way to the workers&apos; Solidarity union and that forcemust therefore be used to clamp down.    In that event the PolishGovernment might attempt to rely on their own resources, ie the militiaand possibly workers who supported the regime, rather than on Sovietmilitary intervention.    Urgent consideration was being given to how theWest should react to such a development.
CONFIDENTIALagricultural price fixing, which was their immediate preoccupation. Itwas in fact in the Community&apos;s interest to reach an agreement since thecost of disposing of the Community&apos;s surplus butter would rise if, as theresult of a failure to agree, New Zealand refused to co-operate with theCommission over exports to third markets.4. THE HOME SECRETARY said that, at the meeting later in theday of the National Joint Council of Local Authorities&apos; Fire Brigades,representatives of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) and of the employerswould discuss further the dispute over the employers&apos; refusal to offerthe 18. 8 per cent increase in pay which was due to the firemen under theterms of the present pay agreement.    The employers had decided by amajority of 18 to 12 to offer 6 per cent, in line with the provision for payin the Rate Support Grant cash limit, rather than 18. 8 per cent as theyhad originally intended.    It was uncertain whether they would hold to thatview in the further discussions.    For their part, the FBU were deeplyresentful of the employers&apos; failure to honour the agreement, and hadthreatened that, if they were not now offered 18. 8 per cent, they wouldundertake a series of one-day strikes of which, apart from the firststrike, they would give no warning.    The difficulties would be moreacute than in the last strike because this time the National Associationof Fire Officers had voted overwhelmingly to support strike action, andit was likely that control room staff would also join in.    The RetainedFirefighters Union, representing part-timers in rural areas, would notstrike, but individuals belonging to other unions would be under pressurenot to answer fire calls during strikes.    Under the contingency plans toprovide emergency fire cover, about 800 Green Goddess fire engineswould be available and 9, 000 troops including 700 specialists withbreathing apparatus.    Inexperienced troops really needed the expertsupervision of fire officers to deal with fires effectively and at minimumCONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, following an all-night session, the Council of Ministers (Budget) had agreed on certainamendments to the draft Community budget for 1981 which went in thedirection desired by the European Parliament.    These changes, whichinvolved both token reductions in agricultural expenditure and increasesin non-obligatory expenditure, would help to avoid a deadlock betweenthe Council and the Parliament.    Further negotiations would take placenext month.    It was desirable that agreement should be reached; other-wise budget refunds to the United Kingdom would be at risk.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIALrisk to themselves; if the fire officers were on strike it would be very-difficult for the local authorities to find anyone for that task, even aftercalling for volunteers from among retired fire officers.    The localauthorities had also made clear that in the event of sporadic strike actionthey would be unwilling to meet their obligation to pay for keeping thetroops on standby.    It was not clear to him how the dispute would beresolved.    Individual firemen would lose relatively little pay from one-day strikes, and the action could continue for a considerable time.Other unions were Unlikely to reach settlements which would set aprecedent so long as they could hope to improve their own negotiatingposition by waiting lor a favourable settlement for the firemen.    In themeantime he remained of the view that, having made their position cleartc the local authorities, the Government should now leave them to reachtheir own decisions in the negotiations.In di son a si on the following points were made -a. Whatever the outcome the Government were likely to beblamed.    Although the Government were not a party to thenegotiations, general public opinion was that they were in practiceresponsible for the decision to break an agreement which they hadhitherto supported, in Government as well as in Opposition. Ifthere were to be loss of life in a fire as a result of the strike, theblame would be laid at the Government&apos;s door for provokingindustrial action.    Some local authority employers consideredthat the Government had pushed them into confrontation, and theywould be critical of any suggestion that they did not now have thefull support of the Government.b. Leaders of the Trades Union Congress had indicatedprivately that, while they would back the FBU&apos;s claim to the hilt,they would not similarly support other unions who tried to secure,similar settlements; but this indication was not quotable and wasat odds with the public stance of some unions (notably the NationalUnion of Public Employees) who had made clear that thev wouldtake the firemen&apos;s settlement as a precedent for them.   It wasessential that the firemen&apos;s settlement should not lead tosuch knock-on effects.c. The local authority employers should be reminded that theyhad flexibility for negotiating a settlement with the firemen. Thefactor of 6 per cent applied to the local authority pay bill overall.This left them free to give more to firemen if they made offsettingsavings by paying other groups less or by increasing manpowersavings.    This would be consistent with the situation in 1980-81,when the overall local authority cash limit had been 13 per centbut the firemen had reached a settlement leading to increases of24 per cent on their average earnings.    The employers should4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALalso be advised that as part of the settlement they should securethe unions&apos; agreement to discuss with them and with the HomeOffice the proposals for future manning levels set out in theconsultative document on future fire policy.    In negotiating asettlement they should also make clear that the present payagreement would not necessarily operate in future; there wereindications that the FBU would accept that.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet recognised that, unless the firemen&apos;s dispute wasresolved quickly, strike action would lead to risk of life and of propertyand that the Government would be widely regarded as responsible. TheSecretary of State for the Knvironment should discuss the situation withrepresentatives of the local authorities before the meeting of theNational Joint Council later in the day.    He should remind them that theyhad flexibility in negotiating a settlement.    The provision in the cashlimit for the increase in the overall local authority pay bill was limitedto 6 per cent but, within that global total, it was open to them to offerrelatively more to firemen and to find offsetting savings, either by lowerpay settlements for other groups or by reductions in manning levels.They should be left in no doubt that the Government would not raise theoverall cash limit following the firemen&apos;s settlement in order toaccommodate any knock-on settlements which other groups might seek tonegotiate.    The Secretary of State for the Environment should also urgethe employers to agree with the unions that they should discuss together,and with the Home Office, futurs manning levels in the light of theconsultative document on future fire policy and of the outcome of the paynegotiations.    He should further invite them to ensure that the settle-ment explicitly recognised that the terms of the present pay agreementwith the firemen could not stand indefinitely and would not necessarilyapply to the next settlement.    The employers should be urged tocontinue to negotiate within this framework until they reached a settle-ment, and to avoid any breakdown in the talks.The Cabinet -1.       Invited the Secretary of State for the Environmentto discuss the negotiations on the firemen&apos;s pay settlementwith representatives of the local authority employersbefore the meeting later in the day of the National JointCouncil of Local Authorities&apos; Fire Brigades, and to beguided in these discussions by the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to discuss at their next meeting the timing and levelof the hospital and community health service cash limit.    They hadpreviously agreed to defer a. fiml decision on this cash limit on theground that the unions concerned would delay negotiations on the pay ofNational Health Service ancillary workers until they had a clear idea ofthe likely outcome of the negotiations on the pay of local authoritymanual workers.    On the other hand delay in settling this limit castdoubts on the Government&apos;s overall intentions for the pay factor in cashlimits and made it more difficult to conduct negotiations with groups,such as the university technicians and teachers, to whom cash limitsincorporating the pay factor of 6 per cent already applied.The Cabinet -2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for SocialServices, to circulate in time for discussion at theirmeeting on 4 December a memorandum makingproposals on the timing and level of the hospital andcommunity health service cash limit.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a settlement of the.prison officers&apos;dispute on terms acceptable to the Government now seemed possible,although it remained to be seen whether the Executive Committee of thePrison Officers&apos; Association would be willing to recommend theirmembers to accept his offer.    The position should become clearerduring the following week.The Cabinet -3.      Took note.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C(80) 73) on public expenditure in 1982-83 and 1983-84.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his memorandumsummarised the policy reductions and increases in programmes, otherthan the nationalised industries, by comparison with the revaluedfigures for 1982-83 and 1983-84 in the last Public Expenditure WhitePaper (Cmnd 7841).    He would discuss further with the Ministersresponsible for local authority services whether the published figures forlocal authority expenditure should be in terms of global totals or, as inthe last White Paper, broken down between services.    He recognisedCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat some Ministers would prefer to show global totals only, on thegrounds that the decision on distribution between particular services laywith the authorities themselves;  on the other hand the Treasury andCivil Service Committee would press for a full breakdown to be given.The Cabinet -1. Endorsed the reductions and additions tospending plans in 1982-83 and 1983-84 listed inTables 1 and 2 attached to C(80) 73.2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, toconsider further with the Ministers concerned(including tho Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster)the presentation in the next Public Expenditure WhitePaper of the Government&apos;s plans for local authorityexpenditure and for expenditure on arts and libraries.7CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs about the forthcoming requestfrom the Canadian Federal Parliament to patriate the CanadianConstitution with additional provisions for an Amending formula, a Billof Rights and an equalisation formula (C(80) 69).THE LrORD PRIVY SEAL said that a joint committee of the CanadianHouse of Commons and Senate was now studying the resolution and wasdue to report by 9 December.    However the resolution was stronglyopposed by the majority of the Provincial Governments and theConservative Opposition, and it seemed probable that the CanadianGovernment would not be able to get the matter cleared in the FederalParliament before Christmas, and might find it difficult to send theproposed legislation to London by the middle of January. TheCanadian Prime Minister had already been given an undertakingregarding patriation, but it had been made clear to Canadian Ministersthat the proposed inclusion of a Bill of Rights was liable to causecontroversy and delay in this country.    Although Mr Trudeau&apos;s requestmight seem unreasonable, the Government could deal only with theCanadian Federal Government and Parliament, and there was noalternative to acceding to a reqt*st duly received from that Parliament.The legality of the request under Canadian law was, however, beingchallenged in the Canadian provincial courts.    Whatever view might betaken of the likely outcome of such a challenge when it eventuallyreached the Federal Supreme Court, there could be real difficulty aboutgiving effect to a request while the issue remained &quot;sub judice&quot; in theCanadian courts, where it seemed unlikely that the matter would havebeen resolved before the Canadian Federal Parliament sent the joint
CONFIDENTIALAddress to Westminster.    The Canadian Federal Government had so farbeen unwilling to seek to expedite matters by themselves referring theissue to their own Supreme Court for a ruling.     Meanwhile indicationsof controversy were already starting to appear in Parliament and thePress in this country.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, said that the sub judice rule in theWestminster Parliament did not apply in respect of litigation overseas.There would be no technical objection to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentacting on a request from the Canadian Government to introduce a Bill atWestminster, even before the legality of the request in Canadian law hadbeen established in the Canadian courts, and such a measure would notbe invalidated by a subsequent ruling in the Supreme Court of Canada thatthe request had been ultra vires.    But in the light of the recent letterfrom the Canadian High Commissioner, confirming that this was amatter which could be taken to the Canadian courts and eventually from aprovincial court to the Supreme Court of Canada, the WestminsterParliament would be heavily criticised if it legislated before the SupremeCourt of Canada had heard the case, even if it was technically entitled todo so.In discussion it was argued that the effect of the preamble to the Statuteof Westminster was to preclude Parliament from amending any Billintroduced at the request of a dominion Government, since if it wereamended the Bill would cease to be one which gave effect to that request.It was suggested, however, that it might be unwise to rely on thisprotection alone to protect a Bill from liability to amendment: it wouldbe desirable to reinforce the protection by suitable wording of the longtitle of the Bill, on the basis of the advice already given byParliamentary Counsel.In further discussion the following additional points were made -a. The consequences of refusing to accede to the Canadianrequest, or of delaying a response on grounds which did not seemreasonable to the Canadians, could be extremely serious forAnglo-Canadian relations.    Mr Trudeau was likely to pursue theissue with great determination.b. The degree of difficulty which the legislation encounteredat Westminster would affect the speed of its passage.    A numberof the Government&apos;s supporters were unhappy with the proposals.Many members of the Opposition were likely to support the Billbecause it had the backing of the left wing in Canada, but theyalso had backbenchers who were likely to be critical. Thelegislation&apos;s passage would be greatly eased if it was introducedafter it had been established that the request was intra vires inCanadian law.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government were bound to accede to a dulyapproved request by the Canadian Government and Parliament tointroduce a Bill in the Westminster Parliament, and could not &quot;lookthrough&quot; the request to the attitudes of Canadian provincial governmentsand minority interests.    But it was cleai that there was likely to bedifficulty in Parliament in following this course of action, at least so longas it was not established whether the request was intra vires in Canadianlaw.    In these circumstances the Government should send a personalmessage (or emissary) to Mr Trudeau, to make it clear that, while theUnited Kingdom was firmly committed in principle to introducing in theWestminster Parliament whatever measure was requested by theCanadian Government and Parliament, the passage of the Bill atWestminster would be very greatly eased and speeded up, if the requestcould be delayed until the Supreme Court of Canada had advised that itwas intra vires in Canadian law.    It would be for the CanadianGovernment to consider whether to expedite matters by referring theissue for a ruling to the Canadian Supreme Court themselves withoutwaiting for the provincial courts to do so.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.2.      Invited the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary to consider the best method and terms ofconveying an appropriate message to the CanadianGovernment and to inform the Cabinet of theirresponse.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(80) 71) about the remuneration of junior Ministers in theHouse of Lords.THF LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the present pay ofjunior Lords Ministers, at  16,400 for Ministers of State and  12, 500for Parliamentary Secretaries, bore no relation to their responsibilites.They had similar Departmental duties to Commons Ministers, and hadalso to undertake a good deal of work in the House of Lords on behalf ofother Departments.    Lords Ministers who lived outside London receivedno allowance towards maintaining a second home, although CommonsMinisters with constituencies outside London could claim such anallowance.    The salary of a Lords Minister who relinquished his postceased immediately, whereas a Commons Minister might continue toreceive his salary as a Member of Parliament.    There was no doubt thatCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALseveral junior Lords Ministers were in serious financial difficulties,and one or more of them might well have to resign if they were not paidthe additional remuneration which they were expecting following thestatement made to the House of Commons by the Prime Minister on7 July 1980.    After the last discussion of the problem by the Cabinet, hehad commissioned a report from officials on ways in which theremuneration of junior Lords Ministers might be improved.    The reportby officials attached to C(80) 71 concluded that an increase could best beeffected by means of an amendment to the Ministerial and OtherSalaries Act 1975.    It recommended that the increase should be of 3, 500, about half the Parliamentary salary paid to CommonsMinisters.    Officials also recommended that the opportunity should betaken to deal with some anomalies in the 1975 Act so that Ministerialsalary increases could be paid retrospectively, and Prime Ministerscould be given greater freedom to determine the composition and size oftheir Cabinet.    He invited the Cabinet to endorse these recommendations,and to consider the further recommendation by officials that the additionalremuneration should be paid to all Ministers and office-holders in theHouse of Lords,In discussion it was argued that the efficient conduct of Governmentbusiness in the House of Lords was dependent upon *he availability ofjunior Ministers of suitable quality, and that the Government should beprepared to pay the rate for the job.    On the other hand, it would bepolitically indefensible to pay salary increases of the order of 25 per centto members of the Government at a time when an effort was being madeto hold public sector pay settlements generally to 6 per cent. Severaldifficult questions on Parliamentary pay and pensions, includingindexing, remained to be resolved in the House of Commons. Therewould be no chance of their being resolved satisfactorily if increasesnot recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) were to bepaid to Lords Ministers when the full increases recommended by theTSRB had not been paid to Members of the House of Commons. Thepresentational difficulties would, however, be lessened if any increasewas paid as an allowance rather than as an increase in basic salary; theprevious decision not to allow Ministers to claim an attendanceallowance might need to be looked at again.    It appeared, however, fromthe report by officials that an allowance could not properly be paidexcept by means of an amendment to the 1975 Act, in which caseappropriate provisions to ensure that the allowance was not taxablemight be included in the legislation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet fully accepted the case for increasing the remuneration ofjunior Lords Ministers.    For the presentational reasons mentioned indiscussion, they considered that any such increase should be paid bymeans of a tax-free allowance rather than as an addition to Ministerialsalaries.    The Lord President of the Council should now arrange for the10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpossible form of such an allowance to be studied in more detail, andshould put revised proposals to the Cabinet for final decision in duecourse.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the remuneration of junior Ministersin the House of Lords should be increased by thepayment of an allowance.2. Invited the Lord President of the Council toconsider the best way of introducing such anallowance, and to make a further report to the Cabinet.3. Agreed to resume their consideration of theremuneration of other Ministers and office-holders inthe House of Lords, and of other possible amendmentsto the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975, at alater meeting.Cabinet Office27 November 1980CONFIDENTIAL11
