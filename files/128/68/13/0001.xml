CONFIDENTIALLeNTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Lights,        THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that during theand) Second Reading of the Tenants&apos; Rights, Etc. (Scotland) Amendmentit Bill        Bill Lord Ross had claimed that, because there were differencesbetween the provisions of that Bill and the amendments made to theHousing Bill before the Summer Recess to permit the exclusion fromthe right to buy of specially adapted houses for the elderly, theGovernment had not fully honoured the pledges they had given. TheOpposition had now tabled amendments for debate during theCommittee stage of the Bill.    There was little substance in thepoints Lord Ross was making, but the Secretary of State for Scotlandhad agreed to see whether any changes could properly be made in theBill so as to facilitate its passage through both Houses before theend of the Session.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET2. The Cabinet had before them a minute from the HomeSecretary to the Prime Minister dated 21 October reporting theoutcome of the discussion by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee (H) of the Government&apos;s response to the threatenedhunger strike by seven Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)prisoners at the Maze Prison in Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatseven of the PIRA prisoners in the Maze Prison were almostcertain to begin a hunger strike on 27 October in support of theirdemand for special treatment as political prisoners.    Support forthe protest in Northern Ireland had so far been confined to smalldaily demonstrations, but these could be expected to increase inscale and number as the hunger strike proceeded. Somedemonstrations in London had already been planned, including athree day fast outside the Houses of Parliament, and there was arisk that the PIRA would try to reinforce the effect of thesedemonstrations by the resumption of violence on the mainland. Itwas doubtful whether they had the capacity to mount a sustainedcampaign, but they could attempt a limited number of terroristoutraged for propaganda purposes.    The hunger strikers had thedetermination to persist in their action.    The first deaths couldbe expected around Christmas, and the numbers could well be indouble figures by the early part of next year.    The Government&apos;smiin task was to carry public opinion with it in its determinationnot to concede any special status to those who had been convictedof murder and other crimes of violence.    Three of the fiveprivileges demanded by the protestors as part of the more generaldemand for political status were already available to thoseprisoners who conformed to normal prison regulations. Therecould be no question of exempting any of the PIRA prisoners fromthe requirement to carry out prison work.    The fifth demand wasfor the PIRA prisoners to be allowed to wear their own clothes.Any privilege of this kind would have to be made available to allprisoners in Northern Ireland, and not just to those convicted ofcrimes having a political motive.    Some consideration had alreadybeen given to the issue of civilian-type clothing as part of thecontinuing process of reviewing possible ameliorations of theprison regime in Northern Ireland, particularly in the light of thecomments of the European Commission on Human Rights. TheHeme and Social Affairs Committee had considered on 21 Octoberwhether it would be helpful for the Government to announce inadvance of the beginning of the strike that they were prepared tolet all Northern Ireland prisoners wear civilian clothes selectedfrom an approved range, or whether it would be preferable to holdthis concession in reserve as a possible card to play later in thestrike when those involved might be searching for a face savingformula.    The Cardinal Archbiship of Armagh (Cardinal O&apos;Fiaich)2SECRET
SECREThad originally given the impression that, if there were a concessionon clothing he would be willing to use his endeavours to persuadethose involved to abandon the threatened strike, but he had recentlyhinted that he would also expect some concession on prison work.Most members of the Home and Social Affairs Committee hadconsidered that to make any concessions now would be seen as asign of weakness, though they had recognised that a gesture onclothing at a later stage might be helpful.    Since the meeting ofH Committee, he had spoken again to the Chief Constable ofNorthern Ireland, who had said that he would be able to deal withany civil unrest occasioned by the protest, but that an indicationof flexibility on the part of the Government would, on balance, behelpful.    His own view was that he should make a statement makingit clear that the Government were in no circumstances prepared togrant special status to the PIRA prisoners, but that, as part of thecontinuing process of penal reform in Northern Ireland, they wereprepared to allow all prisoners to wear approved civilian clothing.He considered that a statement on these lines would deprive theprotestors of a great deal of public sympathy both within theUnited Kingdom and abroad, and would be better made now than ata later stage when it could be presented as a surrender to theprisoners&apos; action.In discussion, it was argued that a change in the rules on prisonclothing which did not allow prisoners to wear their own clotheswould not be seen as a genuine concession, and was very unlikely toavert the threatened hunger strike.    It would appear that theGovernment was prepared to go some way towards granting prisonerof war status before the protest had even begun, and it would beassumed that the Government would be willing to give way on otherissues, including work, once the strike reached a critical stage.The Government should not give away all its bargaining counters atthe beginning of the action.    On the other hand, it was argued thatit should be made clear from the outset how far the Governmentwere prepared to go, and that once the protest had started, nofurther offers which would be interpreted as giving way underpressure should be made.    A concession which was unlikely topersuade the hunger strikers not to start their strike was not verylikely to persuade them to call it off once the strike was under way.A reasonable approach by the Government at this stage wouldundermine support for the protestors, and would reduce the riskthat the scurrilous Press campaign against the Government whichhad begun in the United States would lead to an increased flow ofmoney and arms to the PIRA.    Many other countries, including theRepublic of Ireland, permitted prisoners to wear civilian clothes,and a move in this direction in Northern Ireland could be presentedas an enlightened measure of general reform rather than as aSECRET
SECRETyielding to sectional pressures, though care must be taken to avoidany suggestion that a similar change would be made in theimmediate future in Great Britain.    In Great Britain, though notin Northern Ireland, the Prison Officers Association would opposeany change.   Another relevant consideration was that the Taoiseachhad been co-operating fully in enforcing border security, in spiteof mounting domestic criticism, and it was essential not to make hisposition more difficult.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was unlikely that ary Government actionshort of conceding full political status to the PIRA prisoners couldnow avert the threatened hunger strike.    On balance, however,and taking account of the views of the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland, the Cabinet considered that public opinion in theUnited Kingdom and abroad would be more likely to be sympatheticto the Government if they announced at the outset that they wouldarrange for all prisoners in Northern Ireland who conformed togeneral prison rules to be issued with a more varied range ofcivilian type clothing while again making it clear that they were inno circumstances prepared to concede special political status toPIRA prisoners.    Once the Government&apos;s position had been madeclear, no further concessions should be offered.    The Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland should arrange to make a full statementof the Government&apos;s position as soon as possible.The Cabinet -1.        Invited the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland to make an early statementon the lines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up.The Cabinet had before them a minute of 22 October from theHome Secretary to the Prime Minister about the consequences ofthe industrial action being taken by members of the PrisonOfficers&apos; Association (POA) in England and Wales and the likelyneed to seek new statutory provisions to deal with the resultantsituation.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, although the ostensible causeof the industrial action was a relatively minor, though potentiallyexpensive, claim for retrospective payment for continuous dutycredits (CDCs) to cover meal breaks, the POA were seeking tochallenge his authority as the Minister responsible for the prisonservice in England and Wales and ultimately that of the Government.SECRET
SECRETThey had sought opportunities to make such a challenge in thepast, and in 1978 the previous Administration had appointed theMay Committee of Inquiry to consider, among other things, prisonofficers&apos; conditions of service.    The Committee had recommendeda pay increase of 7 per cent, over and above that given to othercivil servants, and the payment of three claims for CDCs. TheGovernment had implemented vhese recommendations immediately.The POA, whose former officers and executive committee hadrecently been replaced by a more militant group, had pressed twoother claims to CDCs which the May Committee had notrecommended, although they had not in terms rejected them. Hehad refused to grant these claims or contemplate arbitration cnthem because the May Committee had in fact considered them, andby not recommending on them must be presumed to have foundagainst them; moreover, arbitration would not fall within theCivil Service Arbitration Agreement.   At the same time,negotiations were being held on a new duty system which, onceimplemented, should remove this cause of friction by ensuring thatall prison officers received similar allowances.    Had it not beenfor the present dispute these negotiations would by now have beensatisfactorily concluded.    He had no doubt that he was right tostand firm, since otherwise the Home Office and prison governorswould lose control of the prisons to the POA.    The Associationdid not at present have the support of other trade unions, althoughthey retained the loyalty of their members, and their action hadbeen widely attacked in the Press.    Within the prisons the industrialaction had led to the closing of workshops and the worsening ofconditions for inmates.    The greatest problems arose, however,from the refusal of the POA to allow newly-sentenced prisonersto be admitted to prison or those returning after court appearancesto be re-admitted.   Asa result some 3, 000 prisoners, including130 women, were now being held in increasingly unsatisfactoryconditions in police cells.    By the middle of the following week all5, 000 or so places in such cells would be full, even thoughprisoners, with police co-operation, were being moved from onepart of the country to another.    He now proposed, with theco-operation of the Secretary of State for Defence, to arrange forprisoners to be held in service camps.    The police would assistwith security and, so far as possible, service personnel would notcome into direct contact with prisoners.    Legislation would haveto be introduced before such camps could be used and to put beyonddoubt the legal position of those held in police cells.    He alsosought the agreement of Cabinet to the inclusion in the legislationof provisions suspending the requirement to produce remandprisoners regularly before the courts, restricting courts&apos; powersto commit non-criminal prisoners to prison and, which herecognised to be particularly controversial, a reserve power for5SECRET
SECRETthe grant of executive bail to prisoners on remand who had beenrefused bail by the courts: he already had power to grant temporaryrelease to sentenced prisoners.    It was possible, though unlikely,that he would be able to persuade the POA to modify their stance ata meeting later that day or at a further meeting on Monday.Otherwise he proposed, if the Cabinet agreed, to make a statementin the House of Commons on Monday of his intention to introducelegislation.    The Bill, which would apply only to England and Wales,would need to become law by Wednesday, 29 October if he were toretain the necessary room for manoeuvre.In discussion it was pointed oat that it would be essential to securethe support of the Opposition if the proposed Bill were to passthrough all its stages in the House of Commons on 28 October andin the House of Lords the following day.    The Home Secretary wouldbe in touch with Mr Merlyn Rees, MP, the Opposition spokesmanon Home Affairs, as soon as he returned from abroad.    But noapproaches could be made through the usual channels until it wascertain that legislation would have to be introduced.   The fact thatdiscussion of the Bill in the House of Commons on Tuesday wouldbe followed by a debate at the request of the Opposition onunemployment on Wednesday might assist the passage of the Billin the Commons, although a lengthy sitting seemed inevitable. Theprovisions for the grant of executive bail for which the HomeSecretary would carry Ministerial responsibility would becontroversial since they ran contrary to the normal doctrine ofthe independence of the courts, and the way in which these provisionswere presented would therefore be important.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet fully supported the firm line which the Home Secretary hadtaken in the current dispute with the POA.    They agreed thatprisoners should, if necessary, be held in Ministry of Defencecamps as well as in police stations, and authorised the use ofservice personnel on the lines agreed between the Home Secretaryand the Secretary of State for Defence.    They agreed that a Billshould be prepared containing the changes in the law set out in theHome Secretary&apos;s minute of 22 October, and that unless the POAchanged their stance within the next few days the Home Secretaryshould announce in the House of Commons on 27 October hisintention to introduce such a Bill.    The Lord President, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip shoulddo everything possible to secure that if legislation were necessarythe Bill passed through all its stages in both Houses on 28 and29 October.6SECRET
SECRETThe Cabinet -2. Endorsed the line taken by the HomeSecretary in response to the claim by thePrison Officers&apos; Association for the retrospectivepayment of further continuous duty credits.3. Agreed that an Imprisonment (TemporaryPowers) Bill should be prepared containing theprovisions summarised in the Home Secretary&apos;sminute and that Parliamentary Counsel shouldbe authorised to draft the Bill.4. Noted that the Home Secretary wouldhold further meetings with representatives ofthe Prison Officers&apos; Association.5. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, tomake a statement in the House of Commons onMonday 27 October and, subject to the outcome ofhis meetings with the Prison Officers&apos; Association,to announce his intention to introduce the Bill.6. Invited the Lord President of the Council,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theChief Whip to do everything possible to securethat, if a Bill were introduced, it became law onWednesday 29 October.7SECRET
CONFIDENTIAL3.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the agreement reachedon the military reintegration of Greece into the North AtlanticTreaty Organisation was a welcome development, in which thePrime Minister&apos;s recent discussions in Athens had played a part.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that recent hard-line comments onPoland by Czechoslovak, Romanian and East German leadersseemed to have been designed more to inhibit the spread of politicalinfection to their own countries than to foreshadow intervention inPoland itself. gffi?THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there had been no majordevelopments in the fighting between Iraq and Iran.    The Iraqiforces were still advancing, but very slowly.    The IranianGovernment had at the United Nations shown signs of interest innegotiations, but it was not clear whether there was any real changeof attitude.   It was also unclear what if anything lay behind recentremarks by President Carter and his Secretary of State, Mr Muskie,on the possible release of the American hostages.    Because cf theimplications for the arms embargo, it had been made clear to theUnited States Government that Britain would expect advance noticeof any deal between Washington and Tehran.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that a team from the United NationsSecretariat was encountering difficulties in its discussions onNamibia with the South African authorities in Pretoria. Messagesmight need to be sent to the South African Prime Minister,Mr P W Botha, by the Heads of Government of the five Westerncountries represented on the Namibia Contact Group at the UnitedNations.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said thatdiscussions were still continuing as to whether steel production withinthe Community should be regulated on a voluntary basis or throughmandatory quotas under the Treaty establishing the European Coal andSteel Community.    The United Kingdom and other member statesfavoured the latter course, but the Federal Republic of Germanywanted only a voluntary arrangement and were threatening to invokethe Luxembourg Compromise to prevent the Council deciding onmandatorv quotas by majority vote.   While the Federal Republic hadnot previously invoked the Luxembourg Compromise they saw no reasonto e 8chew a weapon which had been frequently used by the French. Itwas in the interests of the United Kingdom that steel production withinthe Community should be regulated.    The Council of Ministers wouldbe meeting again to discuss the question on Saturday, 25 October.CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that Laker Airwayshad appealed to him against a decision of the Civil Aviation Authorityto reject an application for a licence to operate on a large number ofEuropean routes.    The application had been based on the argumentthat the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome overruled the nationalregulatory provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1971.    On legal advicethat our national legislation was valid he had turned down the appeal;it was open to Sir Frederick Laker to challenge this decision in theCourts.    To have granted any of the requests would have achievednothing, since the other European Governments concerned would nothave been willing to agree.   His qua si-judicial function under the CivilAviation Act had left him little choice but to turn down the appeal,although this had inevitably led to some criticism in the Press.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a British nuclear test would takeplace in the United States on 24 October.    It was designed to testa mechanism for varying the yield of future tactical nuclearweapons.   An announcement would be made immediately after thetest, but until then the matter would remain strictly confidential.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL8 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said mat, as r. result ofrulings in the European Court, we were under pressure to change therelationship between our excise duties on beer and wine. Although,as some newspaper reports had suggested, this could lead to asignificant increase in the duty on beer, if the change proposed wasmade in a single move and entirely by adjusting the excise duty onbear, it could equally be accomplished through a smaller increasein the beer duty and a reduction in duties on wine; and if spread overa period of several years could be accommodated without difficulty.In view of its political sensitivity, the matter would be consideredm later by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet -Took note.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL5.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Home Secretary(C(80) 57), to Which was attached a revised draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft Speech attached toC(80) 57 had been revised in the light of the discussion in the Cabineton 16 October.    It incorporated a passage on unemployment suggestedby the Secretary of State for Employment, amendments agreed by theCabinet, revisions suggested by the Secretaries of State for Industryand Energy, and further drafting improvements suggested by thePaymaster General.    The passages on State Visits and on NorthernIreland still had to be finalised;    Amendments became increasinglydifficult to incorporate as the date of State Opening drew nearer, andhe hoped that it would be possible to agree on a final text for thesereferences in die very near future.    With these exceptions, heinvited the Cabinet to approve the draft Opening Speech.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that thelate start of the next Sessiou of Parliament, the addition of at leastfour new Bills to the legislative programme approved by the Cabinetin May, and the fact that a number of major Bills might have to betaken through all their stages on the Floor of the House of Commonsmeant tnat the Government&apos;s legislative timetable would be undervery heavy pressure in the new Session.    There was a serious dangerthat the highly unsatisfactory situation which had obtained in the latterfart of the current Session would be repeated next year unless diebusiness managers were left sufficient scope for lightening theprogramme if necessary.   He suggested that the specific referencesto some of the less essential Bills should be deleted from the draftSpeech, and left to be subsumed by the general reference to othermeasures.    This would not necessarily mean that the Bills concernedwould have to be abandoned, but it would leave the Government freeto review the situation as the Session progressed.   As an example,the references to the Civic Government (Scotland) Bill and to the Billson company law, insurance and civil jurisdiction might be omitted.In discussion, it was pointed out that a large part of the difficultiesexperienced in the current Session had arisen because there had beenan insufficient number of Bills ready for House of Lords introductionat the start of the Session.    Many Bills which might be thought lessessential were suitable for introduction in the House of Lords, and itwould be pointless to remove them from the programme if that wereto mean that the House of Lords would be short of legislative businessin the opening weeks of the new Session.    It would be preferable(though not ideal) to allow them to be taken through all their stagesin the House of Lords, and then for a separate decision to be taken inthe New Year on whether it would be possible to find time for all ofdiem in the House of Commons.11
CONFIDENTIALIn further discussion, the following main points were made:a. The reference to unemployment might need to berevised in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s subsequent decisionson public expenditure.b. The Companies Bill did not consist only of provisionswhich stemmed from European Community commitments;it also included provisions which were an essential part ofthe Government&apos;s strategy to reduce manpower in the publicservices and to assist small businesses.    It would bedesirable to amend the relevant passage in the draft Speechto avoid the implication that the Bills on company law andinsurance were confined to the implementation of EuropeanCommunity Directives.c. The Scottish Eills on education, local government,and civic government were necessary te fulfil policycommitments in Scotland.    Of the five Scottish Bills inthe 1980-81 programme, only those on local and civicgovernment would have to receive their Second Readingen the Floor of the House of Commons instead of in theScottish Grand Committee;   all would, however, take timeon the Floor of the House of Lords.d. The Energy Conservation Bill was a relatively modestmeasure which implemented European Community require-ments on the labelling of energy consuming appliances, butthe omission of a conservation measure from the Speech orthe programme would be presentationally unde sirable.e. The State Visit of the President of Mexico originallyplanned for next year would not now take place.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it wasimportant that The Queen&apos;s Speech should not commit the Governmentto a legislative programme which it might not be able to carry throughbecause of the pressures on Parliamentary time.   The businessmanagers should consider with the Ministers concerned whetherreferences to particular Bills could be removed from the Speech, onthe understanding that this would not preclude the introduction of therelevant legislation if Parliamentary time could be found.    In thelight of these consultations, the Home Secretary should circulate afurther revised version of the draft Speech for final approval at thefollowing week&apos;s Cabinet.12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,and the Chief Whips, to dircuss with the Minister:concerned which references to individual Bills could bedeleted from the draft Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament, and to report their conclusions to theHome Secretary.2. Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a reviseddraft of the Speech for consideration at the following week&apos;sCabinet.13CONFIDENTIAL6.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER gave the Cabineta brief assessment of the economic prospect and its implications forpolicy as background to their forthcoming discussions of the publicexpenditure programme.THE PRIME MINISTER said that by way of preparation for thediscussion of the issues on public expenditure which the Cabinetwould have to consider on 30 October, she had invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer, together with the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment, the Lord President of the Council and the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, to discuss urgently with each of the Ministersresponsible for large spending programmes the proposals affectingtheir Departments which were set out in the memorandum (C(80) 58)circulated by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    The outcome of thesediscussions would be reported to the Cabinet for their discussion on30 October.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL7.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(80) 56) by theLord President of the Council on reductions in Civil Service manpower.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled the Government1 sannounced policy of reducing Civil Service manpower from 732, 000 inApril 1979 to 630, 000 by April 1984.   It had been agreed, but notannounced, that provision should be made within the total of 630, 000for a contingency margin of 10, 000 to allow for unavoidable staffincreases to deal with, for example, rising unemployment.    He nowjudged that it would be prudent to increase this margin to 15, 000 andtherefore to aim for a gross target of 615, 000 by April 1984. Toachieve this reduction it would be necessary to find another 22, 000staff savings in addition to those to which Ministers had agreed indiscussions with him.   Allowing for savings from greater efficiency,of not less than 2 per cent a year overall, he judged that thesereductions could be made, and he had set out in Annex A to C(80) 56his proposed targets for each Department within a total of 615, 000.After allowing for some growth already approved, this represented areduction of 19 per cent on average of staff in post on 1 April 1979,though with variations for individual Departments depending on theirparticular circumstances.    There would be some offsetting costsfrom retiring people early and from unavoidable redundancies, and hehoped that the Chief Secretary, Treasury would now give his agreementto a scheme for voluntary early retirement.   A number of savingswould need legislation and firm places would have to be found for thenecessary Bills in the relevant legislative programmes.In discussion the following points were made -a. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary ofState for Defence, the Lord Privy Seal (for the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary), the Secretary of State for Industry,the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister ofTransport were uncertain whether it would be practicable tomake the full reductions proposed for their Departments, butthey would each do their utmost to reach the targets set.Each would wish to discuss their targets further with theLord President of the Council.b. There would be difficulties in making the full savingsproposed for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, sincea high proportion of their staff were locally employed andexcluded from the totals under discussion; but allowance hadbeen made for this in the target set them.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. In a number of cases achievement of the targets woulddepend on the transfer of functions to the private sector and topriority being given to the necessary legislation.    In some casesthere was a risk that costs could be higher if work weretransferred out of Departments, but there was a danger thatthis argument could be used to stall on changes and it shouldbe viewed with scepticism.    The criteria for transfers offunctions to the private sector should be as stated by the PrimeMinister in the House of Commons, that they should becommensurate with good management and good value for moneyfor the taxpayer,d. For the most part staff and unions had been co-operativeso far in accepting the need for cuts.    It would be important,in explaining the cuts to the staff and to the public, not to implyundue criticisms of civil servants but to present the measuresas sensible steps towards greater efficiency.   If Civil Servicenumbers were too high, or the functions of Government were notbeing discharged as efficiently as they should be, that was lessbureaucratic failure than failure of political management overmany years and governments of both political parties. Thisshould be acknowledged publicly: Ministers should give civilservants credit for the work they did, and for their co-operationin reducing numbers and increasing efficiency, so as to maintainthat co-operation and the morale of the Service. Unjustifiableattacks on the Civil Service, like those recently made byProfessor Milton Friedman on the Treasury and the Bank ofEngland, should be robustly answered and rebutted by Ministers.e. Reductions in Civil Service numbers, and in the size ofpay increases, were the best way of cutting public expenditurewithout damaging the private sector.    For the manpower targetsto be met it was essential that Ministers and senior civilservants in every Department should continue to give priorityand their full support, to finding savings and further measuresof efficiency.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet reaffirmed their earlier decision to reduce the number of civilservants to 630, 000 by April 1984.    Within this total they agreed thatthe contingency margin should be increased to 15,000. EachDepartmental Minister should strain to reach the individual targetsproposed for him by the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet -1.      Agreed that within the public target of 630, 000 civilservants by April 1984 there should be a contingencyreserve of 15, 000.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. Agreed that the revised basic target of 615, 000 for1 April 1984 should be subdivided between Departments asproposed in Annex A of C(80) 56.3. Endorsed the resultant figures for each Departmentas firm targets, which each Departmental Minister shoulddo his utmost to ensure were achieved.4. Took note of the need for legislation as set out inAnnex C of C(80) 56.5. Took note that the Lord President of the Councilwould discuss further with the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretaryof State for Defence, the Secretary of State for Industry,the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Ministerof Transport how best to achieve the targets proposed fortheir Departments.Cabinet Office23 October 198016CONFIDENTIAL
At this morning&apos;s meeting of H Committee the Secretary of StateNorthern Ireland confirmed that seven I.R.A* prisoners at thePrison were almost certain to begin a hunger strike ouOctober and that both they and others who might start aLiar strike a little latex were sufficiently determined to tinue the strike until they died.   The hunger strike would beImpanied by an orchestrated campaign of support throughoutland and abroad.The Committee were unanimous in supporting the view of theetary of State for Northern Ireland that the Government couldcompromise on the principle of granting political status to theoners concerned, and that the aim must be to sustain theoving security position.   Against that background we consideredcarefully the advantages and disadvantages of the Governmentfig any move in advance of the strike on the lines discussed inecretary of State&apos;s paper H(80) 74.We noted that of the five points listed in paragraph 5 of thatthe first three presented no difficulties if and when theaers were willing to conform to the normal rules, and agreedno concession should be made on the requirement for prisonersrk.   Discussion therefore centred on the possible announcementchange in policy v/hereby all prisoners in Northern Ireland whormed to general prison rules would, in the course of time, bed with a more varied range of civilian-type clothing.   Host ofommittee, though not all, felt that it would not be sensible-fo:
Government to offer such, a change of policy now.   Since neitherr the Secretary of State for Scotland could contemplate an earlylar change being made for Great Britain, it could not-Jincingly be represented as a general measure of penal reform.Tas the more lilcely therefore to be seen as a concession to theoners made only because of the imminence of the hunger strike,does not mean, however, that rne possibility of making such aession or of offering a va.de review of prison regimes inhern Ireland may not be useful cards to play as events develop.The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will, if you agree, rt the latest position to Cabinet on Thursday, when he will have the benefit of formal advice from the Chief Constable.   He had iBind, subject to colleagues1 agreement, to make a full statementIthe Government&apos;s position on Friday in Northern Ireland and toI a statement to the House of Commons when it resumes on ay&gt; 27th October.I At the same time, I am likely myself to have to make a statemenput the dispute with the Prison Officers&apos; Association in England Vales.   Both matters could, if you agree, be raised underpliamentary Affairs&quot; at Cabinet or, alternatively, there could  separate item on the agenda.II am copying this minute to the Secretary of State forHiern Ireland, to our other Cabinet colleagues, to theioraey General and the Minister of Transport, and to  Robert Armstrong.11.&apos;&lt;. / .
