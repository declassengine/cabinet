SECRETent IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO    0 KCABINETLIMITED C EtC U L AT ION ANNEXCC(CO) 38th ConclusionsTuesday 4 November 1980 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C(80) 58) and a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(80 ) 64) proposingchanges in public expenditure programmes.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, continuing the discussion begunat its previous meeting, the Cabinet now had to reach specificdecisions on the cuts to be made in public expenditure.    In a briefgeneral discussion, it was suggested that the Cabinet should notnecessarily accept the case for &quot;equality of misery&quot; in consideringcuts in public expenditure on economic grounds, without having dueregard also to the political and social consequences of what wasproposed.    The Cabinet should be in a position to weigh theeconomic, political and social consequences of all the various meansof achieving the Government&apos;s economic strategy, including changesin taxation as well as reductions in public expenditure.    It wassuggested mat final decisions should not be reached on any of theproposals now before the Cabinet until there had been an opportunityof considering all of them     It was also pointed out that it was amajor objective of Government policy to reduce the burden of publicexpenditure upon the resources generated by the private sector:this was achieved by reductions in public expenditure but not byincreases in taxation which transferred resources from the privateto the public sector.The Cabinet then turned to the detailed proposals set out in C(80) 64,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in furtherdiscussion with Departmental Ministers agreement had beenreached on reductions in the programmes of the Department of theEnvironment, the Ministry of Transport, the Foreign andCommonwealth Office (including Aid), and of the Office of Artsand Libraries.1SECRET
SECRETTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatin order to make the cuts required of him from the HousingProgramme, and to avoid any further reductions in capital invest-ment, it was likely that the rent guideline for next year would haveto indicate an average rent increase of  3.25 compared with the 2. 85 implied by the figures in the last Public Expenditure WhitePaper. (Cmnd 7841).    This was likely to be presented asdiscrimination against the council house tenant as against the homeowner who enjoyed tax relief on his mortgage interest, the increasewould of course be mitigated for those tenants eligible for the rentrebate scheme.    It would also have an inflationary effect and,taken in conjunction with other factors (such as increases in ratesand in electricity and gas prices), would be used to justify higherpay claims than otherwise.    So far as possible he would look forrevenue rather than capital cuts on the other part of his programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet took note of the implication for council houserents of the proposed cuts in the Housing Programme.    All thoseMinisters who had already agreed to make the full cuts demandedof them would be faced with strong public criticism. Theirdifficulties in rebutting this criticism would be considerablyincreased if similar cuts were not made on other programmes.The Cabinet -1. Endorsed the agreed reductions in publicexpenditure programmes reported in C(80) 64.SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he proposed afurther 1 per cent cut in local authority current expenditure in eachyear, to be shared out proportionately among the relevant pro-grammes, on top of the decision announced in August of a2 per cent reduction.    Of this further 1 per cent cut,  61 millionwould fall on the education services.    In addition he recommended*hat in 1981-82 the cash limited higher education programmes shouldbe cut by 2 per cent, as was proposed for cash controlledprogrammes generally, at a cost of  30 million;  rather than byj per cent, or  8 million, as proposed by the Secretary of State forEducation and Science.    The total cuts for 1981-82, including the 85 million agreed by Cabinet in July, should be carried iorward byreductions of  236 million in 1982-83 and of  241 million iu 1983-84.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat, if the proposed cut of  61 million were implemented the totalreduction in current expenditure on the education services would beabout 4-  per cent between 1980-81 and 1981-82, compared with afall in the number of pupils in the year of only 2 per cent. Thiswould be contrary to the assumption, which had previously been
SECRETaccepted, that the fall in expenditure could not match that in pupilnumbers without reducing standards.    Of the  85 millionreduction agreed in July,  63 million was off local authority currentexpenditure.     Of the total cut of  124 million which was nowdemanded he judged that about  100 million would have to comefrom the schools programme.    This sum was twice the .otalannual provision for books;  and equivalent to about two-thirdsof the provision for educatioi cf children under the age of 5. Inpractice it would have to be found by increasing the reduction inteacher numbers to 26,000 in the year compared with the 11, 000assumed at present.    Redundancies would not help because of thecosts involved in redundancy payments, and in practice localauthorities would have to suspend the recruitment of teachers andwould be unable to replace any teacher leaving in the next 12 months*This would add to the difficulties already arising from shortages ofmathematics and science teacher s0    In his judgment such reductionsin the numbers of teachers were not feasible within this time scale.Already local authorities, including Conservative controlledauthorities, were complaiir&apos;.ng strongly of the cuts so far requiredof them.   Anything more would be highly damaging to the Governmentboth politically and in terms of its education policy.Tn discussion the following points were made:-a. An exception for the education services would makeit impossible to achieve a cut in local authority currentexpenditure by a further 1 per cent.    It would be tantamountto saying that the Government now judged that educationmerited higher priority than, for example, the law andorder services.    In practice under the new grant arrange-ments it would be for the local authorities to decide forthemselves how the cuts would be made and on theproportion which would fall on the education services.b. It did not necessarily follow that the proposedreduction would affect educational standards.    If the cutswere implemented, there would be a 4 per cent decline inexpenditure between 1979-80 and 1981-82 compared with a6 per cent reduction in pupils.    Only about half of staffexpenditure was on teachers.    Some authorities had beenvigorous in reducing non-teaching staff but there remainedroom for further savings in this area by other authorities,,On the teaching side, teachers had benefited from two recenthigh pay awards; and the number of unemployed teachershad remained otable at a time when unemployment generallywas rising, although this partly reflected the reduced intakeof people into the teacher training colleges.3SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up mis part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet recognised the difficulties of making further cuts inthe education programmes    Without them, however, it would not bepossible to achieve the 1 per cent reduction in local authority currentexpenditure which was a major ingredient of the proposals forreducing public expenditure.   The proposed  61 million cut incurrent expenditure on education services should therefore beaccepted as part of the general 1 per cent cut on local authoritycurrent expenditure, subject to the other proposals before theCabinet for reductions in local authority current expenditure alsobeing agreed.The Cabinet -2. Agreed to a reduction of  61 million in 1981-82in current expenditure on education services, as partof a general 1 per cent cut on local authority currentexpenditure, subject to agreement being reached on theother components oi the 1 per cent cut.3. Agreed to resume discussion later of the proposed9. per cent cut in cash controlled educational spendingprogrammes.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he accepted thatit would not be possible to make good the  100 million loss ofincome from health charges, mainly for accidents, which could notnow be implemented.    He recommended that, in addition to the cuton local authority current spending on social services which hadalready been agreed, there should be a reduction of  126 millionrepresenting the health programme&apos;s share of the general 2 per centreduction in cash controlled programmes.    He did not agree withthe alternative of raising this sum by an increase in the NationalHealth Service (NHS) element in the National Insurance contribution.This would reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)but not public expenditure.    It was essentially a form of tax, and aregressive poll tax at that, and, if an increase were to be considered,it should be in the context of a review of all tne options for changes intaxation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that therehad already been reductions in the net cost of the health programmefrom increased prescription charges; and reductions in expenditurefrom reorganisation and greater efficiency were already in train,though the full financial benefits of this would not accrue until after1981-82,   He strongly recommended that, rather than make anyfurther expenditure cuts in spending on the NHS, the amount requiredshould be raised by an increase in the NHS element in the National4SECRET
SECRETInsurance contribution.    He would be willing to consider anincrease of 0,2 percentage points, which would be sufficient tocover not only the saving which the Chancellor of the Exchequerwas now seeking but also the  100 million loss of income fromcharges.    This approach would be in line with the Government&apos;slonger term objective of placing greater reliance on insurance as ameans of financing the health service.    It was socially sensible,in that it placed the burden cn those in work rather than (as cuts inthe Service would) on the sick, the old, and the unemployed. Hebelieved that it would be perceived by the general public not as anincrease in tax but as an addition to the insurance premium for NHScare.    It would avoid the alternative of cuts which could wellinvolve closing wards and reducing the numbers of doctors and ofnurses.    Subject to further advice, he believed that the change couldbe effected without the need for primary legislation in advance of theFinance Bill  r of other social security legislation which might beintroduced next year.In discussion it was pointed out that there was still considerableinefficiency in the health services and that there should be somescope for finding further savings without, in effect, pre-emptingtax decisions.    On the other hand there would be difficulty in findingsuch savings quickly, and the proposed increase in the NHS chargewould avoid the major social and political difficulties which wouldresult from further cuts in the health programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed on balance that the NHS element in theNational Insurance contribution should be raised rather than thehealth programme cut.    The Secretary of State for Social Servicesshould consider further whether this decision posed any difficultiesfor the legislative programme, and he should consult further withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer on what should be the yield soughtfrom the increase in the contributions.The Cabinet -4. Agreed that there should be an increase in theNational Health Service element in the NationalInsurance contribution rather than a cut in healthexpenditure.5. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services:a. to consult further with the Chancellor of theExchequer on the extent of the increase;b, to confirm that the decision would not requireearly primary legislation;and to report.SECRET
SECRETTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that to provide forspecial employment measures he recommended net increases of 167 million in 1981-82, S203 million in 1982-83 and  189 millionin 1983-84.    These proposals assumed that the Secretary of Statefor Employment would find  42 million nec savings in 1981-82, andrather more in the later years, La addition to his share jf the general2 per cent cut in cash limited programmes and the 1 per cent cut inlocal authority current expenditure.    This additional provisionwould be sufficient to finance continuation, but not improvement, ofexisting special employment schemes and undertakings, includingthe Youth Opportunities Programme (YOP).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theadditional provision necessary to maintain existing schemes andundertakings arose in part because of rising unemployment and inpart because the Job Release Scheme (JRS) and the TemporaryShort-Time Working Compensation Scheme (TSTWCS) had previouslybeen financed from the Contingency Reserve,    The Chief Secretary,Treasury&apos;s, proposals, implying no improvement of existing schemesrepresented not an increase in expenditure but merely a transferfrom the Contingency Reserve.   At a time when unemployment wasrising rapidly it was not sufficient simply to maintain existingschemes.    Some modest improvement was necessary to help inparticular the young and the adult long-term unemployed.    A further 15 million in 1981-82 would enable him to make significant improve-ments in the YOP particularly directed to 16 and 17 year olds. Toincrease the opportunities for the longer term adult unemployed hewished to replace the regionally based Special TemporaryEmployment Programme (STEP) by a new nationwide CommunityEnterprise Programme(CEP).    CEP should be able to provide for25, 000 people compared with 12, 000 under STEP.    It would recognisithe problems of the high pockets of unemployment outside thedevelopment areas.    It would be developed in partnership withprivate sector industry and voluntary agencies.    The additionalcosts would be  28 million in 1981-82.    He proposed that theTSTWCS, which helped firms avoid redundancies, should givesupport in future for up to 9 months rather than 6 months at present.He was prepared to offset the costs of this extension by reducing therate of support from 75 per cent to 65 per cent of normal pay. Hewas reluctantly prepared to forego any improvements in the JRS andin this way additional expenditure of  46 million in 1981-82 would beavoided.In discussion it was suggested that further consideration should begiven to the inter-relation between the measures proposed by theSecretary of State for Employment and measures for industrialassistance for which the Department of Industry and the Departmentof the Environment (through the Development Commission and theCouncil of Small Industries in Rural Areas (COSIRA)) wereresponsible, so as to eliminate duplication and overlap.6SECRET
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the improvements in special employment measuresproposed by the Secretary of State for Employment and to theproposed change in the TSTWCS, and agreed to forego improvementsin the JRS.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should new discussthese changes, and the net offsetting savings which he had proposed,further with the Secretary of State for Employment and reachagreement on the total net additions to the employment programmein each year.The Cabinet -6. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and theSecretary of State for Employment to agree on thetotal net additions to the employment programme in thelight of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.7. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment todiscuss with the Secretaries of State for Industry and forthe Environment the inter-relation between his proposalsfor special employment measures and measures forregional and industrial assistance in their fields ofre spon sibility.7SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he recommendedreductions of  500 million in each year from the Defence Budget,made up of  188 million from the general 2 per cent cut in cashlimited expenditure and of  312 million specific cuts.    The effectwould be to break with the aim of 3 per cent growth in defencespending in real terms in 1981-82, but this was justified againstthe background of our acute economic difficulties and at a timewhen many of our allies were also failing to meet the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) target.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that theGovernment had already cut  1.5 billion from the programmeinherited from the last Administration, which it had criticised asinadequate.    Within that reduced programme it would be necessaryto finance Trident and to honour the undertaking that it would enableus to reinforce our conventional defence capability.    The cuts madeinvolved delays and cancellation of projects for all three services.The Defence Budget had already been reduced as far as he and theChiefs of Staff judged to be prudent.    Any further cut s, and failureto fulfil our NATO commitment to 3 per cent growth annually, wouldbe damaging to the Alliance, to our international standing and to thesecurity of the West at a time of increasing tension worldwide.Admittedly some of our allies were falling short of the target growth
SECRETin expenditure this year, but most of them could point to a bettergrowth record in defence spending than the United Kingdom inrecent years.    Failure to live up to our promises could lead othersto relax their efforts.    Moreover, if there were to be cuts of 500 miUion, this would have very serious effects on the defenceindustrial base: he estimated th?.t it would lead to 70,000 jobslost, to the bankruptcy of many firms and to the disappearance ofsome defence industries.    Cuts of this scale would be contrary tothe Government&apos;s pledge in the Manifesto, and would imply an actuali eduction in the level of defence spending in real terms.    He wasprepared to recommend as a compromise, on which he did not havethe support of the Chiefs of Staff, a cut of  152 million in 1981-82,subject to three conditions:i.       While he did not at this stage seek a commitmentfrom the Cabinet to implement whatever the Armed ForcesPay Review Body recommended in April 1981, recognisingmat the Cabinet should be free to take whatever decisionwas appzopriate when the recommendations were received,the cash limit for armed forces pay in 1981-82 should beadjusted to accommodate whatever pay increases theCabinet agreed in the light of the Review Body&apos;s report,ii.       The cash limit factor for prices as applied to theDefence Budget should be adjusted to take account of thefact that prices for defence equipment tended to increasefaster than the general level of prices.iii.       There should be no further changes In the base-linefor the Defence Budget.On this basis he would undertake to absorb in 1981-82 any amountby which defence expenditure in 1980-81 overran the revised cashlimit for that year.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Secretaryof State for Defence&apos;s proposals failed to take account of the realityof the decline in the United Kingdom&apos;s gross domestic product or ofthe contribution which was needed from the Defence Budget if theagreed objective for bringing down the public sector borrowingrequirement was to be achieved.    The conditions proposed implieda view that the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces should beoutside the disciplines imposed on the Government as a whole by therealities of the economic situation.In discussion the following points were made:a. Increases of 3 per cent would have been achievedin 1979-80 and in 1980-81 and, under the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s proposals, would probably be made in1982-83 and in 1983-84.    In the present economic climate8SECRET
SECRETa dip in 1981-1982 would not be unexpected, at home orabroad.    The cut should not be to the full extent of 500 million, since this would lead to a reduction of0. 7 per rent in the level of defence spending in realterms.    It would, however, be reasonable that at thevery least  188 million should be found from the DefenceBudget in line with the general 2 per cent cut on other cashlimited programmes.    Going above this, a cut of  400 milliowould still allow for a 0. 3 per cent increase in real spendingin 1981-82.    In deciding on the cut to be made it would beimportant to have regard to the effects on industry.b.      The Government was committed by the Manifesto topay comparability for the armed forces.    It would .neverthe-less be a mistake to allow for the cash limit to be adjustedon account of this or of the cost of defence equipment. Thedefence cash limit had been seriously overrun in 1980-8}and to provide for exceptions would be to invite a repetitionof this situation.    As it was, the Defence Budget aloneamong major programmes was allowed to take credit forstaff savings.THE FK.IME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet accepted that the cuts on the Defence Budgetwould have to be less than the  500 million which the Chancellorhad sought but more than the  152 million offered by the Secretaryof State for Defence, which did not even meet the requirement of 188 million representing the general 2 per cent cut in cash limitedexpenditure.    While the commitment to pay comparability for thearmed forces would stand, it remained for further considerationwhether exceptions should be made on this, or any other, account indetermining the cash limits for the Defence Budget.    The Secretaryof State for Defence should now consider urgently, with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,what further cuts he could offer, and report the outcome to theCabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet -8. Invited the Secretary of State for Defence toconsider further with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the scope forfurther cuts in the Defence Budget and report the outcometo the Cabinet as soon as possible.9. Agreed to resume their discussion on publicexpenditure and related issues at their next meeting.Cabinet Office5 November 19809SECRET
