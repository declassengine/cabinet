CONFIDENTIALNTARY    1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERinformed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons in the week beginning 27 October.The Chancellor of the Duchy said that a short Bill would be neededto amend the Tenants&apos; Rights (Scotland) Bill to reflect theamendments which the Government had now agreed to accept to theHousing Bill.    This Bill would probably be introduced in the Houseof Lords and, since it met the wishes of the Opposition, couldsubsequently be taken through all its stages in the House of Commonsin a single day in the week beginning 27 October.   It was only inthe following week that the House would be able to consider theLords&apos; amendments to the Civil Aviation Bill, the Broadcasting Billand the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill. Thelatter Bill in particular would be vulnerable to a concertedOpposition attack on the lines of that mounted against the HousingBill.   The number of Government amendments made to the HousingBill in the House of Lords and the limited time available for theirconsideration in the Commons had helped to make that attackpossible.   It was of the utmost importance that the number ofGovernment amendments tabled in the Lords to the LocalGovernment, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill should be kept to theabsolute minimum, and the need for the fifty Government amendmentsalready proposed should be re-examined with this in mind. Onpresent plans, Parliament would probably be prorogued towards theend of the week of 3 November: the State Opening of the nextSession would now be on 13 November.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe Minister for Local Government had discussed the handling ofthe Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill in the Lordswith the Lord President of the Council and had agreed not to tablesome of the proposed amendments and to table others only if therewere adequate time available.    His main concern was thatGovernment supporters in the House of Lords who expressed theviews of the local authority associations would combine with cross-bench and Opposition peers to defeat the Government on theprovisions of the Bill dealing with the simplification of planningprocedures and the proposed block grant.    It might be possible,though undesirable, to accept some amendments on the planningprovisions but preparations for the Rate Support Grant (RSG)settlement for the next financial year were already going aheadon the basis of the block grant system.    If these provisions of theBill were not to become law in October it would by then be impossibleto revert to the existing system for calculation of the RSG for1981-82.    There was likely to be a need for a guillotine motion whenthe Bill returned to the House of Commons.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the discussion on the BroadcastingBUI could well take place in a difficult and emotionally-heightenedatmosphere if Mr Gwynfor Evans, the leader of Plaid Cymru, diedor became seriously ill as a result of his proposed hunger strikein protest against the decision not to allocate a television channelexclusively to Welsh language broadcasting.    Everything possiblewas being done by Mr Gwynfor Evans&apos;s friends and by influentialpublic figures in Wales to dissuade him from this course, but allthe indications seemed to be that he would persist in his protest.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that1 it had been suggested that National Health Service (NHS) employeescation       were civil servants.   If this view gained ground, one effect wouldbe that Members of Parliament, such as the Minister for Health,who held NHS appointments would be disqualified for the purpose ofthe House of Commons&apos; Disqualification Act.    The Law Officerswere considering the question; if they came to the conclusion thatthe Act applied to NHS employees there would need to belegislation to give indemnity to the Members concerned, and perhapsalso separate legislation to make it clear mat NHS employees werenot civil servants or holders of offices of profit under the Crown.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the House of Lords would face a heavyburden of legislative work when they returned from the SummerRecess on 6 October.   They had identified a number of problemsthat were likely to face the Government in both Houses in securingthe enactment of the remaining four Bills in their programme and,in particular, the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill.Fifty-five Government Bills had, however, already received RoyalAssent this Session and, despite the last-minute problems with theHousing Bill, another five would do so before the Recess. Thisrepresented a considerable achievement, the credit for which waslargely due to the efforts of the business managers in both Houses.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that when thet Defence Cash Limit for 1980-61 was set there was agreement i. thatit should be raised as necessary to cover the cost of pay increasesfor the Armed Forces and ii. that it should be reviewed in the lightof developments in the international situation and the response tothem of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), and ofs Britain&apos;s commitment to her NATO allies for a 3 per cent growthin defence expenditure in real terms.   It had now been agreed thatthe Cash Limit should be raised by  54 million to take account of i.,but difficulty had arisen over ii.    Spending in the first quarter ofthe financial year indicated that the Cash Limit would be overspentby  650 million over the whole year unless cuts were made. TheSecretary of State for Defence had agreed that steps should be takento eliminate  250 million of this, which represented volume inexcess of the accepted programme; and also that the Cash Limitfor 1980-81 should be reduced by  50 million to compensate foroverspending in 1979-80.    The remaining  400 million of theprojected 1980-81 overspend was caused by costs increasing fasterthan had been foreseen when the Cash Limit was fixed.   He himselfwould have preferred to see no increase in the Defence Cash Limit onthis account, given the overriding importance of maintaining cashlimits discipline and thus the basis for the Government&apos;s economicstrategy;  but, in the light of the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;sstrong representations about the consequences of such a courseboth for the defence programme and for Britain&apos;s relations withNATO, it had been agreed that the Defence Cash Limit should beraised by  200 million (which would be  150 million net afterdeduction of the  50 million in respect of overspending in 1979-80),in addition to the extra  54 million for Armed Forces pay. Thiswould represent a total increase of 21.8 per cent over the DefenceCash Limit for 1979-80.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, while heand the Chiefs of Staff accepted this decision, given the very specialsituation created by current economic circumstances, it representeda heavy blow to the Government&apos;s agreed defence policy, which wasbased on aiming for annual increases of defence spending in realterms in the region of 3 per cent in line with the agreed NATO target.The increase in 1979-80 had been only 2. 5 per cent up on 1978-79;and the increase in 1980-81 would now be only about 1. 5 per cent.He would do his best to keep to a minimum the damage which thiswould cause.    But it would be essential to ensure that increases inline with the 3 per cent aim were resumed in 1981-82 and subsequentyear s.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government1 s inability to meet the 3 per cent target in thecurrent year was a matter which all members of the Cabinet wouldregret.   It nevertheless had to be accepted in the interests of thecontrol of public expenditure, which was vital if the underlying baseof the national economy was to be got right.    The co-operationwhich had been shown by the Secretary of State for Defence and theChiefs of Staff was greatly appreciated.    Decisions about the levelof defence expenditure in 1981-82 would be taken when cash limitsfor 1981-82 were set in the autumn of 1980.The Cabinet -2.        Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the difficulties facing thePrime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, would be increasedfollowing the arrest by the police on a murder charge of theMinister of Manpower Planning, Mr Tekere, who was the leaderof the extremist wing of Mr Mugabe&apos;s party.    The leader of theother coalition party, Mr Nkomo, was the Minister to whom thepolice were responsible.    Mr Mugabe was maintaining the positionthat the law should take its course.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the situation in the secessionistisland of Santo was tense but quiet, although one bridge had beendestroyed.   It had been agreed that British and French troopsshould remain there for two weeks longer.    It might be possiblefor a force from Papua New Guinea to take over thereafter. Thesituation had been complicated by the unhelpful attitude taken bythe Australian Government at the United Nations.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that there might be a debate at theUnited Nations on the Israeli Government&apos;s new law on the statusof Jerusalem, which had now passed the Knesset.    It wasunderstood that the Prime Minister would shortly be receiving apersonal message on the subject from President Sadat of Egypt.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, following the incidents involvingIranian &quot;students&quot; in the United States, there seemed little prospectof progress towards the release of the American hostages.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the unruly conduct of Iranianresidents in Britain had provoked demands from the British publicthat they should be expelled.   If one of the magistrates before whomthey appeared were to order their deportation, it would be relativelyeasy for him to take action.   Although he had a power on his owninitiative to order the deportation of individuals whose presence wasin his judgment not conducive to the public interest, the internationalconsequences of his exercising that power in this instance might beserious.    There was also a technical difficulty over signingdeportation orders in the case of persons who refused to give their nameThe Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.        The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Industry (C(80) 51) and by the Lord Chancellor (C(80) 52) onTION     compensation for the nationalised shipbuilding and aircraftILDING  companies and the introduction of private sector capital into theshipbuilding and shiprepair industries.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he hadconsidered further, in consultation with the Secretary of State fors the Environment, the suggestion that the former owners of thewarship building yards might be invited to choose betweencompensation on existing terms, under the Aircraft and ShipbuildingIndustries Act 1977, and the return of their yards.    He had alsoconsidered the possibility of keeping the present compensation termsbut introducing legislation for privatisation and then offering theyards back at market value.    He had reluctantly concluded thatneither of these courses was practicable.    From discussions withformer owners it was clear that they would be interested only ifthey were given assurances over a range of issues: there was noquestion of simply handing the yards back to them.   It would benecessary, for example, to take account of the substantial capitalinvestment by British Shipbuilders (BS) in the yards and to clarifythe treatment of tax allowances, the implications for pension fundsand the recovery of progress payments.    Long and complexlegislation would be necessary to deal with these questions and,unless the Bill were to apply to all the shipbuilding and shiprepaircompanies of BS, there was a risk that it would be declared hybrid.The Opposition would seize the opportunity to threaten renationalisationif they were to come back into power.    There would be an immediatecost to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, because of therepayment of progress payments, and the probability of widespreadand costly industrial unrest within the industry.    He reluctantlyconcluded therefore that privatisation should be deferred and thatthere should be no change in the present compensation provisions.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he agreed with the Secretary ofState for Industry&apos;s conclusion.   In his view the question ofprivatisation should be considered separately from that of the allegedinequity of the compensation terms.    Retrospective legislation wasobjectionable in principle; and in this case retrospective legislationto change the compensation terms would benefit those shareholderswho had held on to their shares in the hope of such legislation butnot those who had sold to cut their losses.   It would compound theinjustice to the latter group, while rewarding the former whosemoral claim was no greater.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was agreed that, while the compensation termsof the 1977 Act were deplorable and in effect confiscatory, theycould not be changed now.    While it might be possible to negotiatesolutions to some of the difficulties identified by the Secretary ofState for Industry, there could be no avoiding complex andcontroversial legislation and the likelihood of creating furtherinjustices.   It was moreover important that the Chairman of BSshould be given the opportunity to tackle the problems of the industryfree from the difficulties which a move to privatisation at this stagewould bring.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet reluctantly accepted that the compensation terms under the1977 Act could not now be amended.    They also agreed that theprivatisation of British Shipbuilders should be deferred, although itremained the Government&apos;s intention to privatise the yards in wholeor in part as soon as it was practicable to do so.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that there should be no changein the terms of compensation under the Aircraftand Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 and that theprivatisation of British Shipbuilders, in wholeor in part, should be deferred.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Industryto announce their decision in a Written Answerbefore the Recess and to agree the terms of hisannouncement with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Trade.CONFIDENTIAL4.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Lord President of theCouncil had reported to her that 32 new non-departmental bodiesi) (Quangos) had been set up since the Government began its campaignto reduce their number.   While numerically many more quangoshad been abolished than created, the aggregate cost of the new oneswas higher than the aggregate cost of all those that had beenabolished.    The pressure to reduce the number of quangos shouldbe maintained, and each Minister should satisfy himself that adequateprogress was being made in the areas for which he was responsible.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office7 August 1980
