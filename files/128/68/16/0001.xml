CONFIDENTIAL1         THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERinformed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week.    He expected Parliament to beprorogued at the end of business on Thursday, 13 November. TheState Opening of the new Session would be on Thursday, 20 November.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat there was likely to be increasing Parliamentary interest overthe coming weeks in developments in the hunger strike in theMaze Prison and in the consequences of the strike for the politicaland security situation in Northern Ireland.   He would keep theCabinet informed on these matters.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the fighting between Iraq and Iran was continuing.    The Iraqiswere still trying to capture Abadan and there was little immediateprospect of peace.    The International Red Cross were now tryingto help to get the ships caught in the Khorramshahr area of theShatt-al-Arab freed.    In regard to the United States hostages in Iran,the Iranians seemed to have missed the most opportune time forstriking an advantageous bargain.    There might now be some delaybefore any further developments occurred.    More attention was nowbeing focussed on the four British subjects under arrest in Iran.It might be possible to do something to help them, using the Algeriansas intermediaries*   The release of Mr Sparkes in Iraq was largelydue to the intervention of King Hussein.    It was likely to prove moredifficult to obtain the release of the other British subject imprisonedin Iraq, Mr Smith, because of the strong probability of his guilt ofthe charge of which he was accused.In a brief discussion it was noted that oil prices were rising on thespot market as a result of the Iraq/Iran conflict.   Although theposition was confused, it seemed possible that the FrenchGovernment were encouraging their suppliers to hold higher stocksand to buy on the spot market.    It was improbable that France hadsucceeded in replacing more than half of the oil supplies which shehad previously received from Iraq.    The International Energy Agencyhad so far been successful in persuading its members te hold eff thespot market; but, if those countries which had been heavilydependent on Iraqi and Iranian oil supplies lost their nerve, there wasa possibility of spot market prices rising very sharply with aconsequential effect on term prices.   Such a development couldhave unwelcome consequences for the sterling exchange rate.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that duringhis recent visit to Hungary he had met Mr Kadar, First Secretary ofthe Communist Party Central Committee and a figure of greatauthority in the country.    He was clearly very anxious about thepresent situation in Poland and worried in case the West should givethe Russians some reason for invading that country.    He had alsostated that the longer Mr Brezhnev remained in office in the SovietUnion the better this would be for the West.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that duringhis recent visit to Poland he had been struck by the realistic approachof the Polish leadership to their social and economic problems.These were very real and were likely to grow acute over the nextsix months.    There was a major shortage of potatoes.    There werealready long food queues.    Nevertheless the Polish leadershipseemed confident that they would be able to achieve some kind of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpolitical solution to their difficulties, if only in the short term.Contrary to the general belief he had gained the impression thatMr Kania, the Polish Communist Party leader and Mr Pinkowski,the Prime Minister, had gone to Moscow at their own suggestionto explain and obtain clearance for their intentions, rather than inresponse to a Soviet summons.   From Poland&apos;s point of view it wasimportant that the countries of the West should avoid open speculationabout the likelihood of a Russian invasion.    Such speculation couldmake the event more probable.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesize of the landslide in Mr Reagan&apos;s support had been a surprise toeverybody*    So had the Republican capture of the Senate. Britishinterests now depended heavily on the calibre and experience of thepeople whom Mr Reagan would choose to form his Administration.It was likely that over the next few months relations between theUnited States and the countries of Western Europe would go througha difficult period, as the Americans felt that recently WesternEurope had been taking advantage of them in a number ef respects.It was also possible that Mr Reagan&apos;s relative inexperience wouldlead to considerable difficulties in regard to the Arab/Israel dispute.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIA3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on the pay and price factors to be included in the1981-82 cash limits and votes (C(80) 60); a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on certain ancillary questions on payrelated to the 1981-82 cash limits and votes (C(80) 65); and a letterfrom the Lord President of the Council to the Chancellor of theExchequer dated 31 October 1980.The Cabinet&apos;s discussions and conclusions are recorded separately.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (C(80) 61) on the Rate Support Grant(RSG) settlement for 1981-82.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT saidthat, under his chairmanship, a Group (MISC 21) of the Ministersdirectly concerned with local authority expenditure had consideredthe RSG settlement for 1981-82.    In England and Wales this wouldbe the first year of the new system of Block Grant, and of separategrant settlements for the two countries.    The Group had agreed onthe option for the method of grant distribution, described in detailin his memorandum, which was the preferred choice of theAssociation of County Councils.    They had looked at the optionsagainst the background that, under the last Administration, therehad been a major and deliberate shift of grant from shire countiesto London, and to outer London in particular.    The option nowrecommended would start to reverse this trend and would lead to anet average gain of 1. 5p, in terms of the rates, to non-metropolitanratepayers and an average net loss of 1. 2p for outer Londonratepayers.    The possibilities for further improvements in thesystem would be considered during the next year. Thearrangements in Wales would be different in detail, though similarin their broad effect, to those in England.    The division of overallgrant between England and Wales would remain in 1981-82 on thesame percentage basis as in previous years, but a study would bemade before next year in the hope that the 1982-83 grant could bedivided more satisfactorily.    The Cabinet had now agreed that thecash limit should be based on a pay factor of 6 per cent and a pricesfactor of 11 per cent, and on the procedure for dealing with the&apos;overhang&apos; effect of staged settlements.    The pay of the police andof firemen would depend on the level of earnings through the year,and decisions on them could be taken later.    If the Cabinet acceptedthe Group&apos;s recommendations on the method of grant distribution,the remaining issue for decision was whether the overall grantpercentage for England and Wales should be 61 or 60 per cent.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thathe recommended a grant percentage of 60 per cent.    This would behighly unpopular, but it was essential to continue to exert thestrongest pressure on the local authorities to cut their currentexpenditure.    This applied both to those authorities which hadoverspent this year and also to those which had kept to target butwhich might otherwise be tempted to relax in 1981-82.    There wasa risk that this decision would lead to higher rates than otherwise;His officials judged that a 60 per cent grant, taken with the otherchanges decided for local authority expenditure, might lead to rateincreases averaging 22 per cent, with much higher increases insome individual authorities.    This was on the assumption thatlocal authority treasurers would assume 13-f per cent for inflationand would budget for 3 per cent more in volume terms than theGovernment were assuming.    He intended, however, to challengethose assumptions vigorously while they were still under discussion,and in this way to influence the local authorities to make lower rateincreases.In discussion it was argued, in support of maintaining the grantpercentage at 61 per cent, that the local authorities were alreadyfaced with the pressures of a fundamental change in thedistribution system, of tight cash limits, and of a further 1 per centvolume cut on current expenditure on top of the 2 per cent announcedin August.   A 1 per cent cut in the grant percentage would add afurther 2.8p on average to the rates in England and 5p to 6p onaverage in Wales.    Faced with this overall package treasurerswere likely to rate high and borrow more, so adding to the burdenson ratepayers and to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement.This would be yet another burden on industry, since 60 per cent ofthe rates fell on them.    High rates, together with the prospect ofsharp increases in the water rate, increases in council house rentsand increases in gas and electricity prices would coincide inApril 1981 to create a climate in which it would become verydifficult to contain the pressure for higher wage increases.    So farthe Government&apos;s tough stance in demanding savings and greaterefficiency by local authorities had been generally supported. Adecision to reduce the overall grant would, however, be seen bythe public as direct action by the Government to put up the rates,and criticised as such.On the other hand it was argued, in support of a grant percentage of60 per cent, that it could well make little or no significant differenceto the level at which rate demands were set, if the grant percentagewas fixed at 60 rather than 61 per cent; and it was important to keepup the greatest possible pressure for savings in local authoritycurrent expenditure, for which there was certainly scope and whichwould be less damaging to industry than cuts in capital spending.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussiont said that theCabinet agreed to endorse the method of grant distribution inEngland and Wales recommended by the MISC 21 Group. Theyhad already agreed in earlier discussion on the allowances to be madein the cash limit for pay and price increases.    They further agreedon balance that the overall grant percentage should be 60 per cent.The Secretary of State for Scotland and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should now reach agreement on the appropriate figures for Scotlandin the light of the decisions for England and Wales.The Cabinet -1.        Approved the method of distribution ofthe Rate Support Grant in England and Wales,and the share of grant between the two countries,summarised in paragraphs 3-8 of C(80) 61.2. Agreed that the overall grant percentagefor England and Wales should be 60 per cent.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to agreeappropriate figures for Scotland in line with thoseselected for England and Welles.5.        The Cabinet briefly resumed their discussion of publicexpenditure and the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement in1981-82.    The discussion is recorded separately.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of publicexpenditure on Thursday 13 November.Cabinet Office6 November 19806CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 39th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 6 November 1980 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer on the pay and price factors to be included in the 1981-82cash limits and votes (C(80) 60), and a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer on certain ancillary questions on payrelated to the 1981-82 cash limits and votes (C(80) 65); they alsohad before them a letter from the Lord President of the Council tothe Chancellor of the Exchequer dated 31 October 1980.Ictor THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet  limits        needed to set cash limits for pay covering numerous public service1-82 groups including the Armed Forces, doctors, nurses, NationalHealth Service staff, teachers, local authority staff and civilservants.    In his view a single pay cash limit of 6 per cent shouldapply to all these groups.    He would like to announce this pay cashlimit later in the day, so that the Government&apos;s view could beavailable to influence expectations in current wage negotiations andas a reassurance to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)whose annual conference was about to begin.    The private sectorwas bearing the brunt of the present recession and attached a gooddeal of importance to the Government holding down the increase inpublic service pay.   An announcement of a 6 per cent cash limitwould give a clear indication of the Government&apos;s intention of doingso.   Apart from the main decision on the figure, there were a numberof technical points, relating in particular to the treatment of stagedincreases, to be decided.    His impression from preliminarydiscussions was that his proposals on these points would beacceptable to the Cabinet*CONFIDENTIAL
In discussion, the following main points were made -a. It was essential that the Government&apos;s pay assumptionfor cash limit purposes should be realistic.   A cash limitset too low which encouraged confrontation could be moreexpensive than one set a little higher which had a chance ofacceptance.    These were matters of fine judgment, but itwas relevant that by next April when the bulk of the publicservice pay settlement dates would have been reached, theretail price index (RPI) might still be about 13 per cent upon the year before, and private sector pay settlementsmight well be averaging out at 10 per cent or more. Itshould be possible to achieve public service settlements insingle figures, but 6 per cent would be likely to be, at best,at the limits of acceptability and might well prove to be toosevere.   A figure in the range of 7 to 8 per cent would belikely to reduce considerably the risks of confrontation.Against this it was argued that expectations were fallingagainst a background of sharply rising unemployment andnumerous liquidations in the private sector. Moreover,there were conspicuous examples of low settlements beingsought in the trading public sector, eg. BL&apos;s &quot;final offer&quot;of 6.8 per cent and Rolls-Royce&apos;s decision to offer no payincrease other than on the grounds of improved productivity,which would increase the likely acceptability of 6 per centin the public services.    It was relevant also that publicservice employees enjoyed job security in a difficult period,and that higher settlements would involve yet furtherincreases in taxation and the further weakening of theprivate sector.b. Even if the Cabinet decided to accept 6 per centas its objective for the pay factor in cash limits for thepublic services, it would be prudent only to announce figuresfor particular limits as it was operationally necessary to doso, and not to make an announcement now that would committhe Government to 6 per cent as of universal application inthe public services.    There were many uncertainties aboutparticular settlements, and many links between settlementswhich could put a single universal objective at risk. Forexample, one of the earliest settlements due in the presentpay round was that for local authority manual employees,whose employers had recourse to their own sources offinance through the rating system, were able to borrow,and had significant possibilities for cutting staff. A6 per cent cash limit applied to them might well be tenableso far as their wage bill was concerned, whilst still allowinghigher settlements for the individual employee. The2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnegotiations for the National Health Service (NHS) manualswhich would follow closely on those for local authoritymanual workers would, however, be wholly constrained bythe cash limits set, because there was no alternative sourceof finance and only limited opportunities to reduce staff orsave money in other ways.    Moreover in the case of theCivil Service the existence of a separate cash limit for pay,the decisions already taken and announced on staff cuts andthe Cabinet&apos;s decision against staging gave virtually noflexibility at all.    The water workers) too, represented adifficult case, lying as they did between the nationalisedindustries and the public services.   They had considerableindustrial power, but the industry was generally acknowledgedto be over-manned.    The actual outcome of negotiationsin terms of the pay increase gained could not therefore bupredicted with any confidence.    The water workers&apos;settlement would cast its own shadow over other public sectornegotiations.    Given these complexities it would be sensibleto limit announcements about the pay element in cash limitsto those which were operationally necessary, and thus topreserve a degree of flexibility to respond to changingcircumstances.c. It could be argued that there ought to be a single paycash limit figure for the whole of the public services and thenationalised industries.   Such a universal limit, by appearingfair, might lead some groups to settle within the limit whowould not otherwise do so.    On the other hand a single limitcovering so wide a field was not reconcilable with the factsof pay bargaining, particularly in the nationalised industries,would appear as a &quot;norm&quot; to be challenged, and would almostcertainly be broken by significant groups, thus discreditingthe policy as a whole.d. The Government&apos;s firm commitments on the pay ofthe Armed Forces and the police were complicating factors.In the case of the police, it would probably be enough to saythat the settlement due in September 1981 would depend onthe movement of earnings during the year and would fall fordecision at the time.    The pay settlement due for the ArmedForces next April would need to be considered by the Cabinetwhen the report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body(AFPRB) was to hand.    The Government&apos;s commitment tothe Armed Forces stood, but it might be possible to influencethe review body through the evidence to be given to them bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Defence.    The more immediate problem here was the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALextent to which and the way in which any excess in theArmed Forces pay bill over that provided by the standardpay cash limit factor should be accommodated. TheCabinet would need to return to this point at a later stagein its discussion of public expenditure.e. It was for consideration whether the local authorityemployers should be given a single cash limit coveringpay and prices or a separate cash limit for pay.    The secondcourse was to be preferred for its demonstration effect;the combined figure, being higher, might be misunderstood.f. Another complicating factor could arise from theexistence of arbitration arrangements in various parts ofthe public services.   This question was already underconsideration in the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy.g. In fixing cash limits for 1981-82 it would be necessaryto make some assumption about the figure to apply in respectof settlements in the pay round starting in August 1981. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had proposed a figuretwo percentage points below the figure decided upon for thecurrent pay round, in order to emphasise the need for thelevel of settlements in the next round to be below the levelin this; but it was generally felt that this would unduly tiethe Government&apos;s hands too far in advance of events, andthat it would be preferable simply to carry forward thefigure agreed for 1981-82, adjusting later on (for instance,by means of clawback on the Rate Support Grant) if eventsjustified or required doing so.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that for planning purposes the pay cashlimit for the public services in 1981-82 should at this stage be setat 6 per cent.    In order to retain as much freedom as possible torespond to changes of circumstances, actual figures should beannounced only as and when it was operatively necessary to do so.The figure of 6 per cent should be given to the local authorityemployers forthwith as a firm decision, so far as they wereconcerned, for the purposes of the current negotiations about ratesupport grant.    The Cabinet would need to consider further thetiming of announcements about the pay cash limits applying to otherparts of the public services, and the Chancellor of the Exchequershould provide an early paper on the implications of the Cabinet&apos;sdecision.    If the local authority employers asked whether theGovernment would apply the 6 per cent factor more widely than to them,4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthey should be told that the Government intended to deal withsettlements in the remainder of the public services broadly withinthe same financial disciplines as were being applied to the localauthorities.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environmentto inform the local authority employers at the appropriatemoment that the pay cash limit applicable to the RateSupport Grant settlement for 1981-82 would be 6 per cent.2. Agreed that announcements of cash limits forother parts Of the public services should not be madebefore they were operationally necessary.3. Agreed that for planning purposes the objectiveshould be to achieve a 6 per cent pay cash limit forthe financial year 1981-82 throughout the whole of thepublic services, the limit to apply provisionally inrespect of settlements in the 1981-82 pay round aswell as of settlements in the 1980-81 round.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tocirculate a memorandum for discussion at theirnext meeting on the implications of these decisions.5. Agreed to consider at a later meeting howto reconcile pay cash limits and the outcome of thenext report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Bodyon the pay of Servicemen and women.5CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hisrecommendation in C(80) 60 was that the cash limits and votesfor 1981-82 should be based on an increase in prices of 11 per centbetween 1980-81 and 1981-82, this figure being an average over theyear as a whole.    This number was within the range of realisticexpectations, but achievement of an 11 per cent increase over theperiod would require the recent good performance on prices to becontinued, and might therefore imply a small degree of cash limitsqueeze on volume.   Any such squeeze would be distinct from thegeneral 2 per cent cut in the volume of expenditure which the Cabinetwas considering separately.
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that, even if11 per cent was realistic as a general factor for price increases,it was not likely to be realistic for expenditure on defenceequipment, the level of inflation on which had consistently exceededthe general level of price increases.    The question of the cash limitfor defence spending should be considered alongside the proposalsfor the defence programme as a whole which the Cabinet had stillto resolve.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet accepted the Chancellor&apos;s proposal for a general factorof 11 per cent for prices in cash limits for the public services for1981-82.    The allowance for price increases in the defenceprogramme would need to be considered further in the context of thediscussion of that programme which was due to take place at theirmeeting in the following week.The Cabinet -6. Agreed that a factor of 11 per centshould apply to the prices element in cashlimits in 1981-82 throughout the public servicesother than to the defence programme.7. Agreed to resume discussion of theprices cash limit to be applied to the defenceprogramme in the context of the generalconsideration of defence expenditure at theirnext meeting.iCabinet Office7 November 19806CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO C25CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 6 November 1980 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet had before them a table circulated at the meeting,summarising the present position on prospects for the publicexpenditure targets and for the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) in 1981-82.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, in the lightof the discussion on 5 November by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy, a further  157 million would be required forthe nationalised industries.   If this could not be found within thenationalised industries, and if in addition to the changes alreadyagreed full credit were taken for the reductions proposed but notyet agreed on Defence, Scotland, social security, and highereducation (on which a reduction of 2 per cent in the cash-controlledprogramme, totalling  30 million, over and above the lj per centagreed in July, was agreed among the Ministers concerned directlyafter the meeting of the Cabinet), the total of public expenditurewould be  77 , 592 mL&apos;lion by comparison with the target of 76, 200 million.    Together with the effect of holding all newpublic service pay increases to 6 per cent, this implied a PublicSector Borrowing Requirement of  12 billion in 1981-82 by comparisonwith the  7j billion implied by the medium term financial strategy.It was not possible both to finance a PSBR of this level and to reduceinterest rates.    It followed that substantial tax increases would beneeded.    The position would be worse to the extent that thosereductions still under discussion were not approved.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sstatement.2. Agreed to resume their discussion of publicexpenditure on Thursday 13 November.Cabinet Office7 November 1980SECRET
