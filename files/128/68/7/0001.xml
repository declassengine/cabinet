CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat five amendments had been carried against the Governmentduring the Report Stage of the Housing Bill in the House ef Lords.Four reduced the scope of the provisions in the Bill givingtenants of council houses the right to buy them.    The grant ofsuch a right was a fundamental part of Government policy, andthe amendments would have to be reversed  when the Commonsconsidered the Lords&apos; amendments to the Bill.     The fifthamendment was in a different category.    It provided for theextension of the option mortgage scheme so as to give theequivalent of tax relief on interest payments on mortgagesraised by elderly people to purchase annuities.    This proposalhad attracted considerable public and political support.    He iconsidered, after consultation with the Lord President of theCouncil, that it would be right to accept the Lords&apos; amendment,even though the annual cost would be about  10 million, sincethis would increase the chances of persuading the House of Lordsto accept the proposed reversal of the other four amendments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the four amendments limiting the right tobuy should be reversed when the Housing Bill returned to theHouse wf Commons.   The Lord President and the Lord Chancellorwould seek to ensure that Government backbenchers in the Houseof Lords did not support any attempt in the Lords to reinstate theamendments.    The Cabinet also agreed that the amendment ontax relief cn interest payments should be allowed to stand,provided that the additional cost was met within existing publicexpenditure allocations.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environmentto table appropriate amendments in the House of Commonsto reverse the effect of the Government defeats in theHouse of Lords on the provisions of the Housing Billdealing with the right of council tenants to buy their houses.2. Agreed to accept the amendment passed in theHouse of Lords making option mortgages available toelderly people wishing to mortgage their existing housesto purchase an annuity.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.      Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for theEnvironment and the Secretary of State for SocialServices, to consider how the relevant cost couldbe met within existing public expenditure allocations.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat the House of Lords had passed, against Government advice,an amendment to the Health Services Bill sponsored byLady Masham providing for doctors to be reimbursed for ,payments made to their wives for assistance given in runningtheir practices*   After discussion with Lady Masham heproposed when.the Bill returned to the Commons to substitutefor this amendment one which would enable him to make regula-tions providing for reimbursement in appropriate circumstances.The Cabinet -4.      Took note.THE HOME SECRETARY said that Mr Norman Hogg had putdown a motion under the Ten-Minute Rule procedure fordiscussion on 29 July in which he sought leave to bring in a Billrepealing those provisions of the Act of Settlement which dis-qualified the heir apparent from succession to the throne if hemarried a Roman Catholic.    Since this Bill affected The Queen&apos;sexercise of the prerogative, the Speaker had told Mr Hogg that hewould not be allowed to move the motion unless her consent wasfirst signified,    Mr Hogg had approached him with a request toobtain The Queen&apos;s consent.    For the Government to recemmendThe Queen to refuse consent would involve Her Majesty (as wellas the Government) in political controversy.    In his view theGovernment should recommend The Queen to give consent.There could .be no doubt that a constitutional change of themagnitude proposed by Mr Hogg ought only to be considered onthe basis of Government proposals following the widest consulta-tion both within the United Kingdom and with other Commonwealthgovernments; it was a totally inappropriate subject for a PrivateMember&apos;s Bill.    The Government must ensure that the motion wassoundly defeated.    The argument should, so far as possible beconfined to the procedural issue and not extended to the merits ofthe proposal, but there could be serious political repercussions,particularly in Northern Ireland, if the Government were not seento oppose the motion.    In his view all Ministers should voteagainst it*2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that hefully agreed that a Ten-Minute Rule Bill was an unsuitable vehiclefor a constitutional change of this magnitude and that Mr Hogg&apos;smotion should be defeated.    The language of the relevant provisionof the Act of Settlement was, however, deeply offensive to RomanCatholics.   He would not vote for the motion, but would find itdifficult in conscience to vote against it.   He was therefore minded,after full consideration, to abstain in any division.In discussion, it was argued that Mr Hogg was primarily concernedto obtain publicity.    There was general agreement that his motioncould and should be opposed because it was inappropriate to seek toraise a major constitutional issue in this way.    If that were thefocus of the argument, there was no reason why Roman Catholicmembers should not be able to vote against the motion with a clearconscience.    If any member of the Cabinet were to abstain ongrounds of conscience it would inevitably focus attention on themerits of Mr Hogg&apos;s proposal, and would embarrass other Ministerswho shared the views of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster onthe relevant provisions of the Act of Settlement but who were willingto vote against the motion.   A complete and united vote by themembers of the Cabinet would be important, not just as a manifesta-tion of collective responsibility but also because the mere fact ofsignifying The Queen&apos;s consent would be bound to have an adversereception among some sections of Northern Ireland opinion, and itwas essential that no impression should be given in the Province ofan equivocal position on the part of the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home&apos;Secretary should recommendThe Queen that her consent should be signified.    In the unusualcircumstances of the case it would be appropriate for the announce-ment of this to be expressed in terms to the effect that, if the Houseof Commons were to give leave for the introduction of the Bill, shewould not withhold consent to its introduction.    It was essential thatMr Hogg&apos;s motion should in fact be defeated by a substantial majority.The motion raised major issues about the way in which constitutionalchanges should be considered and since, in her view, its defeat wasa matter of policy which engaged the collective responsibility of theCabinet, all members of the Cabinet ami indeed of the Governmentwould be expected to vote against it.    She would be placed in anintolerable position in relation t  the advice given to The Queen ifany members of the Cabinet were to abstain.    The Cabinet trustedthat the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would reconsider hisposition in the light of the discussion.    The Chief Whip should ensurethat the motion was opposed, that all members of the Governmentand their Parliamentary Private Secretaries voted against it, andthat all the Government supporters in the House of Commons weremade fully aware of the reasons for the Government decision.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -5* Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said lhat heand the Lord President of the Council proposed that both Houses ofParliament should rise for the summer Recess on 8 August. TheHouse of Lords would reassemble on 6 October, immediately afterthe Labour Party Conference.    Its main business would men beconsideration of the Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2)Bill, which should complete all stages in that House during October.The House of Commons would not reassemble until 27 October.Because of the time needed to consider Lords&apos; amendments to theLocal Government, Planning and Land (No 2) and other Bills, the  State Opening of the next Session could not be until 11 November,with 13 November being held in reserve against any unforeseendelays in completing the Government&apos;s legislative programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed to the timetable outlined by the Chancellor ef theDuchy of Lancaster.    They noted mat it could be adhered to only ifGovernment amendments to the Local Government, Planning and L&gt;Land (No 2) Bill were kept to a minimum.    The Secretary of Statefor the Environment should not table such amendments withoutprior consultation with the Lord President of the Council and theLord Chancellor.The Cabinet -6. Noted that both Houses would rise on 8 August,that the House of Lords would reassemble on 6 October,and the House of Commons on 27 October, and that theState Opening of the next Session was likely to be on11 November,7. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto announce the dates of the summer Recess of the Houseof Commons in his business statement that afternoon.8. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environmentto consult the Lord President of the Council and theLord Chancellor before tabling further amendments tothe Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill.4CONFIDENTIAL
cCONFIDENTIAL2.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 47) about the pay, pensions andallowances of Members of Parliament.The Cabinets discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.3.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 46) proposing a debate before thesummer Recess on the outstanding recommendations of the firstreport from the Select Committee on Procedure (the ProcedureCommittee) Session 1977-78.    They also resumed considerationof his memorandum (C(80) 41) proposing how the Governmentshould respond to these recommendations*THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Cabinet had decided at their last meeting that a debate on theoutstanding recommendations of the Procedure Committee&apos;sreport should not be held before the summer Recess.   He had comeunder heavy pressure at business questions on 17 July to reconsiderthat decision*    The Opposition, who earlier seemed to be againsthaving a debate before the Recess, had now asked for one beforeit, with votes on particular resolutions during the Parliamentaryspill-over in October*    The Government were committed by theirmanifesto to giving the House of Commons an early opportunity todecide on the recommendations of the report.    Some decisions hadalready been made.   He had given undertakings that the remainingrecommendations would be debated before the Recess. Heconsidered that such a debate was now unavoidable, and that theHouse should be given an opportunity to decide on the outstandingrecommendations.    In considering them he had sought in all casesto protect the ability of the Government to handle their businessefficiently and expeditiously.   At the same time his extensivediscussions had made it clear that there was a strong body ofopinion on all sides of the House in support of implementing atleast the majority of the Procedure Committee&apos;s recommendations.His detailed proposals were set out in his memorandum (C(80) 41)and its annexes.    These covered the recommendations onEuropean Community legislation, financial control, public BillCommittees and subordinate legislation.    On European Communitylegislation, he proposed a declaratory resolution on the holding ofdebates on European documents.    This would preserve the presentand essential negotiating flexibility of Ministers to approveCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlegislation without prior debate in exceptional circumstances.He proposed also to accept with modifications the recommendationthat Standing Committees on European Community legislationshould be able to consider substantive motions.    This wouldreactivate the Standing Committees which had become moribundbecause of the unsatisfactory nature of their debates.    It mightlead to the Scrutiny Committee recommending a few moreEuropean documents for debate than at present, but this would beoutweighed by the advantage of not having to take all suchdocuments on the floor of the House.    The Government wouldretain the power to decide which motions should go upstairs andwhich should be taken on the floor of the House.    In order tominimise the risks of the Government being defeated in theStanding Committees, only relatively non-controversial motionswould be sent upstairs; and the Government would be able toreintroduce on the floor of the House motions lost in StandingCommittee, and thus to reverse a Standing Committee decisionwhich went against the Government. He had secured incorrespondence the agreement of colleagues to these recommenda-tions, subject to them being confirmed in Cabinet.    On financialmatters, he proposed with the agreement of the Chancellor of theExchequer, the establishment next Session of a new ProcedureCommittee limited to examining the present procedures forconsidering and voting on supply.    This major step would subsumethe Frocedure Committee&apos;s more limited recommendations onfinancial control.    The present control of supply was unsatisfactoryand there was a good deal of justifiable pressure for betterprocedures.    On public Bills, the Procedure Committee hadrecommended that when Bills were referred to a Standing ,Committee there should first be three Select Committee typeSessions during which the Committee would take evidence fromMinisters, Government officials and outside interests on thebackground to and the effects of the Bill.    This proposal hadwidespread all-Party support in the House of Commons; over140 members had signed an early day motion in its favour. hiresponse he proposed no more than a limited experiment with upto three Bills next Session selected by the Government for the newprocedure, with a time limit within which the Select Committeetype Sessions would have to be concluded.    It might be appropriatefor these Sessions to be chaired by the Chairman of the SelectCommittee for the Department sponsoring the Bill.    His proposalwould allow the Government to retain control of the experimentand would provide another way of dealing with relativelyuncontroversial Bills.   He believed that such a procedure couldbe limited to a small number of Bills in later Sessions.    On theother hand, if the Government was not prepared to go this far, itwas unlikely that it could secure a majority to prevent the intro-duction of procedures which would seriously affect the Government&apos;shandling of its programme, including perhaps the institution ofpre-legislation committees for the examination of all Bills. Onsubordinate legislation, he proposed accepting with modifications6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Procedure Committee&apos;s recommendations that the StandingCommittees on Statutory Instruments should be able to considersubstantive motions.    Taken together his proposals representedthe minimum that he judged would persuade the House ofCommons not to introduce more far reaching amendments to theirprocedures.In discussion, it was argued that taken together the proposalswould unreasonably increase the burdens bom on Ministers andtheir officials and on backbench supporters.    The implementationof the Procedure Committee&apos;s recommendations on SelectCommittees had already created serious difficulties in maintainingmembership and attendance of Government backbenchers on someCommittees.    On some Wednesday mornings as many as 12Select Committees were now in session.   The additional proposalswould make matters worse, especially since the Governmentwould need to command a majority in Standing Committees. Onthe other hand, it was argued that the main burden arose not withSelect Committees but with Standing Committees on Bills. Theonly effective way to reduce this load was to introduce lesslegislation.    The Chancellor of the Duchy&apos;s proposals would.notadd significantly to the burden, and would certainly be lessonerous than if, as seemed the most likely, alternative moreextensive changes were made against the Government&apos;s wishes.In detailed discussion of the proposals for public Bills, it wasargued that the Procedure Committee&apos;s recommendationsrepresented an unsatisfactory and impractical compromise.Pre-legis lation Committees which would at least be able to give aproper and full examination to the Bills had something to commendthem, particularly if their introduction could be linked with anacceptance that timetable motions could generally be applied tothe later stages of Bills.    Three sessions would be too short forthe adequate examination of most Bills.    Moreover, a limitedSelect Committee type stage such as had been proposed confusedthe distinct roles of an investigative Select Committee and theclause by clause examination of a Standing Committee. Thisconfusion would create considerable practical difficulties. Itwould either require a different Chairman for each stage (and theChairman of the relevant Select Committee might not always beacceptable for this task) or it would put the Chairman in a verydifficult position in maintaining his traditional impartiality inchairing a Standing Committee.    It would also mean that a Ministerresponsible for the Bill was likely to be both a member of theStanding Committee and summoned to it to give evidence during theSelect Committee stage.    While the procedure would start as anexperiment, it would soon become established and there would beconsiderable pressure and expectation that it would be extended tomany other Government BUls:  some Opposition supporters of theproposal were already talking in these terms.    There would beserious problems in applying the procedure to Bills which had7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDE8CONFIDENTIALalready been approved by the House of Lords*    The newprocedure would delay those Bills to which it applied by as muchas three weeks, and would tend to increase rather than reduce thelength of a Standing Committee&apos;s consideration of a Bill: ratherthan avoiding probing amendments in Committee it would providea rich source of material for opponents of the Bill*On the other&apos;hand, it was argued that the consultations undertakenby the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster had shown that theGovernment was likely to be defeated if a limited experiment onpublic Bills were not proposed.    It was in the nature of theexperiment that some of its procedures were uncertain and itssuccess could not be assured*    It was possible however that itwould assist the later stages of a Bill, and it would improve theHouse&apos;s scrutiny of it.    If the experiment were to be introduced,the Government would need to make clear the dangers to the futureof the present Parliamentary system if members continued to seekto impose a congressional system of Select Committees on theessentially cameral system of Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were reluctant to accept proposals which were likelyto impose extra burdens on members and to reduce theGovernment&apos;s ability to secure its business.    Nevertheless, theyaccepted that it would be necessary for the Government to takesome limited initiative on procedural matters in order toprevent more extensive changes being carried by the House*The Cabinet agreed to accept the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster&apos;s proposals for a declaratory resolution on debateson European Community documents, for enabling substantivemotions on European documents to be debated in StandingCommittees, and for a new Procedure Committee to be \established next Session to examine supply.    They also agreed,though with considerable misgivings, to an experiment nextSession which would allow up to three Government Bills to beconsidered by a Standing Committee in three Select Committee-type sessions within a limited period*     The Cabinet agreed notto support the Procedure Committee&apos;s proposals for substantive/ debates on subordinate legislation in,testsst Committees onStatutory Instruments.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should accordingly announce mat a debate would beheld before the summer Recess and that the House would begiven the opportunity to reach decisions in the light ofGovernment proposals*The Cabinet -1.      Agreed that there should be a further debateon procedural matters in the House of Commonsbefore the summer Recess.
CONFIDENTIAL2. Agreed to the proposals in the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s memorandum (C(80) 41)Wat there should be a declaratory resolution ondebates on European Community documents; thatappropriate resolutions should be tabled to allowsubstantive debate on European Community documentsin Standing Committees; that there should be a limitedexperiment next Session for a Select Committee-typestage before Committee Stage proper for up to threeGovernment Bills; and that the Government shouldwelcome the establishment next Session of aProcedure Committee to consider procedures forsupply,3. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Chief Whip, to makeappropriate arrangements for the debate and the tablingof the necessary motions, and to take account of thepoints made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion in speakingduring the debate*9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat British and French troops had earlier that morning mounted asuccessful operation to restore legal rule in the island of Santo.There had been no resistance and no casualties.    The New Hebridescould now be brought to independence on 30 July as planned, and theIndependence Ceremony would be attended by a representative ofThe Queen.    The detachment of the Royal Marines would be broughthome as soon as possible.    If the New Hebrides Government requiredfurther military support, this might perhaps be provided by PapuaNew Guinea.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePrime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, appeared to haveconcluded that it would not be possible to find a suitable successorto General Walls from inside the country.   He was at presentthinking in terms of appointing a General from another Commonwealthcountry.    In the end he might well ask for a British General.    If hedid, it would not be in Britain&apos;s overall interest to refuse to help him.There were suitable British Generals on the retired list and itshould be possible to persuade one of them to accept the appointment.The Cabinet -Took note.5.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) meeting on 22 July hadreached agreement upon a satisfactory formula for the automaticextension of the amended Financial Mechanism to 1982 if stillrequired.    There had been no substantive discussion of theArticle 235 Regulation governing supplementary Community expendi-ture in the United Kingdom, but the Council had accepted that workshould proceed with a view to a decision in principle in September.The Council had agreed on the principle of pre-accession aid toPortugal, and the Portuguese were subsequently informed of theCommunity&apos;s willingness to grant them aid.    The amount of aid wasto be settled after the summer break; there would be pressure for adecision at the 15 September Foreign Affairs Council, which wouldfall only a week before the Portuguese Parliamentary election, butthere was no commitment.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatdiscussion at the 21 July Fisheries Council of Commission proposalson 1980 quotas, conservation measures and access had beeninconclusive, though the atmosphere was good and there had beenconsiderable support for British views on a 12 mile exclusive zone.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALA more substantive discussion on conservation would take place atthe 29 September Council*   On quotas, the British fishing industrywere pressing for a 45 per cent share of the Community catch,although over the last 10 years they had never caught more man28 per cent of the total.    It should none the less be possible to getsatisfactory quota shares for the key species eg cod, herring andmackerel.At the 22 July Agriculture Council, all but two member states hadbeen prepared to accept that the negotiations with New Zealand for avoluntary restraint agreement on sheepmeat should be concluded onthe basis of a reduction in the Community&apos;s tariff from 20 per centto 10 per cent; the United Kingdom had argued for 8 per cent andFrance for 15 per cent.     Through this and other reservations theFrench were clearly aiming to delay the introduction of the newsheepmeat regime until after their Presidential elections, relyingmeanwhile on their illegal controls on imports.    The Councilnevertheless agree that the negotiations with New Zealand and othersuppliers should be concluded in September, so that both theinternal and external regimes might come into force on 1 October.This delay was damaging to our sheep farmers, but it would nqt bepossible to introduce deficiency payments unilaterally in advance ofthe Community funded regime without additional public expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note.- SERVICECIENCYMANPOWERious&apos;ence:3) 18thfusions,te 46. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(80) 43) on reductions in Civil Service manpower.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recordedseparately.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C(80) 44) on local authority expenditure in 1981-82, and amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and Science(C(80) 45) on expenditure on education in 1961-82.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he recommendedthat the Government should announce before the summer Recess thatthe provision for the total of local authority current expenditure inEngland and Wales and in Scotland in 1981-82 should be 2 per centbelow the corresponding planned totals for 1980-81.    This reductionwas in line with the assumption in the last Public Expenditure WhitePaper (Cmnd 7841).    It was necessary to announce the total now inorder to influence the local authorities in the planning of their budgetsfor the year.   The Government also had to agree on its proposalsfor the allocation of the planned total among the various localauthority services, in preparation for more detailed work on the RateSupport Grant.   He had listed in the Annexes to his memorandum hisproposals for local authority current and capital expenditure for eachof the services in England and Wales.   He had also proposed areduction of  65 million in the provision for housing in England nextyear.   His discussions had identified two problems.    First, it lookedas though current expenditure on local environmental services inEngland could be about  80 million too high in 1981-82.    It would bevery difficult to find acceptable offsetting savings to this from otherservices, but it might well be that the excess would be cut backfollowing the review of overspending in the present year. Theposition could be reviewed in September.    Secondly, he had proposedsavings of  87 mil lien on education,  equivalent to net savings of afurther  50 million after offsetting the loss of savings of  37 millionon school transport.   The Secretary of State for Education andScience was willing to find savings of  20- 25 million, leaving a gapof about  60 million.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, recommendedthat this should be found from the schools programme by concentratingresources on the &apos;basic skills&apos; to which the Manifesto had referred.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT confirmedthat he would find savings of  65 million from his programmes in1981-82.    Insofar as the savings were made on the housing programmehe would prefer the weight to fall on current rather than capitalexpenditure.   This could mean that the Government&apos;s guidelines wouldhave to provide for increases in rents some 20 to 25 per cent higherthan those previously agreed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat if there were further cuts of  87 million in the schoolsprogramme it would be impossible for the Government to honour thecommitment made in The Queen&apos;s Speech, and repeated subsequently,to maintain and improve the quality of education.   The educationprogramme had already been cut substantially in real terms, and hewas willing to find savings ef  20- 25 million, mainly from higher12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALeducation programmes and from local authority capital expenditure.Any further reductions on the schools programme would leadinescapably to the conclusion that the Government was deliberatelyplanning to lower standards of education*    It would be particularlyunfair to these local authorities which had already made painfulsavings in order to keep within their budgets*   He did not acceptthat a distinction could be drawn between &quot;basic skills&quot; and otheraspects of the quality of education.In discussion it was argued that unless the proposed cuts on theeducation services were made it would be impossible to make therequired total savings on local authority current expenditure. Areduction of  60 million on total schools expenditure of about 3, 900 million was only 1* 6 per cent*   A significant part of thisexpenditure was not on teaching - nearly two-fifths of those employedin schools were non-teaching staff - and it should be possible to findsavings which did not reduce the quality of education*   It wasreasonable to look for savings at a time when pupil numbers werefalling*   It was a mistake to give too much weight to the views ofpressure groups which had an interest in arguing that standardswere falling*On the other hand the Government were deeply committed to thepledge to maintain and improve the quality of education. Substantialcuts had been made already*   At a time of high unemployment morechildren would be staying at school or going into further education*Further reductions would be defensible only if they could beconcentrated on those authorities which had been overspending. Thimight be possible under the new Block Grant system which would beintroduced in 1981-82*THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals made by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, other than those on the education programme in 1981-82in England where they had not yet reached agreement*    The ChiefSecretary, Treasury and the Secretary of State for Education andScience should discuss further, with the other Ministers directlyconcerned, the possibilities for finding substantial further savingson this programme*   They should look in particular at thepossibilities for savings on expenditure on polytechnics* Theyshould report on the outcome in time for an announcement on localauthority expenditure in 1981-82 to be made before the summerRecess.The Cabinet -1* Approved the recommendations in paragraph 13 i,ii, iv, and v of C(80) 44.13CONFIDENTIAL

They had also, however, passed29th four main amendments to the Motion against the Government&apos;sS1 ns, advice*   If implemented these would provide for the pensionsof MPs to be based on the  13, 750 annual salary recommendedby the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) as the appropriaterate from 13 June 1980; for MPs&apos; pay to be linked to &quot;aspecified grade in the public service&quot;; for the rate of accrualof pension entitlement of MPs to be increased from one-sixtieth to one-fortieth of pensionable salary for each year&apos;sservice; and for the Secretarial Allowance for MPs to beincreased to  8, 000 in a full year*    In his view the Governmenthad little choice but to accept the terms of the House ofCommons&apos; Motion either for immediate implementation or inprinciple where further details needed to be worked out*Although regrettable, the conditions forced on the Governmentby the House of Commons were the inevitable price to be paidfor success in reducing the immediate increase in MPs&apos; payfrom the 14. 6 per cent recommended by the TSRB to the9* 6 per cent now accepted by the House,In general discussion serious disquiet was expressed aboutthe action of those Members of the House of Commons,including members of the Executive of the 1922 Committee,who had voted against the Government&apos;s advice.    Although theChairman of the 1922 Committee had argued that the amend-ment relating MPs&apos; pensions to the rates of pay recommendedby the TSRB was a necessary price which had to be paid for1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe support of Members of the Opposition for the 9. 6 per cent payincrease, it was the case that the amendments carried raised thetotal remuneration of MPs well above the levels recommended bythe TSRB. The House of Commons had behaved irresponsibly inmis matter and was open to the charge of abusing its uniqueprivilege of being able to establish its own terms and conditionsof employment.In discussion of the particular proposals the following mainpoints were made:-a. If MPs&apos; pensions were to be based on the full TSRBrecommended rates rather than the lower figures theGovernment had recommended, the Government could notin equity treat mere harshly the senior public servantscovered or affected by the TSRB&apos;s 14th Report.    It wouldbe possible to justify not extending the same treatment tothem only if MPs were required to pay for the additionalpension entitlement resulting from calculation from&apos;notional&apos; salaries by means of higher pensioncontribution s.b. A change to a one-fortieth instead of a one-sixtiethbasis of accrual for MPs&apos; pension rights could have verywide, and expensive, repercussions on pensions arrange-ments throughout the public services.    If the concessionwere to be made steps would need to be taken to draw avery clear distinction between the Parliamentary schemeand other public service pension schemes.    The mostobvious way of doing this would be to require MPs tocontribute the whole cost of the improved pensions forwhich they had voted, even though this meant that therequired contribution from MPs would be likely to exceedthe 15 per cent limit on pension contributions eligible fortax relief under Inland Revenue rules.c. A simple move from a one-sixtieth to a one-fortiethaccrual rate would penalise those MPs who were buyingadditional years of pension entitlement under the existingscheme.d. The best course would be to refuse to implement theimproved accrual rate for which MPs had voted.    If thiswere judged to be impossible, the next best course mightbe to offer MPs a choice, on an individual basis, betweencontinuing with the present scheme and an improved scheme,based on fortieths, the whole of whose extra cost would bemet by the individual MPs&apos; own contributions.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALe&quot; e.      The vote in favour of linking MPs&apos; pay to that of a&quot;specified grade in the public service&quot; left a great manyquestions unanswered.    The Government would need a .clearer idea of the implications and of its own positionbefore it could enter into discussions with representativesof opinion in the House.    It would be for considerationlater whether such consultations should be confined to theGovernment&apos;8 own supporters or should extend to the otherParties in the House.rial Allowance f.      Although the Commons&apos; vote that secretarialallowances should be increased to the full levelrecommended by the TSRB was deplorable, the Governmenthad little choice but to accept it.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said matthe Cabinet deplored the action of Members of the House ofCommons in voting themselves substantial increases in pensionsand allowances which more than offset the savings made byacceptance of die Government&apos;s recommendations for a smallerpay increase.    It might well be that the Government would haveto expose publicly the full financial implications of MPs&apos; actions.Although such a step might exacerbate relationships in the House,it could well strike a responsive chord in the country. TheCabinet could not come to final decisions on these matters on thebasis of the information before them.    The Secretary of theCabinet should therefore arrange for officials urgently to preparea note setting out the financial implications of the Motion whichhad been carried in the House of Commons, both directly and byimplication for other public service employees.    This examina-tion should include assessments of the extra pension contributionswhich would be required from MPs if those who chose to takeadvantage of the improved arrangements were required to meetthe whole of the extra cost.    Officials should also explore thetechnical problems of linking MPs&apos; pay in any appropriate wayto that of public servants.   A report should be available in timefor Cabinet to resume its discussion of these matters at itsmeeting in the following week.   Meanwhile the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster could not, as he had proposed, make a state-ment to the House later in the day on the Government&apos;s reactionto the Motions which had been passed.    If pressed he should sayno more than that the Government needed time to consider whathad happened and promise an early statement without specifyingwhen it would be made.3CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 30th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 24 July11980-at 9. 30 amSERVICE       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PresidentIENCY of the Council (C(80) 43) on reductions in Civil Service manpower.NPOWERTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Cabinetus had agreed that Civil Service manpower should be reduced fromSnce: 705, 000 at April 1980 to 630, 000 by April 1984.    If the 630, 00018th were to include a contingency margin for 10, 000 posts, whichsions, might be necessary to meet future unavoidable claims, the gross4 reduction required was 85, 000.    Of this, savings of 60, 000 hadbeen identified so far.   He recommended that to achieve thesavings in full the general aim should be for all Departments tomake new savings by April 1984, in addition to the plans alreadyannounced, equal to not less man 10 per cent of their staff in oostat 1 April 1980.    Departures, from this should be strictly confined toprison staff and other very exceptional cases.    The proposals putforward so far suggested that numbers would not have fallen muchbelow 690, 000 by April 1982.    It would not be credible to assumethat all of the balance could be found in the following two years, andhe proposed that the aim should be to reduce numbers to 675, 000by April 1982.In discussion the following points were made:-a.      The choice of April 1980, rather than April 1979,as the baseline, penalised those Departments which hadmade substantial staff savings in 1979-80.    They werewilling to make the savings of 15. 3 per cent from April 1979which were necessary to reach the April 1984 target. Ifhowever they were now required to save 10 per cent fromApril 1980 their savings over the five years from 1979-84would be higher than 15. 3 per cent.    Staff in suchDepartments could reasonably complain that they were beingtreated unfairly by comparison with those in Departmentswhich had been slower to make savings.   On the other hand,staff savings in 1979-80 represented to some extent thecutting back of excessive numbers identified when theGovernment first took office, and it was therefore reason-able to take April 1980 as a baseline.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. Although Departments would make staff savings asquickly as possible, in some cases the timing would dependon new legislation.   This might make it difficult to meet theproposed intermediate target for April 1982. Departmentsshould be allowed flexibility in phasing their savings.c. The interaction between expenditure on staff andexpenditure on other resources should be kept in mind.It might make sense to add to staff numbers where (as inthe Department of Health and Social Security) mat wasrequired for the prevention of abuse and thus for theavoidance of unnecessary or unjustified expenditure.Equally there would be some cases in which staff savingscould be achieved only if there were additional capitalexpenditure on, for example, computers and mechanisation.Staff savings which led to the employment of more expensivecontract labour should be avoided.d. The scrutiniet undertaken under the aegis efSir Derek Rayner, and letters sent to Sir Derek in thelight of those scrutinies, suggested that the scope forimproved efficiency in the Civil Service was a long wayfrom being exhausted.    Ministers in charge of Departmentsneeded to keep up the drive for improved efficiency. Itwas desirable that the motivation and momentum for thisdrive should come from within the Civil Service, thoughMinisters need not exclude the possibility of calling uponthe assistance of external advisers, such as Mr LeslieChapman, if it seemed appropriate to do so.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment was firmly and publicly committed to reducing CivilService numbers to 630, 000 by April 1984.    The Cabinet agreedto plan within this total for a contingency margin of 10, 000 posts.The Government would be pressed to give firm indications of howmis target was to be achieved.    It was therefore essential mat allMinisters should give the Lord president of the Council their fullco-operation in finding their share of the savings.    The LordPresident of the Council should now discuss the plans for eachDepartment in bilateral meetings.    Departments should makeproposals for new savings to bring numbers down to 675, 000 by1 April 1982 and to 630, 000 (including a contingency reserve of10,000) by 1 April 1984.    In considering these proposals theLord President of the Council should take account so far as hecould of savings actually achieved in 1979-80.    It was importantto make as much progress as possible by April 1982, althoughthe Cabinet recognised that in some cases savings could not bemade in advance of new legislation.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -invited the Lord President of the Council to agreewith Departmental Ministers by 1 October plansfor staff savings in each Department, and toreport further to the Cabinet thereafter, makingdetailed proposals for reductions of Civil Servicemanpower to 675, 000 hy 1 April 1982 and to630, 000 (including a contingency margin of10, 000 posts) by 1 April 1984.Cabinet Office25 July 19803CONFIDENTIAL
