CONFIDENTIALtlAMENTARY  L The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theIS House of Commons during the following week.lousfence:27th|usions,4THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that thedraft Order under the Ministerial and Other Salaries Act 1975 givingeffect to the agreed increases in the salaries of Ministers in the Houseof Commons would be laid shortly, together with the resolutions neededto give effect to the increases in the pay of Members of Parliament(MPs),    The time taken in the preparation of the draft Order andresolutions, together with the need to allow time for amendments to betabled to the resolutions, meant that it would not be possible, as hadbeen hoped, for them to be debated on Monday 14 July.    The businessfor the remainder of that week was such that the debate would probablyhave to be held in the following week.    The terms of the Ministerial andOther Salaries Act 1975 did not allow an Order made under it to haveretrospective effect, so that the agreed increases in Ministerialsalaries could not come into operation until the draft Order had beenapproved by both Houses.    The resolutions on MPs&apos; pay coula, however,be given effect from 13 June.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a separateresolution would be introduced in the House of Lords to give effect to theproposed 9.6 per cent increase in the secretarial allowances paid toMinisters in the House of Lords.    It had not yet been possible to find asatisfactory way of meeting the Cabinet&apos;s wishes to make an additionalpayment to junior Ministers in the House of Lords who did not receive aParliamentary salary.    Legislation amending the 1975 Act would have tobe passed if their Ministerial salary was to be substantially higher thanthat of their colleagues in the Commons, while the proposal to makethem eligible for Peers&apos; expense allowances as well as secretarialallowances was contrary to the decision announced by the Government on6 March 1960 following earlier consideration of the 13th Report of theTop Salaries Review Body.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet were disturbed to learn of the delay in the date from which theagreed increases in the salaries of Ministers in the House of Commonswould take effect.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster shouldconsider urgently how the proposed timetable could be shortened. Ithad not been possible so far to find a satisfactory way of giving effect tothe Cabinet&apos;s wish to improve the remuneration of junior Ministers in theLords.    New proposals could not now be put forward in parallel with theincreases in secretarial allowances already agreed, but further effortsshould be made to find a satisfactory solution.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,in consultation with the Chief Whip, to consider how t Jensure that the Order increasing the salaries ofMinisters in the House of Commons was brought intooperation with the minimum of delay.2. Invited the Lord President of the Council toexamine further the possible ways of improving theremuneration of junior Ministers in the House ofLords and to report his conclusions to the Cabinet.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C(80) 40), on public expenditure from 1981-82 to 1983-84.They also had before them notes by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C(80) 38 and 39). covering the interdepartmental report by the officialPublic Expenditure Survey Committee, and a summary of the mainissues by Treasury officials.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as his memoran-dum on the economic prospect (C(80) 35) had explained, there would beconsiderable difficulties in containing the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) and monetary growth in 1981-82 within the rangesallowed for in the medium-term financial strategy.    In the later yearsthe prospects were closer to the projections presented at the time ofhis last Budget, and there should be some scope for tax reductionsconsistent with the overriding objective of bringing down the growth ofmoney supply and inflation.    To achieve those objectives, to retain theconfidence of the financial markets, and to make possible some reductionof interest rates, it was essential to keep a tight control on publicexpenditure and the PSBR.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, invited the Cabinet to confirmthat the objective should be to maintain the net-expenditure totals for1981-82 to 1983-84 published in the Public Expenditure White Paper,Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the reductions in our contribution to theEuropean Community (EC).    He had set out in Annex to his paper hisproposals for net changes in Departmental programmes. Theseallowed for some reordering, within the overall expenditure totals, todeal with the industrial and social problems created by the recessionand the increased provision which would be necessary for thenationalised industries.    He would discuss these proposals with theMinisters concerned, and would report back to Cabinet after the Recesswith definite proposals.    In the meantime it was necessary to decide inJuly on the total of local authorities&apos; current expenditure in 1981-82 witha view to a statement before the Recess; to settle before mid-September the totals for local authorities&apos; individual services in1981-82, so that the Rate Support Grant settlement could be madein November; and to take decisions by the end of September on localauthority capital expenditure for 1981-82.    Early decisions would alsohave to be made on the nationalised industries&apos; figures for 1981-82 as abasis for setting their External Financing Limits, and final decisionsfor 1981-82 on the other programmes would have to be reached inOctober.    It would be convenient to take decisions on the later years ofthe review at the same time.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe following points were made in discussion -a. The additional financing problems of the nationalisedindustries were largely the consequence of recession, and if theCabinet insisted upon reductions of other public expenditureprogrammes within the agreed overall totals to offset theadditional finance required by the nationalised industries, theeffect could be to intensify the depth of the recession.    In such,a situation there was a case for some flexibility in the PSBR andin public expenditure totals to allow for additional provision tocounter the problem of rising unemployment and failingindustrial investment during the recession.    At a time of lowdemand, an increase in the PSBR should not lead to higherinterest rates.    As a proportion of gross national product thePSBR was now lower than at the time of the last recession in1974-73.b. The Government was at risk of laying itself open to thecharge of not having a coherent strategy for dealing with theproblems now facing industry.    Painful savings were made byDepartments, which were then used to finance increased con-sumption rather than investment.    The Cabinet should bepresented with a paper setting out the options for a new packageof industrial support.    It could then decide whether somereordering of priorities was justified to finance this. Unlessaction were taken quickly, British industry could bepermanently damaged.c. In principle there would be a case for increasing thePSBR at a lime of recession, if the PSBR started at anacceptable level.    In fact the PSBR was already very high, andthat precluded the Government from adopting this course. Anyrelaxation on public spending would put at serious risk theobjective of bringing down interest rates which were themselvesvery damaging to industrial development.    The problem ofBritish industry at the present time was not shortage of funds tofinance new investment but lack of projects offering asufficiently attractive rate of return.d. The Government was already assisting industry through itspublic purchasing policy; the Chancellor of the Exchequer hadarranged for further work on possible fiscal measures toreinforce those introduced in his last Budget; and, in thepresent review, it might be possible to revise spendingpriorities in favour of support to industry.    But it wasunrealistic to suppose that very substantial increases onindustrial and employment measures could be financed byreductions in the social programmes.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that there could be no increase in the presentpublic expenditure totals, as reduced by the EC settlement. Withinthose totals there should be scope for giving greater priority toemployment and industrial support measures and that could beconsidered further.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should bringforward a paper to Cabinet at an appropriate time discussing the otpionsfor further measures of industrial support.The Cabinet -1. Confirmed the objective of keeping to the netpublic expenditure totals for 1981-82 to 1983-84published in Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the EuropeanCommunity settlement.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, tocirculate a paper in due course on the options forfurther measures of industrial support.In discussion of individual programmes the following points were made re. Local AuthoritiesIt was agreed that, following further discussions between theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Ministers dealing with localauthority expenditure, a statement should be made before theRecess on the Government&apos;s policy on local authorities&apos; currentexpenditure in 1981-82.    There were objections to the ChiefSecretary, Treasury&apos;s proposal that an increase in theprovision for local authority spending should be offset by savingsby the Minister responsible from his other programmes. Thelocal authorities, rather than Ministers, decided on the patternof spending between their services, and it might be fairer to basecontrol on the total of local authority expenditure across theboard rather than on the individual programmes attributed toparticular Departments.    This issue should be discussed by theTreasury and the Departments concerned.f. Civil DefenceThe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had agreed that thereshould be an increase in the provision for civil defence of atleast  13 million in 1981-82 and slightly more in each of the lateryears.    It was necessary to make an early statement in theHouse on civil defence policy in response to pressures fromParliament and elsewhere.    The Home Secretary was willing to5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfind his share of this additional expenditure from offsettingsavings from within his programmes - if necessary even bylimiting the growth of police establishments - ard it should bepossible to find the balance from relatively small contributionsfrom each of the other Departments concerned.    The Secretaryof State for the Environment and the Minister of Transport hadalready undertaken to make their contribution, and the otherMinisters involved should urgently consider following suit.g. IndustryThe Secretary of State for Industry would be discussing with theChief Secretary, Treasury, the possibility of some reductions inhis programme to enable him to give more support to researchand development by key Industrie s.h. EmploymentThe effect of the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals for theDepartment of Employment&apos;s programmes would be to reduce thenet provision, because some provision for employmentmeasures which had hitherto been met from the contingencyreserve had been transferred to the employment programme andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, was calling for offsetting cuts.The Secretary of State for Employment would discuss this furtherwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and would also makeproposals for new employment measures.i. EducationIt would be very difficult to cut expenditure on schools withoutputting at risk the Government&apos;s commitment to the maintenanceof educational standards, though some Ministers thought that therewas scope for reducing the provision for non-teaching supportwithout prejudicing educational standards.    The Department ofEducation and Science had put a ceiling on provision for highereducation, and was examining the possibilities for student loansand for the rationalisation of courses, but it would take time forany expenditure savings to emerge from such changes.    It wasquestionable whether it made sense to reduce the school-leavingage at a time of high unemployment.    Any legislation which mightbe necessary would be highly controversial and the savings wouldbe relatively small.6CONFIDENTIAL
j.      Health and Social SecurityIt would be important to reach agreement on the currentproposals to introduce charges for road traffic accidents and forforeign visitors, and perhaps to introduce charges for othercategories of accident care.    Otherwise there would have to bepainful, and politically unpopular, cuts eloewhere in the healthprogramme.    The Government was committed to the introductionof residential care orders for child offenders and, if localauthorities were to implement this policy, additional financialprovision would have to be made.    There was little prospect ofsecuring legislation to reduce social security benefits to theextent proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury. Provisionfor increases in child benefit had previously been made from thecontingency reserve, but it had now been transferred to the socialsecurity programme and, if the Chief Secretary, Treasury1 sproposals were accepted, would have to be financed from off-setting savings there.k. ScotlandThe Chief Secretary, Treasury, had proposed an extra reductionof  150 million a year in planned Scottish programmes on thegrounds that there was evidence that the share of expenditure perhead of population was higher in Scotland than in Wales andEngland.    This proposal was based on the Needs AssessmentStudy (NAS) which had been drawn up as part of the lastGovernment&apos;s devolution proposals.    The Secretary of State forScotland considered the methodology of this study to be unsound asa basis for Cabinet discussion on the distribution of publicexpenditure.    Even if he were to accept the NAS as a basis forcalculation, it would be highly damaging to announce additionalcuts in Scottish programmes on that basis.    He was prepared toconsider additional cuts in Scottish programmes, but it would beimportant that they should not be seen as being discriminatory.On the other hand, though the methodology of the NAS might bequestionable, there was little doubt that the share of expenditureper head was significantly higher in Scotland than in the North ofEngland.    The political arguments, and difficulties, were notconfined to Scotland.1. WalesThe Secretary of State for Wales was willing to accept the cutsproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, for his Department,but he would wish to discuss further the need for remedialmeasures in areas affected by steel closures.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the ChiefSecretary, Treasury* would discuss further with Departmental Ministersthe net reductions and additions which he had proposed, taking account Ofthe points made in discussion, and bring back his final proposals toCabinet in the autumn.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, would alsodiscuss urgently with the Ministers concerned the totals for currentlocal authority services in 1981-82 and put proposals to Cabinet in timefor a statement to be made before the Summer Recess.    The Cabinetagreed that there should be an early statement on civil defence policy;and the Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, together withthe other Ministers concerned, should reach early agreement on how thesavings were to be found to finance the additional expenditure.The Cabinet -3. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury:-a. To discuss with the Ministers concernedthe net reductions and additions shown inAnnex A of C(80) 40, taking account of thepoints made in the discussion.b. To discuss urgently with Ministersconcerned the totals for current expenditure onlocal authority services in 1981-82 and to putproposals to the Cabinet in time for discussionon 24 July.c. To report further to the Cabinet in theautumn with final proposals on the remainingprogramme s.4. Invited the Home Secretary to agree with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the other Ministersconcerned the savings necessary to offset theadditional expenditure which had been agreed on civildefence measures.Cabinet Office10 July 19808CONFIDENTIAL
