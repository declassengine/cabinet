CONFIDENTIALMENTARY   1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERs informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week.    The Secretary of State forSocial Services would make an oral statement on 23 July on thereorganisation of the National Health Service in England.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatbetween now and the Recess the attack of the Opposition would beconcentrated on the rise in unemployment.    The figures for July,which were to be announced on Tuesday 22 July, included those whohad just left school, and would therefore show a sizeable increase onthe previous month.    The Secretary of State for Energy should makehis announcement about oil depletion policy in his speech during aSupply Day debate on Government policy on the public sector onMonday 21 July rather than as a separate statement.   The Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster should discuss further with the Secretary ofState for Scotland the latter&apos;s wish to make an oral statement about thereorganisation of the Health Service in Scotland.     The Secretary ofState for Wales was content to answer a Written Question on thereorganisation in Wales.The Cabinet -1. Took note.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the Secretary of State for Wales,the Secretary of State for Social Services and theChief Whip, to consider whether an oral statementshould be made about the reorganisation of theNational Health Service in Scotland.Bill: THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatoidance        there was a serious danger that Labour-controlled local authoritieses would seek to frustrate Government policy by transferring leases ofcouncil-owned houses tc housing associations or other bodies, thusdepriving tenants of their right under the Housing Bill to buy the free-hold.    The Home and Social Affairs Committee had agreed theprevious day that an amendment should be tabled to the Bill at ReportStage in the House of Lords to make watertight the requirement inSection 128 of the Local Government Act 1972 for local authorities toobtain his approval to dispose of property.    Tabling the amendmentwould, however, alert local authorities to the possibility of arrangingleases for up to seven years, which did not at present require hisconsent.    The Bill would block this loophole when it became law, but1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlocal authorities could exploit it between the time the Bill left theHouse of Lords (and was therefore incapable of further amendment)and Royal Assent.    In theory the sales of up to half a million propertiescould be blocked in this way and, although avoidance would clearly notbe on this scale, he believed that once one authority had exploited theloophole others would follow suit.    He had therefore asked the Homeand Social Affairs Committee to agree to a second amendment providingthat, with effect from the date on which the amendment was put down,his consent would be required for leases of up to seven years. TheCommittee had rejected this solution because they felt that it involvedunacceptable retrospective legislation.    He doubted if such a provisionwas truly retrospective.    There were in any event precedents in taxlegislation and the nationalisation measures of Labour Administrationsfor anti-avoidance provisions taking effect from the date on which theproposed legislation was introduced.    No alternative way of effectivelyblocking the loophole had been found, and he sought the approval of theCabinet for tabling an amendment at Report Stage on the lines which hehad suggested.THE HOME SECRETARY confirmed that the Home and Social AffairsCommittee had accepted in principle the first of the two amendmentsproposed b&quot; the Secretary of State for the Environment, though withconsiderable reluctance on the part of some members of the Committee.The majority of the Committee had, however, opposed the furtheramendment for which the Secretary of State for the Environment nowsought Cabinet approval, believing that it was objectionable in principleand in law and would expose the Government to criticism dispropor-tionate, on the evidence available, to the risk involved.    Such acontroversial amendment would occupy considerable time in debate inboth Houses.    The Law Officers had been invited to consider with theSecretary of State for the Environment other solutions suggested duringthe Committee&apos;s discussion, but had not in the time available been ableto find a satisfactory answer.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he and his colleagues had beengiven wholly insufficient time for proper consideration of the problem.Even the first amendment, to which he had been reluctantly prepared toagree, had now been tabled in a defective form.    He could agree to itonly if it were corrected on Third Reading.    The second proposal was,in his view, open to severe constitutional legal and political objections.The analogy with tax provisions and nationalisation measures wasuntenable.    The Conservative Party when in Opposition had vigorouslyattacked the principle of retrospective legislation.    The problemoutlined by the Secretary of State for the Environment was short-termand hypothetical.    In the last resort, if the local authorities deliberatelydisposed of leases in the three weeks between Report Stage and RoyalAssent or acted in other ways to frustrate the provisions of a very2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcomplicated Bill the Government could introduce a further short Billnext Session giving the tenants concerned the right to buy.   Such freshlegislation, if it proved necessary, would not be retrospective.In discussion it was argued that the Housing Bill fulfilled a fundamentalManifesto commitment, and that the Government would be exposed tocriticism if it did not take all reasonable measures to see that itsintention was not circumvented.    Although the time available for localauthorities to dispose of property was short, there wag no doubt thatmany of them had already taken legal advice and would be ready to actquickly.    There was no evidence that any of them were about to exploitthe loophole, but they would obviously be very unlikely to advertisetheir intentions while the Bill was still before Parliament. Theconstitutional arguments against retrospective legislation were ofconsiderably less force when the intention was to confer additionalrights or benefits on individuals.    Although it might be possible tocorrect any avoidance which took place by means of a further Bill nextSession, there would still be a period of four or five months in whichlocal authorities hostile to the Government would be able to claim apolitical victory.    On the other hand, there was massive public supportfor allowing local authority tenants to buy their own homes, and anyauthority which tried to frustrate the Government&apos;s intention would beputting itself in a very weak political position.    There should be nodifficulty about making it clear in the debates on the remaining stagesof the Bill that any steps taken by local authorities to undermine theirtenants&apos; rights would be set aside by subsequent legislation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the first priority was to take every possible step tosecure that tenants could exercise the right to buy their own homeswhich would be conferred by the Housing Bill.    They agreed that oneloophole should be closed by amendment to Clause 128 of the LocalGovernment Act 1972, as proposed by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment and agreed by the Home and Social Affairs Committee,subject to correction of any drafting errors on Third Reading in theHouse of Lords.    They noted the advice of the Lord Chancellor andthe Solicitor General that the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;sproposal for dealing with the short-term risk of the grant of leasesbefore Royal Assent involved retrospective legislation open to legal andconstitutional objections.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould consider urgently with the Lord Chancellor and the LawOfficers whether an amendment which met those objections could beprepared.    If agreement was reached on such an amendment, it wouldbe preferable to proceed by those means.    If this proved not to bepossible, the Government spokesman on the Bill in the House of Lordsshould make abundantly clear in debate that any attempt by localauthorities to circumvent the provisions of the law would be counteredby further legislation at the beginning of next Session.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -3. Invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to consult the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers about the drafting of the amendmenttabled to amend Section 128 of the Local GovernmentAct 1972, and to make any necessary draftingalterations on Third Reading of the Bill.4. Invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Law Officers, to considerurgently whether an amendment to the Bill whichwould not be open to the objections he had identifiedin discussion could be tabled to prevent the disposalof dwellings by the grant of leases in the periodbefore Royal Assent, and to arrange for the tablingof such an amendment, if it proved possible to agree:t.5. Invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment, if it proved impossible to devise anacceptable amendment, to arrange for a statementas indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up oftheir discus sion to be made by the Governmentspokesman in the House of Lords.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that he hadtold the House of Commons on 4 March that the Top Salaries ReviewBody (TSRB) would continue to conduct annual reviews of Ministers&apos;and Members&apos; pay.    He was likely to be pressed for confirmation ofthis undertaking during the debate arranged for Monday 21 July.Although there was no formal commitment to review the secretarialallowance of Members annually, there had in practice been such reviewssince 1974, and it would be helpful in containing the likely pressure forlinkage between the pay of Members and the Civil Service if he wereable to announce that the TSRB would continue to conduct annual reviewsof both pay and allowances, and to confirm the undertaking that theirrecommendations would be implemented except in the most exceptionalcircumstance s.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that there would bemuch to be said for getting back to a system under which theremuneration of Ministers and Members of Parliament was reviewedCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALonly once in each Parliament, at the beginning of the Parliament, Itwas recognised, however, that this was unlikely to be acceptable untilthe rate of inflation had been brought down to a much lower level thanat present.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the future of the TSRB and other paycomparability arrangements had still to be decided.   It would beinappropriate to entef into any commitment now about the long-termfuture of the procedure for a particular group.    The Government hadhowever already agreed to a TSRB review of next year&apos;s third-stageincrease of Members&apos; pay to  13,150.    There was no reason why theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should not confirm during thedebate that that review would take place; but he should be careful toavoid any implication that its recommendations would necessarily beimplemented in full, or that annual reviews would be conducted there-after, &quot;Z,- The Cabinet -6.      Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster to confirm during the House of Commonsdebate on 21 July that the commitment to allow areview of the third-stage increase in Members&apos; paynext year would be honoured, while avoiding anylonger-term commitment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had been her intention to raise atthis meeting of the Cabinet the proposal to replace Polaris with theTrident I missile under arrangements which had been agreed with thePresident of the United States.   It had been essential to limit verystrictly, on both sides of the Atlantic, knowledge of the negotiationsinvolved.   Regrettably, however, there had been a leak in the UnitedStates which had made it necessary for a public announcement to bemade at very short notice on 15 July.    The Secretary of State for Defencewas to be congratulated on the skill with which he had handled thematter in Parliament.The Cabinet -7.      Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat Anglo-French attempts to reach a peaceful settlement of theNew Hebrides crisis had failed because of the obduracy of thesecessionist leader, Mr Jimmy Stevens.    It was still hopel to bringthe territory to independence on the agreed date of 30 July, but timewas now very short.   As he himself had made clear to the FrenchForeign Minister, Monsieur Francois-Poncet, the best coursewould now be for Britain and France to end the secession by taking,&apos;joint military action, which would almost certainly be unopposed. /It was not clear whether the French Government would agree to this,given the risk of a clash between French forces and French settlers.The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Blaker,hoped to discuss the matter in the near future with the French &gt;%&amp;&gt;Minister for Overseas Territories, Monsieur Dijoud, despite thelatter having regrettably postponed one recently agreed meeting atshort notice.    Unilateral military action by Britain was not anattractive alternative: it might be contrary to the CondominiumProtocol and was also more likely to involve bloodshed. Theattitude of the French Government was coloured by their sensitivityto the repercussions which events in the New Hebrides might have inNew Caledonia and their other Pacific territories, which were ofparticular importance to them in the context of nuclear weapon tests.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theBritish Press, which had earlier taken an over-optimistic line onZimbabwe, was now being over-pessimistic.    It was unlikely thatMr Nkomo would in fact break away from the Government, and thereseemed to be no sinister significance behind his recent private visitto London.    But it was most unfortunate that General Walls nowwished to retire and to begin his terminal leave as early as the endof July.    His health was not good, and he might not proveresponsive to the efforts which were being made to persuade himto stay on.    There was no black or white Zimbabwean who would bean acceptable successor at the present stage, and the idea of bringingin someone from elsewhere in Africa (eg Nigeria) was unattractive.It might be necessary to put forward a British candidate, perhapsfrom the retired list.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theprospects for stability in Botswana were uncertain following the deathof the President, Sir Seretse Khama.    His son, who was the obviouscandidate to succeed him, was only 27 and thus under the constitutionthree years too young to be eligible.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that he had been having a series of bilateral meetings with theFisheries Ministers of other Community countries.   There was nowwidespread understanding of the problems which would nee1 to beresolved in negotiating a Common Fisheries Policy.   It was howeverdisappointing that the Commission had just issued quota proposalswhich did not take sufficient account of our special requirements.At the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 21 July it should bepossible to agree on certain conservation measures which wouldform part of the eventual overall settlement and this would be helpfulto the Germans who were anxious to see some progress on fisheriesbefore their elections.    Negotiations on the other major issues wouldprobably not take place before the end of September.    The fishingindustry had put in a case which was now under examination foradditional assistance to meet their financial difficulties over thenext six months which arose from lower prices and higher costs.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that atthe Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) in the following week itseemed likely that the United Kingdom would be the only membercountry opposing a proposal to give financial help to Portugal in theperiod prior to her accession to the European Communities. Thiscould create political problems which he would discuss with thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FORIiGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it wasessential to have a Government conference centre in London.    It wasneeded not only for the meetings associated with the United KingdomPresidency of the European Community in 1987 but also for other majorinternational conferences.    Lancaster House was becomingincreasingly inadequate for these purposes and the temporary facilitieswhich had to be provided in the absence of a purpose-built centre werecostly and unsuitable. AgiIn discussion the following points were made -a. A decision to build a conference centre would be severelycriticised at a time when the Government was cutting back onother public expenditure programmes.    Although there wasprovision for the project within the PSA&apos;s programme, it wouldbe at the expense of other projects which many people would feelrated higher priority.b. Planning permission had been given for the building. Ithad not so far attracted adverse public comment, and there hadbeen some approving comment, though it was likely that manywould feel that Broad Sanctuary was not a suitable site for abuilding of that type and size.c. The Broad Sanctuary site had been empty and an eyesorefor 30 years. There could be no question of simply selling itfor commercial development.    Moreover the United Kingdom8CONFIDENTIAL4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (C(80) 34) on the case for building aninternational conference centre at Broad Sanctuary, ParliamentSquare.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, ifit were accepted that the Government should build an internationalconference centre, the Broad Sanctuary site offered the only practicablesolution.    The re were no other suitable sites within a three-mileradius of Whitehall and to adapt existing buildings, such as SomersetHouse and Richmond Terrace, would cost more and take longer. Thecost of the project, which totalled  29. 5 million at 1979 prices, couldbe accommodated within the Property Set vices Agency&apos;s (PSA&apos;s)programme; and he would also be willing to find the further  1 millionnecessary to cover the full cost of the Parliamentary TelephoneExchange from within this programme.    The design of the building hadbeen approved by the local planning authority and the Royal Fine ArtC ommi s sion.
CONFIDENTIALwas the only major Western country without a suitable centre,for international conferences.    Such conferences generatedconsiderable economic benefits, even though the gains weredifficult to quantify.d.      The local authorities and the police had advised thatsatisfactory arrangements could be made for dealing with trafficif the building were to be at Broad Sanctuary.    While this viewseemed implausible in view of the present heavy congestion oftraffic in Parliament Square and nearby, it was nevertheless theconsidered judgment of those responsible for these matters.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that while themajority of the Cabinet were in favour of building an internationalconference centre on the Broad Sanctuary site there were majorobjections to committing public expenditure for this purpose in presentcircumstances.    The Cabiner therefore agreed that the project could goahead only if it could be financed from the private sector.    The cost ofclearing the site and providing for the Parliamentary TelephoneExchange extension could however be borne on public funds.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to explore how the proposed inter-national conference centre on the Broad Sanctuarysite could be financed from the private sector.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL5.       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 41) proposing how the Government shouldrespond to the outstanding Recommendations of the First Report from theSelect Committee on Procedure (the Procedure Committee) for Session1977-78.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that theConservative Election Manifesto had supported the approach of theProcedure Committee for improving the procedures of the House ofCommons.    The House had already considered their recommendationsto set up departmental select committees and about sessions andsittings*    The Government were committed to giving the House anopportunity to reach decisions on the outstanding recommendations ofthe report*   He had promised the House that a debate would be heldbefore the summer recess.    There was considerable support forprocedural reform: over 130 Members had, for example, signed anEarly Day Motion supporting the Procedure Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion for changes in the way Bills were considered in StandingCommittee.   His consultations with influential Members on all sidesof the House suggested that the opportunity to reach further decisionson the Procedure Committee&apos;s report would be welcomed.   He had,however, just received a letter from the Opposition spokesman onprocedural matters (Mr Merlyn Rees MP) asking that the debate bedeferred until October so that the Opposition could have more time toconsider the recommendations.   He proposed mat he should discussthis approach with the Opposition to see whether it might still bepossible to arrange an acceptable time for a debate before the recessand thus implement the pledge he had given.    In the meantime, he inviteethe Cabinet to consider the proposals set out in his memorandum.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that in thelight of the official letter from the Opposition the Cabinet did notconsider it would now be opportune to hold a debate on procedural reforrrbefore the summer recess.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancastershould make clear that he was deferring the debate at the request of theOpposition and that the Government would look for an opportunity toallow the House to debate the outstanding recommendations in October.He should give no firm commitment, however, that the debate wouldtake place in the &quot;spill-over&quot; period before prorogation: circumstancesin October might make it necessary to defer the debate until next sessionThe Cabinet should consider the Government response to the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s outstanding recommendations nearer the time when thedebate would be held.The Cabinet -1.      Agreed to defer consideration of the outstandingrecommendations of the Procedure Committee&apos;s Report.10
CONFIDENTIAL2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto make clear in the House of Commons that a debatewould not now be held before the summer recess, butthat the Government would look for a suitableopportunity to provide the House with time for a debateafter the Summer Recess.6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster (C(80) 42) about the cost of Parliament.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that,following the last discussion by the Cabinet of the cost of Parliament,he had had a helpful private discussion with the Speaker, and hadsubsequently discussed with the House of Commons Commission thevarious measures outlined in his previous memorandum (C(80) 28).The Speaker was to seek the advice of his Counsel on measures togive the Commission more direct control over staff increases, andan Inspector of Staffing was to be appointed.    A number of Membersof Parliament were to be selected to supervise the administration ofall Departments of the House.   The Commission were jealous oftheir independence and were unwilling to consult the Governmentformally about proposals involving significant increases in expen-diture, but as Leader of the House, and a member of theCommission, he would be able to represent the Government&apos;s views.The Commission would not agree to the imposition of cash limits bythe Government, but had indicated that it would impose its own limitsin due course, when it had the necessary information as a basis fordoing so.   A further report was to be obtained on the proposal thatprinting costs should be met from the House of Parliament vote ona repayment basis.    He thought these measures representedreasonable progress towards better control of the expenditure of theHouse.In discussion it was acknowledged that the House authorities werejealous of the independence granted them by the House of Commons(Administration) Act 1978 and that it was difficult to imposesatisfactory measures of control on them.    Nevertheless, theprogress which had so far been made fell well short of the objectivesset out in the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s originalmemorandum, and it appeared that the House authorities regardedthemselves as exempt from the financial and manpower constraintswhich applied elsewhere in the public sector,    A review of possiblestaff economies had not yet been commissioned, and it was notobvious that the appointment of an Inspector of Staffing wouldnecessarily improve the situation.    The need to apply to the Housethe principles which governed complementing, pay and grading in theCivil Service should be urged on the Commission, and they should be11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALencouraged to seek the advice and guidance of the Civil ServiceDepartment.    The basis and timing of the Commission&apos;s proposedimposition of their own cash limits was unclear, and they should beinvited to seek help from the Treasury in working out their rroposalsiIt should be confirmed that the further report on the method of financingprinting would extend to stationery and computing.    There was somedanger that the supervisory bodies which it was proposed to set up tooversee the expenditure of individual departments would themselvesbecome pressure groups for increasing expenditure, while the SelectCommittees were making increasing demands on the resources both ofthe House and of Government Departments called to give evidence. Amajor weakness appeared to be the lack of any clear distinction in theCommission between those responsible for the formulation of policy andthose responsible for financial control.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that some progress had been made towards theobjectives set out in the earlier memorandum by the Chancellor of theDuchy nf Lancaster, but considered that further pressure must beexerted on the authorities of the House to subject their control ofstaffing and expenditure to the same disciplines as those now beingapplied elsewhere in the public sector.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should seek further consultations with the House ofCommons Commission to press them to adopt more positive andsatisfactory measures of control in the near future and should, ifappropriate, arrange for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to beinvolved in these discussions.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, tocontinue to press the authorities of the House ofCommons to adopt more vigorous methods offinancial and staffing control on the lines set out inC(80) 28, and to make a further report to the Cabinetin due course.Cabinet Office17 July 198012CONFIDENTIAL
