THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidvirs that a useful meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the member statesof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) had taken place ini Atlantic Ankara in the previous week; but there was still no sign of anyfcy agreement being reached between Greece and Turkey which wouldoisation lead to the Greeks coming back into the NATO military structure.iousrence:9)17thLusionste 2cellor THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the&apos;idt&apos;s visit of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany,to Herr Schmidt, to Moscow seemed to have followed the line which; w had been forecast.    Chancellor Schmidt had taken up a firm positionin regard to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan but had not made anyimpact.   Indications had emerged from his discussions that theSoviet Union might be willing to talk bilaterally to the United Statesabout the deployment of their SS-20 theatre nuclear weapons andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s modernisation plans forits theatre nuclear weapons, but the prospect of such talks stillseemed to be a long way off.The CabinetTook note.1CONFIDENTIAL

The meeting had been asatisfactory one and had not involved commitments to additionalexpenditure.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT reportedthat, following a British initiative, the Council of Ministers(Environment) had now agreed to a Community ban on the importof primary whale products.

SECRET!E ECONOMIC       5.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of.OSPECT the Exchequer (C(80) 35) on recent developments in the economy andthe outlook ahead.MR BURNS, the Chief Economic Adviser to the Treasury, presentedan analysis of the Government&apos;s economic strategy.    He concludedthat the growth of the money supply was now under control and thatther j were signs of a slow down in the rate of inflation as we movedthrough 1980 and into 1981.    To maintain progress it would be vitalfor the Government to keep control over the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR) and Government spending.    Unemployment wasrising rapidly because of excessive pay settlements.    Only whenthe increase in average earning? was brought within the range offigures for the growth of money supply would there be the basis fora sustained reduction in the rate of inflation, the resumption ofgrowth and a reduction in unemployment.    None of the alternatives,such as relaxing the monetary targets or reducing the exchangerate, was attractive or offered any hope for a sustained improvementin the outlook.MR IBBS, Head of the Central Policy Review Staff, said that therewas a bas7*c question why, compared with other industrialisedcountries, money supply and hence inflation had repeatedly risenmore strongly in the United Kingdom.    One reason was that a beliefin &quot;cost of living&quot; entitlements was deeply embedded, whilemanagement had failed to insist on improved productivity so thatunit labour costs could remain stable, or fall, even though wagesrose.   Within a tightly controlled money supply there would beconsiderable damage to the industrial structure if high wagesettlements and increased unit costs persisted.   It was essentialto back up the economic policy with explanation and education aimedat changing attitudes.    Companies had to be persuaded to stand outfor pay settlements at lower levels rather than to buy time and avertstrikes by the apparently easy route of higher settlements. Thusthe Government&apos;s aim in implementing the economic strategy shouldbe to do everything possible to modify the general attitude on payand productivity and to keep down the cash requirements of thepublic sector.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that currentdevelopments in the economy were not substantially different fromwhat had been expected at the time of the Budget.    But there weretwo important qualifications to this.    First, pay increases had beensignificantly bigger than had been hoped;  second, there weredifficulties in containing the PSBR in 1981-82.    The PSBR problemsarose not from the revenue side of the account but from theproblems of controlling expenditure and borrowing by centralGovernment, the local authorities and the nationalised industries.SECRET
SECRETIf the economic strategy were to succeed, it was crucial forGovernment Departments and local authorities to stay within theircash limits and the nationalised industries within their ExternalFinancing limits.    There were different views among forecastersabout the likely depth and duration cf the United Kingdom economicrecession; and a good deal would turn on our cost competitivenessat a time of world recession.    But the prospect was that thecompany sector might remain in substantial financial deficit throughthe period to 1983; that unemployment would rise steeply, andexceed the level of 1.8 million by autumn 1981 which had beenpreviously assumed; and that, while inflation would decelerate,this would not happen as quickly as had been hoped. Nevertheless,after a tight budgetary position in 1981-82, there should be somescope in the later years for tax reductions consistent with theoverriding objective of bringing down the growth of money supplyand inflation.    Fa .ed with the difficulties of containing the PSBRand reducing monetary growth in 1981-82, and in the presentdelicately poised situation, it was more than ever imperative tohold to the economic strategy.   It was only by bringing about theneeded adjustments in the economy in that period that the Governmentcould create the conditions for sound and sustainable growth in themedium term.In discussion it was argued that in looking at the economic strategyit was very important to take account of the political and socialconsequences of following it through.    The prospect was ofunemployment rising to over 2 million.   At the same time thesqueeze on company liquidity was much more severe than had beenexpected and this was affecting investment.    There was a dangerof widespread and lasting damage to the country&apos;s industrial base.It was not just a matter of individual firms going out of business;there was a risk that whole lines of production would disappear,and open the British market to foreign firms who wexe notnecessarily better or more efficient.   If the strategy were tosucceed, it was necessary to look for some palliatives.    There wasa case for more expenditure to keep people off the unemploymentregister.    Measures should be taken to encourage older workersto retire earlier and, in particular, it was necessary to tackle theproblem of growing unemployment among young people, by additionaltraining and youth employment schemes.    The Government shouldnot shrink from the additional public expenditure involved, whichwas preferable to the alternative of higher expenditure on unemploymentbenefits.    It was also necessary to look for measures to revive invest-ment; perhaps, for example, by adopting Mr Alan Lord&apos;s proposals forgiving relief to tax-exhausted companies.    To resolve the apparentinconsistency between simultaneously stimulating productivity andreducing unemployment, the Government should continue to give fiscalencouragement to the new and expanding industries which would beable to create jobs.4
SECRETOn the other hand, while there should be scope for some reorderingof priorities within public expenditure totals, it was essential thatthe Government should stick to the cash limits and to the overallpublic expenditure plans which had been agreed last year. Otherwise,public sector borrowing would increase, interest rates would stayhigh, and the present pressures on private sector industry wouldbe unnecessarily and damagingly protracted.   All the suggestedalternatives to the present economic strategy carried high risks ofgreater inflation and greater loss of output and employment in thelonger term.In further discussion the following points were made -a*        While unemployment would rise from its presentlevels, it should not be assumed that it would do so as muchas some commentators expected.    To some extent theoutcome would depend on the depth of the world recession,from which we could not be isolated.    More directly it wouldturn on how quickly increases in the levels of pay and pricescame down.b.        The squeeze on corporate liquidity might now be atits peak.    The position would ease as a result of the runningdown of stocks and reductions in spending on capitalinvestment, and as interest rates were reduced and companieswere able to borrow more easily.    For the momentcompanies were borrowing short term from the banks andwaiting for a fall in interest rates.   It was crucial that thecapital markets should be revived so that they could raisetheir money there.   Any increase in the PSBR now wouldpostpone that day.c.        There was no doubt that the industrial base wassuffering and that major companies were losing customers.This was inevitable in a period of transition.   It wasdesirable, however, that the transition should be as shortas possible.    Many firms who could survive a short periodof difficulty would go under if the period of adjustment wereprolonged.   In the meantime it was doubtful whether therewas much advantage in attempting to pick out particularcompanies for assistance.    Such assistance would be nomore than a drop in the bucket.    The aim should be topersevere with the present strategy and to correct thefundamental conditions which were causing the damage, inparticular the high level of pay settlements, so as to be ableto bring down the level of interest rates.SECRET
SECRETd.        It was generally agreed that it would be wrong toreduce the National Insurance Surcharge.    This would beindiscriminate in its effects: helping not just manufacturingindustry but the banks and oil companies too. Moreover,it would undermine the will of companies to stand up tounrealistic pay claims.THF PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should maintain its presenteconomic strategy.    For that strategy to succeed it was essentialfor the Government to keep tight control over those areas for whichit was directly responsible.   The level of public sector paysettlements had to be reduced, and this would give a lead to theprivate sector.    There could be no increase in the present overallpublic expenditure totals, and the trend to overspending in 1980-81which had been identified had to be corrected.   If this were not done,borrowing would increase and interest rates would stay high; theprivate sector would be penalised and the country&apos;s industrial basewould be damaged.   Within the overall public expenditure plansthere might well be scope for switching expenditure to enable higherpriority to be given to measures to alleviate the problems ofunemployment, particularly among young people.    The Cabinetwould consider this further in the course of their forthcomingdiscussions of the 1980 Public Expenditure Survey.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office4 July 19806SECRET
SECRET[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO    3 5CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 27th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 3 July 1980 at 9. 30 amThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of the 14th Report of the TopSalaries Review Body (TSRB) dealing with the pay of the higher CivilService, senior officers of the Armed Forces, the higher judiciary,and nationalised industry Chairmen and Board members, and the 15thReport of the TSRB dealing with the pay of Ministers and Members ofParliament (MPs), and considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C(80) 37) on the options open to them in respect of thesalaries of Ministers and of senior public servants.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a discussion of the pay of MPs andof Ministers, said that the Cabinet confirmed the agreement which theyhad provisionally reached in their earlier discussion that theGovernment should recommend that the increase for MPs should bereduced from 14. 6 per cent as recommended in TSRB 15 to 9. 6 per cent,to produce a salary of  11, 750 from 13 June 1980.    The Cabinet alsoconfirmed its agreement to bring into effect from 13 June 1980 thesecond stage salary levels for Ministers and other paid office holders.The Cabinet further agreed that the second stage salaries of CabinetMinisters should be increased by 5 per cent, and of all other Ministersand other paid office holders of the House of Lords and House ofCommons (including the third Opposition Whip for whom TSRB 15 hadinadvertently failed to make recommendations) by 9. 6 per cent. TheCabinet were not persuaded that any additional payment, beyond the9. 6 per cent, should be made to junior Ministers in the Lords by wayof increase in their salary.    They should, however, be made eligiblefor the normal expenses allowances for Peers.    Secretarial andresearch assistance allowances for MPs and the secretarial allowancefor Ministers and other paid office holders in the House of Lords wouldbe increased by 9. 6 per cent.    Pensions would be based on salariesactually paid except where, as in the case of MPs, the Government hadalready undertaken to base them on a higher notional salary. No1SECRET
SECRETfurther entitlement to a higher notional salary for pensions purposeswould arise from present decisions.    Following the proposed changesthe basis for the third stage increase in MPs&apos; pay due on 13 June 1981would be  13, 025 rather than  12, 000.    The Order necessary toimplement the staged salary increases in Ministers&apos; pay should coverboth the second and third stages.In discussion of the groups covered by TSRB 14 the following main pointswere made -a. Some Ministers argued that the average increase for thegroups as a whole should be 9. 6 per cent, as for MPs.Whichever of the alternatives suggested in C(80) 37 was adopted,it would arouse great resentment in the groups affected.    As faras the Civil Service was concerned, it would probably make itimpossible to agree with the Staff Side the proposedmodifications to pay research, and would put at risk thepossibility of agreeing new pay scales based on pay researchwithin cash limits next year.    These difficulties would not bemuch greater if the Government decided upon the more drasticox the two alternatives, and if the other alternative averaging12. 5 per cent, as set out in C(80) 37, was implemented, itwould be very difficult to persuade MPs to accept 9. 6 per cent.Moreover, while the average was 12.5 per cent, the UnderSecretaries and their equivalents in the Armed Forces would get13.9 per cent and similar increases were envisaged for people atlower levels in the other groups concerned.    These figureswould be picked on by the press, and the Government would failto convince public opinion that they were in earnest in seeking toinfluence public sector pay settlements.b. Other Ministers considered that there was a strong casefor approving the range of increases averaging 12. 5 per cent.This would represent a reduction in the general level ofincreases recommended by TSRB 14 (that is, excluding theadditional increases recommended to restore differentials) in thesame proportion as that proposed for MPs.    Anything lowerwould mean that senior public servants were being treated moreseverely than were MPs, and this would be inequitable. Itwould add to the problem of compressed differentials and wouldmean setting aside the results of pay research not only forAssistant Secretaries but for Senior Principals too. Moreover,it would suggest that the Government was trying to establish apay norm of 9. 6 per cent.    The emphasis should be on the rangeof increases involved; and in the case of the higher CivilService, and of the senior Armed Forces, it could be
SECRETemphasised that the range was from 8.1 per cent to 9. 6 percent with 13. 9 per cent as an exception necessary to deal withthe problem of differentials.    While the average for nationalisedindustry Board members should similarly be set at aLout12. 5 per cent, the increases for each of the Chairmen should beless than 10 per cent.c. Acceptance of the proposals in column C of Table 2annexed to C(80) 37 for senior military officers would result ina particular problem about the pay of medical Brigadiers andtheir equivalents and medical Major Generals and theirequivalents.    This could be overcome by giving a special salaryof  21, 500 to medical Major Generals and their equivalents.d. The suggested rates of pay for the senior judiciary incolumn C of Table 3 annexed to C(80) 37 were a little on the highside.    In particular the proposed increase of 15.9 per cent inthe pay of Masters and Registrars of the Supreme Court andequivalent judicial appointments should be shaded to around13 per cent and the increase in pay of the judicial group as awhole should be held to around 12f per cent.e. If the proposed rates of pay for Chairmen and Boardmembers of nationalised industries were to be based broadly onthe suggestion in column C of Table 4 annexed to C(80) 37 itwould be necessary to modify them so that no Chairmanreceived more than 10 per cent.    It would also be necessary toadjust downwards the increases proposed for members ofnationalised industry Boards where these showed increasessignificantly above 13 per cent as in the case of the BritishTransport Docks Board and the National Water Council.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed on balance that the pay of the higher CivilService and of the senior Armed Forces should be increases by about12. 5 per cent on average, as proposed in column C in Table 2 annexedto C(80) 37.    In taking this decision the Cabinet knew and accepted thatit meant refusing arbitration to the Senior Principal and AssistantSecretary grades whose Pay Research Unit (PRU) based settlement wasstill outstanding.    Pay rates below those suggested by the PRU evidencewould have to be imposed where necessary.    To avoid a problem ofdifferentials medical Major Generals and their equivalents in the ArmedForces should be paid  21, 500.    The Secretary of the Cabinet woulddiscuss further with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department the proposals forthe higher judiciary.    The aim should be to achieve an average increaseof about 12. 5 per cent for this group as a whole.    Within the group theaims should be to restrict the higher rates of increase to around 13 percent.    The Secretary of the Cabinet should also discuss the proposals3SECRET
SECRETfor the nationalised industries with representatives of the Departmentsconcerned.    The proposals in column C of Table 4 annexed to C(80) 37should be amended so that all Chairmen received less than 10 per cent.Any consequential changes to the increases for members should takeaccount of the need to pay them more than the executive staff immediatelybelow them; particular attention in this respect should be paid to theproblems of the National Freight Corporation in this respect, which shewould discuss separately with the Minister of Transport.    On the otherhand the rates of increase proposed for Board members of the BritishTransport Docks Board and the National Water Council wereunacceptably high and should be reduced to be in line with thoseproposed for members of the Boards of other nationalised industries.The rates of pay settled on this basis would apply through the comingyear to those Chairmen and Board members now in post.    In future theTSRB would not be asked to deal with the pay of nationalised industriesChairmen and Board members and the arrangements would be on thebasis agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy at theirmeeting on 20 May.    New appointments arising during the year would bedealt with on their merits.    As there were no longer any stagedincreases from past settlements due to any of the TSRB 14 groups therates of pay actually paid, rather than the TSRB recommendations,would be the basis for assessing pensions.    The increases now approvedby the Cabinet for the groups covered by the TSRB 14 Report assumedthat the House of Commons approved the Government&apos;s recommendationsfor the salaries of MPs.    If they did not do so, the Cabinet would needto reconsider the position.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of theirdiscussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a further discussion on the timing,handling and presentation of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions, said that shewould announce the Government&apos;s recommendations for MPs&apos; pay andtheir decisions on the other groups covered by TSRB 14 and 15, in astatement to the House of Commons on Monday 7 July.    She wouldexplain that in view of the economic situation the Government haddecided, contrary to their previous intention as announced by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, that the recommendations ofTSRB 15 could not be implemented in full.    She would write in confidenceto the Leader of the Opposition before the weekend to inform him of theGovernment&apos;s decisions.    On 7 July, and before her statement, shewould see representatives of the 1922 Committee; Lord Boyle, theChairman of the TSRB; and (if he so wished) the Leader of the4SECRET
SECRETOpposition.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should see theDeputy Leader of the Opposition at the same time.   Representatives ofthe four groups covered by the TSRB&apos;s 14th Report should also be givennotice, in confidence, of the contents of her statement as they affectedthem at noon on Monday 7 July.    The Lord Chancellor should makearrangements to inform representatives of the higher judiciary; theSecretary of State for Defence should speak to the Chiefs of Staff; theLord President of the Council should arrange for the Council of CivilService Unions and representatives of the Nationalised IndustriesChairmen&apos;s Group to be informed.    Each of the Ministers concernedshould inform the Chairmen of the nationalised industries for which hewas responsible.    She would consider further with the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster the arrangements for meeting the Lobby after thestatement.    The debate on the proposals for MPs&apos; pay should bearranged to take place on Monday 14 July, after that on unemployment.The Cabinet -2.
