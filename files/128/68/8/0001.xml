CONFIDENTIALMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inS the House of Commons during the following week.bmmons     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that,in accordance with the conclusions reached by the Cabinet at theirlast meeting, he intended to table later that day, for debate onThursday, 7 August, the necessary motions on the outstandingrecommendations of the First Report from the Select Committee30th on Procedure, Session 1977-78.    He had received assurances fromsions the Chairman of the 1922 Committee that the Government&apos;ssupporters would not table amendments to the motion about a newpublic bill procedure, and he was confident that, with their support,combined with arrangements being made by the Chief Whip to ensurethat as many Ministers as possible were available to vote, therewould be comfortable majorities for the Government at the end ofthe debate.    He was less certain that all the motions would becarried without amendment if for any reason it was now decided todefer moving them until after the Summer Recess.In discussion, it was noted that there were already indications thatamendments would be tabled which if carried would defeat theGovernment&apos;s intention to confine the proposed new public Billprocedure to a strictly limited experiment with not more than threeBills which would not be controversial in party terms.   If theprocedure were introduced on a wider basis, it could put the wholeof the Government&apos;8 legislative programme for the next Session atrisk, and if there were any doubt of securing a majority for all theGovernment motions, it might be preferable not to move them at theend of the debate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although the Cabinet noted that the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster was confident that the Government motions on procedurecould be carried, considerable doubts had been expressed aboutwhether sufficient Government supporters could be relied upon toattend and support the motions on a free vote on 7 August.   In viewof the importance for the Government&apos;s legislative programme ofensuring a majority, the Cabinet would prefer to defer a decisionon whether or not the motions should be moved before the Recessuntil it was clear what amendments would be put down, and whatdegree of support there was likely to be for them.   The Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, in consultation with the Chief Whip, shouldreview the position in the light of developments over the course ofthe next week, and should report to her in time for a final decisionto be taken before the debate.    This could if necessary be reviewedat next week&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1.        Invited the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster, in consultation with the Chief Whip,to review the prospects for obtaining a majorityfor the Government motions on piocedure, asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up, andto report his conclusions to her not later thanWednesday, 6 August.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that270 amendments, most of them put down by the Government, hadbeen made to the Housing Bill in the House of Lords. Thesewould be considered by the House of Commons on Tuesday5 August.    The only amendments likely to be seriouslycontroversial were the five carried against the Government duringthe Lords Report Stage.    The Cabinet had already agreed toconcede the amendment extending the option mortgage scheme togive the equivalent of tax relief to older people who raisedmortgages in order to purchase annuities and, after consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, he had decided to providefor the removal of the 10-year limitation on the power of localauthorities to repurchase houses specially adapted to the needs ofthe elderly.    This would bring the Bill into line with thecorresponding provisions of the Tenants&apos; Rights, Etc. (Scotland)Bill, and with these concessions he hoped that it would be possible,as he had indicated to the Cabinet the previous week, to secure therejection of the amendments which limited tenants&apos; rights to buywithout further serious opposition from the House of Lords.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, although itwas extremely difficult in present circumstances to guarantee aGovernment majority in the House of Lords, his assessment wasthat it was likely that the House would accept the decision of theCommons on the amendments to the Housing Bill referred to bythe Secretary of State for the Environment.    Some members ofthe House of Lords were also likely to complain that there had beeninsufficient time for proper examination of the motions on theHorticulture and Agriculture Grant Orders to be moved in thefollowing week, and would support Lord Sandford&apos;s attempt tosecure postponement of consideration for three months, but he wasnevertheless reasonably confident that the motions could be carried.The Cabinet -2.Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto the THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatof the       one of the 40 bosses in the roof of the Chamber of the House of Lords| Lords       had recently fallen during a sitting.   A preliminary examination ofthe roof had revealed that the glue by which the bosses were held onhad weakened over the years, and that the whole ceiling was in aprecarious state.   As an immediate measure, he was arranging forscaffolding to be erected to support a temporary ceiling at a cost ofabout  150, 000.   In the longer term it might be necessary to rebuildthe entire ceiling at a cost of between  1 and  2 million; thiscourse could prove to be more economical than carrying out furtherrepairs.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe present arrangements for holding House of Lords sittings in theRoyal Gallery were clearly very unsatisfactory, and the Cabinetagreed that everything possible should be done in order to makethe Chamber usable with safety by the time the House of Lordsreassembled on 6 October after the Summer Recess.    The Secretaryof State for the Environment should in any case ensure that thenecessary temporary work was completed in time for the StateOpening of Parliament, which had been provisionally fixed for11 November.The Cabinet -3.        Invited the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to make arrangements to ensurethat the work to erect a temporary ceiling inthe House of Lords Chamber was completed, ifpossible, by 6 October, and in any event in timefor the State Opening of the next Session ofParliament.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the New HebridesCondominium had been brought to independence, as the Republicof Vanuatu, on the planned date of 30 July.    But the situation onthe island of Santo remained unsatisfactory.   At the request of thePrime Minister, Father Lini, the British and French Governmentshad agreed to keep their troops there for one week afterindependence.    Father Lini had now asked for this period to bei extended to three weeks.   The French Government was expecteds to agree, and he himself would be considering with colleaguesdirectly concerned whether the British Government could do thesame.    He would also be arranging for consultations with the Frenchabout ways in which the underlying situation on Santo might beimproved.bia THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Minister of State, Foreignand Commonwealth Office, Mr Hurd, had paid a successful visit toSaudi Arabia and had agreed with the Government there on thee: restoration of normal Anglo-Saudi relations.    The way wasth therefore open for the resumption of contacts at all levels,s including the reinstatement of the proposed visit by the Secretaryof State for Social Services.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Prime Minister, Mr Mugabe,had decided to seek a successor to General Walls from outsideZimbabwe.    It was not yet known whether he would select one ofthe three possible British candidates who had been suggested to him.is The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C(80) 50) covering a report by officials on the financial implicationsof the Motion on Parliamentary Pay, Pensions and Allowancespassed by the House of Commons on 21 July.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was clear that the effect of theHouse of Commons Motion, if implemented, would be a substantialincrease in public expenditure.    The addition to secretarialallowances would cost about  400, 000 per year.   An increase inthe notional salary of Members of Parliament (MPs) for pensionpurposes to  13, 750 would have only a small direct cost, but wouldalmost certainly have to be matched by a similar concession for theother groups covered by the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), andthe Assistant Secretaries, Senior Principals, and related groups inthe Civil Service, whose salaries had been held below the levelssuggested by the pay research evidence.    Such an extension wouldcost about  l  million a year in 1980-81 and 1981-82, and  600, 000in 1982-83, with a gradually diminishing commitment thereafter.The proposals for a more rapid accrual rate for MPs&apos; pensionscould have very widespread and expensive repercussions Indeed*In general discussion it was suggested that, although the variousitems covered by the Motions had been passed by the House withoutan adequate knowledge of the facts, the votes taken were in a sensea quid pro quo for the reduction in MPs&apos; salary increase. TheGovernment would not be able to carry a Motion which did not go aconsiderable way to meeting the various points raised.In further discussion the following main points were made -a. If the notional salary for pension purposes for MPswere to be raised to  13, 750 per annum it would be desirableso to arrange matters that the House was also required tovote at the same time on the consequential changes in thepension entitlement of other public servants.    This wouldensure that MPs faced up to the full consequences of theirdecision; and it would make it clear that the House, and notthe Government, were responsible for the change in policy.b. The proposal that MPs&apos; pensions should accrue at arate of one-fortieth of final salary for each year of servicepresented severe problems.   If Members were themselvesto bear the full cost, the necessary contribution would amountinitially to about 33 per cent of salary on average.    This wasclearly untenable and would call in question the availability oftax relief for the whole of MPs&apos; pension contributions. Ifinstead of increasing Members&apos; contributions the ExchequerCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcontribution was increased, the scheme would becomeexceptionally generous, and would lead to widespreadpressure from other public sector schemes for comparabletreatment to bring them into line with the Parliamentaryscheme.   In any event the number of Members who haddifficulty in acquiring a suitable pension was probably quitesmall, bearing in mind the possibility of transferringpension rights earned in other employment.    Rather thanconsider new schemes based on improved accrual ratestherefore much the best course would be to seek minorimprovements in the present scheme which would provideeasement for the hardest cases eg. by improvements in therules governing the transfer of the pension rights into theParliamentary scheme and possibly some relaxation of thetime limits on which this could be done.    There might alsobe further scope for facilitating the purchase of &quot;added years&quot;of pension entitlement by lump sum payments, although someMembers might not have access to the necessary capitalamounts and be able to acquire &quot;added years&quot; only throughsome form of periodic contributions.c.        The question of linkage of MPs&apos; salaries to &quot;aspecified grade in the public service&quot; also presentedconsiderable difficulty.    Further consultation would benecessary before any conclusions could be reached.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were prepared to accept the increase in secretarialallowances voted for by the House but had very considerable doubtsabout the two improvements sought to pensions entitlement and thelinkage of salary to that of a suitable grade in the public service.In these matters the House should be made fully aware of theimplications of the proposals they had made before any substantivevote was taken.   A factual report should be prepared as soon aspossible and made available to Members.    If, when all the factswere known, the House still wished to vote for an increase innotional salary rates of MPs for pension purposes, they shouldalso be invited to vote on the Government&apos;s recommendation thatsuch a step must in equity be extended to the other TSRB groups,and Civil Service groups, similarly affected.    The Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster should make a statement to the House nextweek, explaining the Government&apos;s attitude and promising a furtherdebate when the House returned in the autumn.   In addition tocirculating the proposed factual note, which would deal with linkageas well as pensions, to individual Members, the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip should also pursueconsultations through the usual channels.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summingup of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster to circulate for comment a draft ofhis proposed statement to be made next week.3.

The Cabinet had before them minutes about teachers&apos; payto the Prime Minister of 28 July from the Secretary of State forEducation and Science; of 29 and 30 July from the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer; of 29 July from the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster; and of 30 July from the Secretary of State for Scotland;and also letters of 9 and 25 July from the Attorney General to theSecretary of State for Education and Science,The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recordedseparately.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALION 5.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChiefuAL Secretary, Treasury (C{60) 48) on his proposals for savings in~TY local authority current expenditure, and the education programmeT in particular, in 1981-82,f2 THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the Cabinet hadalready agreed to keep total public expenditure for 1981-82 withinthe total announced in the last Public Expenditure White Paper,le; Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the European Community receipts, andOth to announce a 2 per cent reduction in total local authority currentons expenditure between 1980-81 and 1981-82.    To achieve the firstobjective, he recommended a cut of  87 million in the totaleducation programme in England, which would be equivalent to 50 million net allowing for the loss of savings on school transport.Within that, to achieve the second objective, he recommended grosssavings of  67 million on local authority current expenditure oneducation in England and Wales.    Of the gross savings of 45 million now offered by the Secretary of State for Education andScience, only  15 million were on local authority current expenditure.If no more savings were made, this would mean an overall netreduction in local authority current expenditure of only 1. 6 per centrather than the 2 per cent approved by the Cabinet.    He recommendedthat the Cabinet should now agree to his proposals for furthersavings on the education programme or, failing that, find them fromall local authority services except law and order.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE saidthat he had increased his proposals for savings from  20 million- 25 million to  45 million, with most of the increased savingscoming on expenditure on polytechnics and higher education assuggested by the Cabinet when this issue had first been discussed.He could not make further savings on current expenditure withoutreducing the standard of provision in schools and so reneging on theGovernment&apos;s commitment to maintain and improve the quality ofeducation.In discussion it was argued that it should be possible to make theproposed further savings on education without necessarily reducingthe quality of teaching.    The further increases required to make upthe Chief Secretary&apos;s proposed total were only 1. 2 per cent of totalschools expenditure.    Even with these savings, unit costs would stillbe higher than in 1978-79.    About 40 per cent of the staff coveredby the education budget were not teachers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had agreed at their last meeting that the Government shouldannounce before the Recess that the total of the local authoritiescurrent expenditure in 1981-82 should be 2 per cent below the8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGovernment16 planned figure for 1980-81.    They now agreed thatthe balance of the savings necessary to achieve this objectiveshould be found from the education programme as proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the total education programmein England in 1981-82 should be reduced by 87 million gross.2. Agreed that, within that figure, localauthority current expenditure on education inEngland and Wales in 1981-82 should be reducedby  67 million gross.USATION     6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (C(80) 49) on compensation for the nationalised[ISATION     shipbuilding and aircraft companies and on the introduction of[&quot;BUILDING private sector capital into the shipbuilding and shiprepair industries.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that problemsabout compensation arose because under the Aircraft and ShipbuildingIndustries Act 1977 compensation payments were based on notionalstock market value in a six months reference period ending on28 February 1974.    The fourteen companies whose values hadfallen between then and vesting day had settled.    Six othercompanies, whose values had risen substantially after vesting daywere strongly pressing the Government to change the terms ofcompensation.   Although the provisions of the 1977 Act were highlyunsatisfactory, he could not recommend that they should now bechanged.    To do so would involve retrospective legislation. Thegrievance felt by shareholders in the companies whose values hadrisen after vesting day had to be balanced against the resentmentthat would be felt, if the compensation terms were changedretrospectively, by the thousands who had sold their shares insome of the companies on the basis of the original compensationterms.   It would cost the Government at least  130 million. Hehad considered the possibility of offering the warship yards backto their previous owners at either compensation or market values.This would have an immediate adverse effect on the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement (PSBR) of about  50 million, becauseprogress payments to the warship yards would have to be repaid;there could be further costs from disruption in the yards of BritishShipbuilders (BS) in protest against the sales; privatisation at thisCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALstage, although not later, would be strongly against the advice ofthe new Chairman of BS;  and it would not deal with the problemsof the former owners of the British Aircraft Corporation. Herecommended therefore that an announcement should be madebefore the Recess that there could be no change in the presentcompensation provisions, and that the Government has decided todefer the introduction Of private sector capital into the shipbuildingand ship repair yards.In discussion it was suggested that the present compensation termsrepresented a policy of confiscation of property.   It was true thatthe policy was that of a previous Government; but the responsibilityfor administering the policy now rested with the present Government.A solution worth considering might be to offer the former owners(where it was still practicable to do so) a choice between acceptingcompensation on the present terms and the return of their formerproperty to them.   This course would require legislation; andwould have other possible disadvantages: that many former ownersof shares had now sold them; that it could lead to industrial actionin BS; and that there would be a cost to the PSBR.   But it shouldbe examined.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatit was not possible to reach conclusions on this matter withoutfurther consideration.    The Cabinet would resume their discussionof this issue at their next meeting with a view to authorising theSecretary of State for Industry td make an announcement oncompensation and on the privatisation of British Shipbuilders beforethe Recess.The CabinetInvited the Secretary of State for Industry,in consultation with the Secretary of State forthe Environment and other Ministers as necessary,to circulate in time for discussion at their nextmeeting a further memorandum setting out andanalysing the advantages and disadvantages of theoptions available to the Government, includingthe proposal suggested in discussion.Cabinet Office31 July 198010CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETERS&apos; PAYsce:6thionsILIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 31st Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 31 July 1980 at 9. 30 amThe Cabinet had before them minutes about teachers&apos; pay to thePrime Minister of 28 July from the Secretary of State for Educationand Science; of 29 and 30 July from the Chancellor of the Exchequer;of 29 July from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster; and of30 July from the Secretary of State for Scotland; and also letters of9 and 25 July from the Attorney General to the Secretary of State forEducation and Science.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid mat the arbitral body appointed to consider the pay of teachersin schools and further education in England and Wales hadrecommended increases from 1 April 1980 costing about 14.6 per centin a full year and, allowing for some staging, 13. 5 per cent in1980-81.    This increase was on a base which made no allowance forthe error by the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability in theirrecommendations for pay increases for 1979.    Before this errorwas discovered the Management Panel, of which the Governmentformed part, had offered a 13 per cent increase from April 1980,corresponding to the 13 per cent allowed for pay and price increasesin the Rate Support Grant cash limit.    They had subsequentlyamended this to 9.26 per cent to allow for the Clegg error of about3. 7 per cent.   In making their recommendations the arbitral bodyclaimed to have taken account of the cost of this error, but it wasnot apparent how they had done so.    It seemed that they had beenprimarily influenced by their judgment of what the employers wereable to pay; and on that they had relied on the previous offer of13 per cent.    Under the 1965 Remuneration of Teachers Act theGovernment had either to accept the awards or to satisfy bothHouses of Parliament, under the Affirmative Resolution procedure,that &apos;national economic circumstances required that effect should notbe given to the recommendations&apos;.    In his view the Government couldnot make such a case.    The proposed awards were lower than those1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALgiven to other comparable public sector groups from April 1980, andit would be pointed out that the Government had offered at one stageto pay 13 per cent.   In these circumstances, although the awardwas higher than he would have wished, he had to recommend that itshould be accepted.In discussion the following points were made -a. Whatever the arguments for setting aside the award,the Resolutions which would be required both in the Houseof Commons and in the House of Lords would be highlycontentious.    Their introduction before the Recess wouldseriously disrupt the Parliamentary programme and putthe Government1 s legislative programme for the sessionat new risk.   It was by no means certain that the Governmentcould command a majority for such Resolutions.   It seemedlikely that the application of the Edmund-Davies formulawould produce an increase of over 20 per cent for the policein September; but, even if the police and the armed forcescould be regarded as exceptional, it was not clear on whatbasis national economic circumstances permitted payincreases of 16 to 18$ per cent for other public servicegroups, including the industrial and non-industrial CivilService, and National Health Service doctors and dentists,but could be argued as requiring a reduction in the payincrease for teachers from 14j to 9l&gt; per cent.b. There was a strong case for inviting Parliament tooverride the award, and for offering no more than the9. 3 per cent proposed by the Management Panel, Otherwisethe  130 million cost of the original error would becompounded; the Government would have lost an opportunityto influence other public sector pay negotiations which wouldbe starting shortly; and the local authorities could complainthat the Government had failed to back them on this issue ata time when it was requiring them to make cuts on theirexpenditure elsewhere,c. Under the terms of the 1965 Act, the case foroverriding the awards would have to be based firmly onnational economic circumstances, rather than on the failureto take account of the Standing Commission&apos;s error. Whileit would be possible to point to a major deterioration in thegeneral economic situation since April, and in particular tothe problems of controlling public expenditure, it would alsobe necessary to convince Parliament that these were sufficientgrounds for reducing the settlement for the teachers when2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALother comparable groups had received higher settlementsin respect of the same period.    It could be argued that,even though the local authorities might have made sufficientprovision to pay for the awards in full, a lower settlementwould allow for smaller rate increases in the coming year.d. It was very important that the Government should notbe defeated on Resolutions to reduce the awards. Thiscould be more damaging than accepting them now.   An attemptto rush Resolutions through before the Recess could add tothe risk of defeat; and economic developments during theRecess might well strengthen rather than weaken the casefor reducing the amount of the increase.e. The awards by the arbitral body dealing with theScottish teachers would not be made for two or three weeks.As the Management Side had offered 14 per cent, they werelikely to be at least that amount.    If it were then decided tooverride them, in line with decisions taken for England andWales, it would not be possible to move the necessaryResolutions until Parliament resumed at the end of October.Failure to take action on the awards in the intervening periodwould almost certainly lead to widespread strike action byScottish teachers.f. It might be possible to publish the reports now andto move the Resolutions in October.    This would allow theGovernment to consider the awards for England and Walesand for Scotland together.    Teachers would, however, beunwilling to wait until then for the implementation of awardsdue with effect from April.    There was a risk that they couldtake Court action against the Secretaries of State.    To dealwith this, one possibility might be to give them an interimaward in line with whatever the Government intended torecommend to Parliament as an acceptable settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that the Government should seek tooverride the awards and to substitute increases in the order of9. 3 per cent as recommended by the Management Panel. &apos; Therewere however considerable difficulties in finding time to debate theResolutions before the Recess.    The Cabinet therefore wished toconsider further the possibility of delaying the Resolutions untilafter the Recess.    The Attorney General, in consultation with theLord Advocate, should prepare urgently a memorandum on the legalposition.    He should advise whether it would be possible to publishthe reports of the arbitral bodies now and to indicate before theRecess that the Government would put forward Resolutions in the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALautumn to override them, and whether the Government could alsoindicate now what would be the award which it would then recommend.He should further advise whether it would be possible to pay aninterim settlement at the level recommended by the Government, onthe understanding that this would be increased to the level of theawards if Parliament subsequently rejected the Resolutions. TheSecretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the aforesaid Law Officers,should assess the risks of the teachers taking Court action againstthe Government if the Resolutions were deferred until the autumn.&apos;He should also advise, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, on how the case for offsetting the cost of the error bythe Standing Commission, in their recommendations for the 1979pay award, could be deployed in Resolutions which would have to bebased primarily on the need to reduce the present awards in thelight of national economic circumstances.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for Educationand Science to publish forthwith the reports of thearbitral body on the pay of teachers in England andWales, and to state that the Government had not yettaken decisions on them.2. Invited the Attorney General, in consultationwith the Lord Advocate and with the Secretaries ofState for Education and Science and for Scotland, tocirculate urgently a memorandum advising on thelegal implications of delaying until after theParliamentary Recess the statutory proceduresnecessary to reduce the awards.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Educationand Science, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the Attorney General and theLord Advocate, to assess the risks of the teacherstaking Court action if the Resolutions were delayed;and, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to advise on how the case for requiring the award to beset aside on account of national economic circumstancescould best be deployed.Cabinet Office1 August 19804CONFIDENTIAL
