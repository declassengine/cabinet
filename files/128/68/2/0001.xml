CONFIDENTIALLIAMENTARYAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.ish Steeljo ration:ncesTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he would bemaking a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon aboutthe serious financial position of the British Steel Corporation (BSC)and the Government&apos;s reaction to it.    The Corporation had told himon 6 June that they estimated that their cash requirement for 1980-81would be some  400 million above the agreed external financing limitof  450 million.    They were in a financial situation in which aprivate-sector company could not legally carry on trading, but wouldhave to go into liquidation.    The Corporation&apos;s problems arose froma long period of ineffective management as well as from the currentrecession and the effects of the long strike.    He would tell the Housethat the Government were not satisfied that BSC had takensufficiently vigorous corrective action, that they looked to the newchairman, Mr MacGregor, to produce new proposals, and that theywere not prepared to fix a new external financing limit until theywere satisfied that BSC were taking the necessary measures.Meanwhile, the Government would, in the lsst resort, have to standbehind BSC in meeting their obligations so that the Corporation couldcontinue trading.    The implications of the situation he would bedescribing to the House were very serious, and included the likelihoodnot only of additional calls on the taxpayer, but also of furtherredundancies in areas of high unemployment.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
REIGNFAIRS3 WesterniancesviousCer&amp;n  :(80) 24thnclusions,tiute 2CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE PRIME&apos;MINISTER said that the Seven-Power SummitMeeting in Venice on 22 and 23 June had broken new ground, bycomparison with previous meetings in the series, in that the Heads ofState and Government had discussed the international political situation,with particular reference to Afghanistan, as well as economic matters.The declaration on Afghanistan had been a useful demonstration of unityand cohesion in the West.    The economic discussion had been dominatedby the effects of the recent oil price increases.    The BritishGovernment&apos;s economic policies had been endorsed.    There wasgeneral agreement that the reduction in inflation was the top priority,though there was increasing concern about the prospects of recession,particularly in the United States and Canada.    There had also been agood discussion about the implications of the oil price increases for thedeveloping countries, and for relations with other countries with them.The increase in their oil bills as a result of the recent price increaseswas greater than the total of official development aid to them.Recycling was not the whole of the answer to the problem: some of thepoorest countries had reached the limit of indebtedness, and needed tobe assisted with grants rather than loans.    The meeting had stressedthe need for the oil exporting countries to share the burden of aid todeveloping countries with the industrialised countries.    The Oilexporting countries had to be convinced that it was not in their intereststo weaken the economies of the industrialised countries and ruin someof the developing countries.    The changing situation made the conceptof the North/South Dialogue out of date.    What was now needed was athree-sided dialogue involving the industrialised countries, the oilexporting countries and the developing countries.    The main work forthe next Summit would be a review of aid policies and procedures in thelight of these developments.   A significant feature of the meeting hadbeen the close understanding between President Giscard and ChancellorSchmidt which had also been evident at the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil ten days earlier.    There was general agreement that thecommunique issued at the end of the meeting was too long and that thefact that it had been largely prepared in advance unnecessarilycircumscribed discussion.    As they had now developed, these Summitmeetings generated excessive expectations, and if expectations were notfulfilled the meeting tended to be regarded by the Press as a disappoint-ment.    For next year it was to be hoped that there could be a returnto a much freer discussion, with many fewer people in attendance, bothfrom Governments and from the media, with an agenda agreed inadvance but with only a short communique prepared in the light of thediscussion, or even no formal communique at all.lamstaneviousference:1(80) 23rdnclusions,nute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the Soviet announcement of the withdrawalof troops from Afghanistan was made during the Venice Summit Meeting.Less than 10,000 troops appeared to be involved, and some might alreadyhave returned.    The significance of the event should be largely dis-counted.    It appeared that Press reports of the extent of resistance inAfghanistan were exaggerated, though there was no doubt that theRussians were in considerable trouble.    Representatives of the Afghanresistance were in contact with representatives of the Islamic Conference.CONFIDENTIAL

He had been reputedly more favourable to theinterests of the West and of private enterprise than his mother.lbodiayiousjrence:79) 24thelusions,iite 3Hebridiesviousjrence:80) 24thelusions,ute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Vietnamese had invadedThailand for 24 hours, taking the Thai army by surprise and killing anumber of Camhodian refugees.    The invasion had been denounced bythe Chinese and by a number of other countries in the region.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that following meetings between theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the French Foreign Minister,M. Francois - Poncet, a package of measures had been worked out withthe French. The success of this package depended on the British beingable to persuade Fr Lini to play his part and on the French being able topersuade Mr Stevens in Santo to do the same. It was still hoped toachieve the independence date of 30 July for the New Hebrides.The CabinetTook note.vIMUNITYTAIRSV10U8erence:80) 24thelusions,.ute 33.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL reported that M. Thorn was now theofficial candidate of the Benelux countries for the Presidency of theCommission.    The appointment would be further discussed informallyamong the Foreign Ministers attending the North Atlantic Councilmeeting in Ankara.    There would be some embarrassment if thequestion was not resolved before Luxembourg assumed the Presidencyof the Council of Ministers on 1 July.    There was still some hope thatthe Italians might put forward Signor Pandolfi as a candidate.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that the Council of Ministers(Transport) on 24 June had been able to make progress on a commondriving licence, subject in our case to the approval of the House ofCommons.    The question of greatei competition among Europeanairlines had also been raised, and a study had been agreed upon, butother countries would be likely to oppose lower air fares in order toprotect Government revenue.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALilTHERNLANDviousrence;80) 12th1 elusions,mte 44.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland (C(80) 31) to which was attached a draftdocument for publication setting out the Government&apos;s proposals forfurther discussion regarding the future government of Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that hismemorandum and the proposals attached to it flowed from the policieswhich the Government had been following since they had come intooffice, and the discussions which had taken place during theConstitutional Conference.    The draft paper for publication had alreadybeen discussed in committee and a number of amendments had been madeto it.   The paper deliberately dealt with the problems at considerablelength, because he attached importance both in Northern Ireland andoutside to having a well argued case on the record.    It was still notpossible to say publicly precisely what the Government wanted orintended to do.   Although substantial areas of agreement had beenidentified, some major issues required further discussion andnegotiation.    The draft proposals narrowed the field down to two possibleapproaches to the establishment of an Assembly and an Executive inNorthern Ireland.    There could be no certainty that the proposalswould succeed.    They would certainly attract criticism from the mainNorthern Irish political parties, none.of whose aspirations would beentirely met by them; but there was a possibility (if no more than that)that these parties would acquiesce in what was proposed.    It wasdesirable to publish the document soon even though July and August werebad months for rational political discussion in Northern Ireland. Ifthe document was published at the beginning of July, intensive discussionsand negotiations with the Northern Irish political parties could then takeplace privately, so that the position could be reviewed by the end ofSeptember and reflected in The Queen&apos;s Speech.In discussion mere was general agreement that the draft proposalsrepre* ented the best that could be made of a very difficult task but thatthere could be no certainty that the proposals would be accepted. Thefollowing points were made:-a. In Northern Ireland the political scene changed rapidly.What had seemed an appropriate political course of action whenthe Government took office was no longer relevant to presentcircumstances.    It was possible that, even if the presentproposals were not accepted, the published document settingthem out would provide a basis for further discussion which mightlead ultimately to some different successful political conclusion,b. The publication of the proposals would undoubtedly giverise to the suggestion that similar considerations should applyto Scotland.    But the text of the paper had been carefullyconsidered from this point of view, it was widely recognisedin Scotland that the situation in Northern Ireland was differentto their own and the risk was containable.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. Although the representation of Northern Ireland atWestminster would certainly need to be considered if and whena legislative assembly was established in Belfast, it would bebetter not to deal with this issue at this stage since it wouldcertainly create difficulties at Westminster.    If the proposalswere to fail, it would be important for them to be seen to failbecause of the refusal of the North Irish political parties tomake the necessary compromises.    The representation issuemight be used to obscure this point.d. The underlying factor which would dictate the success orfailure of the proposals was the extent to which the Unionistscould be persuaded that the minority community should beallowed to exercise some restraint over the power of theExecutive, and the ext ent to which the minority could be broughtto accept that those restraining powers provided them withsufficient safeguards.    It would be important to emphasise thefact that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would retainoverriding powers in the event of a deadlock*e. An important factor in the possible acceptance of theproposals would be the attitude towards them of Dr Paisleyand his willingness and ability to assume a greater degree ofleadership among the Unionists.    His popular support appearedat present to be increasing at the expense m  the leadership ofthe Official Unionist Party.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that while theCabinet recognised the possibility of failure, they agreed that theproposals should be published on 2 July, without any reference toNorthern Irish representation at Westminster.   Although there mightbe advantages in announcing the publication of the document in NorthernIreland, it was probable that the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandwould be under very heavy pressure to make a Parliamentary statementon the date of publication.    The proposals could be debated on 10 Julyat the same time as the Renewal of Emergency Powers.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland -(i)     to arrange for the publication of his draftproposals on 2 July, without any reference toNorthern Irish Parliamentary representation atWe s t minster ;(ii)     to give further consideration in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to theneed for a Parliamentary statement on the date ofpublication.Cabinet Office26 June 1980 5CONFIDENTIAL
