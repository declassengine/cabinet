CONFIDENTIAL^RLIAMENTARY     I.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERPFAIRS informed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofICommons during the following week.    It had been agreed through theusual channels that the Opposition should choose the subjects fordebate on Friday 27 June, when there would be debates on themusicians&apos; dispute with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)and on wages in South Africa.    There would be only a one-line whipfor Government supporters for what were likely to be low-key debates.usicians1 DisputeLth the Britishroadcastingarporationages inmth AfricaTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatMinisterial responsibility for both the subjects selected by theOpposition was very limited, and the Government spokesmen shouldmake this clear*    It would be for a Home Office Minister to reply tothe debate on the musicians&apos; dispute with the BBC; he shouldemphasise the implications of Government interference in BBCmanagement and programming decisions, inherent in any suggestionthat the Government should urge them to continue to support moreorchestras than they thought they could afford to do.    The debateon wages in South Africa was likely to centre on the Government&apos;srefusal to provide the House with a list of British companies which,on the basis of information they had supplied to the Government,might be paying inadequate wages to their employees in South Africa.The Trade Minister who replied to the debate should repeat thatrelevant information was available in the Library of the House, andshould emphasise the strong objections to publishing a list which wasliable to be both incomplete and inaccurate but which would attractabsolute Parliamentary privilege.The Cabinet -1,      Invited the Secretary of State for the HomeDepartment and the Secretary of State for Trade,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury,to make arrangements for the debates on Friday, 27 Juneon the lines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summingup of their discussion.egislation in theouse of Lordsreviousef erenfe:C(80) 11thonclusions,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the volume ofGovernment legislation now going through the House of Lords wascausing serious problems for the management of Governmentbusiness there.    The number and length of debates, including someall-night sittings, was putting an increasing strain on Governmentsupporters.    During the Committee Stage of the Social Security(No. 2) Bill the Liberal and cross-bench peers had supported theLabour Opposition and the Government&apos;s majority had twice been insingle figures.    He was grateful to those of his colleagues who hadCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbeen able to avoid the need for substantial Government amendmentsto Bills in the House of Lords&lt;&gt;    The number of amendments tabledto the Transport Bill had required the allocation of two additionaldayp to the Bill; and he was concerned at the prospect of a largenumber of Government amendments to the Housing Bill, some ofwhich would be controversial.    This matter would be furtherdiscussed at a meeting of the Home and Social Affairs Committeethat afternoon.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.)REIGN&apos;FAIRSw Hebrides  Jeviousference:;(80) 2jfxdnclusions,nute 22.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the attitude of the French Government continued to be affectedby their annoyance at the success of the anglophones   in the islands&apos;elections, but they had now agreed to resume negotiations with theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Blaker,who was on his way to Paris for talks with the Minister for OverseasTerritories, M. Dijoud.    The latter appeared to have been instructedto be more co-operative.    It remained the British objective to bringthe New Hebrides to independence on the due date and on the basis ofthe existing constitution.    If law and order and the writ of the dulyelected Government could be restored on the secessionist island ofSanto, it might be possible to withdraw the Royal Marine detachmentas far as Fiji.    Their positioning would then be comparable to thatof the French gendarmes in New Caledonia.e WesternLianceTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSeven-power Summit Meeting in Venice on 22-23 June was expectedto devote part of its time to political discussion.    This could providea valuable opportunity for demonstrating the basic unity of outlookamong the main industrial nations of the West, particularly in relationto the Afghanistan crisis.    It was to be hoped that the AnkaraMinisterial Meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation on25-26 June would similarly be an occasion for underlining Westernunity.ympic Gameseviousference:;(80) 23rd nclusions,nute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadjust seen the chairman of the British Olympic Association and thechairmen of the governing bodies of British sports federationsintending to take part in the Moscow Olympics.    He had sought toimpress on them, against the background of the latest events inAfghanistan, the extent to which the Soviet authorities would be ableto exploit for political purposes the presence of British athletes atCONFIDENTIAL
1   H9R CONFIDENTIALIthe Games.    Although some of the chairmen were clearly becominguncomfortable with their present policy, it did not seem very likelythat any of them would change their minds.    But it was encouragingthat doubts were beginning to be expressed by a number of individualathletes.byareviousjferehce::(80jllthjnclusilns,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theHead of the Libyan Mission in London had been expelled because ofhis public threats against the lives of two Libyan exiles in Britain.It seemed possible that he had been exceeding his instructions,since the Libyan Government had not so far retaliated againstHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.    The British Embassy in Tripoli hadsuffered minor damage from an attempt at arson, but the Libyanauthorities had co-operated in putting out the fire.aqTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that anunsuccessful attack had just been made on the British Embassy inBaghdad.    It did not seem to have been inspired by the IraqiGovernment, whose security forces had dealt effectively with theattackers.    He would mention the matter at his forthcoming meetingwith the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who was in London on a private visitfor medical treatment.    He would also raise the subject of the twoBritish citizens in prison in Iraq.    Although the Foreign Ministerhad cancelled his official visit to Britain, and had been followed inthis by the Trade Minister, it might now be possible to considertrying to reinstate the Trade Minister&apos;s visit, given the potentialimportance of Iraq as a market for British exports.fficial Dealingsith ForeignmbassadorsTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that itwould be helpful if his colleagues could make a point of ensuringthat the Foreign and Commonwealth Office was informed in advancebefore they made official approaches to foreign Ambassadors. Onlythe Foreign and Commonwealth Office could judge   the impact of aparticular approach, especially if a complaint was involved, on thetotality of Britain&apos;s relations with the country concerned.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIMMUNITYFAIRSropean Councilnice-13 Jual 19803.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the main outcome of therecent meeting of the European Council had been a communique onthe Middle East, the text of which represented a well-balancedstatement since it insisted that no final settlement would be possiblewithout, on the one hand, recognition of Israel&apos;s right to exist and,on the other hand, the right of the Palestinian people to determinetheir own future.    The Leader of the Opposition had criticised theuse of the term &quot;self determination&quot;, but it did not in factnecessarily imply the creation of a Palestinian state.    With some helpfrom the Dutch and the Belgians she and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary had been able to insist on referring to the&quot;association&quot;   rather than the &quot;participation&quot; of the PalestineLiberation Organisation (PLO) in the negotiations.    Even thereference to the association of the PLO with such negotiations hadbeen criticised in an Early Day Motion signed by a number ofGovernment supporters as well as by Opposition Members.Apart from discussions on the Middle East, Heads of Governmenthad had a useful broad debate on the economic situation andCommunity matters.    It was encouraging that such an exchange ofviews had been possible without the European Council feeling theneed to issue detailed pronouncements.    While it did not reem likelythat serious progress on restructuring the Community Budget wouldbe possible until after the German and French elections, it was clearthat Chancellor Schmidt was anxious to reduce the financial burdenplaced on the Federal Republic as a result of the arrangements agreedto reduce our net contribution.In discussion the following points were made:-a.      The Germans were now as worried as we had beenover the burden of the Community&apos;s existing budgetaryarrangements.    Even in regard to the Common AgriculturalPolicy the need for changes was increasing] / recognisedalthough the-smaller countries who were now net beneficiariesfrom the Community Budget would resist.    The Germans alsoshared our view about the need to maintain the present1 per cent ceiling on the Value Added Tax (VAT) contributionsto the Community Budget, and German fears that there mightbe residual obligations on national Governments to meetpayments once that limit was reached were being urgentlystudied.b.      The European Council had not been able to agree on asuccessor to Mr Roy Jenkins as President of the Commission.This had been a disappointment for the Luxembourg ForeignMinister, Mr Thorn, who had hoped to be appointed.    It wasAtiggested that, since restructuring of the Community Budgetwould be a major task for the next Commission a competentex-Finance Minister would be a good choice.  No suchCONFIDENTIA
CONFIDENTIALcandidate had been proposed in Venice.    The ItalianGovernment had not, as we had hoped, been able to putfoi ward Signor Pandolfi.    The name of Mr Duieenberg,a former Dutch Finance Minister, had been mooted, but theDutch Government had been reluctant to put forward some onefrom an Opposition party.    Another possibility would beMr Van der Stee, the present Dutch Finance Minister.mmon Fisherieslicyeviousference:(80) 21stnclusionsTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 16 June had taken placein a friendly atmosphere, as had his bilateral meetings with French,Irish and German Fisheries Ministers.    Although it was known thatChancellor Schmidt was pressing for an early fisheries settlement,the German delegation appeared to be taking a realistic view, and hedid not exclude the possibility of eventually finding a solution onaccess which would suit our interests and safeguard those which theFederal Republic had, notably in Danish waters.    As a result ofconsultations with the Irish, the Danes and the Italians, we were nolonger faced with a situation in which the other eight Member Stateswere putting us in a minority of one.    Nevertheless we wjre not in astrong negotiating position, because the Treaties did not ensure themaintenance of preferential access beyond the end of 1982.    It wasreasonable to suppose that we would be able to negotiate continuedpreferential access within 12 miles and some arrangements beyondwhich would suit the interests of our inshore fishermen.    There wouldhave to be some Community financial arrangements for the distantwater fleet.   The next meeting of the Fisheries Council scheduled for21 July would be crucial.    The Commission were due to makeproposals on both quotas and access following bilateral consultationswith us and the other major fishing nations.w Zealand THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidLry Products that, at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)Commissioner Gundelach had dealt well with the need to providefor continued access to the Community market for New Zealandbutter.   The Council had appointed a special committee ofrepresentatives of Ministers to advise him on the Commission&apos;sproposals.CONFIDENTIAL

A further reportoh the pay of Members of Parliament and Ministers was expectedshortly.    The two Reports .would need to be considered togetherbefore final decisions were taken. wiA&lt;In discussion the following main points were made:-a.      The recommendations in TSRB 14 related to groupswho had already completed the phased implementation ofearlier awards and who were therefore already receivingthe rates of pay accepted by the Government as appropriateat 1 April 1979.    The new Report&apos;s recommendations were, designed to update the 1979 levels to those appropriate at1 April 1980.    The position of Ministers and Members ofParliament differed in that Members of Parliament had justreceived the second instalment of a three-stage adjustmentdesigned to bring their pay to the appropriate rates as at13 June 1979.    The Report expected shortly would update theearlier recommendations to 1980 levels but the third stagepayment would remain to be made.    Both this year&apos;s andnext year&apos;s stage payments to Members of Parliament, butnot any updating increases, were covered by the Order whichhad been made last year.    On the other hand Ministers hadnot yet received the second stage payment arising from lastyear&apos;s award, and an Order implementing this stage and anyupdating would be required before payment could be made. Itwould be convenient if any Order for this purpose could alsodeal with the third stage payment to Ministers due next year.1SECRET
SECRETb. The recommendations in TSRB 14 ranged from 16 to30 per cent for individual grades and posts.    The highestrecommended increases related to the lowest grades dealtwith by TSRB (Under Secretaries, Major Generals and theirequivalents, and ordinary Board Members of NationalisedIndustries) where there were particular problems inmaintaining a reasonable differential between their pay andthat of the grades immediately below them whose pay wasdetermined by other means.    Apart from the recommendationsreflecting particular problems with differentials, therecommendations of the TSRB were broadly in line with thoseearlier made, and accepted, for National Health ServiceDoctors and Dentists.c. The TSRB&apos;s recommendations were among the latersettlements in the 1979-80 pay round.    The Government&apos;s &apos;decisions would be seen as an indication of their attitude topay in the coming 12 months.    It was also relevant thatsettlements for the 1979-80 pay round were still outstandingin respect of some 2 million other public sector employeesincluding the nurses, the teachers and the Post Officeengineers.    The nurses were currently balloting on a payoffer of 14 per cent; the local authorities were seeking tohold the teachers&apos; curient pay settlement to low figures;and difficult pay negotiations with the Post Office EngineeringUnion were in immediate prospect.    The timing and qualityof the Government&apos;s decisions would have to take account ofthese factors.d. Financial and cash limit considerations were in thiscase secondary, because the total amounts of money involvedwere not great; but the absolute levels of remuneration andthe absolute amounts of any increases were such that adversecomment was likely to ensue, whatever the Government&apos;sdecisions.    In that sense there might be no obviously right&apos;decision available; but a seriously wrong decision could havethe most damaging consequences, for the Government&apos;s peliciesfor reducing the levels of pay settlements in the public sector.Implementation of the TSRB&apos;s recommendations in full seemedvery difficult to contemplate:  the question was rather by howmuch to abate them.    This could not be a matter of a single ||||absolute or proportionate reduction, given the need tomaintain reasonable differentials.    Careful and detailedstudy would be required before decisions could be reached.e. Past experience suggested that neither staging norrequests for voluntary forgoing of some part of the increasesrecommended would be a satisfactory way of proceeding.2SECRET
SECRETf. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy-hadagreed at a recent meeting (E(80) 16th Meeting) that infuture the TSRB should no longer be invited to advise on theremuneration of Chairmen and Board Members of nationalisedindustries and other essentially trading public corporations.The Review Body had also, in its Report, expressed its owndoubts about the appropriateness of continuing to makerecommendations in this area.    The precise boundaries ofthe TSRB1 s new and limited remit in relation to chairmen andmembers of public bodies needed to be defined, and nodecision had yet been taken on the timing of an announcementor on whether the TSRB&apos;s current recommendations in thisarea should be acted upon.    Discussion showed wide supportfor the decision taken by E Committee, though fears wereexpressed that greater freedom in settling nationalisedindustry salaries would exert an upward pressure both onthose salaries and on those of appointees to posts in the publicsector, like chairmanships of non-trading corporations, wheremarket forces could not be a principal determinant.g. Appointments to the judiciary represented a specialproblem.    Those appointed to the Bench were recruited fromthe highly competitive and commercially-oriented world of theBar where the rewards for success could be very nigh. Unlessdue account were taken of this, it would be very difficult tomaintain the quality of justice.    An unprecedently largenumber of those approached were now refusing appointmentto the High Court, and the calibre of Judges in the CircuitCourts was declining.    The mechanism for establishingjudicial salaries must be capable of retaining the confidenceof the profession, if substantial and irreversible damage wasnot to be done to the administration of justice.h. The Government&apos;s pledge to the   Armed Forces wasabsolute.    It would be very difficult to draw a distinction  between the senior ranks covered by TSRB 14 and the juniorranks covered by the Armed Forces Review Body.j.       The Government&apos;s pledge to update the  second stagepayment to Members of Parliament this year, and the thirdstage next year, on lines to be recommended by the TSRB,had also been absolute.    This need not prevent the House ofCommons from deciding to forgo part of the increases.The Government would have to table a motion, but the decisionwas for the House to take.    There were signs that opinionamong the Government&apos;s supporters in the House was movingin the direction of a degree of abatement of the increaseslikely to be recommended by the TSRB, though a significant &gt;number of them were still opposed to the concept. Theposition of the Opposition was less certain, but the majoritywere likely to be against any abatement.    No judgment couldyet be made of the outcome of a vote in the House on this issue.SECRET
SECRETk.      Attention would also need to be given to the position ofjunior Ministers.    Those in the House of Commons wouldhave gained from an increase in their Parliamentary pay, butjunior Ministers in the House of Lords had no such recourse.In considering these matters, a clear distinction should bedrawn between the implementation of the remaining stages ofthe recommendations about Ministers&apos; pay made by the TSRBlast year, and updating to take account of current circum-stances.    The stage payments should be implemented withoutquestion and the necessary Order to this effect should beintroduced at an appropriate time.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion; said that theCabinet had confirmed the earlier decision of the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy mat the Chairmen, Deputy ,Chairmen and other board members of nationalised industries andother essentially trading public corporations should be excluded inthe future from the ambit of the TSRB.    Decisions had not been takenabout the precise boundaries of the TSRB remit, about the timing ofan announcement, or about whether to act upon the recommendationsfor nationalised industry board members.    The Cabinet were alsoagreed that the remaining stage payments due, under earlierdecisions, to Members of Parliament and Ministers should be madeon the due dates, though the timing of an announcement aboutMinisters&apos; pay and of the tabling of any necessary Orders wasreserved for later decision.   The question of updating the paymentsto be made to the TSRB groups, including Ministers and Members ofParliament, were a different matter.    There was a wide measure ofagreement that the political case for not implementing the TSRBrecommendations in full was very strong.    On the other hand it wasnot possible to approach this matter either by setting an arbitrarypercentage increase for all salaries concerned or by abating all therecommended rates by a fixed amount or percentage, because of theneed to preserve reasonable differentials.    She would thereforearrange for a detailed study of the possibilities to be made, and foroptions to be presented for the Cabinet&apos;s consideration. TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip shouldcontinue the process of sounding opinion in the House and should keepin close touch with her on the point.    Members of the Cabinet shouldtake early opportunities to sound the opinion of their junior Ministers,and she would also take a hand in this process.    The PaymasterGeneral should give preliminary consideration to the presentationalproblems which the Government would face when its decisions wereannounced.    The Cabinet would be invited to return to the subject andto take decisions when the Report of the TSRB on the pay of Ministersand Members of Parliament was available.    In the meantime it wasparticularly important for Cabinet Ministers to say nothing in publicor in private which would encourage speculation about theGovernment&apos;s attitude to these matters or the decisions they mighttake.4SECRET
