CONFIDENTIAL2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, although the Polishleaders were putting a brave face on it, their sudden summoningto Moscow seemed a sinister development, reminiscent of thesimilar summoning of the Czech leaders at a critical stage of eventsin Czechoslovakia in 1968.    The Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary, who was on a visit to Poland, had seen the leaders beforetheir departure.   Among Britain&apos;s major allies, the Frenchft remained surprisingly optimistic that there would be no Soviets, military intervention, but the Americans were less so and theGermans much less.    Concern was mounting in Eastern Europe, ashad been clear for example during the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary&apos;s recent visit to Hungary.   In the German DemocraticRepublic there had been a sharply worded Press commentary, andthe Government had announced new restrictions on travel to Poland.The Poles were expected to resist if invaded.   Any invasion wouldbe likely to be preceded (as in the Czech case) by sizeable Soviettroop movements, of which there was so far no sign.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the fighting between Iraq and Irancontinued without major developments.    There was no further newsof the release of the United States hostages in Iran.    But thisremained a real possibility.    The Foreign Ministers of the EuropeanCommunity had agreed that formal sanctions against Iran would be&apos; terminated if the hostages were released, but that it would be for eachGovernment to decide nationally on how to proceed thereafter. InBritain&apos;s case a complicating factor would be the four British subjectsunder arrest in Iran.1CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the United Nations (UN) Secretariatteam had now persuaded the South African Government to set a datefor the beginning of the process leading to Namibian elections saidindependence.    This was subject to satisfactory agreement on thecomposition of the proposed UN force and also to the holding of aninternational meeting attended by the Namibian internal parties aswell as others concerned.    On this latter issue it was disappointingthat the UN Secretary General, Dr &quot;Waldheim, had not been moreskilful in his handling of the leaders of the Front Line States; andthere was a danger that President Nyerere of Tanzania might againplay an unhelpful role, as he had done over the Rhodesiannegotiations.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that everythingpossible was being done to persuade the owners of the one Britishship caught in the Khorramshahr area of the Shatt-al-Arab that itwould be dangerous for the ship to attempt to break out.    Such anattempt might nevertheless be madu before long: morale v.asdeclining among the ship&apos;s remaining crew, nine of whom, includingthe captain, were British.The Cabinet -Took note.3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that Monsieur Thorn had visitedLondon on Monday 27 October in his dual capacity as President ofthe Council and President designate of the Commission. Therehad been some discussion abcat the distribution of portfolios in thenew Commission.    Many of the present Commissioners seemed likelyto remain and would wish to retain their existing portfolios. Inparticular, if Monsieur Cheysson remained, it would be difficult forMr Ivor Richard to secure the development portfolio, for which hewas well qualified.   As regards the forthcoming meeting of theEuropean Council, Monsieur Thorn had reported thatPresident Giscard wished the meeting to concentrate on internationalaffairs.    In her view, however, the Heads of Government could notignore problems facing the Community including the CommonAgricultural Policy and the Budget.    There should also bediscussion on commercial policy matters, including trade withJapan and the problems facing eg the chemical industry from lowcost American competition.    The outgoing President,Mr Roy Jenkins, might be invited to give some account of hisstewardship and an indication of how he thought the Communityshould tackle the problems it was facing.In a brief discussion it was noted that the French hu.d held thedevelopment portfolio since the beginning of the Community and itwas time for a change.    Herr Haferkamp had not been effective asthe Commissioner responsible for external relations.    It shouldnot be accepted that incumbents had a right as a matter of courseto retain their portfolios and should press for a more generalreallocation.   Attention was also drawn to the fact that detailedtalks were taking place between the Germans and the French on howto avoid creating difficulties for the French in advance of theforthcoming French Presidential Elections.    It would be advantageous,following the successful Anglo-French consultations in September,for the British Government to show itself equally sensitive, perhapsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthrough the medium of discreet contacts between the PrimeMinister and the President of the Republic.    There were a numberof industrial and commercial areas where the United Kingdom hadinterests in common with France.3CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said he was hopefulthat, at the Council of Ministers meeting that day, it would provepossible to resolve the outstanding difficulties over the introductionof mandatory quotas to regulate steel production in the Community.The German Government had sought to protect the interests of theirproducers Of special steels, but some compromise on this pointshould be possible.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries)agreement on enforcement measures had been reached.   At itsnext meeting the Council would tackle the difficult questions ofquotas and access.    The new French Minister responsible forfisheries was being co-operative.The Cabinet -Took note.4.        The Cabinet considered a note by the Home Secretary(C(80) 63) to which was attached a revised draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament.    They also had before thema letter from the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the HomeSecretary dated 28 October 1980 reporting on his consultations aboutthe possible deletion of references to specific Bills from the draftSpeech.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the revised draft of The Queen&apos;sSpeech attached to C(80) 63 took account of changes agreed by theCabinet at their previous meeting.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster had subsequently consulted four Ministers responsiblefor Bills mentioned in the draft Speech, to see whether they wouldbe prepared for the relevant references to be dropped, on theunderstanding that this would not necessarily imply that the Billsconcerned would not find a place in the legislative programme.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;s letter of 28 October
CONFIDENTIALset out the position reached.    The Secretary of State for Scotlandhad agreed to the deletion of the reference to civic government inScotland on page 5 of the draft Speech, and the Secretary of Statefor Social Services had agreed to the deletion from the same pageof the reference to legislation to enable improvements to be madein the health and social services.    It had not been possible toreach agreement on the three xemaining Bills mentioned insquare brackets on page 5 of the draft Speech.   After furtherdiscussion it was proposed not to excise from the Speech thereferences to the Education (Special Needs) Bill and the Education(Scotland) Bill.    The reference to the Royal Visit to Sri Lankahad still to be confirmed.    The reference to unemployment mighthave to be amended in the light of discussions later that morning,while the passage on Northern Ireland might also have to be revisedto reflect subsequent decisions.    He suggested that on both thesesubjects the final text should be settled between the PrimeMinister, himself, and the Ministers directly concerned. Subjectto these points, he invited thr Cabinet to approve the revised draftSpeech, and to agree that it should be submitted to The Queen inthe course of the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thathe was grateful to the Secretary of State for Scotland and theSecretary of State for Social Services for agreeing to dropreferences to two of their Bills from the draft Speech, Heaccepted that this did not imply any decision about whether theBills themselves were to remain in the programme. TheSecretary of State for Trade had been unwilling to agree to dropthe provisions of the Companies Bill dealing with the implementationof European Community commitments, but had promised toconsider whether the same objectives could be achieved with lessprimary legislation.    The Secretary of State had also been reluctantto agree to the deletion of the reference to the Insurance CompaniesBill from the draft Speech, on the grounds that there had alreadybeen a considerable delay in honouring our Community obligationsin this area, and that its provisions would be of bei.efit to theBiitish insurance industry.    This was however a long Bill whichwas not an essential part of the Government&apos;s domestic strategy,and he hoped that it might be possible to avoid a specific referencein The Queen&apos;s Speech to this Bill, or to the Jurisdiction andForeign Judgments Bill, which was also designed mainly to meetEuropean Community commitments and was not essential to theprogramme.    The overloading in the present Session&apos;s programmehad made it evident that it was better at this stage to err on the sideof caution in judging the prospects for next Session&apos;s legislativeprogramme.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, the following main points were made -a. The Companies Bill would not be ready for introductionuntil early in the new year.    If it was then clear that thelegislative programme was running into difficulties, it mightbe possible to consider dropping some of its less essentialprovisions so as to facilitate its passage through bothHouses.b. The harmonisation of laws governing activities ofinsurance companies was one of th3 areas wheredevelopments in the Community were to our advantage inencouraging cross-frontier business.    If no commitmentto the Insurance Companies Bill were given in The Queen&apos;sSpeech, it would be disappointing to our own insuranceinterests, and attract criticism from our Communitypartners.c. The Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments Bill was anon-controversial measure which would fulfil an overdueCommunity obligation.   It was suitable for introduction inthe House of Lords, and could probably be handled in theHouse of Commons under the Second Reading Committeeprocedure.    It would not take up much Parliamentary timeand there seemed little point in dropping the reference tothe Bill, which was one of the very few law reformmeasures provided for in the legislative programme, fromthe draft Speech.    On the other hand, the drafting of theBill had not yet been completed, and it was unlikely to beready for introduction until shortly before Christmas. TheBill was not a major item in next Session&apos;s programme, andany reference to it would not be likely to attract publicinterest; on balance it might be better to omit suchreference from the Speech.d. Dates for the Royal Visit to Sri Lanka had beenagreed, but the reference to the Visit in the Speech mustdepend on whether an official invitation was received in time.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the deletion of the references to civic governmentin Scotland and to the health and social services on page 5 of thedraft Speech.    In view of the advantages which would accrue to theBritish insurance industry from the European CommunityDirectives on insurance services, the reference to the InsuranceCompanies Bill should remain in the draft Speech, but the referenceto the Jurisdiction and Foreign Judgments Bill should be deleted.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe reference to the Royal Visit to Sri Lanka should remain in squarebrackets for the time being, and would be deleted if no formal invitationhad been received by the time of the State Opening.    She would settlefinal texts on Northern Ireland and unemployment in consultation with theHome Secretary and the Ministers directly concerned, and would arrangefor the draft Speech, as revised, to be submitted to The Queen in thecourse of the following week.The Cabinet -1. Noted that the Prime Minister would determinefinal texts of the references to unemployment andNorthern Ireland after consultation with the HomeSecretary and Ministers directly concerned.2. Subject to 1, invited the Home Secretary toprepare a final draft of the Speech, taking acount ofthe points made in the I rime Minister&apos;s summing upof their discussion.3. Noted that the Prime Minister would submit thedraft Speech to The Queen.6CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET5.        The Cabinet discussed a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(80) 59) on the economic prospect and implicationsfor policy.    They also had before them a table summarising publicexpenditure totals from 1974-75 to 1981-82 and the prospects for thePublic Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) in 1981-82;memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(80) 60 and 65)on the pay and price factors to be included in the 1981-82 cash limitsand vote8; memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChief Secretary, Treasury (C(80) 58 and 64) and by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C(80) 62) on public expenditure programmes; anda memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department(C(80) 61) on the Rate Support Grant settlement in 1981-82.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the decisionswhich the Cabinet was now called upon to reach had to be consideredagainst a very difficult international and domestic economicsituation.     Throughout the industrialised world there had been asharp reduction of growth in the 1970s, as a result of the increasein oil prices and general inflationary tendencies.    This had beenparticularly marked in the United Kingdom, where the averageannual rate of growth between 1973 and 1979 had fallen to 1 per centas compered with 3 per cent over the previous twenty years. GrossDomestic Product in the United Kingdom was expected to fall by aboutfive percentage points between 1979 and 1981, because of the worldrecession, and the high exchange rate accentuating the long-termdecline in the international competitiveness of British industry. Theunderlying problems of the British economy were rooted in theincrease of earnings and prices and not in a deficiency of demand.The right course was to stick to the policy objective of containingthe aggregate totals of public expenditure at the levels agreed earlierin the year - which because of the recession would imply an increasein the ratio between public expenditure and Gross Domestic Product,and to bring the PSBR to a level which would permit the possibility ofa reduction in the level of interest rates, which was among the factorskeeping the exchange rate high and was creating severe liquidityproblems for industry.The reductions in public expenditure proposed by the Treasury didnot represent an overall reduction in public spending: they representeda redistribution within the total, so as to make   room for theincreases (to a considerable extent the unavoidable result of recession)detailed in Table 1 attached to C(80) 58.    Even if all the reductionsproposed by the Treasury were agreed, that would leave the PSBRin 1981 &quot;82 slightly higher than that forecast in July.    It would not inpresent circumstances be appropriate to try to bring the forecastPSBR back to the level implied by the centre of the range indicatedfor money supply increases in the medium term financial strategy,but it would be necessary to bring the PSBR some way back towardsthat level, if it was to become compatible with any prospect ofreducing interest rates.    That meant that he was bound to be thinkingin terms of a considerable increase in taxation in his next Budget, overand above the reductions in public expenditure now proposed.7SECRET
SECRETIn discussion there was general agreement with the objectives of theGovernment&apos;s economic strategy, but reservations were expressedby some Ministers about the scale and timing of the measuresproposed.    It was suggested that the increases in nationalisedindustry financial requirements and in the cost of unemploymentbenefit as a result of the recession should not be regarded as areason for cutting other public spending programmes. Mostcountries did not include nationalised industry investment in theirpublic expenditure, or include it in their PSBR.    It was necessaryto have regard to what was happening in the economy.    The Treasurypapers did not provide the Cabinet with adequate forecasts of theconsequences of their proposals for interest rates, industrial outputor unemployment, and Treasury forecasts of unemployment had in thepast tended to be over optimistic,    Manufacturing output had fallen b/11 per cent this year,    Unemployment was continuing to rise.British goods were increasingly uncompetitive in world marketsbecause of the high exchange rate.    The volume of exports had so farheld up as order books were worked through, but manufacturerscould not continue indefinitely to export at a bare profit 01 even a loss,and export orders were likely soon to decline,,    There was a risk thatthe measures now proposed by the Treasury might merely serve toaggravate the decline in output and the rise in unemployment nowoccurring.    If this happened, it could make inevitable higherexpenditure on unemployment benefits, larger financing requirementsfor nationalised industries and a larger PSBR, and could force out ofbusiness not just inefficient and badly managed companies but some ofthe best companies in the country on whom the prospects of recoverywould depend.    On the monetary side, bank lending to the privatesector was likely to begin to come down, and it should be possible tofinance a PSBR consistent with a money supply increase of the orderof 10 per cent in 1981-82 at lower interest rates than those now ruling.The Cabinet should also have regard to the political implications ofwhat was being proposed.    The right course for the Cabinet was,while supporting the general strategy, not to go as far as nowproposed in reducing public expenditure, to make a modest reductionin the level of interest rates as the rate of inflation came down, andto review the situation again in a few months&apos; time.On the other hand, though there was general recognition that thedecisions facing the Cabinet were very difficult and painful, bothon public expenditure and perhaps also on taxation, it was arguedthat the decisions would not become less necessary or lessdisagreeable with the passage of time, and should not therefore bepostponed.    The measures proposed were themselves likely to haveonly a marginal effect on the level of industrial activity and unemploy-ment; it would be idle to suppose that the Government could find someeasy way of significantly increasing the level of activity, which wasdetermined by world recession and other circumstances not withinthe Government&apos;s ability to determine in the short term.    The Cabinetshould continue to set its course in relation to the longer-term8SECRET
SECRETrequirements for the reduction of the rate of inflation and therecovery of the economy.    That necessitated doing whatever waspossible to create the climate for a revival of investment.    It wasessential to bring the PSBR in 1981-82 back to a level that wascompatible with a fall in interest rates.    This would entail a massivebudgetary switch, with reductions in public expenditure of theaggregate amount proposed by the Treasury and increases intaxation of the kind foreshadowed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In deciding which public expenditure programmes to cut, the Cabinetshould concentrate as far as possible on those programmes that werenot wealth-creating.    From the point of view of the ex edibility of thestrategy and of offering some prospect of hope for industry it wasarguable that the changes of taxation required should be broughtforward from next year and included with the public expenditurechanges in an early announcement.    In this way the total impact ofthe Government&apos;s proposals on the PSBR would be seen, and the fullextent and gravity of the problem demonstrated; but there would besome ground for hoping that this could complete what was requiredand hold out the prospect of a reduction in interest rates.In discussion the following were among the other points made:-a. Of the proposed increases in expenditure, over 1 billion was for the nationalised industries.    This was amajor reason for the substantial cuts which were now beingdemanded from other programmes.    If, however, loss-makingnationalised industries, such as the British Steel Corporation(BSC) had been put into liquidation, the costs to the PSBRwould have been considerably higher.b. There was strong pressure from industry to reduce theburden on them of energy prices, and there might ba somescope for limited selective action in this direction.    On theother hand any substantial slowing down of the move toeconomic energy pricing would have a further and majoradverse effect on the finances of the nationalised industries.c. It was necessary to provide for further increases inthe Contingency Reserve for realism, in the light of experienceover the last year and to guard against likely further demandsfor financing of, for example, British Leyland and BSC.d.      In considering the options it would be necessary to beclear whether priority should be given to the aim of reducingthe PSBR or to reducing the public expenditure totals. Inthe health service, for example, it would be possible to avoidpublic expenditure cuts by the alternative of an increase in theNational Insurance Health Contribution which would benefit thePSBR.   A balance would have to be struck between theseobjectives.    It was suggested that, while in 1981-82 theSECRET
SECRETprimary objective must be to reduce the PSBR, lheGovernment should not lose sight of its commitment tobringing down the level of public expenditure as a proportionof Gross Domestic Product.e.      It would be of prime importance to present a unitedfront in defending the Cabinet&apos;s decisions.    Press speculationwhich sought to portray Cabinet discussion in adversary termswas particularly damaging and members of the Cabinet shouldavoid saying anything which fed such speculation.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion, said that it wasclear that the Cabinet endorsed the Government&apos;s economic strategy,and accepted the need to pursue the objective of keeping the totals ofpublic expenditure in 1981-82 and later years broadly at the levelsset out in the March White Paper (Cmnd. 7841),    To this end, andas a contribution to reducing the PSBR in 1981-82, it would benecessary to achieve aggregate reductions of public expenditure ofthe order of magnitude proposed by the Treasury.    Even with thesereductions, the Chancellor of the Exchequer would be faced with theneed to increase taxation in order to bring the PSBR down to a levelcompatible with a reduction in interest rates.    The only alternativecourse - that of allowing the PSBR and the money supply to rise -was not likely to provide significant relief for industry in the shortterm and would have incalculable consequences for the levels ofinflation, output and unemployment in the longer term.    The Cabinetwould meet again on Tuesday, 4 November to discuss the detailedproposals for reductions in spending programmes to achieve thetotal required.    It had to be accepted that, if some programmes werereduced by less than was proposed, the shortfall would have to beoffset by larger reductions than those proposed in other programmes,if the total reduction required was to be realised.    I  the Cabinet didnot agree upon reductions adding up to the total required, (he shortfallwould have to be made up by increases of taxation additional to thosewhich would be required in any case.The Cabinet -1. Endorsed the Government&apos;s economic strategy asset out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in C(80) 59and in discussion*2. Endorsed the objective of keeping the totals ofpublic expenditure in 1981-82 and later years broadlyat the levels set out in the White Paper of March 1980(Cmnd. 7841).10SECRET
SECRET3. Endorsed the objective of reducing the total ofpublic expenditure programmes by the aggregateamounts indicated in C(80) 58 and 64,4. Agreed that, in so fax* as the agreed reductions inpublic expenditure fell short of the aggregate amountsindicated, it would be necessary for the Chancellor of theExchequer to impose additional increases of taxation,,over and above those which would be required even if thereductions indicated were achieved in full, in order tcbring the PSBR in 1981-82 down to a level compatible withthe prospect of a significant reduction of interest rates,5. Agreed to meet on Tuesday, 4 November fordetailed discussion of the reductions in public expenditureprogrammes proposed in C(80) 58 and 64.Cabinet Office31 October 198011SECRET
