SECRETMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in5 the House of Commons in the following week.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe Debate on the Address would continue up to and includingThursday 27 November.    The choice of subjects for each day ofthe Debate was in the hands of the Opposition, and they would nottake a final decision until the meeting of the Shadow Cabinet thefollowing day.    On the last two days the Opposition would moveamendments and their spokesmen would speak first. Opportunitywould have to be found, either by way of a separate statement or ,during a Ministerial speech, for a number of major Governmentstatements: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on publicexpenditure and the economy, by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment on the publication of the consultative documentscontaining the Government&apos;s proposals for the 1981-82 Rate SupportGrant settlement, including the proposed reduction in local authorityhousing subsidies, and by the Secretary of State for Employment onspecial employment measures.In discussion the following.main points were made:a. It was undesirable for any statements to be madeon Tuesday 25 November, when the publication of the latestunemployment figures was expected to lead to a fierceOpposition attack on the Government; the alternative ofseveral statements on Monday 24 November, including oneby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might be unavoidable.b. The statutory meeting on the Rate Support Grant (RSG)&lt;  settlement for 1981-82 had now been arranged for16 December.    The Secretary of State for the Environmenthad been advised that he would be open to challenge in thecourts unless a reasonable period, probably not less thanthree weeks, was allowed between the publication of theconsultative documents and the statutory meeting. Thispointed towards a statement, followed by publication, asearly as possible in the following week.c. Any statement on the proposals for the RSGsettlement by the Secretary of State for the Environmentwould have to be accompanied by similar statements by theSecretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.SECRET
SECRETd. Because of its implications for. expenditure oneducation, it would be preferable for any statements onthe RSG settlement to be made before the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science had to answer ParliamentaryQuestions on Tuesday 25 November; for this reason, andin order to avoid a proliferation of statements on RSGsettlements, it was for consideration whether theGovernment&apos;s proposals in this area could be included inthe statement to be made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.e. If a settlement of the prison officers&apos; dispute wasreached in time, the Home Secretary might wish to make astatement on Tuesday 25 November.    This would not obviatethe need for a Motion on Wednesday 26 November to continuethe existing powers under the Imprisonment (TemporaryProvisions) Act. faf. The Scrutiny Committee had recommended severaloutstanding European Community documents on fisheriespolicy for debate.   It would be preferable if time could befound for a debate before the next Council meeting onfisheries; it might be held after 10.00 pm during thefollowing week.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be undesirable for any statements,other than one on the prison officers&apos; dispute if the Home Secretarywere in a position to make it, to be made on Tuesday 25 November.The timing of other statements could not be settled until the topicsfor each day&apos;s debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech were known, but itseemed from the Cabinet&apos;s discussion that it would be necessaryfor the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s statement on economic policy,announcements on the RSG settlement for 1981-82 (it was for furtherconsideration among the Ministers concerned whether theseannouncements should be included in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement or made separately by the Secretaries ofState for the Environment, Scotland and Wales), and the statementon special measures to deal with unemployment to be made beforethe conclusion of the debate.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster should arrange the precise timing of these statements inconsultation with the Chief Whip and the other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chief Whip and other Ministersconcerned, to make appropriate arrangements for thenecessary statements in the House of Commons in thefollowing week, and to report the outcome to thePrime Minister.2SECRET
CONFIDENTIALEIGNmrs-Germannitiouspence:115thIlu sions,te 22.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the talks which she andthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had had with the FederalChancellor and Herr Genscher in Bonn on 16-17 November had gonewell.    The Chancellor had shown some concern about the LabourParty Conference decision to work for the withdrawal of theUnited Kingdom from the European Community, but he had beenleft in no doubt about the Government&apos;s commitment to Europe.As a result of the talks the way was now clear for both countriesto go ahead in Europe on a basis of friendship and co-operation.3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, following a series of bilateral meetings in the margins ofthe Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 17 November, the best offermade for the United Kingdom quota share had been a Presidencyproposal of 35.2 per cent of the total allowable catch of the sevenmain species, as against a Commission proposal of 32. 5 per cent.This allocation had been opposed by France and Denmark, but bythe end of the Council the Danes were virtually isolated.Discussion would be resumed at a further Council meeting in thenext week or two, at which he hoped to secure an improvement inthe United Kingdom figure.    Meanwhile the industry were in abetter mood and matters were moving in a direction consistentwith our national interest.The CabinetTook note.IDENTIALITY    4.

SECRETOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCft-BINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 41st Conclusions, Minute 4Wednesday 19 November 1980 at 9. 30 amSECRETTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES drewattention to the reports of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of publicexpenditure which had appeared in a number of newspapers in thefollowing days.    These reports had given detailed accounts, witha considerable degree of accuracy, of the views and positions ofparticular members of the Cabinet.   Ministers could contributehelpfully to the sort of public expenditure exercise in train anddiscuss matters with the requisite degree of frankness amongthemselves only if they could be sure that the confidence of theirproceedings would be respected.In discussion it was agreed that the disclosures to which attentionhad been drawn, which included direct quotations of what Ministershad said, could only have come, directly or indirectly, fromsomeone who was present for the discussion.    They were in directcontravention of the request made by the Prime Minister at the endof the discussion, when she had asked that comments to the Pressshould be confined to the form of words which the Cabinet hadagreed.    Such disclosures called in question the confidence andloyalty among colleagues that ought to subsist in a Cabinet and wasindispensable to the system of Cabinet government.   When theyincluded details of proposals which the Cabinet in the end decidednot to adopt, they could seriously damage the Government&apos;scredibility.   They had to stop.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itshould serve as a reminder of the need for the preservation ofconfidence of proceedings in the Cabinet, as a basis for thefrankness and openness of discussion and the loyalty amongcolleagues which were essential to Cabinet government.    She trustedthat all her colleagues would in future observe the utmost discretion,not only with the Press but also in their own departments and withjunior Ministers, about the proceedings of the Cabinet.   If this werenot done, it could become impossible to discuss sensitive mattersin Cabinet.1

SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOP I NO    Q fCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 41st Conclusions, Minute 5Wednesday 19 November 1980 at 9. 30 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequei (C(80) 72), summarising the results of the decisions onpublic expenditure reached so far in their discussions and theirimplications for the Government&apos;s economic strategy.    They alsoconsidered memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Social Services, circulated at the meeting, onpublic expenditure on the social security and health programmes.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, depending onthe Cabinet&apos;s decisions on the outstanding proposals for reductionsin the defence, social security, health and Scottish programmes,the total of planned public expenditure in 1981-82 would be between 77. 6 billion and  78. 2 billion at late 1979 prices.    This comparedwith the planning total of  76.9 billion in the last Public ExpenditureWhite Paper, Cmnd 7841, which was struck before taking credit forthe European Community refunds of  0. 7 billion which had beenagreed subsequently.The Cabinet then discussed the outstanding proposals for changesto individual programmes.ce THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Secretary of State for Defencehad now agreed with her and with the Chancellor of the Exchequerthat the Defence Budget for 1981-82 should be reduced by 200 million, subject to four conditions.    These were;i.        If the decisions taken by the Government in the lightof the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay ReviewBody entailed an increase in the Armed Forces&apos; pay billbeyond the 6 per cent which would be provided in the defencecash limit, the limit would be increased by the full amountinvolved.1SECRET
SECRETii. The prices factor for the cash limit on defencebudget expenditure other than pay would be 11 per cent, asin other cash limits, but in z ecognition of the specialconsiderations affecting price increases in this programmethe limit would be subject to review in the light of changingcircumstances.iii. The Government would confirm that it adhered toits commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationto increase defence spending in real terms by 3 per cent ayear, economic circumstances permitting, and trusted thateconomic circumstances would permit the United Kingdom toresume this rate of growth in 1982-83 and later years.iv. In accordance with agreed cash limits policy, andwith the treatment of overspending on the defence cash limitsin 1978-79 and 1979-80, any overspend on the 1980-81 defencelimit would lead to a compensating deduction from the limitfor 1981-82.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he acceptedthe cut proposed with reluctance, recognising that in the light ofpresent economic circumstances the commitment to a 3 per centincrease in real terms could not be met.    He had already made clearto the Cabinet that reductions of the order proposed, coming on topof his agreement to absorb next year any overspend on this year&apos;scash limit, would make it difficult to fulfil the Government&apos;spresent defence commitments.   In his judgment they would involvesome risk to the security of the nation.    He would now have toconsider further the implications for the defence programme of thecut in 1981-82, and he might need to bring recommendations to theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Defence Budget should bereduced by  200 million in 1981-82, subject to thefour conditions set out by the Prime Minister inher statement.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that pensions andother benefits would be uprated on 24 November by 16. 5 per cent(11.5 per cent for some short term benefits), compared with hislatest forecast for inflation over the 12 months to November 1980of 15. 5 per cent.    He recommended that this overpayment shouldbe recouped in November 1981 by uprating retirement pensions and2SECRET
all other benefits by one percentage point less than would benecessary to give full price protection.    This would in his viewbe completely compatible with the Government&apos;s pledge that overtime increases in pensions should at least keep pace with increasesin prices.   It would however mean that, if in any future year theuprating were to prove less than the increase in prices over thesame period, the Government would then be bound in practice,though not in law, to make a compensating increase at the nextuprating.   Indeed the Government had already done this inNovember 1979, when they had made good a shortfall of 1.9 per centresulting from the decisions of the Labour Government.   In so faras public sector pensions were increased in the same way and bythe same percentage amounts as retirement pensions, thisabatement should also apply to public sector pensions as appropriate.He further recommended that increases in unemployment andsickness benefits and maternity allowances should be abated byanother two percentage points to reflect the expectation thatearnings would fall behind prices in the coming year and the effectof expected indirect tax increases on alcohol and tobacco prices.The 1 per cent abatement, but not this additional 2 per cent, andsome of his other proposals for social security savings wouldrequire legislation.    The necessary provisions could be added tothe Social Security Bill which was already in the programme to giveeffect to the Employers&apos; Statu to ry Sick Pay Scheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that heagreed that it would be defensible to abate all benefits byone percentage point in November 1981 if the increase in pricesdid indeed show that there had been over-provision of that amountin the November 1980 uprating.    The calculation of this abatementwould, however, need to take account of the fact that theNovember 1980 uprating covered a period of 54 weeks. Thelegislation would undoubtedly be contested, and amendments wouldbe put down on the individual benefits, which included war pensions,war disability pensions and the whole range of benefits for thedisabled.    He strongly recommended against any additionalabatement, over and above the one percentage point, of the upratingof unemployment and sickness benefits and maternity allowances.These groups were already heavily affected by the abatement inbenefits of five percentage points this year and by the decision tophase out the earnings related supplement.In discussion it was argued that, while a 1 per cent abatement mightnot be inconsistent with the Government&apos;s pledges on retirementpensions, it would be much criticised and strongly attacked, and inthe course of the passage of the necessary legislation there wouldbe pressure to make exemptions for particular benefits. Thispressure would be expressed in the form of a series of amendments,3SECRET
SECRETsome of which could well be carried against the Government. Asthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had pointed out, it would mean thatin practice the Government would bo bound in future to compensatefor any under provision, and this could prove to be expensive.Tying upratings very precisely to the outturn of price increasescould entrench index-linking even more deeply, and make it morsdifficult to achieve the longer term aim of breaking from indexation,as was essential if the Government were to achieve full control overpublic expenditure.    On the other hand it was argued that, providedthe abatement was applied without exception to all benefits, it couldbe presented as fair and defensible action in the light of over-provision this year.   Action to compensate for an over-payment onthis occasion need not tie the Government&apos;s hands in taking actionto break with indexation in future.   In drafting the legislation, careshould be taken to keep the provision in general terms as now, andto avoid any statutory link between the uprating and the Retail PriceIndex.   Although these savings would be unpopular, they werenecessary to meet the overall objective of reducing public expenditureand the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR); and they werepreferable to the alternatives of other public expenditure cuts orincreases in taxation which would be harmful to productive investment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed on balance that legislation should betaken to provide for the increases in all benefits to be abated at thetime of the November 1981 uprating to take account of the over-pro vision, currently estimated at one percentage point, in theNovember 1980 uprating.    The Cabinet1 s attention had been drawnto the fact that the November 1980 uprating covered 54 weeks, andthe decision on the amount of the abatement should take account ofthis as appropriate.    The abatement applied to retirement pensionsshould also apply in principle, other things being equal, to publicsector pensions; the Chancellor of the Exchequer should discussthis further with the Lord President of the Council and otherMinisters concerned.    The Cabinet did not accept the proposal thatunemployment and sickness benefit and maternity allowances shouldbe abated by a further two percentage points.    This would place anunacceptable burden on families and on the unemployed at a time ofof mounting unemployment.The Cabinet -2.        Agreed that at the November 1981 upratingthe increase in all benefits should be abated asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up totake account of the over-payment in theNovember 1980 uprating.4SECRET
SECRET3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequerto ensure, in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council and other Ministers concerned, thatthis abatement was applied if and as appropriate topublic sector pensions.4. Took note that these decisions would requirelegislation, although those relating to socialsecurity benefits could be dealt with by additionsto the Social Security Bill which was alreadyincluded in the legislative programme.In discussion of further proposals for savings in the social securityprogramme the following points were made -a. It was agreed that the increase in child benefitin November 1981 should be abated by the same percentageas tax threshold increases were abated in the next Budget.b. It had long been argued that the waiting period beforeflat rate unemployment and sickness benefits were paidshould be extended beyond the present three days.   It wasagreed, however, that this change could not be made at atime when it would add to the burdens on the unemployedand poor families.c. It was agreed that the pensions earning rule, whichat present allows a person to earn up to  52 per week beforehis pension is docked, should be frozen for one year fromNovember 1981 in addition to the freeze already applying fromNovember 1980.    There was a Manifesto commitment toabolish the earnings rule during this Parliament but tofreeze it would not break that pledge.d. It was agreed not to accelerate the phasing out ofchild dependency additions to unemployment and short -termbenefits.e. It was agreed not to hold back supplementary benefitchildren&apos;s rate in order that the cash differential betweenthis and child benefit did not widen.    The majority offamilies eligible, including two-thirds of the children,received benefit because the parents were either chronicallysick or single.    The proposal would therefore hit the poorestfamilies and the argument that the present differential was adisincentive to work was largely irrelevant.   It was notedthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Social Services would consider the possibility of makingchanges in the longer term which might deal with the remainingbeneficiaries to whom the disincentive argument was relevant.
SECRETf. It was noted that it would be contrary to theGovernment&apos;s commitments either to suspend the Christmasbonus or to ignore alcohol and tobacco duties when upratingpensions.g. It was agreed that the upper earnings limit forNational Insurance contribution purposes should be set at 200 a week from April 1981 rather than the  190 a weekhitherto envisaged.    This decision would not affect publicexpenditure totals but it would reduce the PSBR by about 100 million in 1981-82.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, in so far as the changes agreed by the Cabinet requiredlegislation, the necessary provisions could be made in the SocialSecurity Bill already in the programme, and in the legislationrequired to increase the National Insurance contribution.The Cabinet -5. Agreed that the increase in child benefitin November 1981 should be abated by the samepercentage as tax threshold increases wereabated in 1981-82.6. Agreed that the pensions earnings ruleshould be frozen for a further year fromNovember 1981.7. Agreed that the upper earnings limit forNational Insurance contribution purposes shouldbe set at  200 a week from April 1981.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he recommendedthat 1 per cent should be cut from the cash limited health programmeto yield  60 million a year, with the savings being found fromimprovements in efficiency.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES recalled thatthe Cabinet had previously agreed that, rather than reduce publicexpenditure on the National Health Service (NHS), there should bean increase in the employees&apos; National Health Service contribution.The most that he could now offer by way of savings on improvedefficiency, and without damaging cuts in services, was  25 milliona year.SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the public expenditure saving on the healthprogramme should be  25 million a year as proposed, by theSecretary of State for Social Services.The Cabinet -8.        Agreed that the cash controlled healthprogramme in England should be reduced by 25 million a year from 1981-82 to 1983-84 andthat corresponding reductions should be madeunder the formula arrangements in the healthprogrammes for Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND recalled that he hadadvised the Cabinet that the most he could offer under the presentarrangements for determining Scotland&apos;s share of public expenditureon comparable services was  10 million a year.    He had now agreedwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider whether it would bepracticable within these arrangements to increase the savings to 20 million in 1982-83 and  30 million in 1983-84.    These additionalsavings could be made only if they were not inconsistent with thepresent formula arrangements.The Cabinet -9.        Agreed that, in addition to reductionsunder the formula arrangements, theScottish Office programme should be reducedby  10 million in each year from 1981-82 to1983-84 and that the Secretary of State forScotland should agree with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, whether these reductions could beincreased to  20 million in 1982-83 and 30 million in 1983-84.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that the Cabinet had nowcompleted its discussion of public expenditure in 1981-82. TheChancellor of the Exchequer would make a statement in the weekbeginning 24 November on this and other economic and financialmatters.    In the meantime it was essential that no details shouldbe revealed of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions.    The Press would be toldsimply that the Cabinet had now concluded their discussions on publicSECRET
SECRETexpenditure and that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would bemaking a statement in the following week.    The Chancellor of theExchequer would publish in the Official Report, at the same timeas his statement, details of the programmes now agreed for1981-82.   He should clear his text with Ministers responsible forprogrammes.   He should also circulate in time for discussion ifnecessary at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 27 November  a memorandumsummarising the totals for each programme in 1982-83 and 1983-84.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, v culd announce the ExternalFinancing Limits of the nationalised industries in the week beginning24 November, and sponsor Ministers should now reach agreementurgently with him on any outstanding issues.    The Secretary of Statefor the Environment should clear his statement on local authorityexpenditure with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, with Ministersresponsible for local authority expenditure in England, and with theSecretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.   In particular he shouldreach agreement with them on the question whether his statementshould reveal the Government&apos;s assumptions for expenditure onindividual services.    It was essential that these and other majorstatements, whether oral or written, should be cleared in good timewith all Ministers concerned, including the Chancellor of the Duchyof Lancaster and the Chief Whip.    The legislative programme wasalready heavily burdened and the decisions reached on socialsecurity measures would add to the pressures on the Parliamentarytimetable.    The Cabinet noted that it would be very difficult toaccommodate any further Bills without re-examining prioritieswithin the present legislative programme.The Cabinet -10. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.11. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequerto agree with spending Ministers the terms of hisstatement giving details of each programme in1981-82.12.
