CONFIDENTIA1. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the most important inter-national event in recent weeks had been the crisis in Poland. Majorconcessions had been made by the Polish Government.    But industrialunrest continued and might grow if some of the concessions provedunworkable in practice or if the authorities under Soviet pressure soughtto daw any of them back.    Little was known about the new Polishleader, Mr Kania.    The Soviet Government had no doubt been reluctantto contemplate military intervention in Poland in the wake of theAfghanistan crisis, particularly because the Polish Army could beexpected to resist.    But the danger of such intervention was by no meansover;    in Czechoslovakia in 1968 it had occurred after a considerablelapse of time.    Britain&apos;s public stance was that current events inPoland were an internal matter for the Poles alone.    More dramaticwarnings against Soviet intervention might be necessary if it becameclear that military preparations (which could not be concealed) wereafoot, but would be counter-productive as things now stood. Difficultproblems would arise over the Western response to Poland&apos;s need foreconomic assistance.    The West Germans and Americans were alreadyindicating readiness to help.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatdevelopments in Poland were of exceptional significance. Sovietinterests seemed certain to suffer severely whatever happened. Anyconsideration of British economic help to Poland would have to take intoaccount the fact that the Export Credits Guarantee   Department was alreadymore exposed there than in any other country, and the very largesubsidy currently involved in building ships in Britain for the Polishmerchant navy.    There were also conflicting political arguments abouthow far Poland should or should not have to rely on Soviet resources.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the coup d&apos;etat in Turkey on12 September had probably been inevitable.    The political system had :failed to cope with the mounting daily toll of political murders and hadbeen unable for five months to elect a President.    Another recentsymptom had been the forced resignation of the Foreign Minister.Against this background there was little disposition among Turkey&apos;siallies to condemn the military takeover.    Ministers of the EuropeanCommunity, meeting in Political Co-operation on 15 September, hadavoided condemnation and agreed to continue economic aid.    But itremained uncertain whether the new regime would be able to restore thecountry&apos;s economic health, or even to suppress terrorism.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that dangerous situations weredeveloping in Lebanon, on the Palistinian West Bank and on the Iraq-Iran border.    The situation in Syria was complicated by the agreementannounced on union with Libya, which was expected to prove a deadletter unless the Libyan Government were prepared to transferresources on a larger scale than seemed likely.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the British Embassy in Tehran hadbeen closed for the time being because of the risk of ho stage-taking andbecause the Embassy had been prevented from carrying out its normalfunctions eg in relation to the four British subjects recently arrested inIran.    There had been some slight signs of progress over the Americanhostages.    But the prospects were obscure, not least because of theincreasing fragmentation  of Iranian political life.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the fighting in Afghanistan continuedwith little apparent change in the situation.    A Soviet soldier who haddefected to the United States Embassy in Kabul and been interrogatedwith the help of a Russian-speaking member of the British Embassy,believed that the Soviet forces were gaining the upper hand but hadsuffered 12-15, 000 fatal casualties.    In fact, their casualties wereprobably much lower, with 2-3, 000 dead and about 5, 000 wounded.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that it was still far from clear what wouldhappen in the case of Mr Tekere, the Government Minister facing acharge of murder, who appeared to be guilty although he had in errorkilled the wrong man.    Armed clashes had occurred betweensupporters of the Prime Minister, Mr Mugabe, and those of his mainrival, Mr Nkomo.    It was disturbing that some former guerrillas nowbeing dispersed from their Assembly Points were reported to be beingallowed to retain their arms.    On balance, however, the British HighCommissioner remained reasonably confident about the future.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that somepolitical embarrassment might be involved if legislation at Westminsterproved necessary as a result of current political and constitutionaldifficulties in Canada.    Past precedents, eg involving Australia, mightoffer some guidance.CONFIDENTIAL2
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet  &gt;Took note.2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL, reporting on the meeting of the Councilof Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 15-16 September, said that owing toFrench intransigence, especially over access for sugar and beef, it hadonly been possible to agree upon an unsatisfactory mandate for thenegotiation over Zimbabwe&apos;s accession to the Lome Convention. TheCommission had Said that they would prefer to start negotiations on thisbasis rather than have no mandate at all.    He had therefore given hisagreement but had firmly registered the United Kingdom&apos;s view that theterms being offered to Zimbabwe were inadequate and that we expectedthe matter to come back to the Council.    We had to be careful not toundermine the Commission&apos;s negotiating position but he had sent asuitably worded message to the Zimbabwe Government encouraging themto enter into negotiations with a view to eventually reaching a satisfactorysettlement.    It was clear that Zimbabwe would not join the LomeConvention without an adequate quota for sugar such as it had enjoyedunder the former Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.Some progress had been made in agreeing upon the type of programmewhich would be assisted under the arrangements to reduce our netcontribution to the Community budget, but no agreement had been reachedon the procedure by which the programmes would be approved. Wefavoured a consultative procedure with the member states while Francewas asking that the programmes should require the unanimous approvalof the member states.    A compromise had been proposed under whichthe programmes would be approved unless a majority of member stateswas against them.    There were indications that the French wanted towithhold their agreement to the budget regulations to put pressure on usover the fisheries negotiations.    We were not willing to accept a linkeither with fisheries or with next year&apos;s agricultural price fixing.These questions would be discussed further at the Anglo-French Summitmeeting on 19 September.The Council had not been able to agree upon financial aid to Portugal. Ithad been decided that, because of her exceptional situation, theCommunity would offer Portugal financial help prior to her accession.The Portuguese and the Commission had suggested amounts which wereunacceptably high.    During the Council meeting, the LuxembourgPresidency had suggested a figure of 275 million units of account (mua)of which 125 mua would be in the form of aid and 150 mua in the form ofloans from the European Investment Bank (EIB), but the Portuguese hadindicated that this was inadequate.    Neither we nor the French hadaccepted these figures.    We particularly wished to see a higher3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALproportion given in the form of loans.    This would now be consideredby the Governors of the EIB.    The Council would be under pressure totake a decision at its next meeting in view of the impending Presidentialelections in Portugal.The Lord Privy Seal also reported that the French were makingdifficulties over the negotiations with New Zealand and other suppliersof sheepmeat to the Community market and over the arrangements forimports of New Zealand butter.    In the latter case, the French hadsought to overturn a decision which had been taken by the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) in July.    Commissioner Gunctelach, followingtalks in Paris, was now optimistic that the outstanding questions onsheepmeat could be settled at the Agriculture Council later in the monthand that agreement could be reached on arrangements for New Zealandbutter imports in 1980.In a brief discussion it was noted that these questions would be pursuedat the forthcoming Anglo-French Summit.    It was of vital importance toour own producers that the Community sheepmeat arrangements shouldcome into operation in October.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that we hadbeen obliged to change our requirements for the language qualificationsfor European doctors and nurses practising in the United Kingdom sincethe Law Officers had advised that they would probably be found tocontravene the provisions of the Treaty of Rome if a case were taken tothe European Court.    We were now attaching the language requirementto the conditions of service for work in the National Health Service.The practical consequences of the change would not be serious, but it waslikely to provoke public criticism of the Community.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
3.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that itnow seemed probable that the Transport and General Workers Union(TGWU) would withdraw their threat of a national dock strike overredundancies in the Port of Liverpool.    The employers had agreed withthe TGWU that the redundant workers should not be placed on theTemporary Unattached Register which would continue   to be used onlyunder the terms of the 1972 Aldington*Jones agreement.    They had alsooffered improved severance arrangements.    As a result the MerseyDocks and Harbour Company (MDHC) would have to take on thoseredundant workers who did not accept severance terms and they wouldthen have up to 800 men surplus to their requirements.    They hadagreed to do this in response to an assurance that the costs of taking onthese workers would be taken into account by the Government in thecurrent review of their financial position.    At some later stage, if asuitable opportunity arose, he would wish to put forward proposals forthe repeal of the Dockworkers Regulation Act 1976.THE MINISTER OF TRANSPORT said that he would put forwardproposals later on the financing of the MDHC.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, with the agreement of the Secretaryof State for Wales, he had announced on 17 September that the Govern-ment would withdraw its plans to share Welsh language programmesbetween two television channels.    Instead the programmes would, foran experimental period of three years, be broadcast on one channel, ashad been proposed in the Party Manifesto,    He still thought that theprevious plans were preferable but he had agreed to change them inresponse to representations, put to him by Lord Cledwyn and others, ofthe views of informed and responsible opinion in Wales.    The changewould have the advantages of avoiding a likely defeat in the House ofLords during the Committee Stage of the Broadcasting Bill and ofpersuading Mr Gwynfor Evans, the leader of Plaid Cymru, to withdrawhis threat to fast to death.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that he had made clearto the Press that the change had been made in response not to violencebut to moderate opinion following very wide consultations in Wales.This had been generally well received.    Further work would benecessary to ensure that the arrangements for financing the new servicewere adequate.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -2.      Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the increases inthe money supply reported for July and August were largely attributableto the removal of the &quot;corset&quot; arrangements introduced by the lastGovernment:    The underlying rate of monetary growth was neverthelessabove the target range, and it Was crucial to the credibility of theGovernment&apos;s economic policies that it should be brought back on course.At the same time private sector manufacturing firms were underformidable pressure, and were complaining of high exchange andinterest rates and of the continuing high level of public expenditure.There were however limitations to the possibilities for action to reducethe exchange rate.    Its present level was largely a function of North Seaoil revenues, of high interest rates and of confidence in theGovernment&apos;s policies.    Moreover a strong pound was helpful inreducing the rate of inflation.    There were difficulties, too, in bringingdown interest rates, which in part reflected high interest rates world-wide.    Any premature reduction, in advance of improved monetaryprospects, could make problems worse and require more painful stepsto get back on course.    The recent decision to sell more index-linkedsavings certificates (&quot;Granny Bonds&quot;) should attract additional savingsfrom the personal sector and so be helpful to the prospects of reducinginterest rates.    He could not yet say however when interest rates wouldcome down and, in the meantime, it was important not to encouragespeculation over the timing and size of any decrease.If the money supply targets were to be met, and interest rates broughtdown, it would be essential to keep control of the Central GovernmentBorrowing Requirement (CGBR) and the Public Sector BorrowingRequirement (PSBR), and for the markets to be convinced that this washappening.    In part the present underlying rate of the monetary growthreflected the high level of Government borrowing in the first part of theyear - in the first five months the CGBR had been  7 billion comparedwith  9. 3 billion forecast for the whole year; and in the first threemonths the PSBR had been  4. 5 billion against  8. 5 billion forecast forthe year.    To an extent the figures represented a seasonal element inthe pattern of borrowing and a number of major receipts of revenuewere due in the second half of the year.    It nevertheless remainedessential to look for all possible savings in the current year whereprospective overruns of expenditure by the nationalised industriesrepresented a particular problem.    For 1981-82 to 1983-84 it wasessential to achieve the objective of containing public expenditurewithin the net totals in the last Public Expenditure White Paper,6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENT!,Cmnd 7841, as reduced by the European Community settlement. TheCabinet would be considering these matters in the following month.Reaching the objective and accommodating any additional bids whichmight be put forward would necessitate making at least the net cutsproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in the summer and he couldnot exclude the possibility of a need to ask colleagues to go further thanthis.    It was also crucial to control public sector pay and to bring itinto line with the much more modest expectations now apparent in theprivate sector.    Otherwise painful cuts in public expenditureprogrammes would in effect be financing excessive public sector pay.In discussion the following points were made -a. While the present high interest rates were undoubtedly oneof the factors constraining the private sector, for manycompanies increases in their interest costs were insignificant bycomparison with increases in their wage costs.b. The administrative and clerical staff of the NationalHealth Service had traditionally based their pay claims oncomparisons with analogous Civil Service grades.    For thisyear however they had now accepted a settlement below that forthose analogues and within the cash limit applying to theNational Health Service.    This was a significant developmentwhich should serve as a good precedent for other public sectorsettlements.    It showed that the Government&apos;s determinedefforts to reduce expectations in the public sector werebeginning to bear fruit.The Cabinet -3.      Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that hewould announce later in the day his proposals for dealing with over-e spending in 1980-81 by local authorities in England and Wales.    In thelight of the revised budgets submitted to him, and with allowance forprobable shortfall, he had assumed that they might be overspent byaround  200 million by the end of 1980-81.    He proposed to adjust thesums payable under the first Increase Order in respect of the 1980-818&apos; Rate Support Grant accordingly on the understanding that the sumsdeducted might be reinstated at the second Increase Order in the light ofactual expenditure performance.    This action was indiscriminatebetween authorities but it had the advantage of giving them everyincentive to meet their targets.    He was also taking action to reduce thegrants available to a number of high-rating authorities.    In addition to7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthese measures, which had bton approved by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy, he proposed to publish the figures foreach authority rather than, as previously, to give national totals.This would undoubtedly cause a storm but would have the advantage ofshowing clearly which authorities were overspending.    In general theperformance of the Conservative-controlled authorities compared wellwith others and he was confident that the majority of them would end theyear on target, though some of them would be shown to be overspendingconsiderably.    The latest returns of manpower reductions in the localauthorities were highly encouraging     The reduction of 29, 000 in thelast year was the highest annual drop ever and a reduction of 12, 000 inthe last quarter would be probably exceeded in the coming quarter.The Cabinet -4.      Took note.4.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President ofthe Council (C(80) 53) seeking a decision on whether the United Kingdomshould challenge in the European Court of Justice a CommissionDirective, adopted under Article 90(3) of the Treaty of Rome, aimed atbringing greater transparency into the financial relations between themember states and their public undertakings.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a decision wasurgent because, if we wanted to challenge the Directive, we would haveto institute proceedings no later than 22 September to meet the two-month deadline prescribed in Article 173 of the Treaty. Draftpleadings had been prepared on a contingency basis.    The Directiveenabled the Commission to examine the financial relations betweenmember states and their public sector undertakings in order to assesswhether any national aids or subsidies had been granted contrary to theprovisions of the Treaty.    Its adoption had created a conflict, which theSub-Committee on European Questions of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee had been unable to resolve, between our industrial andcommercial interest in supporting a measure which could help toimprove our industries&apos; competitiveness and our constitutional and legalinterest in seeing that the Commission did not gain power at the expenseof the Council of Ministers.    The case against a challenge centred onthe fact that, since the Government&apos;s relations with the public sectorwere already much more transparent than was the case in other memberstate 8, we had nothing to lose and much to gain from letting theCommission probe into the hidden subsidies provided by France andItaly in particular.    There was no prospect of the Council takingsimilar action itself because France and Italy would veto it.    The casefor a challenge turned essentially on the argument that it was contrary8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto our broader interest to acquiesce in an extension of the Commission&apos;spowers at the expense of the Council.    The Solicitor General hadadvised that we had a substantial and respectable case to put before theCourt and that we had a good fighting chance of succeeding.    Since thediscussion in the Ministerial Sub-Committee on European Questions ithad become clear that both France and Italy intended to challenge theDirective themselves.    It was therefore open to us to take no action,leaving the Italians and French to bring the issue to the Court; tointervene later in their actions, in which event the terms of our inter-vention would to a large extent be dictated by the pleadings of the partiesto the case; or to mount a direct challenge ourselves before22 September.    He invited the Cabinet to decide which of these coursesbest accorded with our national interest.In discussion it was argued that we should find it hard to explain to ourindustries, who were much concerned about the unfair competition theysuffered as a result of concealed subsidies granted by other memberstates, why we were seeking to prevent the Commission investigatingthe very practices which harmed their commercial prospects.    It wouldbe all the more quixotic for the United Kingdom to take issue with theCommission on a Directive which helped us now that it was clear that itwould be challenged anyway by Italy and France.    We could have thebest of both worlds in allowing them to make the running, which wouldensure that the legal case was tested, while at the same time gainingpolitical advantage with our industry and agriculture.    The substanceof the Directive as it stood would benefit our industry, while therelative openness of our system meant that we would have much less tofear than other member states from any future extension of its scope.It was in any event difficult to envisage any areas in which theimplementation of the Directive or any likely extension of it would affectus adversely in practice.On the other hand, it was argued that the Directive raised long-termconstitutional and political issues which should outweigh any short-termadvantage the Directive might bring to our industry.    The implicationsof the Directive went far wider than its questionable vires, for if it wentunchecked it would mean that the Commission would have the power tomake law, not just to police it, without being subject to a Council vetoor the need to consult the European Parliament, in all areas affectingpublic undertakings.    Moreover Article 90, on which the Directive wasbased, did not refer to state aids alone: it applied to all the rules of theTreaty.    The Directive would thus seriously prejudice the existinginstitutional balance in the Community, while the extension of theCommission&apos;s powers in this field would be seen in this country as afurther erosion of the authority of Parliament and the Government.There would be criticism if we let the matter pass unchallenged whileParliament was in Recess.    Moreover, we could not be sure eitherthat the French and Italians would mount an effective case against the9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALDirective or that it would not be amended or extended in future in waysthat would be inimical to our interests.    It should not be too difficult toconvince our industry that it was in their long-term interests as well asthe Government&apos;s for the Commission&apos;s powers to be tested in the Court.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thepreponderant opinion in the Cabinet was that we should not let theDirective go unchallenged and that it would be unwise to leave the Frenchand Italians to take the issue to the Court on grounds of their choosing.The Cabinet -Invited the Solicitor General, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, to arrange for the United Kingdomto institute proceedings against the Directive in theEuropean Court of Justice under Article 173 of theTreaty of Rome before 22 September.Cabinet Office18 September 198010CONFIDENTIAL
