CONFIDENTIALCONFIDENTIAL1.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat the Opposition had complained that the announcement to theHouse of Commons of the Government&apos;s attitude to public servicespay had been made by means of a Written Answer by the PrimeMinister in the previous week and not by an oral statement. Theyhad now made a formal request that there Should be an oral state-ment on the implications of the decision that afternoon.    If thisrequest was refused, they were likely to launch a vigorous attackon the Government&apos;s refusal during Prime Minister&apos;s Questions andmight seek to obstruct business for the rest of the day.In discussion, it was noted that the Prime Minister&apos;s WrittenAnswer had been interpreted in some quarters as the imposition ofa 6 per cent limit on all public service pay settlements.    An oralstatement would provide the opportunity to make clear that the figure of6 per cent was related not to pay settlements as such but only to thepay factor in the cash limit for the Rate Support Grant (RSG); thatthe Government was concerned only with cash limits and not withpay settlements as such; and that the statement that cash limits forthe public services (not the public sector) would be determined&quot;broadly within the same financial disciplines&quot; did not necessarilymean identical figures, given that local authorities were in a positionto finance increases of more than 6 per cent within the RSG cashlimit either by reducing manpower or by increasing rates.    On theother hand, it would not necessarily be helpful to create theimpression that settlements in other public services could run tofigures significantly higher than 6 per cent.   All the relevant pointsabout the application of the pay element in cash limits had alreadybeen explained, and it seemed best for Ministers to say as littlefurther as possible at this stage.    The Opposition had alreadyraised the matter during Prime Minister&apos;s Questions and could havedone so during Questions to the Secretary of State for the EnvironmentThey could not now reasonably complain that the House had beengiven no opportunity to discuss the matter.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet noted that there might be renewed protestsfrom the Opposition if their demand for an oral statement on cashlimits and pay was rejected.    Any attempt to disrupt Governmentbusiness at this point of the Session would have no lasting effect, andthe Cabinet agreed that no further statement should be made.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that no oral statement on cash limits andpay settlements in the public sector should be made thatafternoon.1
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the House ofLords attached considerable importance to prorogation being carriedout in an orderly and dignified manner.    He hoped tha.t discussionsthrough the usual channels would result in business in the House ofCommons being concluded not later than 11. 30 pm that evening, withprorogation immediately afterwards.    This was acceptable. If,however, business in the House of Commons was delayed beyond thenbecause of opposition obstruction or by insistence on separate debateson the two codes of practice on picketing and the closed shop, itwould be very undesirable for prorogation to take place in the earlyhours of the following morning.    In that event, it would be preferablefor prorogation to be postponed until 9.30 am the next day, ratherthan risk antagonising members of the House of Lords at the end of along and difficult Session.In discussion, it was pointed out that a single Member of the Houseof Commons could successfully object to the two codes of practicebeing considered together.    If so, the second debate might well notend until after 1. 00 am on Friday, 14 November.    Members of theHouse of Commons would be present for a division at the end ofbusiness, but few were likely to attend the House at short notice thefollowing day; moreover, if the House had to meet again en Friday,14 November, the Opposition would have a further opportunity to raisepoints of order and to suggest other procedural devices to embarrassthe Government.    There was therefore a strong argument forproroguing at the end of business in the House of Commons, even ifthis was in the early hours of Friday morning.    On the other hand, theHouse of Lords debate on the Codes of Practice would probably end atabout 8. 00 pm: prorogation in the House of Lords in the early hours oithe morning would therefore be very sparsely attended, and there wasa danger that the performance of the traditional ceremony ofprorogation in a virtually empty House would expose Parliament toridicule.THE PRB*E MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, despite the inconvenience it might cause to theHouse of Lords, it was preferable for prorogation to take placeimmediately after the conclusion of that day&apos;s business in the Houseof Commons.    Prorogation should not be postponed until a separatesitting the following day unless it became clear that it would otherwisehave to take place at a manifestly unreasonable hour on Fridaymorning.    The Lord President of the Council should review theposition, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand the Chief Whip, later that afternoon, when it should be possible tomake a more accurate assessment of the likely timetable for businessin the House of Commons.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -2. Agreed that it was preferable for Parliamentto be prorogued at the end ef that day&apos;s businessin the House of Commons,3. Invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and the Chief Whip, to review the positionlater that afternoon and report their conclusions tothe Prime Minister.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the South African Foreign Minister, Mr R F Botha, had calledboth on the Prime Minister and on himself the previous day. Hehad appeared alarmingly ignorant about the Namibian negotiations,we well as obdurate on a number of key points involved. Stepswould be taken to brief the Foreign Ministers of France and theFederal Republic of Germany, whom Mr Botha might also beseeing shortly; they would need to keep up the pressure on him, to adopt a more realistic approach.3.        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) all member states except France had agreed toarrangements for continued access for butter which would have beenacceptable to the New Zealand Government,    On the suggestion ofthe Germans he had asked for the problem to be referred to theforthcoming meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs)where there might be a better chance of a satisfactory solution.4CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thefollow-up conference on security and co-operation in Europe hadnow opened in Madrid.    Despite nine weeks preparatory work therewas still no agreement on the agenda.    Western countries wereinsisting that after the opening statements there should be a reviewof the implementation of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act,which would of course cover issues such as Afghanistan and humanrights.    The Russians were opposed to this.    They wished insteadto concentrate on the submission and discussion of new proposals,which would offer scope for a Soviet propaganda barrage on suchtopics as disarmament.    There were signs that they would not nowgreatly mind the conference collapsing; they were perhapsbecoming disenchanted with detente because of the problems it wascausing them in Eastern Europe.    In the event of collapse, therewas some danger that public opinion might blame the West. Itwould on the whole be in Western interests for the conference tocontinue, but it was not vital.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthere had been intensive discussions at official level and bilateralcontacts, including a further meeting with the French Ministerresponsible for fisheries, in preparation for the meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Fisheries) on 17-18 November.    There nowseemed prospects of an agreement on quotas which, while fallingshort of the demands of the British fishing industry, would in factprovide them with greater fishing opportunities than they had everenjoyed in the past and would represent an improvement on theterms offered to the previous Government.    The French had nowagreed that the question of access should be discussed togetherwith quotas, and there seemed the chance of reaching reasonablearrangements.    The leaders of the fishing industry had suggestedthat negotiations should be taken to the level of Heads of Government,but he hoped that he had persuaded them that, given the electoralposition of President Giscard and the particular interest whichChancellor Schmidt took in fishery questions, this was unlikely tobe in British interests.In a brief discussion it was suggested that, in seeking accessarrangements for Scotland and other areas in the North, the specialproblems of local fishermen in the West Country should not beoverlooked.    On the other hand the importance to the major fishingports of an early settlement was stressed.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the hunger strike involving seven Republican terrorists in theMaze prison was now in its third week.    The strikers were in separatecells and were accepting only water and some salt.    Outside theprison, demonstrations in their support were occurring almost dailythroughout the Province, but so far these were peaceful and werebeing well handled by the police.    There had been some favourabledevelopments in terms of public relations, including a brave andmoderate speech by Mr Gerry Fitt in the House of Commons on10 November.    One other prisoner in the Maze was on hunger strike,and indeed had been for over sixty days.    Unless he was talcing foodsurreptitiously he might well die soen;  but his case was not a focusfor public interest or sympathy.    Unlike the others, he was on strikebecause he claimed to have been wrongfully convicted, not becauseof issues of prison status.The Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the mine-workers&apos; leaders and the National Coal Board (NCB) had reachedagreement on a pay settlement to run to 1 November 1981 whichrepresented, at an annualised rate, a little less than 10 per cent onbasic pay and around 12 to 13 per cent on earnings.    The executiveof the National Union of Mine worker s (NUM) would now put theproposed settlement to a ballot of the union membership with arecommendation that it be accepted.    The result of the ballot shouldbe available early in December.    While the balloting procedureswere going on, the NCB were anxious that publicity should not begiven to the increase on the basic rates and that attention should beconcentrated on the higher figures for earnings.    If this could bedone, they judged that there was a good chance of the minersaccepting the settlement by a sizeable majority.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatin view of the explanation given by the Secretary of State for Energyit was incumbent on all members of the Government to refrain fromcomment on the agreement reached on miners&apos; pay until the ballotwas over.    The general line should be that pay was a matter for6CONFIDENTIAL5,        THE HOME SECRETARY said that the dispute with thePrison Officers&apos; Association seemed to be evolving satisfactorily.They were not easy to negotiate with, because of internal divisionsand vacillation.    They were no longer forcefully pies sing theirclaim in relation to meal breaks or their demand for arbitration ohthat issue.    Negotiations now centred on a new duty system.    It waspossible that satisfactory agreement would be reached the followingweek, but there were still problems over the effects of the new system.,given that less overtime work was likely to be needed in the future.It was important not to compromise the prospects of a satisfactoryoutcome by being in too much hurry.    The number of prisoners inpolice cells had not risen, as had been feared.    The total numbersof the prison population had fallen by about 3, 000 in recent weeks:it was not clear why. but the development was a welcome one, whichhad long been sought on wider grounds.    Thanks to first-classco-operation by the Armed Forces, the emergency prison atFrankland was running very well and arrangements for the use ofcertain army camps were also proceeding smoothly.    It had nototherwise been necessary for him to make use of his new emergencypowers, except over not producing in court prisoners who were beingheld on remand.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.
CONFIDENTIALnegotiation between the NCB and the NUM.    This need not,however, inhibit the Government from explaining privately to othernationalised industry employers the nature of the deal reached andin particular the size of (he increase in basic rates so as to enablethem better to resist claims as high as 13 per cent on grounds ofparity.The Cabinet -2.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE HOME SECRETARY said that prespects were uncertain inthe pay dispute between firemen and local authorities.    The firemenwere bitter at the breachirig of their agreement with their employers&apos;and, unlike in 1977, they enjoyed a wide measure of public supportincluding that of the fire officers, the Trades Union Congress (TUC)and a number of the Government&apos;s own Parliamentary supporters*The local authorities were divided.    Some were in the mood tosettle with the firemen at figures well above the 6 per cent now onoffer.    If any local authorities did break ranks id this way, manyLabour-controlled councils could be expected to follow suit. Therepresentatives of the Association of County Councils, on themanagement side, were minded not to reopen negotiations before thefire brigades&apos; unions&apos; delegates&apos; conference met on 21 November.The absence of talks before then could exacerbate the dispute*Meanwhile, industrial action short of an all-out strike was takingplace, and plans were being laid to mount a series of one-day strikes,if the delegate conference approved this action.    The CivilContingencies Unit would be meeting at Ministerial level later thatday, to consider plans for providing a skeleton fire service if thefiremen withdrew emergency cover.    These would involve deployingtroops to man fire appliances held by Home Departments for civildefence purposes.   An immediate decision to shorten servicemen&apos;snotice was likely to be needed.    It would also be necessary toconsider drawing on Ministry of Defence resources to ensure thatenough civil defence appliances were made roadworthy in time. Theprovision of contingency cover would be an expensive and oneroustask, particularly in the face of scattered one-day strikes at uncertainintervals.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the ArmedForces would co-operate fully in these preparations, although therewas beginning to be some sign in the Army of concern lest their rolemight appear to be being extended from that of maintaining essentialservices in an emergency to that of strike-breaking. Unlessservicemen&apos;s notice were shortened, fourteen days would be neededto complete preparations; the training problem would be more serious7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthan in 1977, because fire officers were unlikely to co-operate.As many as 20,000 troops might be involved, compared with only1, 500 in the prisons dispute.    This would seriously strain militaryresources.    It was in any case undesirable for too large a numberof servicemen to be involved at any one time in duties arising out ofindustrial disputes.In a brief discussion the following main points were made:-a. It was open to the local authorities to reconcile apay settlement higher than 6 per cent with a cash limitby reducing levels of manning.    There was, by commonconsent, plenty of room for savings which could financea settlement more satisfactory to the firemen.b. Firemen&apos;s pay was only a small item in localauthority budgets, and therefore only marginal inrelation to the 6 per cent cash limit.    Last year it hadproved perfectly possible for local authorities to reacha settlement, in accordance with their agreement withthe firemen, in excess of 20 per cent, while holding to ageneral cash limit of 13 per cent,c. It would be important to encourage the employersto talk with the fire brigades unions before the delegateconference met on 21 November.   The firemen expectedthis, and the local authorities clearly had enough roomfor manoeuvre to negotiate within their cash limit andthrough seeking greater efficiency.    In the absence of talks,attitudes would harden, and prolonged industrial troublecould ensue,0 particularly as the techniques being adoptedby the firemen for the conduct of their dispute would costthem little while placing the community at large at risk ofserious accidents.d. On the other hand it would be difficult to press thelocal authorities to enter into talks without risking a misinter-pretation of the Government&apos;s position.    It was important notto give the local authorities any ground for complaining thatthe Government, having set the 6 per cent cash limit, andthus (as they saw it) put them in the front line, were nowwithdrawing support.    It would also be helpful to conveymore generally the point that the Government acknowledgedand regretted the necessity for the breach of the firemen&apos;spay agreement, but that present economic conditionsinevitably meant that expectations had to accommodate toreality, not just in the fire service.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said mat theCabinet agreed on the importance of the local authority employersand the fire brigade&apos;s union entering into talks about the pay claimand related matters in good time before the fire brigades&apos;conference on 21 November.The Cabinet -3.      Invited the Home Secretary to convey theGovernment&apos;s view on these matters to the firemen&apos;semployers.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on pay factors and cash limits (C(80) 70); they alsohad before them his two earlier memoranda on Cash Limits(C(80) 60 and 65).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had beeninvited to circulate a further memorandum to Cabinet on theimplications of the decisions taken at their previous meeting forthose cash limits not yet set and for the timing of any announcements.The most urgent need was to set specific cash limits applicable touniversity technicians and university teachers, whose pay negotiationswere already in train, and for the National Health Service (NHS)where negotiations on the pay of ancillary workers would beginshortly.    In addition, decisions were required on the questions ofstaging and overhang discussed in his memorandum (C(80) 65) andon the figure to be used for planning purposes in the preparation ofnext year&apos;s Estimates in respect of Civil Service pav. Herecommended mat the figure of 6 per cent should be used to set thepay cash limits on the grants to universities1 and on the NHS and,for planning purposes, in the preparation of next year&apos;s Estimates.No decision was yet needed on the actual pay cash limit to be appliedto the Civil Service.    It would also be very helpful if decisionscould now be taken on the outstanding questions on staging andoverhang so that an early announcement could be made about this.The cash limits to be set for the Armed Forces would be discussedseparately in the general context of the defence programme.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals madeby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, except as they affected the cashlimit for the NHS.    On this it was pointed out that the unionsconcerned would delay negotiations about the pay of NHS ancillaryworkers until they had a clear idea of the likely outcome of thenegotiations on the pay of local authority manual workers; and thesein their turn might be delayed pending the outcome of the negotiationson the pay of manual workers in the water industry.    In this situationit would make sense to defer a final decision on the cash limit to beapplied to the NHS for the time being.In further discussion the following additional points were made:-a.      The three Review Bodie s dealing with the pay of theArmed Forces, the doctors and dentists and top salarieswere working on their reports due next spring.    It hadalready been agreed that Ministers would need to give powerfuland convincing evidence to the Review Bodies in order toinfluence their Reports.    Decisions on precisely whatevidence should be given and by whom would need to be takensoon and should be referred for collective consideration.10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. A unit monitoring public sector pay issues had beenestablished in the Treasury and the Ministers primarilyconcerned had met to exchange views.   The Chancellorof the Exchequer would be considering further whether,and if so, how, these arrangements could be strengthened.c. It was noted that there were pay claims currently atarbitration with settlement dates in the last pay roundwhich would have to be dealt with on their merits when theawards were known.    The Chancellor&apos;s proposals inparagraph 4 of C(80) 65 would provide the framework withinwhich they should be considered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposals set out in paragraph 8 of C(80) 70,save that they wished to delay a final decision on the cash limit tobe applied to the NHS until more information was available aboutthe likely outcome of related pay negotiations in other areas. Theyalso welcomed the intention of the Chancellor of the Exchequer toconsider improvements in the existing arrangements for keepingMinisters in touch with developments on public sector pay issues.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the pay figure for the cash limits onuniversity grant, affecting university technicians anduniversity teachers, should be set at 6 per cent.2. Agreed that a figure of 6 per cent should forplanning purposes be assumed as the pay factor forcash limits for the public services (including the CivilService) in the preparation of next year&apos;s Estimates.3. Agreed that decisions on pay factor in cash limitsfor the NHS and for the Civil Service should be deferreduntil they were needed for operational purposes.4. Agreed that the problems of past staging andoverhang should be dealt with as proposed in C(80) 65and paragraph 7 of C(80) 70,11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recordedseparately.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at the meetingarranged for Wednesday 19 November.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department and the Secretary of State for Foreignand Commonwealth Affairs (C(80)66)about the renewal by the UnitedKingdom of their acceptance of the optional clauses of the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the United Kingdom had ratifiedthe European Convention on Human Rights in 1951, and in 1966 hadaccepted the optional clauses of the Convention providing for theright of individual petition to the European Commission of HumanRights and the acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of theEuropean Court of Human Rights.    That acceptance had beenrenewed periodically, most recently for a period of five years endingin January 1981.    The Commission and the Court were increasinglyplacing unexpected and embarrassing interpretations on the provisionsof the Convention when individual cases came before them. Thiswas evident, for example, in cases about the interception ofcommunications and penal treatment, and future developments mightseriously affect the basis of military discipline.    The actions ofthe Commission and the Court were tending to limit the freedom ofaction of the United Kingdom Parliament and judiciary and the timemight come when a judgment was so damaging to the Government asto be unacceptable.    For these reasons he did not recommend that theUnited Kingdom should renew its acceptance of the optional clausesfor an indefinite period.    There were, however, strong argumentsfor renewal for a further period of five years.    This course wasconsistent with the United Kingdom&apos;s long-standing commitment tohuman rights.    Failure to renew would be criticised as incompatiblewith the Manifesto commitment to discuss a possible Bill of Rights,while in Northern Ireland it might be seen as an implicit admissionthat arrangements there breached the Convention. Internationally,this country would lose a tactical advantage in relations withCommunist bloc and other countries infringing human rights and it12CONFIDENTIAL7, The Cabinet continued their consideration of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,(C(80) 64) proposing changes in public expenditure programmes, apda memorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C(80) 62) onpublic expenditure in Scotland.
CONFIDENTIALwould become more difficult to defend non-ratification of corres-ponding provisions in the United Nations Convenant on Civil andPolitical Rights.    Of the twenty European States who were partiesto the Convention, fourteen, including all members of the EuropeanCommunity (EC) except France, had accepted the right of individualpetition, and seventeen, including all EC members, had acceptedthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.    They would be criticalof a decision not to renew, particularly if this were taken duringthe Madrid Conference.    On the other hand, only a minority of thecountries party to the Convention had accepted the clauses for anindefinite period and some were known to share the United Kingdom&apos;smisgivings about the way in which provisions of the Convention werenow being interpreted.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the validity of the misgivings that had beenexpressed about the interpretation placed in some recent cases onparticular provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights,but agreed with the judgment of the Home Secretary and the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary that the arguments, both domestic andinternational, for renewal of acceptance of the optional clauses ofthe Convention outweighed the arguments against doing so.The Cabinet - * v&apos;1. Agreed that the United Kingdom&apos;s acceptance ofArticles 25 and 46 of the European Convention on HumanRights should be renewed for a further period of fiveyear 8 from January 1981.2.

SECRETPROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCCPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 40th Conclusions, Minute 7Thursday 13 November 1980 at 9.30 amThe Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,(C(80) 64) proposing changes in public expenditure programmes;they also considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer, circulated at the meeting, on the social security programmeand on public sector pensions; and a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C(80) 62) on public expenditure in Scotland,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE E XCHEQUER said that the total plannedpublic expenditure for 1981-82 published in the White Paper (Cmnd 7841)was  76.9 billion at late 1979 prices.    If the European Communityrefunds were deducted, that target became   76.2 billion.    With theincreases accepted since July and the reductions already agreed by theCabinet, and if the outstanding proposals for reductions totalling 0.8 billion in the Defence, Scottish Office and Social Securityprogrammes were all accepted,  he estimated that the total would nowbe  77.6 billion.The Cabinet then discussed the outstanding proposals for changes toindividual programmes.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she and the Secretary of State forDefence had met the Chiefs of Staff, at their request, on 12 Novemberto discuss the proposals for further reductions in the Defence Budget.The Chiefs of Staff had made clear that in their professional judgmentthe country&apos;s defence commitments should not be reduced and therewas no scope for reductions of expenditure if those commitments wereto be maintained.    They recognised that consideration of the DefenceBudget could not be divorced from the economic difficulties now facingthe country, and that it was for Ministers to judge whether reductionswere necessary for economic reasons.    If there were to be suchreductions, it would not in the view of the Chiefs of Staff be possibleto hold to present defence commitments; they would have to advisefurther if it was to be decided that the commitments must be reduced*She would now consider with the Secretary of State for Defence andwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer what reductions in the DefenceBudget should be recommended to Cabinet.1SECRET
SECRETThe Cabinet -1. Agreed to discuss the Defence Budgetfurther at their meeting on 19 November.2SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had agreedwith the Secretary of State for Social Services on savings from theproposed move to monthly payments of child benefit, following thestudy under Sir Derek Rayner, and to a Z per cent cut on cashcontrolled expenditure, mainly affecting administration expenses.The outstanding issue for consideration was whether there shouldbe any abatement of the uprating of social security benefits due inNovember 1981.After discussion, a record of which is being held by the Secretaryof the Cabinet,The Cabinet -2. Agreed to the savings following fromthe proposed shift to monthly payments of childbenefit and to a 2 per cent cut in the cashcontrolled social security programme.3. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Social Servicesto consider and report for their next meeting on -a. the possibility and coverage of anabatement in the November 1981 upratingof social security benefits other thanretirement pensions, and the argumentsfor and against such an abatement;b. the scope for a reduction of thecash controlled health programme.4. Agreed to resume consideration of thecase for a measure of general de-indexation ofpay, pensions and benefits and of tax allowances,after the report of the Scott Committee on publicsector pension arrangements had been received.
SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he recommendedthat the employees&apos; national insurance contributions should beincreased by one percentage point, to yield  1 billion to the benefitof the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) (though with no effecton the public expenditure totals).    There would be three parts tothis increase:i. 0. 25 per cent would come in the normal course ofthe annual review of the level of national insurancecontributions and would be necessary to offset a deficit of 250 million which would otherwise arise in the NationalInsurance Fund;ii. the employees&apos; National Health Service contributionwould be increased by a further 0.25 per cent following theCabinet&apos;s discussion of the health programme on4 November;iii. the Treasury Supplement to the Fund would bereduced so as to save  500 million, and the balance wouldbe restored by a further 0. 5 per cent increase in employees&apos;contri buti on s.The second and third of these changes would require legislation.To give employers the usual time to change pay-roll and othersystemsi a Bill would have to be introduced as soon as the newSession started and to receive Royal Assent by very early in theNew Year.    In his judgment this course was better than thealternative of raising even more by way of extra taxation.    It didnot, however, offset the savings which he had sought from thesocial security programme.   It was necessary in addition to thosesavings in order to reduce the prospective PSBR for 1981-82.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed to the proposals put forward by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.The Cabinet -5. Agreed that the employees&apos; NationalInsurance contribution in 1981-82 should beraised by 1 per cent as proposed by theChancellor of toe Exciisquor.6. Invited the Secretary of State for SocialServices, in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to put urgent recommendationson the primary legislation necessary to securethese changes to the Legislation Committee.3SECRET
THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, reported that he had agreedwith the Secretary of State for Education and Science that the totalreductions in the education programme in 1982-83 and 1983-84should be  211 million and  191 million respectively.The Cabinet -7.        Took note, with approval, of the reductionsagreed for the education programme of  211 millionin 1982-83 and  191 miUion in 1983-84.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Secretaryof State for Scotland had agreed to the formula cuts based on thereductions accepted by other Departments.    There remained thequestion whether a further specific cut of about  90 million shouldbe made on the grounds that the Scottish share of public expenditureon comparable services was much larger than was justified byrelative need, as indicated by the Needs Assessment Study (NAS).The proposed reduction of  90 million compared with the advantageof  300 million identified by the NAS.    He recognised thepolitical difficulties which would arise in Scotland from implementingthis cut.    On the other hand it had to be recognised that there wereareas of England, particularly in the North, which regardedthemselves as at a marked disadvantage by comparison with thebenefits now flowing to Scotland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he couldnot accept that a  90 million cut should be imposed on Scotland, ontop of the formula cuts which he had accepted in line with thosebeing applied generally.    The NAS was out of date and of doubtfulvalidity; it should not be used as a basis for cuts.    Since 1978,Scotland&apos;s share of public expenditure on comparable services hadbeen determined by a Treasury formula and, with the Treasury1 sagreement, he had explained this to the Select Committee onScottish Affairs as recently as last July.    To abandon the arrangementnow, only eighteen months after the referendum which had led to thewithdrawal of the devolution proposals, would destroy the Government&apos;scredibility in Scotland.    The most he could offer within the presentframework would be a saving of about  10 million a year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Committee reluctantly accepted the political arguments putforward by the Secretary of State for Scotland against the proposedcut of  90 million.    The Secretary of State should, however,consider further what savings he might offer in his health and otherprogrammes in addition to the  10 million which he had now accepted.4SECRETSECRET
SECRETThe Cabinet -8. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of theirdiscussion.9. Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland,in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to consider further what savings he might offer inaddition to the  10 million further reduction whichhe had offered, and to report in time for theirdiscussion on 19 November.THE SECPETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that he hadaccepted his share of the formula cuts based on the proposals forother Departments, but he needed additional provision of 20 million in 1982-83 and in 1983-84 for factory buildings in areasaffected by steel closures.   As it was, increased provision hadbeen made to deal with the consequences of steel closures in1980-81 and 1981-82 but not in the later years, when the programmefell by 40 per cent.    This was unrealistic at a time whenunemployment was rising and further major closures were coming.He was attracting substantial increased private capital for projectsbut unless he were now given increased public expenditure provisionit would be necessary for him to bid for it later.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY , said that he could notaccept additional bids at a time when it was proving impossible tomake the full public expenditure reductions which were necessary.If the Secretary of State for Wales needed extra provision for hisindustrial programme he should find it from elsewhere within hisbudget.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet could not accept the Secretary of State forWales&apos; proposal for additional provision.    If it later provednecessary for him to bid for additional funds, the case could beconsidered then.IThe Cabinet -10.       Agreed that no additional provision couldbe made for the programme of the Welsh Office.11.        Took note that the Secretary of State for Walesmight need to bid for additional provision at a laterstage should that prove necessary.SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would resume theiidiscussion of public expenditure at their meeting on 19 November,when they would consider the Defence budget, the possibilities forfurther savings on social security benefits, the health programme,and the Scottish Office.    In view of the failure to achieve the fullsavings proposed by the Treasury, they would also need to considerfurther the External Financing Limits of the nationalised industrieswhich, on present proposals endorsed by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy, would lead to additionalprovision of  157 million.    In preparation for this meeting theChancellor of the Exchequer should circulate a memorandumsummarising the totals now agreed for each of the three yearsj.981-82 to 1983-84 and indicating the implications for theGovernment&apos;s economic strategy.The Cabinet -12.
