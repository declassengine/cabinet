CONFIDENTIALLIAMENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theAIRS House of Commons in the week beginning 12 January 1981.rtmental THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that thect Cabinet noted that the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education,mittees Science and the Arts (Mr Christopher Price MP) was likely to move aMotion on Friday 16 January in pursuit of his campaign for internalious departmental documents to be made available to Select Committees,rence: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be seeing both0) 7th Mr Price and the Chairman of the Liaison Committeeelusions, (Mr Edward du Cann MP), and would use his best endeavours to avoidte 1 the issue becoming a matter of major political controversy. TheCabinet agreed that there could be no question of a concession on thedisclosure of confidential advice given to Ministers by officials, whichcould have serious consequences for the administration of publicbusiness, and that, if Mr Price moved such a motion, steps would haveto be taken to ensure that it was defeated.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval.2.Took note.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that it hadalways been intended that the British Nationality Bill would beintroduced into the House of Commons early in January 1981. TheOpposition had repeatedly argued that the Bill was a major constitutional1CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that in theabsence of the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, theSecretary of State for Scotland had agreed to make a statement thatafternoon on the outcome of the abortive negotiations on the commonfisheries policy in Brussels.    The Secretary of State for NorthernIreland would be making a statement the following day on the situationcreated by the continuing hunger strike by certain prisoners inNorthern Ireland; to avoid further encroachment on the time availablefor the adjournment debates on that day, it would be preferable forthe Minister of Agriculture not to make his intended oral statementon the current Council of Agricultural Ministers.The Cabinet -
CONFIDENTIALmeasure, and should consequently be taken at all stages on the Floorof the House.    Although the precedents were not entirely clear,the Government believed that the Bill did not raise fundamentalconstitutional issues, and need not therefore be taken on the Floor ofthe House, a course which would gravely disrupt the rest of thelegislative programme.    A possible way out of this dilemma had beenoffered during questions on the Business Statement the previous week,when the Shadow Leader of the House had suggested that the Billmight be referred to one of the experimental special standingcommittees.    The Home Secretary was in principle prepared forthe Bill to be handled in this way but at Legislation Committee theprevious day the Minister of State, Home Office, had been unwillingto agree that the Bill should be published before the Christmas Recessso as to offset at least part of the 28 days which would be devoted tothe evidence-taking Sessions under the new procedure, on the groundsthat further consideration of the draft Bill was necessary before itwas in a fit state for introduction.    If the Bill were not published untilafter the Christmas Recess, and then taken under the special standingcommittee procedure, it could not in practice reach the House ofLords until the end of June.    That would mean that its CommitteeStage in the Lords would have to be taken in an extended spilloverperiod, and the advice of the Lord President had been that in thesecircumstar.ees there would be a significant possibility that the Billwould be lost for the present Session.    The view of both the Commonsand the Lords business managers at Legislation Committee hadtherefore been that in order to be reasonably confident that the Billcould be passed in the current Session, it had to be introduced beforeChristmas, with the object of sending it to a special standingcommittee after its Second Reading early in the New Year. TheCommittee had accordingly agreed that printing of the Bill shouldproceed with a view to its introduction, subject to the approval of theCabinet, on Friday 19 December.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT saidthat, although he was willing to consider any means for facilitatingthe passage of the British Nationality Bill, there were very seriouspolitical and procedural objections to advancing its publication in theway proposed by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Aconsiderable part of the Bill had been in print for less than a week, andthere was a great deal of detailed work still to be done on the presentdraft.    Matters of substance were still under consideration betweenthe Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary needed a reasonable time toprepare the ground overseas for the publication of the Bill,particularly in Hong Kong, Gibraltar, and the Falkland Islands. Ifthe Bill were to be published in its present state, there was no doubtthat it would contain a number of more or less serious mistakes andthat up to 40 Government amendments would be required during its2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpassage through Parliament.    The Government&apos;s credibility would&quot;suffer and the likely reaction to the more controversial parts of theBill, both in the United Kingdom and overseas, would be moreextreme than it would be with a more orderly approach topublication.    He was confident that a properly considered Bill couldbe ready for introduction in accordance with the original timetablesoon after the Christmas Recess, but was not prepared to acceptany responsibility for the consequences for the despatch of theGovernment&apos;s business in Parliament or for the Government&apos;scredibility of publishing the Bill before the Christmas Recess.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, said that he agreed thatthe political arguments against publication of the Bill in its existingstate were decisive.    On the other hand, it had to be accepted that,if there were insufficient time available for consideration of the Billin the House of Lords, it could well be lost.    If the Bill wereintroduced in the Lords by the Whitsun Recess, it would probably havea good chance of receiving Royal Assent by the end of July. Failingthat, introduction by 10 June at the latest should enable the Lords totake the Committee Stage before the Summer Recess, leaving theremaining stages to be taken in a relatively short spillover period.He would be very pessimistic about the Bill&apos;s chances of becominglaw that Session if it reached the House of Lords after 10 June.In discussion, it was pointed out that it was doubtful whether theOpposition were in a position to guarantee that Committee Stage couldbe completed to a voluntary timetable in exchange for the use of thespecial standing committee procedure.    In these circumstances, itmight be preferable for the Government to use its majority to committhe Bill to an ordinary standing committee, and, if necessary, tointroduce a timetable motion to ensure that the Bill was sent to theHouse of Lords not later than 10 June.    The use of the specialstanding committee procedure could be resisted on the grounds thatthe Government had indicated that the procedure would not be used forBills which were likely to be controversial as between the politicalparties.    The Criminal Attempts Bill could appropriately be selectedfor the procedure.    In theory, the Government could defer the BritishNationality Bill, or introduce it and take it no further than SecondReading in the present Session; but reform of the existing nationalitylaws, which was a Manifesto commitment, was long overdue. TheBill had already been postponed once, and further deferment would beseen as a major climbdown on the part of the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there were very &quot;strong objections to publishingthe British Nationality Bill before the Christmas Recess in a formwhich was known to be defective.    It should therefore be introducedinto the House of Commons as early as possible in January,    For the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALreasons outlined in discussion, it would be inappropriate to refer theBill to a special standing committee, and the Opposition case fortaking the Bill at all stages on the Floor of the House was a weak pnerthe arguments for regarding it as a constitutional measure werespecious.    The Government should therefore use their majority afterSecond Reading to ensure that the Bill was sent to a normal standingcommittee.    A timetable motion should be introduced if necessary toensure that the Bill was sent to the House of Lords not later than10 June 1981.The Cabinet -3. Agreed that the British Nationality Bill shouldnot be introduced in the House of Commons beforethe Christmas Recess.4. Invited the Home Secretary to circulate arevised draft of the Bill to Legislation Committeewith a view to its introduction in the week beginning12 January.5. Agreed that the British Nationality Bill shouldnot be referred to a Special Standing Committee ofthe House of Commons and that the CriminalAttempts Bill should be so referred.6. Invited the Chancellor of the-Duchy ofLancaster, in consultation with the Chief Whip,to make the appropriate arrangements to ensurethat the British Nationality Bill was referred to astanding committee after its Second Reading inthe House of Commons, and for a timetable motionif that became necessary to ensure that the Bill wassent to the House of Lords not later than 10 June.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THET OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thtcommemoration ceremony at Gdansk on 16th December had beenremarkable in that it had brought together on one platformrepresentatives of the Polish Government, die Roman Catholic Churchand the trade union Solidarity.    But the situation was still on a knife-edge.    The Soviet Union was now in a position to intervene militarilywhenever it wished, and could probably maintain that postureindefinitely.    The Polish Government were therefore on trial.Intervention during the Christmas holiday period could not be excluded.Adequate Western economic assistance to Poland remained animportant factor, which was to be discussed further in the Defenceand Oversea Policy Committee that afternoon.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therehad been a successful two day meeting of the North Atlantic Councilthe previous week.   A robust communique on the Polish crisis hadbeen agreed, but this would not stop individual member governmentsadopting a weaker attitude as they came to consider what counter-measures should be taken in the event of Soviet intervention.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMr. Obote&apos;s victory in the Ugandan elections had not been unexpected.A team of observers from the Commonwealth, including Britain, hadconcluded that there had been a valid electoral exercise; that whilesome cheating had occurred this had not been on a scale to alter theoverall outcome; and that the counting of votes had not been seriouslymanipulated.    Mr Obote had therefore to be accepted as the newPresident of Uganda, and a British message of goodwill would be sentto him in suitable terms.    It was not yet clear whether he would proveto have learnt from the mistakes which had led to the overthrow of hisearlier Presidency.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at theUnited Nations in New York the preparatory talks on the proposedGlebal Negotiations had been suspended until January.    The UnitedStates had taken a notably firm line, while the developing countrieshad been unwilling to compromise on their demands.    There had beenno disunity among the members of the European Community.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSecretary of State for Defence, who was currently in Canada on avisit to defence facilities used by British forces, would be takingadvantage of this opportunity to talk to the Canadian Prime Minister,Mr Trudeau, about the difficulties likely to arise at Westminsterif the Canadian Government&apos;s reque st for the patriation of theCanadian Constitution were received in the form currently envisaged.The Parliamentary Select Committee on Foreign Affairs wasexpected to report in the near future mat Mr Trudeau&apos;s presentproposals were ultra vires.    The Select Committee&apos;s Report wouldreflect in the main the views of Mr Trudeau&apos;s opponents, because theCanadian Government had taken no steps to put their side of the storyand it was clearly not the British Government&apos;s business to do so.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) on 15-16 December had reached agreement on theoffer to sell to Poland at favourable prices, foodstuffs from inter-vention stocks including 100, 000 tons of barley from the United Kingdom,The Minister of State for Trade had also  secured the Council&apos;sagreement to a new Community initiative with the United States onexports of textiles and the energy price differential.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, at a meeting ofthe Council of Ministers (Ecofin) on 15 December, the Community hadagreed to further improvements in the mandate which might offer somechance of agreement in the forthcoming discussions in the Organisationfor Economic Co-operation and Development to renew the export creditconsensus.    The Council had also agreed on the terms for restructuringaid to Italy following the recent earthquake.    He had proposed that theEcofin Council should consider a limitation en agriculture expenditurebefore the Agriculture Council discussed next year&apos;s prices. Itwould be for the Dutch Presidency to follow up this suggestion.CONFIDENTIAL
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he and theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had attended a long andfrustrating meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) which had;ended without agreement.    Good progress had been made during theearlier part of the meeting, and quota allocations had been proposedwhich would have given the United Kingdom slightly over 36 per centof the total for the main species.    The related question of access hadalso been discussed and the prospects of an overall agreement had atone stage appeared good.    They had explained the likely terms indetail to the leaders of the industry, who were present in Brusselsthroughout the discussions, and they had all indicated their readinessto give public endorsement to a settlement if one could be reached onthe basis that at that stage seemed likely to be available. Subsequentlyhowever, the French had indicated, at first in bilateral discussionsand then more generally, that they were unwilling to agree to morethan a short extension of the present derogation on access and then onlyon condition that the historic rights enjoyed by France were preserved.The Presidency and the Commission had prepared a possible comprom-ise package.    As drafted, this would not have given us adequateassurances on access and in presenting their proposals the Presidencyand the Commission had acknowledged that they were deficient in thisrespect.    Negotiations were, however, broken off and the compromisewithdrawn when the French, clearly acting on instructions from Paris,had insisted upon their legal right to free access up to the beachesfrom 1 January 1983, and had been prepared to contemplate only minorderogations.    By adopting this position the French had isolatedthemselves.    While it was expected that the Council would resumein January, no date for a further meeting had been fixed.    It seemedlikely that the French now intended to link fisheries questions withagricultural prices and perhaps other issues with a view to a packagesettlement at the time of the next European Council.In a brief discussion it was noted that the Director General of theBritish Fishing Industry had publicly confirmed that the deal wouldhave been acceptable to the industry.    Having originally been stronglyopposed to linking fisheries with other issues, and kaving more recentlywondered whether a linkage might be to their advantage, the industrywould now probably be suspicious of the latest French tactics. TheFrench Prime Minister had recently made it clear to the LordPresident that the French were determined to link a number of issueswith the forthcoming discussions on reform of the Common AgriculturalPolicy.    It might be that the French had, at a late stage, decided toput the fisheries negotiations into this category.    The Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary would have the opportunity on 19 December totake the question up with the French Foreign Minister.    It was notclear that such tactics would be in the French interest: it wouldenable the United Kingdom to make a linkage with next year&apos;sagricultural prices in a way which was unlikely to be in the Frenchinterest.    It was the French who, at the time of the budget negotiationsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALleading up to the 30 May agreement, had insisted on the fisheriesnegotiations being completed by the end of this year.    During theearlier negotiations on quotas, the United Kingdom had beenparticularly helpful to the French.    There could be advantage in someof these points being made in a message from the Prime Minister tothe President of France.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETSECRET4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the hunger strike by seven Republican prisoners in the&quot;Maze Prison wasnowin its 53rd day.    Other more recent strikerswere not yet in a serious condition, and a hunger strike by sixLoyalist prisoners had just been abandoned.    But the seven, whileremaining conscious and for the most part lucid, had all probablyreached the stage where their long-term health would be damagedeven if they abandoned the strike; and one of them had becomealmost totally blind, because of vitamin deficiency damage to theoptic nerve, but was refusing medical treatment.    A decision to movethem to hospital was expected soon and would be taken purely onmedical advice.    If the strike persisted the first death wouldprobably occur in about a week.    The strikers had not altered theirdemands and there had been no negotiations with them. Theauthorities had nevertheless kept their ear to the ground, and it hadseemed at one moment that the strikers were ready to climb down ifa suitable &apos;ladder&quot; could be provided; but this had turned out not tobe the case.    There were many would-be intermediaries, but nonehad proved able to move the strikers.    All seven were toughcharacters, and there was a real prospect that one and perhaps all ofthem would die.    The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)would then seek to exploit public emotion.    The security authoritieswere well prepared, but widespread rioting and bloodshed would belikely.    The body of any striker who died would have to be handedover to his relatives after the inquest, and a large public funeralwould no doubt then be held.    The PIRA campaign of bombing andshooting, which had been restrained during the strike in order not toalienate sympathy, would be resumed in Northern Ireland and perhapsalso in Great Britain.    The Government&apos;s attitude must continue to bethat political status for the prisoners was impossible, but that theprison regime was a humane one and improvements to it were notruled out.    He himself would be making a further television appealshortly, in which he would once more carefully explain theprivileges for which prisoners who abandoned their protest would beeligible.    Even if this did not sway the seven strikers, it shouldhelp to reduce public sympathy for them.    Encouragingly, opinionin the Province seemed to have accepted that political status couldnot and would not be granted.In the course of discussion it was noted that the presentation of theGovernment&apos;s case was a key factor.    Domestic Press comment wasbecoming increasingly favourable.    But with the overseas Press aspecial effort would be needed to counter the inevitable PIRApropaganda.    This would involve in particular the Central Office ofInformation;  British Information Services New York, who had mosteffectively projected a recent visit by Conservative backbenchersconcerned with Northern Irish affairs; and the authorities in Belfast,who were well placed to influence the local correspondents of foreign9
SECRETnewspapers.    It would be helpful both at home and abroad if publicitycould be focussed on the victims of the violent crimes for which thehunger strikers had been sentenced.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had made clear to the hunger strikers the advantagesthey would gain if they gave up their protest, but could not preventthem dying if they were determined to do so.    Any deaths would havea major impact on public opinion, particularly during the Christmasseason; and the Cabinet would wish to offer the Secretary of State, forNorthern Irelandfull support in the difficult situation which wouldarise.    The Government&apos;s case would need to be carefully presentednot only in Northern Ireland but also in Britain and abroad.    It wasencouraging that there was no international pressure in favour ofpolitical status.The Cabinet -Took note.10SECRET
CONFIDENTIAL11CONFIDENTIAL5. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Cabinethad agreed at their meeting on 11 December that the targets for totalCivil Service manpower at 1 April 1981 and 1 April 1982 should be695, 000 and 685, 000 respectively.    Ministers had now submittedrevised manpower estimates to the Civil Service Department, butthe aggregate bid&apos;s were still too high by 1,000 in April 1981 and 5, 500in April 1982.    To meet the timetable for the preparation of theEstimates, Departmental manpower figures had to be agreed by5 January.    There was not time for a further round of Ministerialbilateral discussions*    He proposed therefore that he should now havediscretion to amend Departmental bids, so as to remove theremaining excess over the targets.    He would do this for theApril 1981 figures by making a pro rata reduction on the manpowerbids Of those Departments which had not revised their estimatessufficiently.    For April 1982 he would be more selective indistributing the &quot;reductions, by taking account of known possibilitiesfor manpower reduction, such as those arising from the recentscrutiny of the methods of payment of benefit to the unemployed.In discussion it was suggested that the regular publication on aquarterly basis of the forecast and actual staffing figures ofindividual Departments was unnecessary and misleading.    It was theoverall totals, and the end-of-year figures, which were of particularsignificance to the Government&apos;s aims.    On the other hand, it wasnoted that the local authorities were required by statute to publishmanpower figures on a quarterly basis, and this had proved asalutary discipline.    The Government could not be seen to be lessrigorous in its own controls than in those it imposed on other bodies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theachievement of manpower reductions, towards the target of no more than630, 000 by April 1984, was essential to the credibility of theGovernment&apos;s policies.    The overall total should not be allowed torise in any quarter.    The Cabinet were agreed that the Lord Presidentshould now have discretion*.raubject to such discussion at official levelas might be possible in the time available, to adjust the manpower bidsfrom Departments in the manner he had proposed so as to providefigures for Departmental Estimates compatible with the overall targetsagreed for 1 April 1981 and 1 April 1982.
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -Invited the Lord President of the Councilto amehd Departmental manpower Estimatesso as to achieve figures compatible withtotals of 695, 000 civil servants at 1 April 1981,and 685, 000 at 1 April 1982, to circulate therevised figures to Ministers in charge ofDepartments, and to submit them to theTreasury by 5 January, for incorporation inthe Estimates.Cabinet Office18 December 198012CONFIDENTIAL
