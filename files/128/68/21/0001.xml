CONFIDENTIALLIAMENTARYA.IRS1. The Cabinet were informed cf the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.nents.ng and Rateort Grantiousrence:iO) 39thlusions,te 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that heintended to make a statement in the House of Commons on Monday15 December covering a number of controversial matters of housingpolicy.    On Tuesday 16 December he would make a statement aboutthe Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement in England for 1981-82. Hewould try to keep both statements as short as possible.    With oneexception, announcements about the RSG settlement had always beenmade in the past by written reply, but in view of the presentParliamentary sensitivity on this subject, and the fact that 1981-82would be the first year in which the block grant arrangements hadapplied, he had agreed with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthat a departure from precedent would be justified.    He would makeit clear in the statement that in future years the Government intendedto revert to the existing practice of making announcements about theRSG settlement in written answers.    It was the more important todo this since, under the new arrangements, if an oral statement wasmade on the English settlement, similar oral statements for Walesand Scotland became virtually unavoidable: in other words, it wasa matter not of one statement but of three separate statements.This year the Secretary of State for Wales would be making acombined statement on housing and the RSG settlement in Wales onTuesday 16 December, and the Secretary of State for Scotland wouldmake a statement on the Scottish RSG settlement en Wednesday17 December.    He and other Ministers in his Department would bebriefing Government supporters and the Press on the effect of theEnglish settlement and its underlying policy implications, includingthe relevant policy assumptions for different local governmentservices.    He would also be arranging for colleagues to receiveappropriate background information about the effect of the settlementon local authorities in their constituencies.Jwlees Repert iousrence:42ndlusions, te 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT saidthat the Yellowlee s Report on the medical examination of immigrantswas to be published on 15 December.   The report contained statementswhich were potentially explosive in both domestic and Commonwealthterms if taken out of their medical context.    He had prepared a draftstatement in consultation with the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Secretary of State for Social Services which he hadhoped to make by way of a written reply.    The Opposition had at firstappeared to accept this approach but their spokesman was now pressingfor an oral statement.    If he refused to make one, there was a dangerthat the considerable number of backbenchers on both sides of theHouse who had strong, though conflicting, views on racial issues,would accuse the Government of attempting to suppress the report.He might therefore have to make an oral statement on Monday15 December.    If so, he would try to discourage hasty over-reactionto the report. ,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that an early announce-ment of the Government&apos;s intention not to renew existing textile quotaswas essential.    He was prepared to give a written reply, but thebusiness managers considered that, because of the sensitivity of theHouse of Commons on matters affecting the textile industry, it would bepreferable for the statement to be made crawly.    It would have to bemade or. either Monday 15 or Tuesday 16 December.In discussion it was pointed out that two important and controversialstatements on the RSG settlement in England and on housing and the RSGsettlement in Wales had to be made on Tuesday 16 December. Iffurther oral statements were made that day, statements and the lengthyquestions that followed would take so long that the Government would bein grave danger of being unable to carry the supply estimates, with theconsequent loss of a whole day&apos;s business.    It would therefore bepreferable for any necessary statements on steel and textiles to be madeon Monday 15 December, though this would inevitably curtail the timeavailable for Private Members&apos; Motions.    It would be extremely difficultto find time on that day for a fourth statement, on the YellowleesReport, and it might well be necessary to revert to the Government&apos;soriginal intention of dealing with the matter by means of a written reply.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that oral statements on housing in &quot;England andon textiles should be made on Monday 15 December; on the RSG2CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the Chairmanof the British Steel Corporation (BSC) would be holding statutoryconsultations with the steel unions that day, and would be presenting thecorporate plan for BSC to his Board the following day.    If approved, theplan would be submitted to the Government immediately after the Boardmeeting, which would be followed by a Press conference held by theChairman.    Although the Government had no advance warning of whatwas likely to be contained in the plan, there had already been a greatdeal of speculation, particularly in &quot;Wales, and a Private NoticeQuestion (since disallowed) had already been tabled for answer thatafternoon.    The Government could expect to come under strong pressureto make a statement in the House of Commons at the beginning of thefollowing week.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that hewould need to make a statement on fisheries policy on Wednesday17 December.    Depending on the outcome of the meeting of the Councilof Agricultural Ministers which had been arranged in Brussels forThursday 18 December, he might need to make a further statement onagriculture on Friday 19-December.
CONFIDENTIALsettlement in England and on housing and the RSG settlement in Waleson Tuesday 16 December;  on fisheries and on the RSG Settlement inScotland on Wednesday 17 December; and, suoject to developments inthe Council of Ministers, on agriculture on Friday 19 December. Itwas unreasonable to expect the Government to give considered reactionsto the BSC&apos;s corporate plan at such short notice, but the Secretary ofState for Industry should be ready to make a statement or to answer aPrivate Notice Question on the subject on Monday 15 December. Thecongestion of statements on Monday 15 and Tuesday 16 December meantthat it would be virtually impossible to fit in a statement on theYellowlees Report; the Home Secretary and the Chief WMp should renewtheir efforts to secure the Opposition&apos;s concurrence to a Written Answeroa Monday 15 December.    Even without a statement on the YellowleesReport, there was likely to be substantial curtailment of the timeavailable for Private Members&apos; Motions on Monday 15 December. Itwould be unreasonable for the Opposition to complain about this whenthey continued to press for a large number of statements on varioussubjects, but the Chief Whip should be prepared to offer to move aprocedural resolution extending Private Members&apos; time to 8. 00 pm onthat day and subsequent business by one hour.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the timetable for oral statementsin the following week as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.2. Invited the Ministers concerned, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theChief Whip, to make arrangements accordingly.3. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Chief Whip, to use his best endeavours toobtain the concurrence of the Opposition to bisannouncing the publication of the Yellowlees Reportin a Written Answer.4. Invited the Chief Whip, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to offer to theOpposition the possibility of extending the timeavailable for Private Members&apos; Motions by one houron Monday 15 December, and to&apos;arrange if necessaryfor the tabling of the appropriate proceduralresolution.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatfollowing the debate on Parliamentary pay, pensions and allowances inthe House of Commons on 21 July, he had circulated a factualmemorandum to all Members of Parliament setting out the financialimplications of implementing the Motions that had then been passed.He was now committed to putting down further Motions, in the light ofthe reaction to this document, on linkages between the pay of Membersof Parliament and other public service groups, the accrual rate forpensions, and the level of pensionable pay.    He had discussed theseissues with leading representatives of the three main parties in theHouse of Commons, and had secured their agreement to theGovernment&apos;s proposals on linkage and accrual.    The Motions wouldprovide for linkage to be considered further by a Select Committee, onthe basis of quinquennial independent reviews, with the use of a basketof comparators in intermediate years.    Those he had consulted agreedthat the l/40ths accrual rate proposed in the Motion of 21 July wasunreasonable, and that an acceptable compromise would be to retainthe l/60ths rate originally proposed but to offer Members the opportunityto buy added years by instalments over a five-vear period.    The proposalto base pensions on the actual figure of  13, 150 rather than on the notional |salary figure of  13, 750.recommended by the Top Salaries Review Body(TSRB) had     attracted strong opposition from the Labour Party and nosupport from the Liberal Party representatives, although represen-tatives of the 1922 Committee were prepared to acquiesce in the lowerfigure.    He intended to table an unamendable resolution providing forthe use of  13,150 as the pensionable base.    He would make every effortin consultation with the Chief Whip to ensure that this Motion wascarried, but 57 of the Government&apos;s own supporters had voted for theMotion adopted on 21 July, and it was impossible to say what the likelyoutcome of the free vote on a future occasion would be.    If the Motionwas defeated, the Government would have to accept the will of the Houseon Members&apos; pensionable pay.    In that event, he proposed to make clearthat, as the Cabinet had already agreed, the pensionable basis for all thepublic sector groups concerned would also have to be aligned with theTSRB salary recommendations.    The debate would now take place asearly as possible in the New Year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatalthough the immediate cost of using a notional salary basis for thepensions of all the groups covered by the TSRB was relatively small(about Slf million in the first year), the psychological effect of treatingfinancially privileged groups in this way could be very damaging. Itwould wrongly imply an intention to move towards the full TSRB salaryrecommendations in the course of the next year, and would be totally atvariance with the efforts being made to hold the pay element in the cashlimits for the public sector to 6 per cent.    It was irresponsible forMembers of Parliament to be Seen to be seeking privileged treatment inpresent economic circumstances, and every effort should be made toCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALensure that the Motions proposed by the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster were carried.   All members of the Government and theirParliamentary Private Secretaries should vote for the Motions, and theChief Whip should endeavour to ensure that as many as possible of theGovernment&apos;s other supporters also voted in favour.The Cabinet -5. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterto table Motions on linkage, accrual, and pensionablerates of pay on the lines which he had proposed fordebate after the Christmas Recess.6. Invited the Chief Whip to make arrangementsto ensure that all members of the &quot;Government andtheir Parliamentary Private Secretaries, and as manyas possible of the Government&apos;s other supporters inthe House of Commons, voted in favour of theseMotions.5CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as envisaged inthe Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion of the cost of Parliament, he hadattended a meeting of the House of Commons Commission.    He hadhoped to be able to persuade the Commission to seek the assistance ofthe Treasury in the formulation and imposition-of cash limits on theirexpenditure and the help of the Civil Service Department in the controlof manpower.    He had found, as the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster had indicated during the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, thatthe House of Commons Commission were not receptive to Governmentadvice.    They were not prepared to take up his suggestions and did notappear to attach sufficient importance to the effective control of theexpenditure for which they were responsible.The Cabinet -7.      Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that Portugal had suffered aserious loss in the death of her Prime Minister, Dr Sa Carneiro, in anair crash.    He had been the main driving force in the presentGovernment, whose position had been further weakened by the ease withwhich President Eanes had been re-elected for a second term againsttheir strong opposition.    The continuance of a democratic system inPortugal was not yet assured; and it was to be hoped thatDr Sa Carneiro1 s party, the Social Democrats, would be able to find anadequate leader to take his place.CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the situation inside Poland appearedsomewhat calmer, but the danger of Soviet intervention remained. TheWarsaw Pact summit meeting in Moscow had in effect put Poland onprobation, as was clear from the attendance there of Ministersresponsible for defence and internal security.    The Russians appearedto have completed their military precautions and to be in a position tointervene at any time.    Intelligence indicators might still provide theWest with 24 to 48 hours&apos; warning of such a move, but there would beless warning if military action were initially based on forces which werealready in Poland, eg on manoeuvres.    Four United States airbornewarning and control system aircraft were being deployed to WestGermany.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had the previousday discussed the situation with his colleagues among Britain&apos;s NATOallies; they seemed to feel that the Western reaction to Soviet interven-tion at present envisaged would be inadequate, particularly in theeconomic field, but some of them might well in the event find it difficultto go much further.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that tension between Jordan and Syria hadbeen further reduced.    There was no sign of an end to the war betweenIraq and Iran, where military stalemate persisted.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had visited Dublin on 8 December,accompanied by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland, for a routine bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister of theIrish Republic, Mr Haughey, and other Irish Ministers.    In accordance
CONFIDENTIAL with precedent a joint communique had been issued after the meeting,and she had not (despite some pressure to the contrary) made any state-ment in Parliament.    In the present case theie was nothing to add to thecommunique.    The proposed joint studies with the Irish Governmentwould examine economic and other areas in which it might be possible toachieve greater co-operation between the United Kingdom and theRepublic and thus incr&lt; ase mutual understanding.    The reference to thepossibility of new institutional structures was not directed to relationsbetween Dublin and Belfast, where there was no intention of revivingideas eg for a Council of Ireland, but to relations between Dublin andLondon, where it might be possible to draw on models provided by Franceand Germany or by Belgium and Luxembourg.    It was satisfactory thattl e communique recorded Mr Haughey&apos;s concurrence in the hope that theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland&apos;s statement of 4 December wouldprovide a basis for ending the hunger strike and other protest action inthe Maze Prison.    Mr Haughey had regrettably not been willing tocondemn the hunger strike in public, but he had made clear in privatethat he did so; he had not sought to argue that the strikers&apos; demand forpolitical status should be met; and he had accepted that there was nothingmore the British authorities could offer them.    It was against this back-ground that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had subsequentlyarranged for a senior official of the Northern Ireland Office to visit thehunger strikers in order to explain to them in detail the conditions whichwere already on offer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that theseven men on hunger strike were still strong enough to walk and had beenassembled in a single room by the Governor of the prison.    His officialhad then taken them through his statement of 4 December, making quiteclear that the purpose of the visit was to explain rather than tonegotiate.    It was perhaps encouraging that the prisoners had asked manydetailed questions about the available conditions as described in thestatement.    Copies of the statement had been sent to the next-of-kin ofthe hunger strikers and of all other prisoners taking protest action. Itwas clear that those who were organising public support for the strikerswere disappointed by the paucity of the response.    Public opinion hadprobably been influenced against the strikers&apos; cause by the shooting ofan innocent woman bystander and three policemen in an ambush inStraban on 9 December, which had given rise to a protest march inBelfast.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that much wasat stake.    The ending of the hunger strike and other protest action byprisoners would be a major achievement.    If efforts to this end failed,serious violence might well erupt and the co-operation of the Republicin cross-Border security matters could be jeopardised.    A situation ofsuch difficulty called for maximum discretion in public statements.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY reported that a satisfactoryagreement had been reached at the recent Ministerial meeting of theInternational Energy Agency (IEA) which shovud help to calm the worldoil markets.    It had been useful to secure the support of Japan, andprobably the new United States Administration as well as the present one,for a concerted effort by the members of IE A to seek to moderate energyprices.    While some farther rise in both official and spot prices for oilwas to be expected, it was to be hoped that this would do no more thanreflect inflation rates.The CabinetTook note.3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, although other member states and the Commission had agreed atthe Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 8-9 December to a three-yeararrangement for New Zealand butter, the French had prevented agree-ment and a further meeting of the Council had been fixed for 18 December.If no agreement on a long-term arrangement was reached then, theCommission were preparing a regulation which would allow continuedimports on a monthly basis at the rate agreed for the current year.Although the French had shown slight signs of movement in bilateralconsultations it was possible that the French would veto even thistemporary accommodation.    The legal problems which this wouldcreate were being examined.    He was in close touch with the NewZealand authorities.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said therewould be difficult negotiations at the Council of Ministers (Fisheries),which was due to meet on 15-16 December.    Several countries were stillunwilling to accept the proposed quota allocations.The Cabinet -Took note.8CONFIDENTIAL
confidential9CONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(80) 74) on the provision for Civil Service manpowerin the 1981-82 estimates.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Departments&apos; bidsfor Civil Service manpower in 1981-82 were higher than expected,mainly because of the growth in the numbers of staff dealing with theunemployed.    The total bids were for 698, 500 at 1 April 1981 and for693,000 at 1 April 1982.    The total for April 1981 represented anincrease on the 697, 000 staff in post on 1 October 1980.    The Govern-ment would be severely criticised if the total in any quarter was higherthan that in the previous quarter.    To avoid this, and to establish aclear and strong downward trend in Civil Service numbers towards theGovernment&apos;s published target of 630, 000 civil &quot;servants by April 1984,he recommended that the total bids should be revised to 695, 000 inApril 1981 and 685, 000 in April 1982.    These figures representedreductions of about \ per cent and l  per cenf respectively on theexisting bids.    To this end there should be restrictions on recruitmentfrom January 1981, on the lines of those imposed in 1979, Which shouldremain in force until the downward trend had been firmly established.This was not a matter of setting new targets, but of ensuring that thetarget reduction to 630, 000 by April 1984 was achieved, and of the rateof progress &quot;to that objective.    Nor was it a ban on recruitment; it wasa matter of each Minister paying particular and personal attention tothe levels of recruitment in his Department in the months ahead, witha view to ensuring that a clear downward trend was maintained. Heinvited each Minister to let the Civil Service Department have revisedmanpower bids by Tuesday 16 December.    Provided Ministersvolunteered &quot;sufficient reductions, the unwelcome choice between evenmore stringent restraints upon recruitment and abandoning the presenttargets for manpower reductions could be avoided.In discussion the following points were made -a. It was generally agreed that, while a total ban onrecruitment would present severe operational difficulties,strict control as proposed by the Lord President of the Councilwas acceptable.    It was essential for the Government to avoidincreases at any time in Civil Service manpower, and to show atrend of continuing reduction.    Otherwise they would be heavilycriticised by private industry, and would lose credibility withthe local authorities who were themselves under severe pressureto reduce their manpower.b. Some Departments (notably the Ministry of Defence) wereon course for the reductions to which they were committed, andwould have difficulty in going further or taster. &quot; The Ministryof Defence already had restrictions on recruitment in force, and
CONFIDENTIALwere proposing staff reductions of 6, 200^ between April 1981 andApril 1982, by comparison with net increases of 700 by all otherDepartments taken together.    Nonetheless all Departmentsshould review their bids to see what more they could achieve in1981 and 1982.c.      For the moment the problem centred on the year &quot;ahead.In the longer term substantial savings should be achieved aseffect was given to major proposals, some of which weredependent on legislation.    In particular a number of measureswere under examination for reducing the numbers of staff dealingwith the unemployed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was essential to establish a clear downward trendin Civil Service numbers towards the target of no more than 630, 000 byApril~1984 and, in particular, to avoid increases in staff numbers in anyquarter.    Each Minister should now arrange for the submission ofrevised manpower estimates to the Civil Service Department with a viewto arriving at revised totals of 695, 000 in April 1981 and 685, 000 inApril 1982.    Each Minister should also take personal responsibility forcontrol of recruitment by his Department.    These arrangements shouldremain in force until the Cabinet were satisfied that manpower reductionswere firmly on course towards the 1984 target.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that, with the objective of establishing afirm downward trend towards the target of no morethan 630, 000 civil servants by April 1984, the aimshould be to agree on total provision in estimates of695, 000 by 1 April 1981 and 685, 000 by 1 April 1982.2. Invited each Minister in charge of a Department:a.      To arrange for revisedmanpower estimatesto be submitted to the Civil Service Departmentby Tuesday 16 December. b.       To maintain, until further notice, personalcontrol of recruitment by his Department.Cabinet Office11 December 198010CONFIDENTIAL
