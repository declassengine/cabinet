CONFIDENTIALTARY   1. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it hadbeen hoped that the House of Lords could complete theirconsideration of the Broadcasting, Civil Aviation, and Localunent,    Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bills by 5 November in orderLand    to give enough time for the House of Commons to consider Lords&apos;amendments to those Bills before Prorogation on 10 or 11 November.Thursday 13 November had been set for the State Opening of the nextSession of Parliament.    The Government had suffered only twoand       defeats during the Committee stage of the long and controversialof       Local Government, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill (one of which wouldneed to be reversed at the Report stage), but it had been necessaryto allot seven days to the Committee stage of that Bill, and the Billwould not be given a Third Reading until 5 or 6 November. TheCommons could net begin consideration of the 200 or so amendmentslikelv to be made in the Lords until the week beginning 10 November.It was therefore clear that the State Opening could not now takeplace on 13 November.    Because of the State Visit of the King of Nepal,the earliest alternative date, which the Palace had already been askedto reserve in The Queen&apos;s diary, was Thursday 20 November. Hethought the sooner the change was announced the better.In discussion there was general agreement that the State Openingwould have to be postponed.    It was suggested that it would bepremature to make the announcement until attempts had been madeto secure some agreement with the Opposition in both Houses aboutthe business to be taken before Prorogation.    On the other hand itwas argued that an early announcement would assist the managementof business in the House of Lords, where Peers on all sides wereconcerned at the current pressures.    The tactics of the Oppositionin the House of Commons were likely to be determined by theforthcoming election of a new Leader of the Labour Party. Theymight seek to use an additional week in the spillover for generaldebates on Government policy rather than seek to filibuster ondiscussion of amendments to the Local Government Bill, themajority of which were not controversial.    In any event it wasimportant that the Palace and all concerned with the arrangementsfor the State Opening, for which invitations had already issued for13 November, should receive adequate notice of the proposed changeof date.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the congestion of business in the House of Lordsand reluctantly accepted that it was now impossible for the LocalGovernment, Planning and Land (No 2) Bill and the other Bills nowin the House of Lords to become law in time for Prorogation on thedate previously envisaged.    The Opening of the new Session wouldhave to be postponed until Thursday 20 November.    The LordPresident should do everything possible to agree a new timetableCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwith the Opposition in the House of Lords before the decision wasmade public.    Subject to that, and to prior notice being given toThe Queen, the balance of advantage lay in not delaying anannouncement.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theChief Whip would need to reconsider the business in the House ofCommons during the spillover.   As much relatively non-controversial Government business as possible should becompleted, and they should also examine with the Secretary of Statefor Employment the possibility of arranging a debate on the Codesof Practice on picketing and the closed shop.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that the State Opening of thenext Session of Parliament should be postponedto Thursday 20 November.2. Noted that the Prime Minister wouldarrange for The Queen to be told of theirdecision.3. Invited the Lord President to holddiscussions with the Opposition in the Houseof Lords with a view to an announcement ofthe postponement being made in that Housethat afternoon.2.        THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that two recent actions of theGovernment of the German Democratic Republic were cause forconcern.    In a move which was probably inspired by their fearof contagion from events in Poland, and was designed to reduce thenumber of visitors from the West, they had increased the amountof East German currency which visitors to East Berlin andEast Germany were obliged to purchase; and in a menacing speech,presumably with Soviet approval, the East German leader,Herr Honecker, had not only attacked both the West GermanGovernment and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation but hadalso made clear that Poland&apos;s neighbours intended to ensure thecontinuance of the Communist system there.   These moves, andthe chilly attitude of the Soviet Union at the current Madrid meetingon the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, seemedto indicate a hardening of Soviet policy on detente.    In Poland, theCommunist Party remained in turmoil and it was not clear whetherthe reformist wing would be able to retain its present ascendancy.The Poles had received some economic assistance from the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSoviet Union and were now seeking more elsewhere.    The PolishAmbassador in London had asked for help from Britain in the formof increased amounts of officially-&apos; sponsored export credit anddelayed repayment in respect of the large amount of such creditalready in existence.    This request was being examined by theDepartments concerned.    The Export Credits GuaranteeDepartment&apos;s exposure in Poland was very Considerable, and itwas a measure of the Poles&apos; near-bankruptcy that 95 per cent oftheir current export earnings had to be spent on debt servicing.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that fighting had continued betweenIraq and Iran.    The Iraqis were advancing slowly but despitereports to the contrary had not so far cut the main oil pipelinerunning northwards from the Abadan refinery. . Iranian airti activity was declining.   Outside Iraqi and Iranian waters shippings was continuing to move normally.    There appeared to be noimmediate danger that the Iranians would block the Straits of Hormuz,although it remained possible that they might do so either as an actof desperation or as a response in the event of an Iraqi attack onthe nearby islands which the Iranians held or on Bandar Abbas.One British naval vessel, HMS Coventry, was already in the areaand another, HMS Alacrity, was on the way.    Consultations betweenthe Americans and their allies on naval and other matters had notbeen well handled for various reasons, including the imminence ofthe United States elections.    But it was satisfactory that with thehelp of the Iraqis and an Independent Television News reporter mostof the crew had been rescued from the only British ship which wasin danger in the Shatt-al-Arab and that only volunteers now remainedon board.    It was not yet clear whether, as the Iraqis were stillclaiming, it would be practicable for the Secretary of State for SocialServices to visit the Baghdad International Trade Fair in mid-November.    In Iran, the four British subjects under arrest were nowall believed to be in Tehran.   It was not possible to determine whatmight lie behind rumours that the United States Government mightagree to provide supplies to the Iranians in return for the release ofthe American hostages.    Such a deal, if it were available, would beelector ally very tempting for President Carter; but it was difficultto believe that he would agree to supply arms, which his alliesincluding Britain had for months past been withholding at Americaninsistence.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALty 3.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr Christopher Tugendhat,who had done well as one of the two British members of theCommission of the European Communities, would be nominatedfor a second term in the new Commission which would take placesioners       in January 1981.    Following discussions with the Leader of theOpposition, she had offered nomination as the second Commissionerto Mr Ivor Richard, who had accepted.    The question of portfolioswould be discussed with the new President of the Commission duringhis forthcoming visit to London; it was hoped that Mr Tugendhatwould retain the Budget portfoHo.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat agreement had now been reached on the implementation of theCommunity regime for sheepmeat.    It was part of the agreementthat there should be a claw-back of premium payments on ourh exports.    He was hopeful that British export trade could neverthelessis be maintained, although more was likely to go to France and less toGermany.    The Ministers of Agriculture had also had an informaldiscussion about the problems of the Common Agricultural Policy.Current market conditions, which might not last, meant that sugarproduction was no longer a cost to the Community Budget and theproportion of the budget attributable to dairy surpluses had declined.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that at the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) on 7 October French pressure to link progresson the fisheries negotiations with the Budget settlement had beensuccessfully resisted and agreement had been reached on the earlyimplementation of that settlement; it was expected that there wouldbe advance payments to the United Kingdom from the 1980 CommunityBudget of 150-200 million units of account.    Agreement had also beenreached on the terms for Zimbabwe accession to the LomeConvention with provision for the import of 25, 000 tons of sugarinto the Community.    Most Member States had supported aCommission proposal for mandatory quota restrictions on steelproduction, but the Federal Republic of Germany was still arguingfor a voluntary scheme.
4.        The Cabinet considered a ncte by the Home Secretary(C(80) 55), to which were attached drafts of The Queen&apos;s Speecheson the Prorogation of the current Session of Parliament and theOpening of the new Session.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft speeches attached toC(80) 55 had been prepared by Ihe Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee on the basis of contributions from theMinisters concerned.    The Paymaster General had made a majorcontribution in redrafting parts of both texts to make them asreadable as was possible within the constraints of the conventionsgoverning speeches from the Throne.    The draft ProrogationSpeech was on the long side, but it reflected the events of a longand busy first Session of the present Parliament, and could noteasily be shortened.    The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future LegislationCommittee had, however, attempted to keep the draft OpeningSpeech as short as possible.    Because of this, some Bills whichhad been accepted by the Cabii.et for next Session&apos;s legislativeprogramme did not receive a specific mention.    The draft Speechreflected the agreed emphasis of that programme by concentratingon economic and industrial affairs.    The passages on NorthernIreland and Royal Visits still needed to be finalised, but with theseexceptions, he now invited the Cabinet to approve the draft Speeches.In discussion the following points were made -a. The Opening Speech should include an expression ofconcern about the present level of unemployment. Thismight conveniently be added at the beginning of the paragraphon industrial training.b. The Government were not enthusiastic about theprospect of an international summit meeting on co-operationand development; moreover it was uncertain whether thePresident of the United States would be prepared to go, andunlikely that the meeting would go ahead witxiout him. Thesentence in the Foreign Affairs section of the draft OpeningSpeech referring to the summit meeting should therefore beomitted; the previous sentence could be expanded to referto the Government&apos;s intention to continue to work with othercountries and in international organisations in the search forsolutions (if that was the right word) to world economicproblems.c.        The reference to the aims of future tax policy might betaken as a signal that the Government had already decided toreduce the level of taxation in the next budget and would bebetter omitted.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd. The general reference to developing plans for givingeffect to the proposals in the recent White Paper on youngoffenders was unexceptionable as it stood, but no decisionsabout possible legislation or the financing of the possibleintroduction of residential care orders had yet been taken.e. It would be helpful if a reference could be made inthe Scottish section of the Speech to the proposed Billprotecting the rights of wives to the matrimonial home;this would add a welcome note of social concern to theSpeech, and would forestall the possibility of a private Memberintroducing legislation on this subject.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to minor drafting changes to be sent to the Home Secretaryby the Secretaries of State for Energy, Trade, and Wales, theCabinet approved the draft Prorogation Speech circulated withC(80) 55.    They were generally content with the scope and tone ofthe draft Opening Speech and agreed to incorporate the alterationssuggested in discussion on tax policy, the proposed North/Southsummit meeting, and matrimonial homes in Scotland.    The Secretaryof State for Employment should send to the Home Secretary (with acopy to the Paymaster General) as soon as possible a proposedaddition to the draft Speech expressing the Government&apos;s concernat the present level of unemployment.    The Secretaries of State forIndustry and Energy should let the Home Secretary have theirsuggested alternative versions of the sentences dealing with thepostal and telecommunications services, and private participationin the British National Oil Corporation.    The Home Secretary shouldthen prepare a final text of the draft Opening Speech in consultationwith the Paymaster General, taking account of any necessarychanges to the sections on Northern Ireland and Royal Visits. TheCabinet would consider the revised text at their next meeting.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretaries of State forEnergy, Trade and Wales to send draftingcomments on the draft Prorogation Speechattached to C(80) 55 to the Home SecretaryIas soon as possible.2.        Subject to 1., approved the draftProrogation Speech, and noted that the PrimeMinister would submit it to The Queen.6CONFIDENTIAL

Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Paymaster General, to circulate arevised version of the draft Opening Speech takingaccount of these amendments and of the pointsmade in discussion.Cabinet Office16 October 19807CONFIDENTIAL
