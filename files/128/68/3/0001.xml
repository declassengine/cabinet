S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(80) 26th ConclusionsTuesday 1 July 1980 at 10. 30 amTh^ Cabinet consiiered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster (C(80) 33) on the recommendations in the15th Report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB 15) for new ratesfor the salaries and secretarial allowances of Members ofParliament (MPs), the salaries of Ministers, and Peers&apos; expensesallowances; a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(80) 32)covering the 14th Report of the TSRB on rates of salary for thehigher Civil Service, senior officers of the armed forces, thehigher judiciary and the chairmen and board members of nationalisedindustries; and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(80) 34)covering a note by officialr on some options for dealing with the twoTSRB reports.THE PRIME MINISTER said that TSRB 14 recommended increasesin a range from 16.2 per cent to 30. 6 per cent, and averaging25,8 per cent with effect from 1 April 1980; and TSRB 15recommended increases for MPs of 14. 6 per cent from 13 June 1980.It was necessary to consider these proposals against the backgroundof the current rising levels of unemployment, mounting criticism ofthe levels of public sector pay, and the overspending by someGovernment Departments in the first three months of the presentfinancial year.    The Government was directly responsible for thedecisions on these increases, other than those for MPs, and theoutcome would influence the approach to pay negotiations later inthe year in both the public and private sectors.    The two TSRBreports should be looked at together and given broadly similartreatment.    In reaching decisions it would be necessary to recognisethe importance of preserving reasonable differentials between grades,both in the Civil Service and in the armed forces.    The Governmentwould have to be prepared to impose lower rates of pay forAssistant Secretaries than those suggested by pay research and torefuse arbitration to the Assistant Secretary grade, if that wasnecessary to ensure a reasonable differential between the maximum ofthe Assistant Secretary scale and the rate for Under Secretaries atlevels which were not excessively high.1SECRETP SALARIESVIEW BODYPORTSeviousference:(80) 24thnclusionsnute 4
SECRETTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that herecommended acceptance of the full 14. 6 per cent increase proposedin TSRB 15 for MPs.    The Government was publicly committed toimplementing the updating proposed by the TSRB. and it would be agrave step to go back on this.    The Executive of the 1922 Committeeand Parliamentary Labour Party believed that in principle the TSRBrecommendations should be accepted.    It was, however, difficult tojudge what would be the reaction to the proposal of 14. 6 per centsince MPs were generally expecting a recommendation in the orderof 20 per cent.    Given that 14. 6 per cent was substantially belowexpectations, and below the current rate of increase in the RetailPrice Index and in other comparable salaries, he believed that theGovernment should not go back on its undertaking in order to makefurther marginal reductions.    The Cabinet had already agreed toimplement the second stage increases due to Ministers.    There wasno ruch public commitment to uprate the salaries of Ministers asthere was in the case of MPs, and it should be possible to set anexample either by making no additional payments to Cabinet Ministersand a partial payment to junior Ministers or by making a smallpayment to the former and a larger one to the latter.In discussion the following points were made -a.        Since the Government had publicly undertaken to acceptthe outcome of TSRB 15 the economic situation had seriouslydeteriorated.   In particular unemployment was rising sharplyand there were increasing signs of economic downturn.Private sector employers were now under strong financialpressures to seek relatively small pay settlements in thenext round, but their ability to do so would be weakened ifthe Government were seen to be giving large increases in thepublic services for which they had direct responsibility. Inthese circumstances the Government was justified in adoptinga new approach, and in making clear that it could not affordsettlements at the levels proposed.    While it might be arguedthat the settlements were at the end of the present round,they would be bound to influence forthcoming pay negotiations.Unless the Government took a tough line on these groups,which had all had major increases in the last year, it couldnot hope to influence settlements in the next round or topersuade the country that it was showing determination indealing with the current serious economical and socialsituation.2SECRET
SECRETb. Single figure settlements were necessary to have themaximum impact.    Nine per cent was the mid-point of therange of 7-11 per cent for the money supply target;  but theGovernment should think in terms of an average figure witha scatter of rates between grades and groups and it wouldbe important to avoid the appearance of a pay norm.c. If MPs&apos; salaries were to be increased to  11, 750that would represent an increase of 9. 6 per cent.    It wasthought that the majority of Conservative MPs would beprepared to settle for 10-12 per cent, and might well bepersuaded to accept 9. 6 per cent.    It would be necessaryto take informal soundings before the Government put forwardits recommendations as a ba.us for a free vote of the House.It was important that the Government&apos;s proposals should notbe defeated: while a defeat could be presented as the decisionof MPs, it would cause bad feeling and could have repercussionson the handling of other business in the House.    Rather thaninvite comments on the recommendations in TSRB 15 it wouldbe better to try to influence MPs by announcing, whenTSRB 15 was published, what were the Government&apos;sdecisions on the increases for Ministers and for the TSRB 14Groups and their recommendations for MPs.d. The recommendations in TSRB 14 were on averageconsiderably Mgher than those in TSRB 15; if the groupscovered by TSRB 14 were similarly brought down to anaverage increase of 9. 6 per cent, it could be argued thatthey would be treated proportionately more severely thanMPs,.    This pointed to examining the possibility of reducingthe TSRB 14 recommendations pro rata with the reductionproposed for MPs, while preserving the present cashdifferentials between grades.    This approach would involvegoing back on the commitment either to accept the proposedincreases for the Assistant Secretary grade to  22, 000which had emerged from the Pay Research Unit (PRU)exercise or to let the Assistant Secretaries go to arbitrationon that amount.e. In the interest of simplicity there was a case forgiving Cabinet Ministers the same percentage increase asother Ministers and MPs.    On the other hand, it might bebetter for Cabinet Ministers to take no increase beyond thestaging already agreed, even though this would be seen asno more than a gesture.    Either way, increases up to thoseagreed for MPs should be allowed for junior Ministers. Inaddition ways should be sought of finding additional sums,3SECRET
through attendance allowances or in some similar way,for junior Ministers in the House of Lords.    Such Ministersreceived no Parliamentary salary of the kind available totheir colleagues in the Commons, and their service inGovernment often entailed substantial sacrifice. Withoutassistance some of them might find it impossible to continueto serve.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should advise MPs to accept anincrease of 9. 6 per cent, giving them  11, 750 from 13 June 1980,rather than 14. 6 per cent as recommended in TSRB 15.   It wouldhave to be made clear that, although the Government had hithertoundertaken to accept the recommendations in TSRB 15, they now feltbound to recommend a lower rate of increase, in view of the presenteconomic climate     The Cabinet would consider further whetherCabinet Ministers should receive an increase in line with that forMPs or something less than that.   It would be necessary to giveincreases to junior Ministers of up to, but no more than, thoseoffered to MPs.    Further consideration should be given to thepossibility of offering Ministers in the Lords an attendance allowanceor some other supplement to their Ministerial salaries which wouldhelp to meet the particular problems they faced.   The Cabinet didnot agree that MPs&apos; secretarial and research assistance allowancesshould go up by 18 per cent as proposed in TSRB 15; this increaseshould be reduced pro rata to the proposed reduction in MPs&apos; salariesThe Cabinet also agreed that the increases recommended for thefour groups covered by TSRB 14 were unacceptably high. TheSecretary of the Cabinet should arrange for officials to prepare afurther note setting out the options for reductions.   This shouldindicate first what would be the outcome of deflating the general levelof increases recommended in TSRB 14 by the same factor -approximately 35 per cent - that was proposed for reducing theincrease in MPs&apos; salaries from 14. 6 per cent to 9. 6 per cent. Thiswould make it necessary to impose a salary less than that resultingfrom the Pay Research Unit findings for Assistant Secretaries; butthe overall increase should be modified with a view to preservingbroadly the cash differentials between the grades.    The tableshould indicate the resulting weighted average percentage increasefor each of the four groups and for the four groups as a whole. Theresulting average increase would inevitably be higher than the9. 6 per cent proposed for MPs.    The table should also illustratethe implications of holding the overall increase in the wage bill forthe TSRB groups as a whole to 9. 6 per cent, while paying due regardto the preservation of appropriate differentials. Ministersrecognised that this approach would mean that the Governmentwould have to set aside the pay research results for Assistant4SECRET
SECRETSecretaries and to refuse to let the Assistant Secretaries go toarbitration.    For the nationalised industries the salaries emergingfrom this process of calculation would apply this time round.Thereafter the arrangements would be on the basis agreed !&gt;ythe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy at their meeting on20 May.    For all groups pensions would be based on salariesactually paid, except where, as in the case of MPs, the Governmenthad &apos;.lready undertaken to base them on a higher amount.The Cabinet would resume their discussion on the basis of thisfurther report from officials.    In the meantime she would, togetherwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip,see the Chairman of the 1922 Committee.    She would explain that theGovernment&apos;s provisional intention would be to announce a decisionon the pay of Ministers and of the groups covered by TSRB 14 at thesame time as making their recommendations for the increase toapply to MPs.    For the present there should be no public indicationof the Government&apos;s thinking other than that useful progress wasbeing made.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approved, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinetto arrange for the preparation of a further noteon the lines indicated by the Prime Minister inher summing up.Cabinet Office2 July 19805SECRET
