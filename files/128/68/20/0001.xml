CONFIDENTIALIAMENTARYURS1 Securitylibutions)1.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERinformed the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week*    The Social Security(Contributions) Bill would have its Second Reading on Monday,8 December and Thursday, 11 December had been set aside for itsremaining stages.    It was evident from the attitude of theOpposition that even with the expected all-night sitting there was nolikelihood of completing the Commons consideration of the Bill thatday.    If the Opposition were prepared to agree that the remainingstages could be completed with a further half day&apos;s debate, timecould be set aside on Monday 15 December for this purpose; but if,as seemed more likely, they continued to withhold their co-operation,a timetable Motion would be moved on that day.    The administrativetimetable for introducing the changes in employees&apos; nationalinsurance contributions meant that the Bill would have to haveFirst Reading in the House of Lords before Christmas, and receiveRoyal Assent by the end of January,The Cabinet -Took note.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat prospects in Poland remained uncertain and disquieting. Theposition of the Polish leader, Mr Kania, seemed to have beenstrengthened by the dismissal from the Politburo of a number of hispredecessor&apos;s associates; but the appointment of the hard-lineGeneral Moczar was a worrying development.    Unless the workersin the Solidarity movement moderated their demands, it seemedinevitable that there would be some kind of show-down with thePolish Government, who were so far continuing to give way on almostall points.    Military moves by the Soviet Union had enhanced itscapacity to intervene, but it was not clear whether these movesreflected the imminence of intervention, a wish to be ready to moveat short notice if need be (but no decision to do so), or merely adesire to influence Polish attitudes.    Nor was it clear what forma show-down might take.    The Polish Government might try to usethe Polish Army, and if this failed invoke Soviet military help; orthe Russians might take their own military steps and replaceMr Kania.    The Western response would vary with the circumstances,but, if the Russians intervened militarily without having been invitedin, detente would clearly be at an end; the Conference on Securityand Co-operation in Europe would collapse; pressures on theEuropean allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation toincrease their defence effort would be intensified; and the abandon-ment of arms limitation negotiations would lead to a major armsrace, in which the United States would no doubt in the end have theCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALadvantage but at great cost to all concerned, including Britain.There would also be economic sanctions; but it was unlikely thatthere would be Western agreement in advance on what these wouldinvolve.In the course of a brief discussion emphasis was laid on the needfor contingency planning in relation to economic sanctions.Ineffective sanctions would be disastrous.    Britain would wish tosupport sanctions but not to become more exposed than her partners.The effect of past sanctions, eg the grain embargo, should not beunderestimated.    But some Western European countries would behampered by their dependence on Soviet energy supplies. Britaintoo would be vulnerable to Soviet retaliation eg over supplies of keyraw materials.    The Secretary of State for Trade would arrange fora factual review of what main items might be involved.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernment had now announced their intention of bringing Belize toearly independence and of convening a constitutional conference inthe near future.    The Guatemalans&apos; reaction had so far beenencouragingly mild.    Negotiations with them would be continued inJanuary.    They appeared genuinely to want an agreed settlement,but it remained to be seen whether an acceptable basis for this couldbe found.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, whilethere was no legitimacy in Argentina&apos;s claim to the Falkland Islands,her stranglehold over their communications and supply routes washaving a blighting effect on their prospects.    The Minister of State,Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Ridley, had therefore dis-cussed with the Islanders various possible bases for a settlementwhich would enable the blight to be removed, including the idea ofsovereignty being ceded in return for long-term leaseback.    He hadfound a vociferous minority against any settlement and another infavour of one, while the majority were still undecided. Theconsidered reactions of the Islanders&apos; leaders were now awaited.CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thewar between Iraq and Iran remained deadlocked, although therewere rumours of an impending Iranian counter-attack. Meanwhilethe prospect of a Syrian attack on Jordan, which had seemedimminent, had now receded; but Syria&apos;s motives for provoking thecrisis remained uncertain.
CONFIDENTIALIf these proved to favour a settlement, arrangements would bemade to explore without haste the possibility of negotiating one.If they proved unfavourable, it would be necessary to consider whatother ways could be found of keeping the Argentines in play.In the course of a short discussion it was noted that this was a highlyemotive issue for parliamentary and puMic opinion in Britain, wherethe Islanders&apos; hostility to Mr Ridley&apos;s approach seemed to havebeen exaggerated.    It would be tragic if the Islands&apos; chances ofescaping from economic blight were to be diminished by the attitudeof their champions at Westminster,The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatthe question of continued access for New Zealand butter would now comeup for discussion again in the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on8-9 December.    It was likely that there would continue to be supportfor the Commission&apos;s proposals for a three-year arrangement from allcountries except France, although the Irish were still holding out forlower quantities.    It seemed unlikely that the French would be preparedto agree on anything but a one-year arrangement before the presentarrangements expired at the end of the year.    The Commission was nowconsidering how to authorise the continued import of New Zealandbutter on a temporary basis.    It had in mind a Community Regulationin which the French Government might acquiesce, since it would stillleave open the question of the longer term.    In the absence ofCommunity Regulation it was doubtful whether the United Kingdom couldlegally continue to import New Zealand butter on preferential terms.United Kingdom legislation could be challenged in the European Court;and in the absence of such legislation any such action could bechallenged in the British Courts.In discussion it was suggested that the French would probably not objectto temporary arrangements to allow for the continuation of butterimports from New Zealand, although they might seek to reduce thequantities.    Their probable intention was to hold up any decisions onNew Zealand butter until the forthcoming negotiations over next year&apos;sCONFIDENTIAL3. THE PRIME MINISTER reported on the meeting of theEuropean Council in Luxembourg on 1-2 December.    Although theItalian Government had not made specific demands, the Heads ofGovernment had shown their desire for the European Community tohelp with reconstruction following the Italian earthquake.    The Councilhad discussed Poland and the Middle East at some length, and hadissued satisfactory statements on both issues as well as on the situationin the Lebanon.    The Council had noted the increase in unemploymentthroughout the Community, but had unanimously rejected the notion ofreflation as a short-term remedy, because of the longer-term problemsto which that could give rise.    The President of the Commission hadgiven a good analysis of the extent to which Europe was losing groundespecially to Japan through lack of industrial innovation and unwilling-ness to accept technological change.    She had pointed out the contrastbetween the free movement of goods within the Community and the lackof progress towards freer competition in services, where the UnitedKingdom had an advantage.     She had also pressed for early decisionson continued access for New Zealand butter if the Community was not tobe in breach of the obligations which had been accepted at the time ofBritish accession to the Communities and reaffirmed in 1975. TheUnited Kingdom, France and the Federal Republic of Germany had allinsisted on the need to maintain the existing 1 per cent ceiling on ValueAdded Tax contributions to the Community Budget.    Only the smallercountries who benefited financially wished to see the ceiling raised.
CONFIDENTIALagricultural prices.    There were indications that President Giscardnow had even more ambitious ideas for increases in agriculturalprices next year than had previously been expressed.    On the otherhand, they might be seeking to link the question with the restructuringof the Community Budget or to delay it until after the FrenchPresidential elections.    It would be intolerable if there was anyinterruption to New Zealand&apos;s access to our market, given the previouscommitments and the fact that New Zealand&apos;s position had such wide-spread support from other member states and the Commission.5CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that at the Council ofMinisters (Energy) on 27 November it had eventually been possible toreach a common Community position on arrangements to deal with thepresent oil supply situation by running down and redistributing stocks,provided that the Americans and the Japanese were willing to do likewise.There were signs that the United States would be able to secure theco-operation of the American oil companies, thus ensuring wideragreement at the forthcoming meeting of the International Energy AgencyTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES reported that,at the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers (Social Affairs),agreement had been reached on the extension of reciprocal socialsecurity benefits so that the self-employed would be able to carry theirrights to medical care with them when they travelled within theCommunity.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL6CONFIDENTIAL4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE i-&apos;OR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat me hunger strike in the Maze Prison was now in its sixth week.The strikers were losing weight, but were in good health; they hadbeen moved with their agreement into the prison hospital where it waseasier to deal with them.    The strike was getting less support fromoutside than the organisers had hoped.    The level of public responsehad not increased and the size of marches had not grown. SevenRoman Catholic bishops led by the Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh hadput out a helpful statement on 28   November, condemning the strikeand urging the strikers to call it off.    All but one of the leaders of thepolitical parties in Northern Ireland had come out against the strike;the Government would be putting out a statement that afternoon giving acomprehensive account of the conditions already available to theprisoners as part of the normal regime, and it was hoped that on thebasis of that statement Mr John Hume would also declare himselfagainst the strike.    The police were handling the marches and otherdemonstrations sensibly and sensitively, and it had not been necessaryto call out the Army.THE HOME SECRETARY said that it had to be assumed that the carbombs in Hammersmith on 2 December were die responsibility of theProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA).    Though no evidence wasavailable about the attempt on the life of Mr Christopher Tugendhat inBrussels, it was known that there were Irish sympathisei s and an Irishcolony there, and this attack seemed likely also to be the responsibilityof the PIFvA or one of the other Republican movements.    It had beenexpected that the PIRA might resort to a campaign of heightenedviolence, not only in Northern Ireland but also on the mainland, insupport oi the hunger strike in the Maze Prison, and it looked as ifthey had succeeded in getting an active cell into London,   He would beproposing the appropriate precautions in Government Departments andother Government buildings.The Cabinet -Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL5. THE HOME SECRETARY said chat negotiators representing thelocal authorities and the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) had reachedagreement, subject to ratification at a delegate conference of the FBU,on a settlement which gave the firemen increases of pay of 13 per centwith effect from 7 November 1980 and a further 5.8 per cent in April1981.    The local authorities had sought to make the settlementconditional on agreement upon (or at least agreement to discuss)reductions of manpower.    The FBU had been unwilling to accept anyconditions:  the employers had therefore put out their own statement ofobjectives, and the FBU had put out another statement disagreeing withthose objectives.    It was helpful that the Trades Union Congress hadsaid publicly there should be no knock-on effect from this settlement,though no doubt that would not prevent the unions representing localauthority manual workers and others from praying the increase infiremen&apos;s pay in aid of their own claims.    He expected that the FBUdelegate conference would ratify the agreement, but the &quot;GreenGoddesses&quot; and other precautions against the possibility of industrialaction would be kept in a state of appropriate readiness in case of anadverse decision by the delegate conference.    He had made it clear thatreductions of fire cover in consequences of reductions in manpowerrequired his approval; he would of course consider any proposals whichwere put to him.    In the last 18 months only 19 fire authorities hadapplied for approval for a reduction of cover; he lad given his approvalin every case but one.THE HOME SECRETARY said that representatives of the Home Officeand of the Prison Officers Association (POA) were meeting on that dayto consider proposals for a new duty system in the prison service.The proposals would provide for a shorter working week with no changein basic pay, and no meal break payments.    The Chairman and otherofficials of the POA wanted to settle the dispute on the basis of theseproposals, but the Executive Committee was thought to be sharplydivided.    If the proposals were accepted by the negotiators and theExecutive, they would be put to a delegate conference of the POA on15 and 16 December; that was likely only to recommend a truce in theindustrial action for a month, and to postpone a decision on the proposalsuntil a further delegate conference in January.    If the proposals werethen accepted, it was to be hoped that they would constitute the basis onwhich more effective management of the prison service could be re-established.    He would be seeking approval of Parliament for therenewal of the emergency powers before Christmas; by these andother means he hoped to keep up pressure on the POA to reach agree-ment on the basis of the current proposals.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the PrisonOfficers Association in Scotland was not involved in the dispute aboutmeal break payments which was going on in England and Wales, butthere were some signs of unrest in the Scottish service.    The PrisonOfficers Association in Scotland was conducting a ballot on the questionof whether to take industrial action on the pay offer of 6 per cent, andthere was some working to rule in one or two establishments wherenot enough overtime was being worked to maintain earnings at what wasregarded as an acceptable level..The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office4 December 19808CONFIDENTIAL
