1.    Ihe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons in the week beginning 15 October and in the

House of Lords in the week beginning 8 October.



In discussion it was noted that a number of major Bills had

still to complete their passage.   Ihe timetable for the

spillover would be very tight in both Houses.   It was important

that Ministers responsible for Bills should pay careful

attention to the handling of Government amendments.   It would be

icularly important for the Government to win the vote in the

of Lords on the impartiality amendment to the Broadcasting

Any statements which had to be made in the House of Lords

week beginning 8 October should be very fully prepared.

Hussein had assured Western leaders that he had warned Saddam

Hussain that he must withdraw.   In reality, by his mediation

efforts and by allowing the recent meeting of Palestinian

organisations to take place in Amman, he had sown doubts about

his motives and had caused a breach with the Saudi Government

which would be difficult to repair.   Nevertheless, King

Hussein&apos;s survival in power remained an important Western

objective, since any alternative regime seemed certain to be

more damaging to Western interests.   In Kuwait, approximately

700 British citizens remained in hiding.   Their situation was

!rrying.   The British Embassy staff, including the Ambassador,

d stay on in Kuwait as long as possible.   Two out of the

members of staff were trying to leave, but the Iraqi



was creating difficulties.   The Ambassador and one

ff member would be able to hold out for several more

Other European Embassies had also behaved with

Continuing, the Prime Minister said that she had also discussed

the Soviet Union with President Bush, having recently received a

message frcm President Gorbachev in which he had asked for

substantial soft loans and had proposed an early meeting with

her and the signature of an Anglo-Soviet bilateral agreement.

President Gorbachev was facing very considerable difficulties.

He had assumed full personal responsibility for economic policy,

when it might have been wiser to have delegated authority for

solving the current problems to the individual Republics. While

the central Government would retain control of policy areas

as defence and foreign affairs, it would have made more

for agriculture, industry, privatisation and the transport

to be put in the hands of the Republican Governments.

Yeltsin, who was new in a powerful position as

of the Russian Republic, was in the forefront of

to expand the role of the Republican authorities. It

be in the Soviet Union&apos;s long term interests for

Western governments to respond to Soviet approaches by providing

substantial soft loans for the purchase of consumer goods. The

goods woul^??^sappear quickly frcm the shops and the Soviet

    CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the agreement reached

on the United States budget deficit between Republican and



tic Congressmen represented an unsatisfactory compromise,

reposed reductions in budget spending of $500 billion over

e, years, though the reductions in the first year would be

to  $40 billion.   Most of the reductions were reserved

fourth and fifth years.   Considerable doubt remained as

ther these reductions would take place.   There was

ing evidence of a fall in economic activity in the

United States. Growth was new at a very low level.   Bankers were

beginning to talk about recession, and much concern had been

expressed/^^it the property market.   The expectation was that

the budgeT^rapQsals would eventually be approved since the

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY noted that German

Chancellor Kohl would doubtless take a different line in

discussions  within the Community.   It was essential that

Germany signed a treaty with Poland confirming the Oder-Neisse

border and that Article 23 of its constitution, which allowed

any Land to join the Federal Republic, was abolished.



MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND POOD said that the

prmal meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Palermo had

^ssed the implications for agricultural policy of

opments in Eastern Europe and German unification.   He had



tough line, particularly regarding the General Agreement
