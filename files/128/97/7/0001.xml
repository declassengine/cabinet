FOREIGN AND OCMOWEAITH SECRETARY said that recent events

Soviet Union formed the background for the Soviet

fa on a united Germany.   Both President Gorbachev and the

Foreign Minister, Mr Shevardnadze, clearly felt that they

were\jj1 a stronger position following the outcome of the Soviet

Party Congress and had more roan for manoeuvre in foreign

affairs.   A split within the Party had been prevented, and their

programme h^ef^heen approved by the Congress.   Nevertheless, the

Soviet leaa^rsaip would continue to face daunting problems.

Many Party m^^^ were likely to follow Mr Yeltsin&apos;s example by

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the legal base,

though not the substance, of the initial measures proposed under

the Commission&apos;s social action programme had been discussed

during the informal meeting of the Social Affairs Council. The

United Kingdom view that it was inappropriate to propose a base

permitting adoption by  qualified majority vote had received

some support frcm the German, Spanish and Irish representatives.

It was unfortunate that Mr de Michael is, who had previously been

 Italian Minister for Social Affairs, was eager to make progress

rith the social action programme during the Italian Presidency

13d circulated to the Foreign Affairs Council a note

ling that Member States should act as if the measures could

The proposed 1991-92 local authority finance se 

England involved a very large increase. Aggregate

Finance (AEF) would increase by nearly  3 billion, o:

cent, over the current year. Total Standard Spending

rise to  39 billion, 7 per cent higher than local authd

actual budgets in 1990-91. The Community Charge for S

Spending (CCSS) was consequently  379, about  20 above the

actual average ccanmunity charge of  357 after capping in the

current year (though it should be noted that the average charge

actually paid, after allowing for rebates and other forms of

relief, was only  286). Seme local authority associations would

argue that TSS should be higher and had produced a figure of

 40.7 billion. That would represent an increase of 40 per cent

in three years and would be unjustifiable.   Even the figure

.-agreed by E(IG) represented more than a 30 per cent increase,

^/ e media, however, would be likely to focus their attention on

/  ^CCSS and argue that it was too high. In defence against this

  it should be pointed out that there was no option but



frcm the high base which councils had set in the

&gt;year, and that many authorities, none of wham would be

to the safety net and many of whom would be

itting from it, could set charges well below that figure.

In general, he believed that local authorities should need to

increase community charges by no more than the rate of

inflation. /T6e\ settlement was realistic and defensible. The

community charge payer would be able to see that the Government

had played K&amp;rr^nd that it was up to local authorities to hold

inprovements which, together with the AEF settlement, should

help to rai-m the debate, rally the Government&apos;s supporters and

promote the objectives of establishing the charge and making

dear where the responsibility for local authority spending

properly lay.



discussion the following main points were made:



(a)   The package was realistic, reasonable and fair. It

would be important to mobilise Parliamentary support and to

^^hcvsS. the Government&apos;s supporters fully, so as to get

^\/a^oss the message that any big increases in community

^charges in the caning year would be due to high spending by

 als.



The figure of  286 for the average canmunity charge

? \d in 1990-91 was striking, and should be made

known. It would be helpful to produce a similar

coming year. The average community charge

was lower than the English figure and

to with advantage. On the other hand it

&apos; &apos;.ck as closely as possible to figures

in individual local authority areas.

(g) It was nonetheless disappointing that such a large

settlement had had to be conceded at the expense of other

high priority programmes.   It could be argued that the

Government was deferring the problem rather than solving

it.   The argument about accountability had not been won.

More hard work would be needed to counter the tendency of

local authorities to push up spending and rely on the

Government to validate their increases in subsequent

settlements.



(h) On the other hand, the Government&apos;s powers to cap were

now more robust.   That was an essential pre-requisite for



^^^he settlement.   The rise in the proportion of local

^&gt;/sending met from local taxes had been checked.   It was

X^essential new to pin the responsibility for local charges

Nbn local authorities.   The Government would not this year

be appearing to incur responsibility by publishing a

detailed series of local exemplifications.

6.    The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of

the Exchequer (C(90) 6) on economic prospects, and a memorandum

by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, (C(90)5) on the 1990 Public

Expenditure Survey.



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the growth rate of the

economy had been slewing down over the last eighteen months, but

it had not yet done so sufficiently to remove inflationary

pressures.   The economic indicators were still ambiguous, with a

mixed picture on retail sales, stronger prospects for company

investment, and a sharp fall in new car sales.   The current

account deficit was falling slcwly, and was likely to be  15-16

billies.for the current year as a whole.   The most worrying

the immediate prospect for inflation.   The annual

the Retail Prices Index might reach 10 per cent in

the n^H^Arth or so, and would probably stay around 9 per cent

in the fourth quarter of the year, with an unhelpful effect on

the leve^kf^jgy settlements.   The increase in Gross Domestic

Product (GDP) was likely to be a little higher than expected at

the time of the Budget, with domestic demand also slightly

stronger.



Against this background there was no scope for any relaxation of

policy.   The strejfth of the public finances had promoted

confidence in recent years, but was now being affected by

cyclical factors.   At the time of the Budget the surplus had

been expected to disappear by 1992-93.   But with disappointing



figures for borrowing for

strong growth in central

difficulties in the coll

lower oil revenues, and wi

social security uprating,

current year was fast disa]

from buoyant tax revenues, and

choice could soon be between tax

net borrowing requirement, both of

and economically unattractive. Co:



strong and was helping to counter

taken for granted.   It would be essenti

impression that the Government was unabl

a turning point, and would continue to move in the right

direction if confidence was maintained and the right outcome

achieved in the public expenditure round.

programmes, as the Secretary of State for the Environment had

recognised, and this would need to be stressed in its public

presentation.   Both he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had

warned the Cabinet at its meeting on 19 April (CC(90) 15th

Conclusions) that the 1990 Survey would be exceptionally

difficult, and it was therefore particularly disappointing that

the bids submitted were even larger than at the same stage of

the 1989 Survey.   He would need to seek a much larger reduction

in bids than previously, and therefore to ask colleagues to

review their bids  to pursue only those which were absolutely

essential and even then to find offsetting savings. He

recognised that programmes were affected by higher inflation,

but the bids exceeded the upward revision of prices, and cash

plaj e|| was in any case intended as a weapon to curb

inflationary increases in spending.   He invited the Cabinet to

endorse his recxanmendation that the Government should hold as

close as possible to the existing planning totals, and that the

ratio of public spending to GDP should be kept on a downward



In discussia



dllowing main points were made:



a.    With^^iJ^flation and low growth, it was

particularly^0Pp ant to restrain public expenditure.

Bids at the present level would imply a substantial

increase in the rate of income tax, and were not compatible

with the economic situation and prospects.



b.     It was of key

Government&apos;s reputat

therefore to avoid a

c.     Ihe Chancellor of the ExcheM|r^gs to be

congratulated on having maintained map^t confidence and on

having avoided any further increasd^Kxnterest rates. It

was very important that he should continue to be able to

resist upward pressure on interest rates, and that

decisions on public expenditure should not add to those

pressures.

higher inflation, which had for example undermined the

effect of recent Survey settlements on the health programme

and implied declining real expenditure on education. It

would also be more difficult to contain seme public sector
