1.    The Cabinet were informed of the arrangements for the two-

day debate in the House of Cannons on the Gulf crisis which was

to begin that afternoon.   The debate would be on a motion for

the adjournment.   It was expected that seme Members would seek

to have a vote taken at the end of the proceedings the following

day.



    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that an explosive

ice had detonated earlier that morning on board the Fort

3.         HUME MINISTER said that the immediate cause of the

crisis in the Gulf lay in the dispute between Iraq and Kuwait in

July this year over oil pricing and production levels, and over

obligations which stemmed from the assistance provided by Kuwait

during the Iran/Iraq war.   Iraq had deployed large numbers of

troops along the border with Kuwait, but the general expectation

was that discussions between Iraq and Kuwait would continue.

^Without warning President Saddam Hussain invaded Kuwait on 2



fc and occupied the country.   Ihe United Nations (UN)

Security Council acted with exemplary speed, adopting Security

Council Resolution 660, which demanded the unconditional

withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.   The United Kingdom

Permanent Representative at the UN, Sir Crispin Tickell, had

made tJpgjghout the crisis an admirable and effective

contribution to the UN&apos;s role.   At the time she herself had been

;to capture the northern oil pipelines,

cither Gulf States would probably have

fallen.   Ihe Gulf States had requested assistance to which the

United States Government, closely followed by the United

Kingdom, had responded rapidly.   When after a few days Iraq had

Council Resolution 665, which authorised UN member states to

take necessary measures against ships to ensure the strict

implementation of sanctions, had been a helpful development

despite the delays and problems which had occurred when it was

being negotiated.     though the words &apos;,minimum force&quot; did not

appear in the final text of the Resolution, the United Kingdcm

and other governments made clear in the Explanation of Vote by

fheir Representatives at the UN that the Resolution embraced the



of force if necessary.   Since that time the United States

had sent additional forces to the Gulf.   There were new over

100,000 United States troops and 550 combat aircraft present in

the region, and armoured formations were new arriving.   It would

not be necessary to seek further UN authority to use force if

action^ere taken to carpel Iraq to withdraw frcm Kuwait. To

seek such authority would alert Saddam Hussain, thus imperilling

BritSK^fces, and would impair the freedom of action which was

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMQNWEAITH SECRETARY said that his recent

visit to Gulf and Middle East States indicated that Governments

in the Gulf States were new staunchly supportive and relatively

calm.   King Fahd was providing strong and balanced eldership

and had expressed appreciation for the help provi^eafc.British

forces.   The Ruler of Kuwait, understandably for a

exile, was more impatient for early action.   By con

Hussein of Jordan, and the leaders of a small number  

States, were seeking compromises which would in effect

helpful to Saddam Hussain.   They argued that, while Sa&lt;

Hussain must withdraw frcm Kuwait and release the hostages

there ought to be discussion of ways in which he might be

compensated for his withdrawal.   The Prime Minister had

forcefully reminded King Hussein that there was no question of a

compromise:   the Security Council Resolutions had to be

implemented without conditions.   The crisis had created further

tensions in the Arab world.   Constant effort was needed to

steady the majority of Arab governments.   An essential component

was the reassurance that Western governments would stand solidly

behind them.   Hence, a process of mutual reassurance was



King Hussein had told him the previous day that the

)jectives of his visit to Baghdad would be to tell Saddam

Hussain what no one in Baghdad had dared to tell him, namely

that he must withdraw from Kuwait and release the hostages.

Meanwhile, a major humanitarian problem was building up along

Jordan&apos;s borders with Iraq: an airlift was now being organised.

The key question, which could not yet be

ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the validity of the united

[em&apos;s policy in international law was clear.   The question

had been raised whether in the light of the Security Council

Resolutions it remained open to a member state to use force for

the purpose of securing the withdrawal of Iraqi forces frcm

Kuwait ,^ithout the further express authority of the Security

principles of the UN Charter required that

jould be settled by peaceful means.   They prohibited

prce in any manner inconsistent with the purposes of

threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and

Resolution called for the implementation of Resolution 661 by

those states co-operating with the Government of Kuwait which

were deploying maritime forces to the area. The

called upon these states to vise such measures

specific circumstances to ensure implementation  

661.   The Resolution authorised the use of force fd!

purpose.   At the same time, the Resolution recalled

Security Council&apos;s previous Resolutions. Accordingly

remained under Iraqi occupation.   For the vise of force to be

legitimate under Article 51 as collective self-defence, it was

essential for the country attacked to request assistance.

Kuwait had sought British assistance for the enforcement of

economic measures.   If further military action were required

under Article 51 this would be made legitimate by a further

written request from Kuwait.   At the same time it would have to

Jte shown that the forces were immediately necessary;   that there

^^%as&gt; not sufficient alternative means available;   and that the

force used was proportionate.   Despite the lapse of time since

the invasion of Kuwait, it could still be shewn that the forces

were immediately necessary since the intervening time had been

used to establish whether economic sanctions alone would suffice

to implementation of the Security Council Resolutions.

countries had adopted tighter economic policies, had lower

rates of inflation and were less oil dependent.   The lesson

of the 1970s was that it was essential to tighten policy in

response to oil price rises.   Simply accommodating the

rises stored up trouble for the future.   It was difficult

to estimate precisely the likely effects on the world

economy.   Ihe Japanese discount rate was already rising and

other governments might follow suit, possibly including the

West German Government.   If oil prices remained around $25

per barrel this might reduce grewth in G7 countries by

about 0.25 to 0.5 per cent in 1991.   Seme rise in world

inflation was likely.   Even assuming interest rate rises

and non-accemmodating monetary policy, seme increase in



inflation was likely, perhaps by 0.75 per cent by the

Overall oil price rises would contribute to

in world grewth and increased inflation.   If oil

to $40 a barrel the G7 countries would have an

rate of 7 per cent by the end of 1991.

the British economy would be less because the

was a small net oil exporter.   In the

effect would be to boost the sterling/

te which would reduce the impact on the



(RPI).   Ihe prospects were more worrying

despite seme sterling appreciation. If

oil prices settled around $25 a barrel, this could add 0.25

-0.5 per cent to the RPI aver next year.   Ihe RPI for

August would be affected by two unwelcome factors:   the oil

c.   Ihe inherent right of self-defence was older than the

United Nations.   It was essential%o^mck firmly and

clearly to this inherent right, rea^KSbd by Article 51

of the UN Charter.   Ihe successful recapture of the

Falkland Islands had been carried out under Article 51.

was not practicable to rely on obtaining international

support in advance of every action.   For public

presentation it was not necessary to enter

actions.   Nevertheless, it would be helpful

to have a short note to use in answer to le

legitimate under international law.   Absolute firmness and

steadiness would be needed in the period ahead.   The Government

would not be deflected frcm the principal objective of securing

and meat frcm the United Kingdom.   To begin with the French

Government had done little and at one point during the previous

week the two channel ferry companies, P&amp;O and Seed ink were

on the point of refusing to carry live animals and perhaps meat

as well, thus giving the French farmers precisely what they

wanted.   He had had lengthy telephone conversations with M.

Nallet, French Minister of Agriculture, and the Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary had spoken to M. Dumas.   Two detachments

&quot; riot police had then been sent to Calais and the companies

continued to carry all consignments.   But further inland the

police still appeared to be making little attempt to curb

armers1 activities and he would continue to point out that

of any prosecutions so far indicated a lack of

determination on the part of the French Government to enforce

thelaw.   M. Nallet had put himself in a weak position through

his earlier action to ban imports of British beef on account of

bovine sporgiform encephalopathy, which he had subsequently been
