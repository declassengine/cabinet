THE PRIME MINISTER said that, at a meeting of colleagues closely

concerned, it had been decided that the War Crimes Bill should

^be re-introduced the following Session.   It would be made clear

it the Government would be considering the use of the



under the Parliament Acts for attaching to the Bill

jested amendments&quot; to take into account same of the

ations expressed about it in the House of Lords. No

debate on the matter was envisaged this Session.   It was

plaWn^dT that an announcement of this decision would be made

THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the European Court of Justice

(ECJ) had given its ruling on 19 June on a case submitted to it

by the House of lords arising .out of judicial review proceedings

in which it was claimed that the conditions for registration of

fishing vessels contained in Part H of the Merchant Shipping

Act 1988 were incompatible with directly effective rights under

Community law.   The case arose from the activities of certain

Spanish fishing interests who had sought to register some

fishing vessels under the British flag and thus gain access to

United Kingdom fishing quotas.   The applicants had applied

interim relief in the United Kingdom courts pending a

itive ruling of the ECJ.   This would have involved

flying or suspending the conditions in the 1988 Act or



a mandatory injunction against the Crown, and the House

had referred to the ECJ the question whether it had a

or a duty to give such relief and, if so, what criteria

lould apply.   The effect of the ECJ ruling was that

national courts had such a right and that, in deciding whether

or not to ccaKt interim relief in a given case, the national

courts must/set) aside national jurisdictional rules which would

render it Hjgpss^le for the courts to grant such relief in an

appropriate ca^eJj This gave a power for the courts to grant

interim reliefi^E^id not impose a duty upon them to do so.

The matter would^^^eturn to the House of lords for further

consideration. (yyvs\

dispute about the power of the ECJ to grant interim relief in a

case before it but the point of the present ruling was that it

conferred such a power an national courts, /p^  ruling

nothing about the criteria for the

national courts and he proposed to argue

that the criteria to be adopted should give

views expressed by Parliament an the issue .

note that substantial arrears of social security contributions

due in terms of those requirements had accumulated.   A final

decision on whether interim relief should be granted might be

remitted by the House of lords to the Divisional Court or the

Court of Appeal.   The substantive case would not be heard until

the autumn and it was impossible to say when a judgement would

be given.



In discussion the following main points were raised:



(a)   Ihe judgement was not wholly unforeseen stemming as it

did from the European Communities Act 1972 under which

feet is automatically given by United Kingdom law to the

5/^bJ.igatians arid directly applicable rights arising under

Treaty of Rome.   It applied to all Member States and

be helpful to the United Kingdom in circumstances

the United Kingdom wanted to see tougher enforcement

of Community obligations.   On the other hand, that would

only yield practical benefits if the courts in other Member

prepared to be entirely objective in matters

of their own nationals were concerned,

the ECJ over national courts raised

might justify further consideration.



(b) Ihe

question the

such as those

objectively a&lt;

only sensible way

It would be important to secu

Holland and Germany whose

similar threat.



the ruling might call in

of policies based on national quotas

but in this case these were an

.tion from the normal rules. More

that national quotas were the

(d)   The Speaker of the House of Caramons had indicated same

sympathy with the application made the previous day for an

emergency debate under Standing Order 20. It seemed likely

that he had an exaggerated view of the importance of the

constitutional issue and of the immediate practical

implications of the ruling and it would be helpful for the

Solicitor General to brief him on the facts as a matter of

urgency.   Hie House of Cannons would be considering

European Community matters on Thursday 28 June, in a debate

on the procedure for the scrutiny of European legislation,

and this matter might be raised then.   In those

//^circumstances the right line might be that it was

c^^inappropriate to discuss a matter which was still before

courts.



\$e)   The emerging agreement in the Community on the import

of Japanese cars would retain quota restrictions for four

Member States and allow free circulation for the products

of Jap^ne^e manufacturers in the United Kingdom. This

wouldtcg^ane opportunities for the United Kingdom, making

it an attiriCTiive location for further Japanese investment

in manufgOTdrisg capacity.   It would be unfortunate if the

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the outcome of

the Romanian elections had been discussed at the Foreign Affairs

Council in Luxembourg an 18 June.     It had been decided that

European Community Ambassadors should attend the inauguration in

Parliament of President Iliescu on 20 June since the elections

marked a step towards democracy and the new opposition parties

would be represented, even though the United States Ambassador

had decided not to be present.   On the other hand, the Foreign

Affairs Council had agreed that the signature of a Trade and Co-

tian Agreement with Romania should be postponed and that

Romanian Government should not be invited to send a



tive to the next Ministerial meeting of the group of

ies considering future aid to Eastern Europe on 4 July,

decisions were in line with accepted Community policy to



ite in relations with Eastern Europe in favour of

countries which made most progress in political and

c reform.   The British Government had taken up, under the

Transport Council had agreed a good package on aviation to take

effect after 1992, and sensible measures which would liberalise

fares and open up the market meanwhile. The Council had not

been as satisfactory on shipping or land transport; on shipping,

there was a reluctance to discuss the issues seriously. A

number of difficult aviation problems remained to be resolved,

for example slot allocations at busy airports such as Heathrow;

but passengers should benefit from the agreement.
