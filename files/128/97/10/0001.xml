?? State Opening of the 1990/91 Session of Parliament would

take place on Wednesday 7 November .



2.     THE CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER said that the trade figures

published earlier in the week had been better than the market

had expected, with invisibles estimated to be in balance and a

^oaarrent account deficit of  1.1 billion, several hundred million

/poinds lcwer than had been anticipated.   It was important not to

 ! . . too much into one month&apos;s figures but trends over the last

nths were also encouraging: the year-on-year comparisons

t period shewed that imports were broadly flat while

were 10 per cent higher.    Import prices were falling

sharply,   partly  as  a  result  of   firm  exchange rate

policies, and should feed through helpfully into the core level

of   inflation   over   the   next   few  months.      There  was new

idence of a slow-dcwn in the economy with output

ing,   unemployment growing,   retail  sales weak,

rofits and reports of more uncertain trading

supply figures supported this view, and

a deceleration  in bank  lending. In

charge and mortgage interest distorted the figures, and the

adequacy of the method of collecting data had been questioned.

It was to be hoped that at least seme of the factors which had

distorted the index upwards would in due course begin to work

the other way. In the longer term consideration might be given

to bringing the index more into line with the practice of other

countries. In the meantime it would be helpful for the

inadequacies of the present index to be the subject of a

Parliamentary debate, most appropriately on a Private Member&apos;s

&quot;ion.



SECRETARY said that an explosive device had been found

continue to emphasise the positive aspects of the White Paper in

individual   local   authorities   differed   widely. Scottish

experience,   hewever,   was   that   local   authorities   had not

collected the outstanding sums as efficiently as with rates,

partly because of their innate reluctance to do so and partly

because of deficiencies in the charge registers.    There were

clear signs of anger amongst those who had paid the carirunity

charge that non-payment would lead to higher charges in later

years,  and this appeared to be inducing sane prominent nan-

payers to fall into line.    There would hewever continue to be

that political difficulties at the next round of charge-

would be less marked, because in sane areas charges

not be going up and might even fall, and because links

charge  levels  and the  political  control  of local

authorities   should   become   clearer   than   in   the   year of

of the Gulf had made no attempt to break the embargo. The

Indian ship, Vishva Siddhi, carrying food for Indian refugees,

was unable to dock since Urrm Qasr harbour was still full. The

Indian action could set a bad precedent since there were no

representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross

(ICRC) on the vessel, only the Secretary-General of the Indian

Red Cross.   Without ICRC supervision there was reason to doubt

that the food on the ship would be distributed solely to the

Indian population.    The British Government was taking a strong

^Xcdine in the Sanctions Committee on the need for such vessels to

&lt;/  F&amp;?* ign Affairs had sent a Note to foreign Embassies asking the

ies to provide a list of  foreign nationals who were

lonary  Command  Council  decree  which  laid  down that

ing a foreign national with the intent of hiding him from

the&quot; authorities was a crime in the category of espionage for

which the punishment was death.    Countries were continuing to

send  reinfSJ^cements  to  the  allied  forces   in Saudi Arabia,

ircludingi(sc^ useful offers of help from Eastern Europe. This

4.     THE MINISTER OF AGRICUUIURE,  FISHERIES AND POOD said that

protests by French farmers against inports of British sheep had

continued.   The French Government had previously been inactive,

owing to their tradition of allowing farmers to demonstrate from

time to time with impunity on the grounds that they could not go

on strike.     The farmers&apos;  actions had been widely condemned,

including in France itself.   It was evident that the Government

had now given proper instructions to the police and ensured that

they were followed.   In an incident on the previous day, police

^/&lt;had protected both the lorry and the sheep.   Even so, trade was

/ib^ing adversely affected.   Meanwhile he had been taken to court

&lt;/j7^the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals

to do so, the French farmers would have achieved their

r/ Moreover his powers to prohibit such exports, which had

used to prevent exports to Spain because of unsatisfactory

conditions there, could well be held to be contrary to Canmunity

law if tested in court.   It was important that there should be

no publicx^uggestion that the French Government was not in

particularly producers of beef and lamb, were already suffering

considerably from high costs, partly because of two dry summers,

and lew prices.   Further cuts in support would make it difficult

for seme to carry on at all.    If so, there would be adverse

effects on rural society as a whole.    The dairy sector, by

contrast,   was   quite   profitable:   the   Commission   could be

encouraged to offer more in that area.   Although it was rumoured

that the United States would offer to cut farm support by 70 per

cent, this would be over ten years and would not be on a basis

^Cranparable to the Ccnmunity&apos;s offer.   To prevent United Kingdom

&lt;/^w xlld be important to argue for future support to be targeted

if cur efficient farms had to split into smaller units in

new have to take responsibility for the very large farms

in Eastern Germany might in due course affect their attitude on

this point.
