1. IHE ERIME MINISTER said that the Lord Privy Seal and the

Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms were to be congratulated for

their success in achieving acceptance by the House of Lords of

the Government&apos;s position cn the registration of dogs, enabling

proceedings on the Environmental Protection Bill to be completed

in good time the previous day. Congratulations were also due to

them and to the Lord President of the Council and the

Chief Whip for securing the timely completion of what had been a

(erf heavy legislative programme in the 1989-90 Session.



MINISTER said that it was essential that the major

in the 1990-91 legislative Programme should be ready for

ion at the very beginning of the Session so that they

could complete their passage in good time. !here should be

sufficient^major bills for both the House of Commons and the

House of (L^S^s to make an immediate start; any delay would draw

criticismV^parti.cularly after the strenuous efforts which had

been made.to(complete the 1989-90 Session in good time.

2.     CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER said that the Chief

Secretary, Treasury was hoping to bring a paper to Cabinet on

8 November on the outcome of the Public Expenditure Survey, with

the Autumn Statement on the same day. It was particularly

important this year for colleagues to ensure that the press

briefing new being prepared in Departments on the outcome of

individual negotiations was properly co-ordinated with the

Treasury&apos;s presentation of the general economic situation and

prospects. If the public and market reaction focussed too

ivily on the year-an-year rise in public expenditure plans,

capacity he might otherwise have to reduce interest rates

d be lost. The reason for the planned increase was the

of inflation on Government spending. Commentators would,

inevitably be concerned that it might demonstrate a

of Government control of the economy. Against this

the presentation of the outcome of the Survey was

important. A balance needed to be drawn between the

desirability of highlighting improvements in services implied by

and the evidence that the Government continued

control over real levels of spending. The

practice a tight one. It shewed that the

}&gt;le to meet its commitments by good housekeeping

proposals, the reception in

was, hewever, clear that the

be an issue high on the polii

considered   that   events were

Government&apos;s advantage. First,



ir !HE ENVIRONMENT said that in a

Commons the previous day he had

e revenue support grant settlement

charge-capping for 1991/92. He

in the unified business rate,

enerally been critical of his



had been encouraging. It

Lty charge would continue to

genda.    In two areas he

inning   to   turn   to the

was growing resentment on



the consequences for chargepayers of the high levels of ncn-

payment in same areas of the country, particularly in London.

This resentment would be fuelled if local^a&amp;thorities sought to

pass  an  the  shortfall   in   income  in((^eL^follcwing year&apos;s



community charge bills.     Secondly, it

focus  attention  on  the  likely effect

alternative   proposals   for   local gov 

appeared not to have been fully understood,

developing these aspects of the issue over the

claim that the settlement implied major cuts in services, but it

would be clear that any local authority whose spending for

1991/92 was limited, had effectively volunteered for charge-

capping.



In discussion, it was noted that one consequence of the

proposals for 1991-92 should be a greater distinction between

the general community charge levels of Conservative and Labour-

controlled local authorities. It was important that

itive authorities should be encouraged to exercise proper

11 over spending. Increases in business rates continued to

cause of complaint, particularly in the south of England,

it could be argued that the policy favoured by the

.on of leaving local authorities free to determine the

business rates would lead to extra costs falling on

As regards domestic properties, it would be worth

areas of Northern England would have been, compared with the

In discussion the following main points were made:-



a. Hie matter required concerted international action and

consideration should be given to raising it at the next

European Council, or on some earlier occasion if

appropriate. It called into question the idea of open

borders favoured by many in Europe and indicated the need

for a Europe-wide immigration policy.



5^p+ It was necessary to recognise that there would be a

V/flcw of genuine refugees, but given the scale of the

\\current problem consideration should be given to

strengthening the law to introduce procedures which the

courts would not overrule, providing for quick assessment

of the^qircumstances of individuals and prompt decisions on

whether $hey should be granted asylum or sent back. Any

such^Wpja^ians might be a candidate for inclusion in the

European Council in Rome on 27-28 October had adopted a useful

declaration an the Gulf crisis which had condemned Iraqi actions

and the holding of hostages.   Ihe European Community governments

had affirmed their determination not to send representatives of

their governments in any capacity to negotiate the release of

foreign hostages.   Ihe governments also committed themselves to

discouraging others from doing so.     They had called on the

united Nations (UN) Security Council to continue its efforts to

/^achieve the immediate departure of all hostages and encourage

)me UN Secretary General to send a special representative to

&lt;y Jr&amp;q for this purpose.   While the issue of Western hostages was

discussed at the European Council, plans were being made,

Ithe German Chancellor, Herr Kohl did not disclose, for the

Chancellor of West Germany, Herr Willy Brandt, to travel

together with Signor Colombo (Italy) and Monsieur de

(Belgium) to negotiate the release of hostages under the

auspices of the UN Secretary General.   Herr Brandt had decided

to visit Iraq essentially in the hope of obtaining the release

of Germajv^iostages.    In the light of the forthcoming German

James Baker,  would begin a visit to seven Middle East and

European countries including France and the united Kingdom. He

would also have a meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr

Shevardnadze, in Geneva.   Mr Baker was expected to reaffirm the

determination of the countries participating in the allied

operation in the Gulf to secure the withdrawal of Iraqi forces

from Kuwait,   if necessary by force.    At the UN,  a broadly

satisfactory Resolution had been  approved by the Security

Council, with only Yemen and Cuba abstaining, calling upon Iraq

&lt;^/?&lt;\to end its maltreatment of Kuwaitis and foreign nationals, and

/A^e looting and destruction of Kuwait.   Member states were asked

&lt;y    collect evidence of breaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention

Iraqi forces.   The Resolution warned Iraq that it would

le to make full restitution for losses to Kuwaiti and

country   nationals   arising   from   the   invasion and

tian.    The United States Government was keen to maintain

pressure   upon   Iraq   by   tabling   a   series   of single-issue

Resolutions at the Security Council.   The British Government was

numerous deaths and injuries. As a result the Eharatiya Janata

Party, which was part of Prime Minister V   Singh&apos;s governing

coalition, had decided to withdraw its support, thus depriving

the present government of its majority. Nevertheless, the

Congress (I) Party, led by Mr Rajiv Gandhi, was reluctant to

form a successor government at once, since Mr Rajiv Gandhi had

still not canpleted the reorganisation of the Party. The

4.     THE MINISTER OF AGRICUITURE,FISHERIES AND POOD said that,

following the Agriculture Council&apos;s failure to agree for the

sixth time on the Community&apos;s offer on reductions of agricul-

tural support in the Uruguay Round, a furtS^r meeting was

planned for 5 November.   The French Minieteivhad chosen to

withhold agreement on the basis of an

stances.   On 2 November he and the Secretary

Trade and Industry would meet the Italian Mini

in order to demonstrate their support for their own farmers.

But   in  those  circumstances  other member  states  might be

unwilling to vote in favour of the proposal, since they would

appear to be defending their farmers  less.     In order to

negotiate  effectively  in  the Round  itself,   the Commission

certainly needed the backing of most or 2111 of the Council:

otherwise the other participants would have no guarantee that

the Community would put the results of the negotiation into

force. In any event it would need strong chairmanship to force

&gt;&gt;?othe issue to a vote, and the Italian Presidency had so far

./^nspicuously failed to demonstrate this,   !here was a risk of

&lt;/jfctJk United Kingdom,  perhaps accompanied by the Netherlands,

to vote against if the Commission or Presidency changed

offer in a way that would make it unacceptable, for

by an undertaking that the common agricultural policy

be adjusted so as to concentrate assistance on small

farmers.    In this connection it should be borne in mind that

calls within the Community for farmers to be supported through



never be endorsed: this would inevitably mean

assistance away from United Kingdom farmers to

in the Community.    In addition, if income aids

the commitment to reduce support which it was

otiated in the Round, there was a danger that

d use this loophole to continue to support

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, during a

meeting of the Environment Council which had been generally

uneventful, there had been a joint meeting of Environment and

Energy Ministers to consider the Community&apos;s position for the

World Climate Conference in relation to controls on greenhouse

gases.     The United Kingdom&apos;s position that we would stabilise

emissions of carbon dioxide at 1990 levels with effect from 2005

had been protected.   The conclusions of the meeting would cause

no difficulty for the prospectus for electricity privatisation.
