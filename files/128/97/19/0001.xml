1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the following

week.



CHIEF WHIP said that on present plans there would be a

te on capital punishment in the House of Commons on Monday

The Criminal Justice Bill would be committed to a

ttee of the whole House to debate, on a free vote, a range

s by backbenchers for circumstances in which the

ty might be appropriate.   Discussions were taking

plafefe&lt;through the usual channels to ensure that a full range of

cptio^ was voted upon, so as to avoid the need for further

discussion of the death penalty during the later stages of the

Bill.

In discussion the following main points were made:



a. Ihe arrangements proposed by the Prime Minist^fV

provided a good framework for  he review. It was     

that the work shculd be carried cut carefully and

thoroughly, taking sufficient time, though there would be

sustained pressure for early commitments frcm the

Opposition and relevant interest groups.



b.    It was important to ensure that the existence of the

review was not used by local authorities as a justification

for relaxing their efforts on collection of the community

charge and the Secretary of State for the Environment had

laid emphasis cn this in his speech the previous day. It

might be helpful of the Audit Commission were to remind

local authorities of their duties in relation to the

llection of revenues.



Ihe offer which the Secretary of State for the

ironment had made of talks with the Opposition parties

would be followed up by an invitation to the main political

parties to take part in discussions, which would be an an

indivdxfe^L basis rather than in a joint meeting. Similar

approrane^) would be made in Wales and Scotland, though it

was importajt not to imply that they were in any way

separate((frpm the main review.   Ihe offer had already had

tactical a^iwage in political terms, producing divided

reactions aaipcxfsfc the Opposition parties.

Christmas so that local authorities wculd be aware of their

detailed contents in time to take the^iieisessary action,

though they could not be debated untM.ajx^r Christmas. It

wculd be desirable to follow the rorm^?pf^rt:ice of making

an oral statement when the Orders for Wqiesvwere laid.



IHE ERIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion.

Cabinet had approved the proposed arrangements fi

review.   It was important that, throughout this ex!

Government should avoid the risk of promising more

delivered and it was preferable to err on the side

this stage, as the Secretary of State for the Enviro:

done in the previous day&apos;s debate.

v??^j^^tructive discussions with the Irish Foreign Minister on 30

The outstanding matters of disagreement related to the

and timing of the three elements of the talks, dealing

:sternal political matters in Northern Ireland, North/South

tween the united Kingdom and Irish Governments, and

East/vfest talks between the Governments about any consequential

implications for the Anglo-Irish Agreement.   There was general

agreement t a \the process as a whole would need to embrace all

3.     THE FOREIGN AND CCMOJWEALIH SECRETARY said that after

several weeks of negotiations United Nations (UN) Security

Council Resolution 678 had been approved.   Ihe terms of the

Resolution were satisfactory, and the negotiating process had

gone more smoothly than might have been expected. The

Resolution authorised the use of force if Saddam Hussain did not

comply fully with UN Resolutions.   The United States Government

taking the firm line that if Saddam Hussain stayed in

t, and refused to release the hostages, he would be

eked:   if he withdrew and released the hostages, he would

attacked.   The United States Secretary of State, Mr James

had described this as a carrot and stick policy. The

that if Saddam Hussain complied the stick would not

be ii^at.   The United States Government had rapidly followed up

the passage of Resolution 678 with an announcement that the

Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mr Tariq Aziz, had been invited for

discussion in Washington and that Mr Baker would travel to

At the EC Foreign Affairs Council on 3 December it had been

agreed that, if Mr Tariq Aziz visited Washington, he would be

invited to Rome on his way back for discussipns^with the Italian

Presidency so that he could be given the s^K/fi^saqe frcm the

message would be that the British Government was searching for a

peaceful solution.   No one had any illusions that the military

option would be easy or painless.   Nevertheless, the world would

not be safe if aggression was allowed to succeed.   He had

written to colleagues about the efforts which were being made to

help Jordan solve its economic problems, which were partly of

own making.   The Gulf States were best placed to give

to promote a reconciliation between King Hussein and the

rulers through the intermediation of the Oman Government,

united Nations, discussion was continuing on a draft

Council Resolutions he would not be attacked.   Ihe basic

requirements were that he should withdraw completely and

unconditionally from Kuwait, allow the legitimate

government of Kuwait to be restored and release 6111 the

hostages.   It was important to avoid any linkage between

the Gulf crisis and an Arab/Israel settlement.   Mr Baker

had given firm assurances that he would not allow the

issues to be linked in his discussions with Mr Tariq Aziz.

was the balance of payments assistance which the Soviet Union

was now requesting.   A number of British companies, including

Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI), had not received payments,

apparently because the British had not helped with the Soviet

Union&apos;s hard currency problems.   But it would be paradoxical to

supply add simply to meet debts to the United Kingdcm. Ihe

issue should be considered in the context of the International

The senior Italian official concerned was visiting London on 7

December and United Kingdom officials would take a firm line

with him. It seemed likely frcm discussions with the Luxembourg

Foreign Minister that both IGCs could be expected to run into

second half of 1991, and it was in the United Kingdom&apos;s



that they should do so. In his appearance before the

ign Affairs Select Catmittee on 5 December and at the debate

affairs on 6 December he would be emphasising that the new

would not be reversing previous policies. On EMU, the

unchanged; on Political Union the United Kingdom had

its hand fully and had a number of positive ideas. The

Kingdom&apos;s EC partners should not get the impression that

policies would be changed.

THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR TRACE AND INDUSTRY (MR SAINSBURY) said

that the negotiations taking place this week in Brussels

represented the culmination of four years of work. The agenda

was much longer than that of previous General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade (GAIT) negotiations, and the difficulties of

arriving at a successful conclusion had probably been

insufficiently appreciated and prepared for.   There was,



/er, a real deadline insofar as all the details needed to be

Lised in January for the united States Government to retain

.fast-track negotiating authority frcm Congress.   The world

adfe situation made failure more dangerous and the need for

stronger. He had spoken to the Secretary of State for

Industry, who was in Brussels with the Minister of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, shortly before Cabinet, and had

fcum^iim a little more optimistic than in an earlier

conversation that morning. The Council of Ministers had agreed

that the Community would not accept a suspension of the

THE EREME MINISTER said that he Iw^ki spoken that morning to

the Secretary of State for Trade ardPlndustry, who had told him

that no other negotiating party was^sking the EC to increase

its offer of a 30 per cent reduction in agricultural support;

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry that

Kingdom should do everything possible to avoid

the negotiations. If the talks were suspended th!

oily be serious timetable problems but also a risk

entrenched positions when they resumed. He had also

the  New Zealand Prime Minister, Mr Bolger, who had

the importance of avoiding a suspension and was likely

the United States negotiators that it was neither wise

practicable to veto progress by putting the Presidency of

Mr Bolger had had the impression that, providing there seemed to

be movement within the Ccranunity&apos;s 30 per cent agriculture

offer, it ought to be possible to avoid a suspension of

negotiations when talks resumed.   It might be necessary for the

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Minister for

Trade or the Prime Minister himself to speak to other

cipating countries to try to avoid a breakdown.



brief discussion, it was pointed out that there were flaws

united States negotiating position; for example, their

tural offer excluded cuts in deficiency payments, and

e tariffs were high. It was noted that the present

the negotiations had resulted from a suggestion by

idency of the Conference that there should be a

breakthrough on the five main issues by noon an 6 December. The

United States negotiators had responded to this by arguing that

they could ngt&gt;proceed until the EC had made a new offer on
