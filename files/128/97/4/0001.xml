THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDJSTRY said that he

!reposed to make a statement that afternoon about the EC



ission&apos;s decision on 27 June to require repayment of  44.4

ion in respect of aid given to British Aerospace pic (BAe)

time of the sale of the Rover Group in July 1988. The

lection was based on recommendations by Sir Leon Brittan, the

&apos;ioner for Competition Policy; three members of the

^h had abstained and one, Mr Bruce Millan, had voted

against on the grounds that the penalty should have been

heavier.    The decision confirmed that the purchase price of

 150 million for the Rover Group had been reasonable. It



condemned two^

ciaries.    He was advised that a legal

on&apos;s decision was very unlikely to

any event to put the issue to rest

ssion&apos;s calculation of the

BAe appeared to be unfair, since it

    HCME SECRETARY said that the recorded crime figures for the

first quarter of 1990 would be published later that day. The

figures would show that recorded crime, which had been falling,

was increasing again.   Violent crime accounted for 6 per cent of

the total and a recent survey suggested that there was less

violent crime in Great Britain than in other European countries,

v&apos;orth America or Australia.     The rate of increase in violent

sexual crimes appeared to be slowing down, and it was clear

more of the latter were being reported because there was



gement for victims to do so.   The bulk of crime was

crime, and 25 per cent of all crimes were thefts of and

Car crime was more prevalent in England and Wales

Western European countries.   He would be meeting

tatives of motor manufacturers later that day to discuss

and hoped that useful publicity would be given to that meeting.

IRELAND said that while

to begin in Northern Ireland, probably in

structure and agenda for the talks.   The es

proposition was that in the autumn the Briti

Governments would arrange a gap between Confe:

which they would declare had been done in part b

opportunity for political development.   Both Gov!

already said enough to indicate their willingness to

proposals for modifications of, or alternatives to,

Irish  Agreement.   Both Governments would indicate tha

the Conference was not meeting for that period the

normal work of servicing Conference meetings would not be&apos;

needed.   There would be three strands of talks.   The first

strand would be the talks dealing with internal political



and on the

participant though they could put forward views and proposals.

The second strand would be North/South talks in which the

Unionists would meet the Irish Government, as members of the

United Kingdom team.   The third strand would be East/West talks

between the Governments about any implications of this process

for the Anglo-Irish Agreement.   It was generally agreed that the

recess would start with talks on the internal government of

orthern Ireland.   One of the outstanding matters of contention

the timing when the other two strands were brought into play

? particular how far the timetable should be specified in

It was common ground that the process as a whole would

address all three relationships, and that no agreement

The Irish Foreign Minister, with whom he had had talks

!revious day, had promised a reply on the Irish

it&apos;s position by the weekend.   The Secretary of State

would circulate to colleagues in advance the text of the

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a further

Ministerial meeting of the Four Powers and the two Germanies

(2+4) had taken place in Berlin on 22 June.   The Soviet Foreign

Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, had tabled an intransigent

paper which sought to revert to proposals already rejected by

Western governments.   These included a transitional period

itween German unification and the renunciation of the

dripartite Rights and Responsibilities (QRR) of the Four

which would have the effect of prolonging QRR.   At a

for Ministers alone, Mr Shevardnadze had taken a softer

.ving the impression that the Soviet Government was

ied with its problems with the Soviet Armed Forces. It

?*that the Soviet leadership was reserving its position

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the most difficult issue

sing at the meeting in Cublin of European Community Heads of

it, which she had attended on 25 and 26 June with the

and Commonwealth Secretary, had been an attempt by the

Chancellor and the French President to push through a $15

irogramme of aid to the Soviet Union, comprising export



assistance with structural problems.   The proposal

put over dinner on the first evening, having evidently

between the Chancellor and the President at a

meeting five days before.   This was reminiscent of the tactics

competent international organisations,

should be made before proposals were put

This approach had been supported by a m

even though several Community countries were in practice lifting

South Africa.   She had secured the agreement of the Italian

Prime Minister that the matter would be on the agenda of the

next meeting of Heads of Government, which he would chair.



Continuing, the Prime Minister said that she had taken the

portunity of a discussion of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)

commend the ideas put forward recently by the Chancellor of

&apos; Exchequer for further progress beyond stage 1. His
