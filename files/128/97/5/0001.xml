1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Ccmmons and the House of Lords in the following

week.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked Ministers responsible for handling

Parliamentary business in the coming weeks to ensure that all

relevant documents were available in the Vote Office and that

all procedural requirements were complied with, to minimise

opportunities for the Opposition to disrupt business.   It was

also important to make a special effort to provide new

publications promptly to the Government&apos;s supporters, who were

often called upon by the media to comment on them.

Bill



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the law Reform

(Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill had run into serious

difficulties in Standing Committee as a result of obstruction by

a number of Government backbenchers.   They had not revealed

their opposition until after the Bill had been committed to

Standing Committee.   So far the Government had not sustained any

defeats, but the Bill had made little progress.   He would be

discussing with the Law Society of Scotland later that day the

possibility of agreeing a more limited package than was at

present embodied in the Bill, but which would nevertheless

provide for phasing out the conveyancing monopoly in Scotland.



In a brief discussion, the desirability of bringing a swift end

to divisions among the Government&apos;s supporters on this matter

was noted.   This experience raised questions about the amount

of Scottish legislation which it would be prudent to include in

the following Session&apos;s programme.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that one and a

half days had been set aside the following week for a debate on

the three community charge capping orders.   While it was

undesirable to have publicity for the matter spread over two

days, he accepted that, on wider business management grounds, it

would be necessary to provide this amount of time.   In his view

it was desirable that there should be no vote at the end of the

first day&apos;s debate, since this would mean taking the orders

separately and would allow frontbench speeches on the second day

to eat into the time available for backbenchers with a



CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL



constituency interest.   It was important that the amount of time

allocated on this occasion should not establish a precedent if,

as seemed possible, more extensive use of capping was to be made

in a future year.



In a brief discussion it was pointed out that there was a

balance of considerations affecting the handling of these orders

which the business managers would be considering further in

consultation with the Secretary of State.

Heathrow

Airport



2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that on 2 July he

had met Dr Jim Swire, the father of one of the victims of the

Lockerbie air disaster, who claimed that he had recently

smuggled a simulated bomb in a cassette recorder onto a British

Airways (BA) transatlantic flight from Heathrow Airport.

Subsequent enquiries had established that BA had known in

advance that both Dr Swire and Mr Barry Flick, another Lockerbie

victim&apos;s relative, would be on the flight in question, and had,

in accordance with their usual policy, given them special

treatment.   Four days before the incident, Mr Flick had

telephoned BA to ask for a preferential fare in order to travel

to a meeting of Lockerbie victims&apos; relatives in the United

States.   In addition, Dr Swire had, during a search of his

luggage by security officials, identified himself and his

circumstances.   The security officials, while they had carried

out the usual procedures, had not, therefore, pressed him as

hard as they might and in particular it was unclear whether they

had questioned him about the ownership of the cassette recorder.

It was clear that Dr Swire&apos;s underlying abjective was to

publicise his campaign for a public inquiry into the Lockerbie

incident.   The Secretary of State would shortly be issuing a

public statement setting out the results of the enquiries into

the incident, as would BA.   While it was clear that Dr Swire&apos;s

action had been misguided, it was difficult in the circumstances

to criticise him too severely.



The Cabinet -



Took note.



Northern THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he had had



Ireland further discussions with the political parties in Northern



Ireland and with the Irish Government on the steps which would

Previous enable inter-party talks to begin in Northern Ireland. The



Reference: Irish Government&apos;s concern to establish a timescale for all



CC(90) 24.2 stages of the talks had led them to demand, as a pre-condition



to their participation in an agreement, a commitment to a clear

timetable frcm the outset.   Ihis was impossible for him to give



CONFIDENTIAL


though he had that morning had further discussions with the

Unionists to try to find a way forward and would be proposing a

revised formula to the Irish Government.   If agreement between

the parties could not be reached in time for an announcement of

the whole package to be made during the Commons debate the

following day on the renewal of direct rule, his fall back

position would be a pause before resuming his efforts to start

talks.   But the Unionists had moved their position

significantly during the current discussions, and might feel

vulnerable and unable to continue if, after expectations of

agreement on inter-party talks been raised, momentum was lost.

3.     IHE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEAIIH OFFICE (MR

WAIDEGRAVE) said that German economic and monetary union (GEMU),

which had cane into force on 1 July, was the biggest single step

towards unification taken so far.   Controls on movement of

persons, but not of goods, across the Inner-German border had

been lifted at the same time.   Ihe transition to GEMU had passed

off smoothly, and the indications were that the East German

people were not indulging in a spending spree but were saving

their newly-issued Deutsche Marks.   If this trend continued

inflation might be less than predicted, but the transition to a

market economy in East Germany would be painful and substantial

unemployment was unavoidable.

IHE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND OCMMDNWEALIH OFFICE said that

the Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union

(CPSU) had opened on 2 July.   President Gorbachev and his

Politburo colleague Mr Yakovlev had made impressive speeches.

Ihe Congress, which was expected to last ten days, was likely to

be a confused occasion.   Ihe delegates had been chosen by old

methods, and traditionalist views were strongly represented.

Nevertheless the traditionalists were likely to re-elect

President Gorbachev as head of the Party for lack of a credible

alternative of their own, and also because they believed that

for the time being it was in their interests for him to remain

in charge.   Ihe Party appeared to be an increasingly

unsatisfactory power-base for President Gorbachev but he had

probably not yet finally decided how far to seek to maintain it.



In discussion, it was noted that Mr Ligachev, the Central

Committee Secretary for Agriculture, had made a powerful speech

on 3 July which was strongly critical of President&apos;s Gorbachev&apos;s

policies and which had been well received.   Ihe speeches of the




CONFIDENTIAL



Defence Minister, Marshal Yazov, and the Head of the Committee

for State Security (KGB), General Kryuchkav, had had a poor

reception.   Marshal Yazov had reportedly had to be helped back

to his seat after speaking; it was not clear whether this was an

indication of serious illness.



Zambia THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMM3NWEAUIH OFFICE said



that, following recent riots in Zambia provoked by economic

discontent, a junior Army officer, aided by two companions, had

succeeded in broadcasting a message that the armed forces had

seized pcwer frcm President Kaunda&apos;s government.   This message,

although untrue, had led to public rejoicing.   President Kaunda

had displayed sang-froid in fulfilling a public engagement

before returning to Lusaka to deal with the crisis.   He now

faced a difficult decision on whether or not to persevere with

the economic reforms required by the International Monetary

Fund, which had resulted in a doubling of the price of staple

food.



Kenya THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMMCNWEAITH OFFICE said that



political discontent had been rising in Kenya, where there had

been broadly-based demands for greater democracy.   President Moi

seemed ready to make seme concessions but had dealt heavy-

handedly with seme of his critics, notably the opposition

politician, Mr Matiba.   The British High Commissioner in Nairobi

was urging President Moi to try to defuse the situation and to

respond to legitimate calls for greater openness.



Liberia THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEALTH OFFICE said that



the situation in Liberia had deteriorated.   Rebel forces had

Previous moved into the capital Monrovia on 3 July.   President Doe had



Reference: agreed conditionally to resign, and the United States Government



CC(90) 22.3        would evacuate him frcm the country if he requested this. His

probable successor as President, Mr Charles Taylor, an Americo-

Liberian who had received advice and assistance frcm Libya, was

unlikely to improve on the poor record of the Doe

administration.   Over 100 British citizens remained in Liberia;

all were reported to be safe, and there were contingency

arrangements for evacuating them in co-operation with the

Americans.



In discussion, it was noted that tribal jealousies in Liberia

were likely to lead to further bloodshed.   HMS PHOEBE and the

Royal Fleet Auxiliary TIDESFKENG were lying off the Liberian

coast ready to assist in any evacuation.

    MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that

Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress (ANC) leader,

was currently visiting London.   He had seen the Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary on 3 July and would be calling on the

Prime Minister later that morning.   Although a man of great

dignity and courage, and of greater stature than other African

leaders, he was mentally set in his ways, and had done little

but repeat familiar and dated themes in the previous day&apos;s

discussions.   His entourage were unimpressive.   Mr Mandela&apos;s

schedule of world travel, which was set to continue for the rest

of the year, was exhausting him and was also insulating him from

the reality of events in South Africa.



In discussion, it was pointed out that the South African

President, Mr de KLerk, could not indefinitely continue his

programme of reforms without an adequate response from the ANC.

It was not clear that Mr Mandela was sufficiently flexible to

make the necessary response.   Younger men among the ANC

leadership might be more capable of this.

German lorry

:tax



4.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the German

Government, believing that the relatively low level of charges

imposed on road-haulage operators by most other Member States

represented a concealed subsidy, had planned to introduce a tax

an all lorries using German roads, which would be levied at

borders and refunded to German operators.   The German Parliament

had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the measure.   Other Member

States and the Commission had strongly objected, and the

Commission had brought the matter before the European Court of

Justice.   Since British operators already paid a full and fair

charge for their track costs under British taxation, the

additional tax in Germany would be particularly disadvantageous

to them.   While having seme sympathy with the German position,

he had therefore joined the objections made by others. 1he

Court had not yet considered the case itself, but had issued a

temporary injunction preventing the introduction of the tax on 1

July as the German Government had intended.   The Court would

consider on 6 July whether to extend the injunction pending a

full hearing.



fction against

British lamb

pxports



    MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND POOD said that two

British lorries carrying lamb to Spain had been turned back

after landing at Cherbourg as a result of action by French

farmers.   The police had told the drivers that they could not



CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL



guarantee to protect them and therefore advised them to return.

There was evidence that the French authorities were encouraging

the farmers to take this action.   Because of its superior

quality, British lamb had made considerable inroads into the

French and Spanish markets, which the two countries concerned

seemed to regard as improper especially as their market prices

were relatively lew.   Success in exporting lamb was seme slight

compensation for the damage inflicted on the United Kingdom beef

market through the action previously taken by the French and

other Governments against beef exports on account of bovine

spongiform encephalopathy.    He had taken the matter up with the

French Minister.     If the reply was not satisfactory, he

intended to pursue it with the Ccmmission.

GOVERNMENT 5.     THE FKEME MINISTER said that she would shortly be asking



POLICY FOR Cabinet colleagues and Ministers in charge of Departments to



THE LONGER report to her on the policy proposals they were working on or



      proposed to set in train, relating to the Government&apos;s



objectives over the next three or four years, with an indication

of progress so far and prospective timing.   The exercise would

be valuable in helping to ensure that the legislative programme

for the first Session of Parliament after the next General

Election was adequately prepared and that the policy issues

requiring most urgent attention in the next Parliament were

properly addressed.
