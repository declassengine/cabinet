THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR        said that he would be

ing on Tuesday 4 December his decision on the first round

&apos;ational Health Service Trust applications, that is those

to become operational in April 1991.   He expected to be



56 of the 66 applications.   He would also be

&apos;ing his agreement for hospitals and other units which had



interest in trust status to prepare applications to

trusts in April 1992.   ?Ihe number of successful first

round applications was high, which would attract seme criticism,

but his decision would be an important signal of support for

those who /M3worked hard to establish successful trusts. The

Secretary was in New York for the debate on a united Naf

Security Council Resolution authorising the use of force ai

Iraq.   The Resolution was expected to obtain the necessary nine

positive votes.   None of the five Permanent Members of the

Security Council was likely to veto the Resolution, but China

might abstain.   The Resolution, which had been tabled on the

previous evening, prescribed a deadline of 15 January 1991 for

full implementation of United Nations Resolutions.   Both the

British and United States Governments would have preferred a

deadline of 1 January, but acceptance of the later date was

probably the price which would have to be paid for Soviet



port.   Progress on the adoption of this Resolution could be

plicated by the pressure frati a number of Security Council

for a debate on the Occupied Territories.   The non-

countries were demanding a vote on their draft

:ion which provided for an enhanced United Nations

in the Occupied Territories.   The United States

nt, which currently held the Presidency of the Security

LI, was resisting these demands.   So far these tactics had

proved successful.   Nevertheless, the outcome was uncertain and

the Occupied Territories issue could still cause problems for

the adcptiG^^f a Resolution authorising the use of force in the

Gulf.

The British Embassy in Damascus had new

,Affaires.   The Foreign and Commonwealth

in his statement in the House of

it Syria was an important regional

were seme 750 British hostages still in Iraq, of whem

approximately 300 were believed to be held at installations in

Iraq.



In discussion, the following points were ma



a. a number of British servicemen bela

detained in Iraq.   They faced difficult dec

whether their wives should travel out for Chri

not travel out.

beginning to conclude that the policy of holding h

and releasing them in small numbers was not in its own

interests.   The international community had made clear to

the Iraqi Government that the holding of hostages was

unacceptable and that they should all be released.



c.   Ihe economic situation in Jordan was a matter for great

concern.   As a result of applying sanctions against Iraq,

there was likely to be a fall in Jordan&apos;s gross domestic

product of over 30 per cent.   Ihe Jordanian Government had

spent over $40 million dealing with the influx of refugees

frcm Iraq and Kuwait.   Although a number of international

institutions and countries had made substantial aid



&apos;tments to Jordan, disbursement had been slew.   If King

in and the monarchy as a whole were deposed in Jordan

s would have serious implications for Western interests

for the future of the region as a whole, especially if

government was taken over by Muslim fundamentalists.

With these considerations in mind, the British Government

THE FRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

economic situation in Jordan remained a source of concern.

Although Jordan&apos;s record on the implementation of the united

Nations embargo was patchy, it would not be in Western interests

for the Jordanian Government to collapse.   Both the British and

 united States Governments were very much alive to this problem,

&amp;qu were making strenuous efforts to secure earlier disbursement

/pf&gt;aid to Jordan.   These efforts were being channelled through

&lt;^pap&gt; European Community and through the Financial Co-ordinating

which was meeting under United States chairmanship to co-

? international assistance to states most directly

af$fe6ted by the Gulf crisis.   Steps had also been taken to

promq e an improvement in relations between the Saudi and

Jordanian Governments, principally through the intermediation of

the Oman Government.   It was important to maintain these efforts

the importance of maintaining close cooperation with the

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he and

Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would represent

United Kingdom at the meeting of Contracting Parties to the

   ^ negotiations.   Although the outlook was not good, he

beiaeSred success was still possible.



In discussion, it was noted that, on agriculture, the Commission

negotiators seemed to be shewing a little more flexibility. All

THE EKEME MINISTER said he believed that, in handling issues

within the Ccmmunity, it would be important to seek alliances

with other member states to a greater extent than hitherto and

to be active frcm an early stage of the debate.   This required

wide-ranging programme for making contacts with key people in

the Community.



In discussion the follcwing main points were made:



a.   The aim should be to build up a network of cooperation

with other member states at all levels, so that joint

^^^Lnitiatives could be explored as appropriate.



   ;   Since Germany would have an increasingly dominant

\\position within the Community, close relations with the

Germans were particularly important.   German attitudes

seemed for some time to have been dictated solely by

electoral considerations.   This should change after the

elections)on 2 December.

THE HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

United Kingdom needed to maximise its influence in decision-

making within the European Community.   It was probably not

possible to arrive at conclusions which would be applicable in

all circumstances. But a fresh look across the board, rather

at particular subject areas, was desirable.   It would be

ful if, in the first instance, the Foreign and Commonwealth

etary could put forward a paper for collective discussion.
