1.        PRIME MINISTER said that her consultations among

colleagues about the prospects for the second ballot in the

election for the leadership of the Conservative Party had

indicated that all were supportive but most thought that it was

now unlikely that she would win the ballot.   She had therefore

informed Ihe Queen that morning that she did riot intend to



the second ballot and proposed to tender her resignation

ime Minister as soon as a new leader of the Conservative

had been elected.   She then read the following statement,

would shortly be issuing publicly:-



ing consulted widely among colleagues, I have concluded

it the unity of the Party and the prospects of victory in

General Election would be better served if I stood down

to enable Cabinet colleagues to enter the ballot for the

leadership.   I should like to thank all those in Cabinet

THE CHANCELLOR OF     DUCHY OF ]LANCASTER said that he would like

to add as Chairman of the Conservative Party that the Prime

Minister had and always would have the love and loyalty of the

Conservative Party.   Conservatives throughout the country held

in the greatest esteem and affection and knew that, under

leadership, they had been associated with greatness.

4.     THE FOREIGN AND CCMM3NWEAIIH SECRETARY said that the Prime

Minister and he had attended the Conference on Security and Co-

operation in Europe (CSCE) frcm 19-21 November in Paris during

which the Prime Minister had signed the Conventional Armed

Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty.   The Treaty was a major

achievement, which would not have been possible if the British

Government had not stood firm on Cruise missiles.   It was clear

proof of the validity of a policy of multilateral disarmament

from a position of strength.   He hoped that colleagues would

:line this point in arty public statements.   Ihe CSCE Summit

had been well prepared tut it had been effectively a

of formal speeches.   Ihe chief value of the occasion lay

bilateral meetings which the Prime Minister and he had

margins.   Ihe CSCE was not a substitute for the North

Treaty Organisation.    It contained provisions for a

Liation mechanism for the settlement of disputes, based on

British ideas, a Conflict Prevention Centre and a charter on

human rights and fundamental freedoms, which had been

foreshadcwed^in the Prime Minister&apos;s call for a Magna Carta for

Europe in hef^foeech at Aspen an 2 August.   The presence at the

mating of M^fe^s such as President Havel of Czechoslovakia

showed that thisapprcach had new borne fruit.

the French Government was able to play a major part in drafting

or approving the text.   Ihe United States Government believed

that it was better to have a Resolution, even if only passed on

a majority of 9 to 6, than not to have a Resolution, since it

would strengthen the United States Government&apos;s position with

Congress and public opinion.



HUME MINISTER said that she had discussed the Soviet



situation with President Gorbachev, who had appeared

ly ebullient despite his pressing difficulties. The

was worrying, since the Soviet Government did not

have a clear chain of command or an effective

ve machinery.   President Gorbachev had explained that

since mis earlier proposals had been badly received by the

Supreme Soviet he had worked overnight to produce a new set

which had been, approved.   This indicated the precarious way in

which the deOemment of the Soviet Union was being conducted.

THE ERIME MINISTER said that during the CSCE Summit she had had

keen interest in the extension of the Know-How Fund to Bulgaria,

and she had agreed to consider this.

MINISTER said that, during discussion with the

 lor, Herr Kohl, she had recalled that he had

fully argued that the two Intergovernmental Conferences

d the Community Treaties should not start until after the

German elections.   By the same token they ought not to be

brought to a^cqnclusian until after the British elections, to

avoid the ($ c$Hpe being a divisive issue during an election

campaign.



THE SECRETARY OF

negotiations.   All ha

THE ERIME MINISTER said that, duri&amp;pier discussion with the

United States President, Mr Bush on\3,9 November, he had

expressed great concern about the Round.   He faced a Congress

inclined to be protectionist: the Community&apos;s poor offer on

measures such as minimum mesh sizes.   Ihe Italian Chairman had

failed to push the matter to an agreement, even though it had

been within his grasp.   It would be discussed again at the next

6.    The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Secretary of

State for Defence (C(90) 10) about options for reinforcing

British forces in the Gulf.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that 26 Iraqi divisions

totalling approximately 400,000 men were deployed in the region



f Kuwait and Southern Iraq.   Although these troops were of

varying quality they were a substantial force.   Against this

background the United States Government had decided to build up

the level of their forces in the Gulf frcm the present level of

240,000   to over 400,000.   The United States assessment was that

it wa^tessential to assemble a force sufficiently powerful to

present a credible military option, so as to convince Saddam

need to withdraw frcm Kuwait.   A larger force

more certain prospect of victory in a shorter

a lower level of casualties in the event of

nsideration should destroy Saddam Hussain&apos;s



nations would find the prospect of battle

le.   The build-up did not imply a

to war whatever happened: indeed, it

!respect of securing a peaceful solution by

in that he had no alternative but to

withdraw.   Recent ^?htelligence reports had contained the first

signs of disintegration in the Iraqi regime.   The Chief of Staff

had been dismissed and possibly arrested.   The window of

opportunity for any military action by the allies would close at

the start of Ramadan (17 Maagk 1991), which would coincide with

the onset of hotter weathe|&gt;w% this timescale meant that a

Continuing, THE SECRETARY OF STATE PORTOEpKE said that he had

carefully considered what level of reini^rceinent of British

forces in the Gulf would be appropriate.   So far approximately

17,500 personnel had been committed to the Gulf, comprising

2,500 Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary personnel, 11,500

from the Army and 3,500 from the Royal Air Force

including about 1,000 outside theatre.   The opti|

reinforcement were described in his Memorandum.

Brigade, already in Saudi Arabia, consisted of two?

Challenger tanks and one mechanised infantry battali

with Warrior armoured fighting vehicles, supported &apos;

troops.   He proposed to reinforce 7 Armoured Brigade

additional mechanised brigade which would include a

Challenger regiment and two mechanised infantry battalior

new brigade and its support totalled seme 8,500 men, including

600 from the RAF.   To these would be added a Headquarters and

divisional troops totalling seme 5,500 men. These

reinforcements would increase the total of Army personnel to

seme 25,000, and the tri-Service total to upwards of 30,000.

The United States commander, General Schwarzkopf, had indicated

to him that he would be prepared to place a United States

kbrigade under British command.   This would enable a British



Division, commanded by a British Major-General, to be

formed, which would be more effective militarily than two free-

standing British brigades.   There would be operational

advantages in placing a British officer in command at

divisional level.   His proposal was strongly supported by the

ChiefStaff and would be warmly welcomed by the United



on



.tion, by Congressional opinion and by the

military command in the Gulf.   A United Kingdom

this scale would compare very favourably with

er member of the alliance, apart frcm the United,

reflect the fact that in the event of conflict

of United States and British forces were

to success.   The cost of the proposed

  associated procurement would be



of Defence estimated that it would

cost to the defence budget arising from

1990-91 from  400 million to  800 million.

The Saudi Arabian Government had agreed to contribute free food,

fuel, water, transport and accommodation for the forces. He

would contact other Governments, particularly the Federal

Republic of Germany, to disajjs further contributions. He

would wish to consider the financial implications further with

Concluding, THE SECRETARY OF

increased British force would

support.   Although every effort

in that context, it was essential

to cope with the potential casualty

medical personnel would need to be add!

the area.   Seme of the 1,600 would need

hospitals in the United Kingdom which took in National Health

Service (NHS) patients.   Others would came from Service

hospitals in Germany.   The German Government had undertaken to

help fill the gap.   It might also be necessary to a^l up

reservists for the reinforcement, mainly in technical and

medical categories.     For the most part these wo3

THE CHIEF OF THE DEFENCE STAFF said that after careful

examination the preferred option on military grounds was to



lish a full British Armoured Division under British

command, for the reasons given by the Defence Secretary. If

conflict became necessary there would be only one opportunity to

achieve military success.   A short encounter would be preferable

to a prolonged campaign.   The reinforcements proposed were

essenj^l to achieving the military objectives which had been

set j



the following points were made:



of finance for the additional costs would

separately by the Chief Secretary,

the Secretary of State for Defence. However,

tary. Treasury did not wish to advise the

approval of the Defence Secretary&apos;s



the Chi

Cabinet

proposals



b.    A decision to send reinforcements to the Gulf would

demands on the latter were at thexa0e3K..   This could have

implications for NHS funding.   The Secretary of State for

Health would wish to discuss these with the Chief

Secretary, Treasury.
