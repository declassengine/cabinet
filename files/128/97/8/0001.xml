THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that British

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that

BAe&apos;s decision was regrettable in prolonging debate on the

issue. It would be necessary to consult the-Attorney General as

a matter of urgency on the implicatiftte \pf the Canpany&apos;s

3.     IHE  FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAITH SECRETARY  said that Iraqi

intimidation of Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the

run-up to the 26 July meeting of the Organisation of the

Petroleum Exporting Countries in Geneva continued.    The Iraqi

Government was accusing the Kuwaitis of being responsible for

the decline in oil prices due to over-production.    In fact oil

prices had new risen so that this problem might well diminish.

President Mubarak of Egypt and the Saudi Arabian Government were

attempting to mediate between the two countries.    The Kuwaiti

i^sqyernment was anxious to avoid conflict and might be prepared

/P&amp;&gt; reach a  financial  settlement with  Iraq.        Although a

&lt;:?/di^cmatic solution to the present crisis might be found, it was

? cmen for the future.    Iraq&apos;s President, Saddam Hussein,

that Iraq should become the leading nation in the

arid and the principal power in the Gulf.    The United

had no defence agreement with Kuwait and no commitment

to military intervention.   At the same time, a 70-strong British

Kuwait Liaison Team was at present in Kuwait, mainly servicing

the aircraf^bf the Kuwaiti Air Force.    The Kuwaiti Air Force

would not be able to operate without the support of the Liaison

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEALIH SECRETARY said tha

Czechoslovakia frcm 22-24 July and had had

President Havel and Foreign Minister Dienstbier

Havel was deriving wry enjoyment from the trapping:

He was devoting principal attention to the future of

difficult.   Ihe Soviet Government was insisting on being paid in

dollars   for   oil   supplies,   while   refusing   to   take Czech

industrial goods.   The Czech Government accepted that the key to

success was privatisation of state enterprises, though there was

sane difference of view about the pace at which this should be

implemented.   1he Czech Government had asked for British advice

on privatisation.   A team would be sent under the Kncw-Hcw Fund.

Help was also being given with English language training. The

^ Czech Government was locking forward to the Prime Minister  s

^yssit   in   September   to   which   they   attached considerable

z^fipprtance.     The situation  in Slovakia was different from

President Havel had asked the Prime Minister to start

;it in Bratislava as a gesture to the Slovaks. Although

nt Havel had reverted to the idea of a joint visit by the

&quot;Minister and the French President, M. Mitterrand, perhaps

mectian with the anniversary of the Munich Agreement, it

would be wrong for the British Government to be associated in

any way with commemorating the Munich Agreement.

firmly that all agricultural products should be included in the

negotiations. There should be no question of the Americans

splitting the Community in this way. If the United States

tactic was successful, the whole weight of reform would lie on

the backs of the United Kingdcm, French, German and Benelux

farmers, with the result that subsidies to United Kingdcm

farmers would be reduced while the Government&apos;s contribution to

subsidies to Mediterranean farmers would remain unchanged.



lypi a brief discussion, it was noted that the American approach

anted  a  reversal  of  the  line  agreed  at  the Houston

Lc Summit.  It was important to adhere to the position

there. Ihe Prime Minister would be meeting United States

Bush shortly, and would raise the matter with him.

The other significant  item considered by the Economic and

P^am. the Houston Economic Summit that there should be a study by

International Monetary Fund (IMF).  He had reported that

it such aid might cause difficulties. Reforms would not

5.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said th  ^l%e Defence

and Overseas Policy Committee had met the day Defor &gt; and had

approved his draft statement to the House of Ctommon^Jnwefence

policy options.   He was new seeking the approval of

colleagues to the statement.   The proposals had been

after careful consideration of the implications of the

which had taken place in Eastern Europe and the Sovief

It was essential that changes in the United Kingdom force

structures should be planned in a coherent and co-ordinated way

as part of the reshaping of broader Alliance strategy, to which

the Prime Minister and the British Government had made

significant contributions in recent months. Full consultation

on these proposal would therefore be undertaken with North

Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies and with the NATO

Secretary-General, on the basis of the Declaration agreed at the

? Summit in London. He was keen that the Services themselves

.d be involved in the consultation process since it was the

merit&apos;s duty to give as much information as possible to

whose cwn futures would be involved in the decisions. If

t approved the proposals, the Prime Minister would send

messages to President Bush, President Mitterrand,

lor Kohl and the Secretary-General of NATO. He would be

ch with his principal counterparts in the main NATO

countries in order to inform them of the statement. Under the

new proposals, the United Kingdom would retain its strategic

a four-boat Trident force, together with an

submarines and frigates. Direct air defence of

approximately 120,000 personnel.   The RAF would be reduced frcm

89,000 to approximately 75,000, and the Royal Navy/Royal Marines

would be reduced frcm their present actual level of 63,000 to

approximately 60,000.    Hence, regular Service manpower numbers

/  would be substantially cut frcm around 312,000 to about 255,000

?ar Service manpower by approximately 18 per cent.



OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had decided to

[tation.    The implications for research and development,

procurement and support would be examined. The proposals
