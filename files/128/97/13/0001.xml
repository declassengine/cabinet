&lt;Xpr parations in the Gulf were nearing completion.   On the

&lt;/dipl^t1atic front, there had been a spate of rumours about the

!he British Government&apos;s policy was to try to contain the issue

in such a way as to minimise the potential damage to allied

action in the Gulf, though the attitude of the Israeli

Government was making the task more difficult.



IHE FOREIGN AND CCMOJWEAITH SECRETARY said that the Supreme

//&lt;-xSoviet had passed a new law which would increase the pcwer of

x^rhe central authorities vis-a-vis the Republics.   The decision

be seen as a challenge on President Gorbachev&apos;s part to

ional authorities in a number of Republics, including the

Federation, Ukraine and Georgia.   The issue would be a

test of President Gorbachev&apos;s ability to maintain

authority in the Soviet Union,   and it was difficult to

Let how the Republics would react.   The Soviet Government&apos;s

request for economic assistance frcm Western countries would be

discussed afeJthe Special Eurcpean Council on 27-28 October in

4.         FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEAIIH SECRETARY said that, at its

meeting an 22 October, the Foreign Affairs Council had been due

to discuss the Community&apos;s overdue offer on reductions in

agricultural support which it should have tabled as part of the

Uruguay Round of negotiations under the General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade (GAIT).   But during informal discussion over

lunch the German Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, had made it

clear that he could not agree to the offer in its present form,

and other Ministers had been unwilling to override the German

sition.   He had himself stressed the danger which the delay

ited for the Round as a whole, and the unreality of the

unity trying to press ahead with further integration when

were in manifest disarray on an urgent matter of current

Agriculture and Trade Ministers were to consider the

OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND POOD said that, at

the resumed meeting, the Commission seemed likely to try to



ient support by making seme changes to the offer

&apos; proposing an undertaking from the Council that

ly German, farmers would be compensated from

or the loss of income which they would suffer

were that the lack of a GAIT settlement would not

and other countries; that the CAP in any case needed

reform to avoid surplus production and to target assi

the Ccmnunity as a whole, would in the long run be to British

farmers&apos; benefit.   It should also be remembered that the 30 per

cent reduction in support envisaged in the Community&apos;s offer was

based on 1986, so a lot of the reduction had already been

achieved.   The greatest difficulties were being experienced by

livestock farmers in upland and marginal areas, who had no

opportunities to diversify.   He considered that an increase in

the compensatory allowances paid on livestock in these areas

would be necessary, particularly bearing in mind the

environmental justification for this assistance and the lack of

for reducing overheads.   Other farmers would have to find

of cutting fixed costs.   Ihose who had bought land at too

a price, especially with borrowed money, might have to sell

farms at a loss but those who then bought them would have

l^^&gt;bverheads to bear.



In discussion, it was pointed out that it would be absurd for

the Community to put itself in the position where the United



it for the failure of the GAIT Round as a

position was logically weak.   Germany had a

j.on of its population engaged in farming than

member state, a particularly high proportion

only part-time and had another source of

Germany was wealthy enough to give them

from its own resources. Moreover
