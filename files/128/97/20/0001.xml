1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Ccnmans in the following week and in the first week

after the Christmas Recess.



THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that seven new clauses

had been tabled for consideration in the debate on capital

punishment on Monday 17 December.   These covered a range of

possible options and there was expected to be a series of votes

&apos;beginning at 10.00 pm.   There was particular difficulty about

Clause 4, which proposed the abolition of the death penalty

^treason and piracy, and which therefore raised wholly



issues frcm the other new clauses restoring the death

It was necessary to consider whether a free vote on

was appropriate.   He intended later that day to

ene^a meeting of colleagues most closely concerned to

ier what position the Government should adept. One

possibility was to refer the matter to a Select Committee or

seme other form of inquiry, but this might serve only to prolong

the difficulfef.   He would advise the Prime Minister and

colleagues /rnluie li&lt;^1t of his meeting.



In discussion(



following main points were made:



a. There

immediately

cases had

spies whose a

charged with

maintenance of the

inconsistent with

the end of the Second World War and those

ficult legal issues.   More recently

it was arguably difficult to

which the death penalty might be

ty for treason was not

of it for murder and there

in peace or war, where acts

b. A possible approach wau&amp;?? ^not to resist the

abolition of the death penalty\ or treason in peacetime but

to re-introduce it if necessary as part of the emergency

powers generally taken in times of war.   On the other hand,

this could involve a difficult decisi0iE$t a time of crisis

and it might be preferable to retain( (aie^)provision within

existing law.



c. It would not be possible to rely on

since acts of treason could be committed



d.    The public might find it hard to und

by Parliament to abolish the death penalty fo

the Government could be criticised if it did

lead.   It was particularly unfortunate that the

arose on an Opposition amendment and at a time wh

might shortly be military action in the Gulf.   It would

nevertheless be difficult for the Government to adept a

firm position on this, when it was allowing free votes on

the death penalty for murder.



e.    There were attractions in finding grounds to argue in

the debate that it would be wrong to change the status quo

without proper consideration, which had not been possible

since there had been so little notice of the amendment. On

this basis the Government needed for the present to take a

view only on matters of timing and handling, rather than on

the substance of the issue.



MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there

was&lt;vap2iear distinction between abolition of the death penalty

for murder and for treason. It would be undesirable to change

the status quo on treason at present. The implications of any

change would require careful consideration, which had not been

possible ij1/tbe time available. The lord President of the

Council shewdd^iscuss the matter with colleagues with a view to

finding a vra^yof^yoiding the matter ccming to a vote in the

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE OOUNC^SJwd that his proposed

Business Statement that day inclu^^a&gt;debate on Wednesday 16

January on the Revenue Support Gra^t/fRSG) Orders relating to

the local authority grant settlement^for the 1991/92 financial

year.   This was dependent on the assumption that the relevant

Orders for England and for Wales would be laid before the House

rose for the Christmas Adjournment.   If, ixC^he. event, the

orders were not laid before Christmas, he (would need to make a

revised business statement.



In discussion, it was noted that the Governmeh^^d.not yet

reached a view on the option of changing the setfiement, and it

was not yet clear whether they would do so befoi^^QvChristmas

Recess.      Once the RSG orders had been laid it waul;

possible for local authorities to calculate the impl

community charge for their areas and there could be

criticism of the results.   Any change in RSG following,

could seem to be a reaction to pressure, rather than &apos;

consequence of a constructive and soundly-based decision. It

would therefore be wrong to table the Orders while the

possibility of adjusting the settlement remained an option. In

explaining why the Orders were not being laid before Christmas

it would be essential not to raise expectations that local

authority grants for 1991/2 would be enhanced.



IHE       MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

Lance of probability was that the Government would not be in a

;ition to lay the RSG Orders before Christmas.   On this basis,

Ld not be prudent for the lord President of the Council to

the debate as proposed.   He should agree with the

?ies of State for the Environment, Wales and Scotland a

form of words for use at his Business Statement that

to explain the position.   Although continuing

was to be expected, deferring the orders was

THE HCME SECRETARY said that in the course of their

investigations into Polly Peck, the Serious Fraud Office had

cane across material suggesting a recent connection between that

Company and Mr Wyn Jones, an Assistant Commissioner in the

Metropolitan Police.   It was possible that these connections

were not substantial.   Hewever, Mr Jones was a well-known police

officer, who had been involved in the policing of both the

Wapping disturbances and the demonstrations at Greenham Common,

reports of the investigation had been carried in the Sun

ssioner of the Metropolitan Police, had reported to him the

continued, and the issue might be pressed to a vote within the

next two or three days.   Since a United States veto would place

the coalition under strain, it was important to find language

for a Resolution in which the United States Government could

It was extremely important that the Uni

continued to get across its views on

agriculture, including the 1991 price pa&lt;

where the united Kingdom had important objectives, for

example in respect of United States protection of its high

technology industry and Japanese protection of its

financial service industries.   The latter was being pursued

in the context of the negotiations for an agreement on

services. On the former, tariff support for high

technology products would be reduced in the GATT round,

though probably not by as much as we would have hoped. It

was pointed out, however, that the United States practice

of not buying nan-American technology unless they did not

possess it themselves posed a fundamental barrier.



MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that it was

it the United Kingdom needed to press to get the

negotiations resumed, and should do what it could to this end at

the European Council, looking at all its interests in the

negotiation.

lints were made:



a. It was noted that the idea of a Treaty amendment on

education had been discussed at the Education Council on 6

December.   All other Ministers, includSb, the Danish

Minister, had reacted favourably. There was a danger that a

Treaty amendment which sought to legirStdS^current

Community action in the areas of educatSi^Qn^ors health wculd

be used by the Commission to extend activ^^sxinto

undesirable areas, such as school curricula



b. It was suggested that it could be against

Kingdom interests to attempt to secure a defi

subsidiarity in the Treaty unless we could be

securing ideal language.

issues that needed to be addressed.



THE HUME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

points made in discussion should be taken into account in

preparations for discussions in the IGC.   Subject to these

points, the Cabinet endorsed the approach set cut in CP(90) 1.
