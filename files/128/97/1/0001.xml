THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the Opposition had

chosen the effect of the introduction of charges for eye tests

first subject for debate on the Opposition Day on

&quot;ay 6 June.   He expected the Opposition argument to turn

claim that charges were a disincentive, but he would be

announce the results of a survey which shewed an

THE HCME SECRETARY said that the War Crimes Bill had been

defeated on second reading in the House of Lords on Monday 5

June by a majority of 207 to 74.   There were strong arguments

for reaching and announcing in good time before the Summer

Recess a decision on the reintroduction of the Bill the

following Session paving the way for the use of the Parliament

Acts if necessary, though an immediate announcement that the

Bill was to be reintroduced would seem hasty and petulant. He

saw no force in the argument made in seme quarters that,



tuse the &quot;Salisbury doctrine&quot; that the House of Lords should

reject a Manifesto carmitment did not apply to this Bill,

? was no case for using the Parliament Acts:   the reverse

case since, if the &quot;Salisbury doctrine&quot; was followed,

the only sort of measure to which the Parliament Acts

ly.   He foresaw serious embarrassment for the



if it decided not to reintroduce the Bill and a

ler successful in the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills

were to introduce the measure in the forthcoming Session.

THE HCME SECRETARY said that on the evening of 1 June three

soldiers had been shot while waiting for a train at Lichfield

Statical.   One of the soldiers had died a few hours later. Ihe

Provisional Irish Republican Amy   (PIRA) had claimed

responsibility for the shooting.   The police had assembled

descriptions of two men thought to have been involved in the

incident, but they were disappointed that members of the public

had been unable to give more detailed descriptions. Five

arrests had been made, but all five detainees had new been

&apos;.eased because no connection with the shooting could be

* lished.   Ihe most worrying aspect of the incident was the

f firearms by PIRA terrorists as the sole means of carrying

attack on the mainland for the first time since November



Jssion it was noted that, although there appeared to be

&apos;uctance on the part of eye witnesses to cane forward in

this case, it wculd be important in the event of any further

terrorist attacks to ensure that no information was held back

3.     THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND CCMM3NWEALIH OFFICE (MR

WAIDEGRAVE) said that, as the Prime Minister was aware frcm her

direct contacts with the United States President, Mr George

Bush, the atmosphere at the Americar^Scvie^sAiM  in Washington

frcm 31 May to 3 June had been good.   Progr^shad been made on

a number of bilateral issues including an

Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START), and

chemical weapons, nuclear testing and American/

Ihe trade agreement had been linked to the passagi

unification of Germany and German membership of the North

Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO).   President Bush had firmly

adhered to the Alliance position.   There had perhaps been a hint

of movement on the Soviet side late in the discussions. The

Soviet President, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had accepted that the

signature of an agreement on Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)

should be linked to the holding of a Summit meeting later this

year of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.

The joint Soviet/American statement an CFE was an important step

J, which committed both countries to intensifying progress

an agreement.   However, two arms control issues had

which were of major concern to the United Kingdom.

President Gorbachev had taken a much harder line than

ly on non-circumvention of the START agreement. The

question concerned the future of the arrangements for

of United States technology and equipment to the United

under the Trident programme.   Under existing patterns of

co-operation the united Kingdom was the sole country to which

the United States transferred such technology and equipment.



Gorbachev had reversed the position which he

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND OCMM3NWEACIH OFFICE said that

the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had visited Jordan and

Saudi Arabia from 30 May to 3 June.   He had been concerned about

the situation he found in the Middle East and the pressures

which were being exerted upon friendly nations in the area. A

wave of radicalism was sweeping the Arab countries.   Two recent

factors had contributed to the increase in tension.   The first

was the abortive seaborne attack an 30 May an the Israeli coast

which had been carried out by the Palestine Liberation Front

The PLF was a faction of the Palestine Liberation

tion (FLO), and the leader, Mr Abul Abbas, was a member

FLO Executive Committee.   The second was the United

veto, and its heavy-handed diplomacy, at the meetings of

Nations Security Council which took place in Geneva

May and then New York an 30/31 May.   The terrorist

had increased the pressure inside Israel frcm those who

that the peace process was fraudulent.   The United

handling of the Geneva debate had contributed to a rise

feeling in the Arab countries.   This was

air, since the United States Secretary of State,

made considerable efforts to take forward

The Commission&apos;s intention had been publicly known

months and it was not clear what had stimulated press

this moment.    Documents dating frcm 19S5 and 19S6 had

subsequently been leaked to the press, purporting to

the Government had deliberately delayed measures to canply with

the Directive in order to improve the prospects for the

privatisation of the water industry.   In response to the press

reports he would be pointing out that three quarters of bathing

beaches in the United Kingdom new ccnplied with the Directive

compared with half three years ago.   Complete canpliance would

be achieved as soon as possible as a result of a  3 billion

investment programme.   Far from delaying this programme,

arivatisatian had brought it forward.    An enquiry into the leak

documents was being recommended to the Cabinet Secretary. He

not believe that the leak would make the defence of the

Court case more difficult:   it was possible to shew

Emissions of

In ^\brief discussion it was pointed out that, as it had been

legally obliged to do, the Government had referred in the

failure to ggiRly with the Directive.   Present problems arose

States would be secured by allowing them to stabilise emissions

at a higher level or at later dates.    He h^d made it very clear

that the United Kingdom would not be able t^ateree to this

target, and public criticism of our position,ps^to be expected.



In a brief discussion it was pointed out thai

by 2000, although their precise offer was still the subject of

disagreement within the Government.   The measures required in

the united Kingdom to achieve stabilisation at 1990 levels by

this date would involve a sharp cut in the use of coal for

generating electricity and its replacement by gas or nuclear

power;   this wculd not be publicly acceptable.



,SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that at the same

the Community would need to determine its position for

meeting in London to review the Montreal

on substances that deplete the ozone layer. He

a successful outcome to this meeting was possible, in

of tougher targets and more signatories to the

including seme developing countries.   The main

potential problem was the attitude of the United States. It

would be important to put pressure an them to accept the ideas

of the IJhilMd^Lngdcm and other countries for additional

financial assistance to developing countries.
