THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had had no notice

of statements in the following week apart from a statement by

the Prims Minister, probably on Wednesday 21 November, on the

outcome of the Summit on Conventional Forces in Europe. It

would be helpful if in planning future statements colleagues

    CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER said that the sterling rate of

exchange had been unsettled over the past few days for a number

of reasons including the present political uncertainty in the

United Kingdcm, a factor which particularly influenced Japanese

markets; the continuing weakness of the dollar, which still

tended to influence sterling; and the strength of the

Deutschmark, reflecting expectations of an interest rate rise in

Germany.   Certain other European currencies had also fallen

against the Deutschmark and in assessing the overall position of

;^sterling account had to be taken of the effect of this on the



/jD^rds within the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European

&lt;xjfrffietary System.   Sterling was in fact as far above the

which arose directly out of education policy itself.   On the

latter, the Government&apos;s policies on grant-maintained schools

were designed to increase the resources being made available to

local authorities on central administration, and had been widely

(CELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in April 1990 Customs

officers at Teeside had detained eight large steel tubes which

were to be exported to Iraq on behalf of two British companies,

the Commissioners the view that the tubes themselves were

components of a gun in order not to prejudice the condemnation

proceedings.   Wider questions might be raised about arrangements

for export licensing and the conduct of particular Departments.

Ihe handling of these issues was being co-ordinated by the

Cabinet Office.



;X&apos;CTHE       MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it

//W$ls important in any statement to underline the statutory

^-^i^epereience of the Commissioners of C&amp;E in reaching their

&lt;^tedsions on possible prosecutions.   Until the Commissioners1

it had been made in Court, the matter remained sub

Although there was already sufficient legal justification for

the use of force under Article 51 of the united Nations Charter,

Security Council endorsement would enable the United States

Government to suggest to Congress that it would be unreasonable

on their part to refuse to support action which had already been

approved by the Security Council.   A major effort was now

beginning in the United Nations to secure agreement on the text

of a suitable Security Council Resolution.   The objective was to

achieve agreement during November while the United States held

Presidency of the Security Council. Passage of the

lution would be preceded by a debate in the Security Council

the initiative of the Kuwaiti Government, focussing on the

ction caused in Kuwait by the Iraqi forces and their

ity towards the inhabitants.   The Soviet attitude was

ting and difficult to predict.   Nevertheless, there was a

mable chance that the Soviet Government would be prepared

to co-operate over a debate and a Resolution in the Security

Council in view of its developing relationship with the United

the British Ambassador in Kuwait, Mr Michael Weston, to convey

the Cabinet&apos;s appreciation of the courage and steadfastness

shown by him and his staff.   Within Iraq there were new signs of
