1.    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons and the House of lords in the following

week.



THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Opposition had

given notice that they intended to move the writs for the

^outstanding by-elections for the Paisley North and Paisley South

3nstituencies that afternoon.   There was a possibility that the

:ish National Party would seek to debate the writs, in order

ay the start of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Autumn



it and to cause embarrassment to the Government. The

sitian had tabled a Private Notice Question (PNQ) on the

5ion by British Steel to close the Clydesdale steelworks and

mill in Lanarkshire with a loss of seme 1,200 jobs, in an

attempt to foreshorten any debate on the writs.   He and the

Secretary^oS. State for Scotland  agreed that the PNQ should be

resisted//for policy and business management reasons.   He and

the Oiiek^hipr^were seeking alternative ways of minimising delay

to the Autumn Statement.



THE LORD PRESIDENT,^/?

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE O0UNCIL\^aid that for each of the past

three years the Cabinet had agreed relatively modest increases

in Ministerial salaries, awarding Ministers and paid office

holders the same cash increase as backbenrfl^Members of

Parliament.   As a result, Parliamentary (salaries had increased

by 44 per cent, whereas Ministerial salaH&amp;s^S^d increased by

roughly half this amount, and the differenMajs/tod been eroded.

For the following year, he proposed to awarct^^/Ministers and

paid office holders the same percentage incr^sex^%backbench

Members of Parliament, that is 8.5 per cent. The^kmisterial

increases would take effect frcm 1 January 1991.   K^cblleagues

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that

although an 8.5 per cent increase in Ministers&apos; salaries could

draw criticism, against the background of the previous three

years&apos; increases and the current level of settlements in both

the public and private sectors, the Cabinet agreed it could be

justified.



The Cabinet -



Took note, with approval of the Prime

Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,

and invited the lord President to proceed

accordingly.



2.        SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the report of

the publip^wuiry into the Piper Alpha platform explosion,

chaired wl^d Cullen, would be published on 12 November, and

he would r3e&gt;rt@king a statement to the House of Commons on that

day.   Ihe repo^n was an extensive document which was critical of

the maragemen^iG^ Occidental Petroleum who had operated the

platform.   Th^r^EOrt. also contained seme criticism of the

Department of Et^gyNand its Inspectors.   lord Cullen had

proposed a new saieiyxregime for offshore oil platforms, which

involved transferri^^^ponsibility to the Health and Safety



fort for the Opposition since lord

had received a broadly reassuring message from President

Gorbachev, although the wording still left seme room for doubt

about the Soviet position.    The balance of evidence suggested

that the Soviet Union would not dissent from the use of force if

this became necessary.   At the United Nations, the United States

had assumed the Presidency of the Security Council for the month

of November.   The British and United States Governments were in

close consultation about hew to make best use of this period.

One approach currently under discussion would be to stimulate a

^kdebate in the Security Council to focus public attention on the

/&gt;^amage and suffering caused by the Iraqi invasion and occupation

&lt;/\0f Kuwait.   The problem of Western hostages in Iraq and Kuwait

&lt;/^ntinued to cause concern.   The Iraqi Government appeared to

concluded that it gained in propaganda terms by releasing

lostages in small numbers.   The Iraqis had been encouraging

its by eminent public figures from the West.   The former West

Chancellor, Herr Brandt, and the former Japanese Prime

Minister, Mr Nakasane, had both visited Baghdad.   Herr Brandt&apos;s

visit raiyeounter to the declaration issued at the European

Council ^p2W28 October and there was evidence that the German

Foreign rujdster, Herr Genscher, had encouraged Herr Brandt.

Such activircdSlmade the position of the 600 British people at

present in in Kuwait more difficult and dangerous.

impossible to envisage happening in practice, but the French had

tried to inject into the Council&apos;s statement a phrase that would

extend protection. In the event, this attempt had been resisted

and the language in the statement had been taken from previously

agreed documents. The claimed increase in compensatory measures

Treasury (C(90)9), on the 1990 Public Expenditure Survey.



    CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the initial bids had

totalled seme  17% billion for 1991-92 rising to  22^ billion

and  28 billion for the two later years.   A large proportion of

the bids had been unavoidable, including the  2^ billion cost of

the settlement for local authorities,  3 billion for additional

demand-led social security expenditure and  lh billion for items

already agreed before the Survey.   Higher interest rates had led

to increased spending on Housing Revenue Accounts and by the

  j_ 1111 1 11 11 i I   Guarantee Department.   The total of unavoidable

bidlfm   hus amounted to  8^ billion in the first year. Ihe



tionary bids had been reduced by 70 per cent

during the bilaterals to  2^ billion.   Savings had been made in



Ihe programmes of the Department of Trade

ially in the later years, arising from the

Ipptions for Change&quot;.   Overall, the additions

amounted to  11 billion in 1991-92 and

After drawing down the Reserves

previous plans, the addition to the planning

total for next year was  8 billion, in line with the cost of the

unavoidable additions.   Infrastructure expenditure would be

safeguarded, since a quarter of the  8 billion addition would be

Service running costs, where there would be a cash increase of

pressures from certain new policies and from higher

accommodation costs, this was an area in which he ^ould be

aiming to achieve a tighter result in future.   Civil Service

numbers would however be at least 3000 below pubiishedyplans,

despite bids for an additional 7000.



Cabinet had decided that priority must be given in

to the need to defeat inflation.   The outcome meant

inflation was being absorbed, and that there would be a

reduction in real terms from the previous plans for next

Domestic Product (GDP) would remain stable at 39h per cent,

before falling to 39 per cent in 1993-94.   Overall, this was a

tight settlement.   It would be important to present the outcome

on programmes in a way which struck a balance between the

benefits of the agreed increases and the maintenance of sound

finances.   He thanked colleagues for their cooperation in

achieving what he believed to be a good result in both political

and financial terms.



THE CHANCELLOR OF IHE EXCHEQUER said that the Chief Secretary

was to be congratulated on a successful outcome to the Survey.

Against the background of higher inflation it was, he believed,

a ticjAer settlement than any achieved in recent years.

Inflation had not been fully accomodated.   Keeping the ratio of

GGE to GDP stable, with seme decline in the last year of the

Survey period was a significant achievement, since at this stage

in the economic cycle an increase in the ratio was to be

expected.^J^j^ixing Reserves he had to aim at levels which

would be credible given the uncertainties for economic prospects

arising, for example, frcm the situation in the Gulf. He

therefore proposed figures of  3h billion in 1991-92,  7 billion

in 1992-93, aiftSOLbillion in 1993-94, which were higher than

in the existing p^jpW  He had also decided to fix privatisation

receipts at  5h t 11ion a year, in line with the levels of

recent years.   This would give planning totals of  200 billion,

 215 billion, and  226 billion in the three survey years, and

increases on previous plans of  8 billion in 1991-92 and  11.6

billion in 1992-93. These

As regards the economy, events in the Gulf had raised oil

prices, and this had affected both inflation and past and

projected activity.   The Government had succeeded in slowing the

economy, but the effect of weaker activity had yei

through in lower inflation.   For 1990, the

likely to be 1 per cent, as in the Budget fo:

higher than expected in the first half of the y&lt;

the second.   Inflation as measured by the Retail Pr

(RPI) was likely to peak close to its current level

falling before the end of the year.   The trade balance1

improved, and the current account deficit for the year

forecast to be  15^ billion, virtually unchanged from the&apos;

forecast.   Public finances were somewhat weaker, and the

A



forecast Public Sector Debt Repayment for 1990-91 was  3 billion

rather than the  7 billion expected at Budget time. This

reflected, in particular, higher local authority borrowing and

weaker public corporation finances.   There was no need to be

defensive about this outcome.   The United Kingdom&apos;s fiscal

position was stronger than that of any of the Group of Seven

major industrial countries except Japan.   This was moreover the

fourth successive year of debt repayment. Inflationary

pressures were under control, with MO within its target range,

and with good figures in prospect.   The grewth of broad money

was down sharply.   Membership of the European Exchange Rate

Mechanism (ERM) would also help to bring inflation dewn.



For^^k. although output might initially continue to weaken,

In discussion the following main points



dllcwing day.



made:



a. On social security, it was proposed to legislate to

move frcm 100 per cent to 80 per cent reimbursement of



employers&apos; statutory sick pay costs. About,

effect on employers would be offset by a

reduction in employers&apos; National Insurance

!here might be some complaint from the Confed!

British Industry, and perhaps particularly f:

National Federation of Self Employed (NFSE)

important to the Government&apos;s wider strategy on

security that more of the cost of short term si

should be borne by employers, so that social sect:

SECRET


secret



provision could be concentrated on long term sickness and

disability for which only the state could provide. The

reduction in National Insurance contributions was tilted

towards lower paid employees, and this should be broadly

beneficial to NFSE members.   The Secretary of State for

Social Security would ensure that colleagues were fully

briefed on these changes, which had already been indicated

in his statement on the uprating, and he would welcome

their support for the approach of shifting short term

sickness costs to employers.



b.    Although there was a small increase in the employment

in the first year, the need to accommodate

ises on the European Social Fund and on redundancy

meant that offsetting reductions had had to be

Lch had been concentrated on Employment Training.

Lected a review of the range of provision for the

unemployed, and a shift away from training

measures such as Jab Clubs and the Job

itee Scheme which might be more effective in

term unemployed into jobs.   There was also

sion for Youth Training, and Training and

Ls would be given wide flexibility in

jets.   Nevertheless, the settlement

would be difficult to present, and it would be necessary to

emphasise the deliberate switch in priorities which had

taken place.



spending th&lt;



c.    There were

expenditure in the 1

cutbacks had been def

negotiations on force

would be felt very widely

industries, suppliers, stora

aerodromes and dockyards.



reductions in defence



For tactical reasons

international

were in progress, but it

ground, and the effects

put the country on defence

training units, and on



d.     There might be complaints flpn^Sfc scientific

community that the science budget \0FW}t being increased

in real terms, but this overlooked the substantial increase

of 25 per cent over the last two years.



e. The resources available would give only limited scope

to respond to current pressures on the farming community.



f. The tight provision for local authority

expenditure would restrict shire district to

programmes, reviving concerns about rural hous



g.    The settlement on the Foreign and Commonweal&apos;

programme would not fulfil the ambitions of the Brit

Council and the British Broadcasting Corporation 0v&lt;

Services, and on the basis of present figures it would be

necessary to close seme diplomatic posts in due course.

Substantial pressures were in prospect on the aid budget,

for example to help the Soviet union, and to alleviate the

effects of the Gulf situation on the Commonwealth and on

Eastern Europe.



h. The increase in police manpower was well below the

bids which Chief Constables had made, but any complaint

could be answered effectively on the basis that the

Government had this year given priority to the vehicles,

plant, and equipment which were needed if police manpower

ure to be used effectively.



i. The trade and industry programme was broadly

unchanged, but gross aid was to continue at a significant

level with its cost increasingly offset by repayments of

laui^h ^d. Programmes which were to be announced for small

and medium sized companies would be well received.



j.    There might be same disappointment with the transport

settlement on the part of British Rail and London

Transport,^u^Aogh the Government had moved from a low

base to quit^^Sstantial provision for investment in

recent years.   This had increased their ambition for

further investment.   Both wished to pursue plans involving

bath modernisation and major projects such as Channel

Tunnel investment, the ,Jubilee Line extension, and East

West crossrail.



k.     In Wales it would^BH^pessary to lay emphasis on the

increased effectiveness with which existing provision was

being spent; to this end J^wAld help if not too much was

made of increases in the lel^^e programmes in England.



THE       MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

Cabinet endorsed the agreements which the Chief Secretary had

reached on individual programmes, and%onJbtulated him on the

outcome of the Survey.   Cabinet had not^^^eral points on

which there might be specific political problems, but in general

the Government could take a positive view of the Survey outcome

and of economic prospects.   Over the coming year inflation would

be falling, and the public finances were in bettershape than in

any of our major competitors other than Japan. Fte^^cturing of

industry, and associated changes in the roles ofmA^jement and

unions, had been taken further in the United Kingd^^^n in

competing European countries.   This would provide

foundation on which to build in the coming upturn.

Chancellor was to be congratulated on his very sound

the economy over the past year.   She thanked colleagues1

their cooperation in the settlement which had been reach*
