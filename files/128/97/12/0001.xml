1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Cannons and the House of lords in the following

week.



THE CHIEF WHIP asked colleagues to emphasise to their junior

Ministers and Parliamentary Private Secretaries the importance

of being available to vote on opposed private business after 7pm

on Monday 22 October and Wednesday 24 October.   Because it was

not possible to whip the Party on private business, their

attendance was needed to secure the passage of business to which

e Government attached importance.



1RD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it would not now be

le to complete the passage of the Ministerial and Other

Offices (Pensions and Salaries) Bill during the spillover. One

or two matters were still under discussion with the Trustees of

the ParliarjSentary Pensions Scheme, and it was necessary to came

to an ag1raem#t on these if the Bill was to make swift progress

in the HabsV^^Ccmnons.

summing up a brief discussion, said that it

2.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that sterling had

joined the Exchange Rate Mechanism (EFM)of the European Monetary

System with effect from the start of busifiesk in London on

Monday 8 October.   There had been a conc^xeKtt^reduction in

interest rates at the same time by 1 per ceHtT^ho 14 per cent.

There had been a good deal of comment subsel^a^ly about the

timing of these events, particularly the cut ^mjterest rates.

The cut had been entirely warranted by the monqca^y^ituat ion.

A range of indicators, including figures not ye^pi^Ushed,

shewed that monetary growth had fallen to within its^target

range, bank lending was decelerating, and a number&apos;&quot;

indicators, including surveys by the Confederation

Industry, demonstrated that the economy was slewing dc

substantially.   Against this background, it had been ?

necessary to reduce interest rates, and the Governor of

of England had supported the move.   Equally, it had been

necessary to announce the cut in base rates concurrently with

the announcement of sterling&apos;s entry to the EFM.   A reduction in

advance of entry would have given unfortunate signals to the

market, and might have driven down the exchange rate at the

wrong moment, or implied that the United Kingdcm was seeking to

delay entry.



Sterling had entered the mechanism with a central rate against

the Deutschmark of 2.95 and with 6 per cent bands around its

itral rates; these were precisely the terms on which entry had



sought.   The United Kingdom&apos;s decision had been warmly

ccmed in Europe, except by the !?resident of the Commission,

deques Delors, whose response had been rather grudging. The

&apos;.al markets were new settling down following an initial

1 sterling and on the Stock Market. On seme days

ence in the Far East markets, as a result of internal

factors in Japan, had temporarily depressed the value of the

pound, though not belcw the central rate.



ContinuinaC V&amp;a CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that this

reinforcCT^il^ofx monetary policy made it essential to control

costs in botinjhe^rivate and public sectors, and he would be

stressing theTSpatf for restraint in his Mansion House speech

that evening. ^E^wpqld also be essential to emphasise the

Government&apos;s deteriw^ion to maintain sterling&apos;s value within

the 6 per cent band?

August was provisionally put at 50, the Iwe^L^August figure

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that

Leicestershire, would be published later that day. ?

incorrectly diagnosed by the pilots who had consequently shut

down the good engine.   The failing engine had finally broken up

just short of the runway of the East Midlands Airport and the

aircraft had crashed on the Ml Motorway.   The AAIB were

specifically barred frcm apportioning blame, but the report was

clearly critical of the pilots, the engine manufacturer and the

procedures for certificating the engines.   The report contained

31 safety recommendations, of which the Civil Aviation Authority

had already accepted 27.   They were working further on the

remaining 4 which they were expected to accept in due course,

unlikely to have a serious long term effect.   The Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary had had useful discussions in Egypt, and

with the Israeli Foreign Minister.   There was evidence of a

significant improvement in Jordan&apos;s performance over sanctions

against Iraq.   Crown Prince Hassan was taking closer control

over Jordanian policy.   A Soviet emissary, Mr Primakov, who had

earlier had discussions in Baghdad, was now conducting a series

of visits to Italy, France and the United States.   During his

discussions he appeared to be giving a misleadingly optimistic

:/^ ^impression of the prospects for peace on the basis of compromise

the Gulf.



SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the personnel of

Armoured Brigade were beginning to arrive in Saudi

in significant numbers.   In the period to 29 October

ther  would be four flights per day of TriStar and Boeing 747

aircraft carrying troops to Saudi Arabia.   The first two ships

carrying equipment were due to arrive shortly in Saudi Arabia,

and the transportation of equipment would be completed by 4

November.((!he Commander of the British Forces in the Middle

East, Generai^d6*\ la Billiere, was already well established in-

theatre and (h d/set up effective links with the United States

delivery of certa&amp;n^^itish newspapers to the 7th Armoured

4.     THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE FISHERIES AND POOD said that

the Agriculture Council had held a further discussion of the

proposed offer on reducing agricultural support which the

Ccnmmity was committed to table in the Uruguay Round of

negotiations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade

(GATT).   The Commission&apos;s proposal had again been attacked by

member states.   Only the United Kingdom, Denmark and the

 lands had supported it.   In an effort to reach agreement

:talian Presidency had proposed a separate Council



it, about the manner in which the common agricultural

might be adjusted following a GAIT agreement. This

it, initially unwelcome but acceptable, had then been

revised in an unacceptable way to include an amendment to the

proposed offer itself.   The discussion had broken up in disarray

and would resume on 19 October.   He hoped that the Commission

the earliest opportunity.
