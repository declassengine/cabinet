1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Caramons and the House of lords the following week.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEAIHH said that a number of

amendments had been tabled by backbench members for the



ining stages of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill.

? some of these raised new points, others were aimed at

issues relating to abortion on which the House had

1 view on a free vote at the Committee Stage.   Under the

ons applying to Report Stage amendments, such amendments

? normally be selected, and it would be right to make

itions to the Speaker to this effect.   Members of the

lobby were objecting to the Government&apos;s decision to

impose^a two line whip  on Third Reading of the Bill, on the

grounds that seme members would be required to vote against



their consci

2.     THE HCME SECRETARY said that he had

morning that Counsel for the Director of Publ

(DPP) would be telling the Inquiry into the c

Guildford Four case, chaired by Sir John May,

the convictions of seven people in 1976 for

explosives had been unsafe and unsatisfactory,

that the DPP had reached this view as a result of ne

science tests carried out for the Inquiry.   It was no

intention to criticise those who had given forensic evi&lt;

the original trial.   It was to be expected that Sir John

would concur with DPP&apos;s conclusion and it would be neces

consider during the day how to respond to this development.

There would inevitably be claims in the media that the

convictions of six people for the 1975 Birmingham pub bombing

were also unsafe, since those convictions were also based partly

on scientific evidence.   The two cases were, however, different.

on a public consultation in relation to the Derby CTC and any

subsequent proposals.   He wished to alert colleagues to this

unexpected legal advice, which might be relevant to other areas

where decisions were not subject to a statutory consultation&apos;

procedure.



In a brief discussion, it was pointed out that this appeared to

!resent an extension in the circumstances requiring

insultation which could have wide repercussions.   While it had

right not to test the issue in this case, it would be

to consider whether the Government should contest this

it in the Courts in a further instance.

3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECTARY said that the

violence in Bucharest over the past twfenty-four hours had been

caused by the measures taken by the Romanian Government to

remove students and hunger strikers frcm Uniyssqsity Square

There were unconfirmed reports of several

Although the disturbances could not be descri

Romanian elections probably reflected the balance of

opinion, the procedures had been flawed to a cons ide

extent.   The British Government would continue to adopt

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMDNWEAITH SECRETARY said that in contrast to

Romania, the elections in Czechoslovakia had been well-

conducted.   There had been a 96 per cent turnout with a sweeping

victory for the Civic Forum and Public Against Violence parties,

who had been supported by President Havel.   The Christian

Democrat vote had been lower than expected, marginally below

t of the Communist Party.   The two principal tasks facing the

Government were economic reform and drafting a new

itutian which would satisfy Slovak national aspirations.



THE FS^IGN AND CCMMONWEAITH SECRETARY said that the first round

of the Bulgarian elections had been reasonably free and fair.

aver NATO&apos;s future was not the question of wh&lt;

by NATO, the integrated command structure and the continuation

ways of making further progress in the current arms control

discussions, particularly the negotitions on Conventional Forces

in Europe (CFE).   It new seemed possible for a CFE agreement to

be signed in the autumn, followed by a CSCE Summit in Paris in

new accelerating.   All-German elections were scheduled to

President Gorbachev had not sought to deny that a uni

German membership of NATO.

Continuing, the Prime Minister said that President Gorbachev had

also talked about Soviet policy towards the Baltic States. He

had shewn his irritation with the Lithuanian leadership but had

indicated that he was new more hopeful of making progress.

Since then the Council of the Federation had met on 12 June with

the leaders of the Baltic States present.   President Gorbachev

had described the pressure which was new being exerted upon him

^by Arab Governments over the flew of Soviet emigrants into the

Csraeli occupied territories.   She had urged him to maintain the

of permitting emigration from the Soviet Union.



briefly describing her meeting with the Soviet Defence

and General Staff, the Prime Minister said that she had

^a useful discussion with Prime Minister Ryzhkov. She

that his attitude was still based on the principle

should be dictated by the Central Government and

throughout the Soviet Union, despite his Government&apos;s

commitment to moving towards a free market.   He had argued that

it was essential to compensate Soviet workers for price

increases bwnigper wages.   His sense of commitment to a genuine

economic liberalisation was doubtful, and his programme would

now be substant^aMAj. revised following discussion in the

Congress of Pet^i^s/ Deputies.

In a brief discussion, it was noted that one of the

regional problems in the Soviet Union concerned the

the food transport and distribution system.    30 to 4(

of the food production did not reach the market place,

was no distribution structure involving wholesalers, mic

or multiple stores,   !here was more food available in

countryside than in Moscow or the other major cities. The

existence of an efficient black market system alleviated the

problem to sane extent.   Eastern European countries were no

longer prepared to accept payment for their food deliveries

through the rouble account in the form of sub-standard Soviet

products.   British companies were encountering increasing

problems over obtaining payment from Soviet enterprises which

had become self-financing, since the Central Government no

longer accepted responsibility for repayment.



REIGN AND CCMMDNWEAITH SECRETARY said that fighting was

around Sierra Leone, although the two sides had now

satiations.   Two British naval vessels were standing off



in case there was a need for rapid evacuation.

Embassies had advised their residents, to leave Liberia,

and most had now done so.    ?Ihe situation would be kept under

close watch.

Denmark had subsequently followed suit.   It had also been agreed

that the Commission should investigate whether BSE was occurring

outside the United Kingdcm and Ireland:   evidently the French

authorities considered it was occurring there, and they had that

week made the disease notifiable.     Following the Council

meeting, he had promulgated certain changes in slaughterhouse

practices recommended by the Standing Veterinary Committee.



OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a major

between the United Kingdom and other Member States at

rnment Council on targets for reductions in emissions

dioxide had not happened.   The Council had been

in a workmanlike manner and had finished early. A

number &quot;of useful measures had been adopted.   Discussion of

climatic change had not ended in disagreement.   It was evident

undecided on what should follow the first stage, while the

German Minister, Herr Waigel, had helpfully emphasised economic

convergence as a precondition for monetary union.   There was

evidently disagreement an the nature of a Community central

bank, with the French wanting it to be politically accountable

in same way, and the Germans insisting on independence. On

economic union, the Commission had repeated their opposition to

linding budgetary rules, although he was not convinced that they

*1.d maintain this line.   The discussion also contained



ing features.    All other Ministers had taken it as given

a single central bank and single currency would inevitably

pjiableffls would be overcome.   Further, the southern Member States

wera5Sudently building up a case for additional budgetary

transfers.   The Chairman of the Bundesbank, Herr Poehl, had

hint^Xduring the meeting, and had explicitly stated to the

press afterwards, that the likely outcome was an initial move to

monetary union by an inner core consisting of the Member States

with more conjzergent economies, probably Germany, France and

Benelux.    ,nies^j remarks had naturally caused concern to the

southern Membekr^St&amp;tes.
