0^rnd BiUlJe , THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that an amend- ^1*8 ment had been tabled to remove the requirement, inserted byete1ce. Mr George Cunningham&apos;s earlier amendment, that the provisions- The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.F^Ue       ^e^ate: The Cabinet considered the arrangements for handling the debatej. 1^ ]^   J&quot;* *Abu        ^ on PuWic purchasing and the abuse of Ministerial power which^steria]186 0* ^e Opposition ^ad chosen as the subject for the Supply Day debatea Power on Monday, 13 February.    The Governments power to includeclauses relating to pay policy in Governmont contracts was not in doubt.    The only ground for criticism v/as that they necessarilvreferred to pay policy as it operated at the time, and there were no juridical means of dcterrrdng whether a settlement *vas withinor outside the policy.    There was however no practical alter-native to this situation and, despite recent criticism by the media,there was widespread recognition by die public generally and bysome firms that the Government could not apply a strict paypolicy in the public sector without taking corresponding action inthe private sector.    While standing firmly on Its position theGovernment should however avoid appearing not to treat the matter as one of seriousness, about *vhich concern extended to some sections of the trade union movement and the parliamentary labour Party.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Government should not be deflectedby the recent tone of the media from pursuing their present policies and should take a robust attitude in the debate, whiletreating the matter as a serious one.    The overriding need wasto break inflation for which the Governments present policieswere essential and in which they had the support of public opinion.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.t;0J^) 2hq q* me Bill should be supported in a referendum by not less thaniiti Us*0lis ^ Per cent Q* ^e persons entitled to vote;  and there were other   1. amendments designed to reduce the proportion from 40 per cent to 33 per cent or one-third.    He proposed that the Governmentshould support the amendment to remove the requirementaltogether,    If, as might happen, the amendment were defeated,the Government would support the amendment reducing the figure to 33 per cent.    If this were carried, the situation, thoughunsatisfactory, would be tolerable.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discusstion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the proposals by the Lord Presidentof the Council.    Suitable arrangements should be made to informthe Parliamentary Labour party and the Lobby.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summirg up of this part of their discussion.2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet wouldrecall their decision on 8 December that the claim of the directors of British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) to the stage 1 salary increases given to corresponding grades in theCivil Service at the beginning of 1975 should be resisted andthat they should be awarded increases on the same lines as thoseagreed for the board members of nationalised industries. TheCabinet had then accepted the risk, which was evident from the attorney General&apos;s advice at the time, that the BNFL directorsclaim to a pre-pay policy contractual link with Civil Servicegrades might be pursued in the courts in which case it could wellbe upheld.    However, the Attorney General&apos;s statement in theCourt of Appeal last Monday in the Holliday Hall case, in whichhe had made clear that it was no part of the Government&apos;s paypolicy to take any action with the intention or consequence of a breach of contractual or other legal obligation, had made itdesirable to ensure that the line taken with the BNFL directorswas fully consistent with this statement.    He had accordinglyauthorised a letter to be sent to the Atomic Energy Authorityto the effect that if there were a contractual obligation, it wasnot the Government&apos;8 intention to stand in the way of its fulfilment.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.2
^airs3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had come direct fromtalks at London Airport with President Sadat of Egypt, who wasreturning from his visit to the United States.    That visit had^dle   evidently been useful and should have the effect of restrainingPresident Sadat from taking any impetuous action.    President Carterevioua **ad made it clear to him that in some respects Prime Minister Begin^erence. u* Israel had evidently misrepresented the views which he,^M(7gj President Carter, had expressed about the lsrasli position. ThereC0llcluo; was indeed little doubt that both President Sadat and Prime MinisterLr      *ons   .Minute 2     &apos; Begin had gone back on some of the things they had said at the start of the latest initiatives and this had contributed to the current situation.    But President Sadat seemed seriously and constructivelyintent on seeking a settlement.    We should try to put this across to prime Minister Begin.    President Sadat saw the need for a link between the West Bank and Jordan, and was ready to contemplate a situation in which the Jordanians, Israelis, Palestinians and theUnited Nations were jointly associated in arrangements for the WestBank area.    But this would involve a major move by Prime MinisterBegin over Judea and Samaria which it was not at all certain he wouldbe able to make.    President Sadat however recognised Israel&quot;s needfor assurances on her security.    He felt that his points could be bestput across through quiet persuasion of the Israelis and had not pressed for a public statement.    It would be useful if the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary could find an opportunity to visit Israel inorder to have a talk with Prime Minister Begin.    The Prime ministers aid he had told President Sadat that he found his position reasonable,but did not agree with the line he had taken on the Sinai settlements,which had been too rigid.    He thought President Sadat had appreciatedhaving a candid assessment of the situation from a disinterested pointof view.    He had the impression that the President looked upon us asfriends who had more understanding of the problem than some of curpartners in the Nine, and had no misgivings about our contacts withthe Israelis.The Cabinet -Took note.3
to^TH SEA^ 4* The ^aDinet had before il a note by the Secretary cf the oil Cabinet (CP(78) 15) covering a paper by officials showing how a&quot;*eviou8 North Sea Oil Development Fund could be operated, assuming that*reference Ministers decided that ihere should be one.*Qclu8ions THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had been almost*ijiute 7     &apos; equally divided at its last meeting about the desirability of creatingsuch a Fund.    He had himself originally been in favour of a fund for political and for psychological reasons, but he now believed that^ Sea t*ie practical arguments were decisively against it.    He would&apos;eVe*0Prnent F welcome the views of the Cabinet.In favour of a Fund, it was argued that public expectations hadalready been aroused.    There was a strong current of feeling infavour of segregating the additional benefits of North Sea Oil, in away which would allow this windfall gain to be used wisely.Although the main impact of North Sea oil on the economy would be through the balance of payments, it would also -yield significantadditional public revenue which could be quantified and identified.It was important to turn this revenue into wealth creating investment.This could best be done if some or all of the additional revenue wassegregated in a special fund.    There were in any case precedents forthe establishment of separate funds free from Ministerial control:the block allocations to the National Enterprise Board and theScottish and Welsh Development Agencies were examples of this.Another alternative would be to establish an investment bank chargedwith using a proportion of North Sea revenues.    There was also acase for leaving these issues open in a White Paper, and seeking theviews of the public about them.    Alternatively, a small group ofthose Ministers who wished to see a fund established could rapidlyprepare detailed plans showing how it would work, in ways net opento the criticisms levelled against the three schemes described inthe note.On the other hand, it was argued that there was little real public support for a separate fund.    Opinion was divided, both in theNational Economic Development Council (NEDC), in theParliamentary Party, and in the Trades Union Congress. Thecreation of a fund would not satisfy the Scottish Nationalist Party.There were severe practical problems in identifying and earmarkingNorth Sea revenue to particular purposes.    A bogus fund would soon be exposed as an electoral gimmick.    The Government1 s existingpublic expenditure plans already took full account of the additional resources which North Sea oil would make available.    It would bedifficult to disentangle any additional expenditure which could be directly attributed to North Sea revenue.    If a new blueprint was tobe drawn up for Ministerial consideration, those Ministers who weresceptical about the proposal should have a chaiice to take part in thediscussions.
It was also suggested that, whatever the practicalities of aseparate fund, the public would want. *o see some account of theway in which the Government was using the additional resources ofthe North Sea.    This would require an explanation, not only of the ways in which the revenues were spent, but of the use made by theeconomic opportunities created by additional real resources and bythe easement of the balance of payments constraint.    The way inwhich these benefits were taken up should be continuously monitored,possibly by a special committee of NEDC, or by an annual report toParliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that before asking the Cabinet to take a final decision on whether thereshould be a separate North Sea development fund it would be rightto give some of the Ministers who favoured this the charce to demonstrate that a practicable scheme could be devised. TheSecretary of State for Energy, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Scotland,should urgently prepare such a scheme and should associate theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, fully in this work from the outset.    They should circulate a paper in time for discussion the following week.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP(78) 16) covering a further draft of a White Paper on theBenefits of North Sea Oil.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the White Paper had been redraftedby the Cabinet Office and the Policy Unit in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion at its previous meeting, and he had himself also made anumber of amendments.    He thought that the general shape of theWhite Paper was now in line with the Cabinet1 s wishes. there remained a number of points of detail to settle.In discussion, the following main points were made:-a.    Debt Repayment iThe White Paper could not ignore the problem of debtrepayment.    The Governments general strategy was to spread out the hump of debt repayment for as long aspossible to avoid the need for unnecessary deflation,particularly in the early years in which the bulk of the&apos;4ftxte paper 
existing loans fell due.    To do this meant reborrowing,and the Government had therefore to maintain its stanceas a credible borrower.    This required at le-.st a minimumlevel of repayment in the eaily years, and this should bemade clear in the draft.    Amendments in this sense were needed to paragraphs 4 and 19.    A new section which theChancellor of the Exchequer would prepare should be addedafter paragraph 23.b. Some minor changes were needed in the sectiondealing with the British National Oil Corporation inparagraph 13.c. The reference to the yield of -North Sea taxes etc. inparagiaph 13 should be modified so as to refer to the revenues already being received from the North Seaoilfields.d. In paragraph 16 the United Kingdom share of the domestic o&amp;shore supplies market could be betterpresented if it showed how we had built up an entirely new industry to the point where it now provided 57 per cent ofthe requirements of the domestic North Sea market,e. The references to a managed exchange rate inparagraph 20 could be read as conflicting with our inter-national obligations and should be deleted.f. The profitability of United Kingdom industry was nolonger significantly lower than that of our competitors;paragraph 27 should refer to a rate &quot;below what was desirable&quot;.    The references to productivity were undulycritical, and the second, third and fourth sentences of thisparagraph should be deleted.g. Paragraph 37 could be improved by adding a referenceto Research.    The Secretary of State for Education and science was invited to submit a sentence for this purpose.h. The section beginning at paragraph 34 should have anadditional heading of &quot;regional policies&quot; and in paragraph 32,references to the Scottish and Welsh Development Agenciesmight be added.i. There were now signs that the economy was beginning to expand again: paragraph 40 should therefore refer to&quot;keeping the process of expansion going&quot;.6
j.     Tnere was a casj for adding a reference, inparagraph 43, to short term measures to maintain employ-ment until new jobs could be created.    But or balance thisdetracted from the main argument of the paper, that theNorth Sea revenues would be used to make permanentimprovements in the British economy.    In any case, it was wrong to suggest that there would be a net decline inemployment in manufacturing industry.    The Secretary ofState for Trade would offer an alternative passage.k.    Paragraph 44 conveyed the impression that the latestpublic expenditure White Paper froze the level of public expenditure for all time.    While retaining the reference tothe need to retain firm contrcl ever public expenditure the specific reference to the White Paper should be omitted.1. The references to collapsing Victorian buildings inparagraph 46 were too morbid and should be amended.m.   Paragraph 47 should refer to &quot;education, training andretraining to develop industrial and commercial skills&quot;,deleting the references to industry, educational establish-ments etc.n.    The table, circulated as an addendum to CP(78) 16,might be better presented in the form of a graph or diagram.A number of minor drafting changes were also suggested.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now approved the White Paper with the exception of thesection dealing with monitoring and the case for a Fund. Thesepassages would have to be reconsidered in the light of the cabinet decision on the Fund in the following week.    He would arrange forthe final version of the White Paper to be published as soon aspossible thereafter, probably towards the end of February. he himself would take the Press Conference and the paper should be presented to Parliament in his name.    Meanwhile, the Chancellorof the Exchequer should arrange to see the Confederation of BritishIndustry, who had asked to be allowed to make representations aboutthe White Paper, as soon as possible after the following week&apos;cabinet.The Cabinet -2. Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.7
5. Cabinet had before tem a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(78) 13) to which was attached a draft White paper on the nationalised industries.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the White Paper had already been thoroughly discussed by the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy (EY) as a result of which a number of amendments hadbeen made.    Most members of the Cabinet concerned had Deeninvolved in that discussion.    It should therefore be possible to clear the White paper quickly.    He would be grateful however for anyfurther comments on the draft.In discussion the following points were made:-a. It was suggested that the draft laid too much emphasis on financial and commercial considerations without takingsufficient account of the Government&apos;s proper socialconcerns.    On the other hand, it was pointed out that this white Paper dealt with the regime for the nationalised industries and not with support provided to those in need.Rather similar points had arisen in discussion of the energy Green Paper and the Electricity and NuclearMaterials Bill, and it had been possible to devise a formof words which took account of social considerations. Itwould however be better in a more general document on the objectives for the nationalised industries not to include asimilar passage.b. The Government would shortly have to take difficultdecisions about the future financing of the steel industryand it was arguable that the references in the White paper to public dividend capital (PDC) were not cast in sufficientlyflexible terms.    It was however pointed out that this pointhad been discussed by EY who had agreed that the passage onPDC was adequate to cover the special problems of the steelindustry.    It would be better therefore to make no change init.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper and agreed that it should bepublished in March.    The exact date should be settled in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, having regard to the timing of the publication of the White Paper on the Benefits of North SeaOil and also a possible statement on the steel industry.The Cabinet -Took note, \ ith approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office9 February 1978 R
