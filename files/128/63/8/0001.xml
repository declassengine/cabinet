^%s1ENTARY     1&apos; The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.infect fr0m THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Opposition^tiitte proposed to use the  Supply Day on Thursday 9 March for a Motion/tionaj.ee 0n to approve the Fifth Report from the Select Committee on^Ustjjg86^ Nationalised Industries on the Financial Forecast of the british steel Corporation.    It was proposed to table a Governmentamendment in terms which would maximise support from government backbenchers and minority parties.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that further consideration would need to be given by the ministers concerned to the terms of the amendment but its general senseshould be to reject the Select Committee&apos;s Report;  and it was to be hoped that all Government supporters would recognise their duty tosupport it.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of this partof their discussion.city BiUTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY reminded the cabinet of the importance of the Electricity Bill to the industry and tothe trades unions concerned.    On the previous evening he had seen Mr King, the Conservative spokesman on energy, who hadcriticised the attitude of the Liberals in opposing the provisions relating to the reconstruction of the industry.    These provisionsdepended for their effect on the making of a statutory instrumentand were themselves in politically neutral terms.    On this basishe thought that the Conservatives might be prepared to allow aBill for the reconstruction of the industry to obtain SecondReading.    It might be possible to arrange for the provisions onDrax B and nuclear safety to form a separate Bill which could be passed with the Liberal support which had already been indicated;a Bill on reconstruction might then be passed with Conservativeacquiescence, despite Liberal opposition.    Alternatively, the conservatives might be persuaded to allow second reading for a comprehensive Bill covering all the proposed provisions, includingalso Drax B and nuclear &quot;safety&apos;, although attempts would no doubt be made to amend any Bill in Committee.    He believed that the bill was of sufficient importance to justify further talks with theConservative leaders to see whether an assurance of support on second Reading could be obtained.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that further consideration would be needed before a decision could betaken to introduce separate Bills, and the implications for theParliamentary timetable would also need to be examined.Discussions with the Opposition should be pursued through the usual channels and the position should be reviewed again when theirattitude, both to the reconstruction proposals and to Drax B, hadbeen established beyond doubt.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Energy and the Chief Whip to be guided accordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said the inspectors report recommended that planning permission begranted without delay.    He found the report a persuasive one whoseconclusions should be generally acceptable.    Nevertheless he believed that Parliament must have the opportunity to debate themain issues arising from the report before a final decision wastaken.    The ordinary procedure for deciding planning applicationsmade this difficult:  if a debate took place before ho announced his decision it could be argued that he had taken into account materialnot available to the Inquiry and his decision could be challenged inthe High Court.    He proposed therefore to make a statement on6 March which would say that he had refused the existing planningapplication solely in order to clear the ground for a debate. Hewould at the same time say that, subject to Parliamentary debate on the main issues after the report was published, the governments intention was to authorise the wind scale development by means of aSpecial Development Order under Section 24 of the 1971 Planning Act.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, in order to allow a Parliamentary debate,authorisation of the wind scale development should be by SpecialDevelopment Order.    Very careful briefing would however be needed to avoid any misunderstanding abroad, particularly by theJapanese, of the reason for rejecting the original planning application.This way of proceeding was exceptional because the circumstancesof wind scale were also exceptional:  and the use of the SpecialDevelopment Order procedure after a debate should not become a precedent for other Inquiries.2
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion,and invited the Secretary of State for the environment to be guided accordingly.3
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYreporting on his recent visit to Israel and Jordan, said that therewas a danger of each side reverting to the situation it had taken up before President Saoat of Egypt&apos;s initiative.    Israeli action intoughening up Prime Minister Begin&apos;s proposals was not helpfuland the situation had been aggravated by the somewhat emotionalEgyptian reaction, especially in relation to the Sinai settlements.Jordan was in a difficult situation.    In practice the status quoprobably suited her interests reasonably well and if King Husseinwere to join in the talks he would be severely criticised by Saudi arabia and Syria.    Both Egypt and Jordan were against the creation of anindependent Palestinian State but could not say so publicly. Anywording in a Declaration of Principles which appeared to make concessions on this point would be very difficult for King Husseinto accept and, to a lesser extent for President Sadat.    Mr begin on the other hand was adopting a legalistic approach which made himreluctant to accept any wording which fudged the issue of self-determination.    The Israeli Labour Party took the view thatMr Begin had gone too far on Sinai but not far enough on the WestBank.    The only hope of progress was through the concept of atransition period, during which each side would maintain its positionof principle, in the hope that after five years or so the situation would develop in a more satisfactory way.    There was a general desire in Israel for a settlement with Egypt and the best hope at thepresent time was probably for a bilateral agreement.    Jordan mightjoin this later but there was virtually no prospect of Syrianparticipation or of a comprehensive agreement.    In strategic terms,a bilateral agreement would be helpful if it had the effect ofneutralising the threat to Israel from Egypt, but the Israelis were also worried about the accumulation of Soviet arms in Syria. IfPresident Sadat&apos;s initiative were to fail, the danger would be thatthis would encourage greater extremism on the part of theRejectionist Front and increased Soviet involvement.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad invited Bishop Muzorewa to come to London for a meeting on6 March to discuss the Salisbury talks.    We were now in broadagreement with the Americans in our attitude towards these, although we differed slightly over what line to take with the Patriotic Front.The Americans at some levels thought we should arrange anotherMalta-type meeting.    This seemed however too risky.    Any internalagreement reached in Salisbury would not on its own ensure a viablesettlement.    On the other hand we could not force the Anglo-american proposals through.    We should have to look for a compromise between them and the outcome of the talks in Salisbury.    If weappeared to be leaning towards the Patriotic Front this would not,4SECRET
in his \iew, ha likely to strengthen the hand of the nationalists in salisbury, but rather to weaken their position in relation toMr Smith.    We might be faced shortly with a draft United Nationsresolution condemning the Salisbury talks.    If there had to be a debate in the United Nations it would be to our advantage to widen itbeyond the narrow issue of recognition into a general discussion of progress towards a settlement.    We could then publish all our proposals and encourage Bishop Muzorewa and Mr Sithole to go tothe United Nations, and by this means we might be able to secure amore balanced resolution.    In the Salisbury talks it was envisaged that a transitional government would be established later this month and it was probable that we should be asked to recognise it. Thiswould cause great difficulty.    We should be able to hold out at least until there had been a referendum on the settlement, which might take place in May.    The problem would increase after that because,assuming it resulted in support for the internal settlement, we wouldprobably have to accept that our Fifth Principle had been fulfilled.At that point the question of the future of sanctions could arise. Itwould be much easier if we could put off the need for recognitionuntil 31 December after elections had been held and a representativeblack government had been established.    Mr Smith&apos;s intentions withregard to his future were not clear, but it would be better if he had nothing to do with the transitional government.     We were not likelyto achieve this, but we might get a neutral chairman accepted for the transitional council.    In all this we had to bear in mind the dangers of finding ourselves isolated internationally which could result fromignoring the Patriotic Front and recognising the Salisbury talks.The important thing would be to keep the Americans alongside us.The Front Line Presidents were adopting a very cautious attitudeso far.    They did not trust Mr Smith any more than we did, and thiswas why we should delay any recognition of a government emergingfrom the Salisbury talks until the last possible moment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we should certainly be cautious aboutgiving recognition to any settlement which emerged from the Salisburytalks in view of Mr Smith&apos;s past record.    In particular we should try to avoid putting Mr Nkomo in an isolated position.    But we should take our stand firmly on the Six Principles and should be ready to agreeto a transfer of power which was clearly based on them.The Cabinet -Took note.5
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Foreign Affairs Council on 7 March would consider possibledates for direct elections to tne European Assembly.    There was at present broad agreement that these should be either 17-20 Mayor 7-10 June 1979.    He thought the latter period was preferable.If our partners were to favour an even later date we could agree toit, buc we should not ourselves press for further delay.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that 7-10 June was the acceptable period. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary need not oppose a later dateif that was the wish of other member States.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for employment (CP(78) 26) setting out proposals for a temporaryscheme of support for short time working and a minute by theSecretary of State for Employment, dated 27 February 1978, to thePrime Minister about negotiations with the Commission of theEuropean Economic Community on the terms for continuation of temporary Employment Subsidy (TES).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the Ministerial Group onUnemployment Amongst Young People (GEN 27) had examinedearlier that day the proposals set out in CP(78) 26 for a newtemporary scheme of support for short time working.    Such ascheme was essential in order to meet the acsurances theGovernment had given that any reduction in jobs saved by TESresulting from negotiations with the Commission would be offset byother employment measures.    In brief the scheme would be availableto support in employment workers who would have been eligible forassistance through TES were it not for the proposed reductions inthat subsidy.    The basic scheme provided that workers in this category would receive 75 per cent on gross earnings for each day&apos;work lost and employers would be compensated 100 per cent for thecost from the Exchequer.    The subsidy would be available for aperiod up to 18 months in the first instance.    It would preservesome 37, 000 workers from unemployment which would give an equivalent compensation for the loss of TES after allowing for thedisplacement effect of TES.    The Secretary of State for Employmenthad however also proposed that the subsidy should be available for a
further 6 months and that firms which had exhausted their eligibility for TES in the past as well as those who would do so in the futureshould be eligible for this 6 months&quot; support under the scheme. Hehad also proposed that the national insurance contributions paid by employers should be met in full on the 75 per cent of earnings payable for short time working.    These additions would help to meet the criticisms made of the scheme by the industries, trades unions andthe Parliamentary Labour Party.    Although primarily intended toassist in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, firmselsewhere would be eligible if they had lost the chance of help underTES because of the reduction in the scale of that subsidy.    GEN 27had agreed these proposals and recommended them to the Cabinet.Taking into account the savings due to reduction in TES the grosscost which would be a charge on the Contingency Reserve in 1978-79would be  32 million.    Although the proposals approved by GEN 27,even discounting the displacement employment effect of TES, wouldfully offset the reductions in TES, it had to be recognised that somefirms would not benefit as much from the new scheme as they didfrom TES.    There would still be problems both politically and withthe industries over the new arrangements.    Presentation wouldhave to be carefully done and regard would have to be paid also toany sensitivities of the Commission regarding the size and cost ofthe short time working scheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he had set out in his minute of 27 February the details of the package whichhe had negotiated cn TES with the Commissioner Vbuel. the package was now subject to approval by Cabinet colleagues and bythe Commission.    He had concluded his negotiations withCommissioner Vouel last Friday.    Vouel had still been very keen tcabolish the Supplement altogether and it had been necessary to makea concession to reduce expenditure on the Supplement.    On the mainscheme he had reached agreement that payment should be Hmited, inthe textiles, clothing and footwear sectors only, to 70 per cent of theworkforce in any factory in the first six months and 50 per cent forthe second six months.    On Northern Ireland the Commission hadinitially wanted the same conditions as elsewhere in the United Kingdom.He had refused this and Commissioner Vouel had ultimately agreedthat we would apply the same Hmitations as in the rest of theUnited Kingdom only where it could be shown that a firm in thetextiles, clothing and footwear sectors in Northern Ireland was indirect competition with firms in Southern Ireland and those firmswere not in receipt of an equivalent subsidy.    For sectors other thanthese three no limitations would apply in Northern Ireland.Identifying the areas where there were equivalent subsidies wouldin the first instance be a matter between the United KingdomGovernment and the Government of Southern Ireland but they would need to report their conclusions to the Commission.    The details of 
these arrangements remained to be settled.    In addition he had agreed to certain administrative procedures affecting the operationof TES generally under which firms will be required to put forwardplans for reorganisation after the second 6 months&apos; period of support and that the Government should give the Commission priornotification on applications from certain categories of larger firmsfor the purposes of monitoring.    Expenditure limits agreed on themain scheme were  55 million in 1978-79 in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and  80 million on the Supplement whereverpaid and the main scheme outside the textile, clothing and footwearsectors, and if it looked as though these figures were going to be exceeded, further discussions with the Commission would benecessary.    He had agreed with Commissioner Vouel that nochanges would be made in TES before the short time working schemewas in operation, but had undertaken to use his best endeavours toget it working by the end of May.    The package he had negotiatedrepresented a significant reduction in TES - by some 35, 000 lessjobs but this was much less than the Commission had originallywanted and it represented the best deal he thought could be negotiated.The short time working scheme as recommended by GEN 27 wouldenable the Government to stick to their assurances that the reductionin TES would be offset by other employment measures evendiscounting the displacement effect from TES.    This was animportant point as it was very difficult to be precise about the size of the displacement effect.In discussion the package negotiated by the Secretary of State for employment and his proposals for a scheme to support short time working were generally welcomed.    It was argued that, whilst there could be presentational problems in introducing the new arrangements,it had also to be recognised that temporary employment subsidy couldnot have been paid on n. permanent basis and that there were longterm risks involved in allowing industries to continue to be relianton subsidies.    It was however accepted that textiles and clothingremained an important part of manufacturing industry employingover 800, 000 workers or 10 per cent of the total manufacturingworkforce.    The Multi-Fibre Agreement had helped the industry but some sections were still under severe pressure through demandchanges.    It was suggested that we might counter the attacks whichhad been made upon the TES by complaining about subsidies in other member States.    On the other hand it was argued that to follow sucha policy systematically would be mistaken and likely to cause moredifficulties for us.    It was better to adopt a cape by case approachas at present.    Furthermore an unselective support for subsidiesmight only encourage a tendency to protectionism and any steps inthat direction should only be taken after the pro&apos;s and con&apos;s had beenfully considered having regard to United Kingdom interests and itswider consequences including the impact on the Third World. This8
was an area where further consideration by Cabinet of the general issues involved might be appropriate.In relation to Northern Ireland it was noted that any reduction inTES would have a particularly severe effect as 34 per cent of thosein manufacturing employment were engaged in the textile, clothing and footwear industry.    The Irish Republic had a tax free profitsscheme for exports which appeared contrary to the european economic Community rules and if TES were reduced in NorthernIreland then the advantages of this subsidy would be even more marked.    On the other hand the agreement secured by the Secretaryof State for Employment would protect all Northern Ireland industryother than clothing, textiles and footwear from TES reductions andsuch reductions would only apply in the clothing, textiles andfootwear industries where the Irish Republic were not payingequivalent subsidies to firms in direct competition with the province.There would be ample scope for arguing about how far these conditions were fulfilled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet congratulated the Secretary of State for Employment onnegotiating the package he had presented and agreed that he should announce these changes after the Commission had given their formalapproval to them.    The Cabinet noted that the proposals for atemporary scheme of support for short time working as recommended by GEN 27 would cost more than would be saved bythe reduction in TES but that it did give firm assurance that the reductions in jobs saved by the cut back in TES would be amplyoffset.    They accordingly raised no objections to these proposalswhich should be announced at the same time as the results of thenegotiations on TES.    They had noted that the new scheme shoulube in operation by the end of May and would tie in with the effectivedate for the introduction of the modifications to TES.The Cabinet -2. Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for employment to be guided accordingly.9
4. The Cabinet had before them a minute from the Chancellorof the Exchequer, dated 22 February 1978, to the Prime Ministerreporting the outcome of the discussion in the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P))on the pay of nationalised industries board members and amemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal (CP(78) 25) on the implementation of the decisions taken by Ministers in December on the pay of board members and senior staff in the nationalised industries and similarpublic sector bodies.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had agreed that the cabinet should review the decision which they had reached at their meetingon 8 December that nationalised industries board chairmen and members should receive increases of 5 per cent, with thepossibilities of increases of up to 10 per cent for the less well paidbut tapered so that those earning more than  13, 000 received no more than 5 per cent.    He had also agreed that they should review the decision taken subsequently by EY(P) at their meeting on27 December that a similar 5 per cent plus tapering rule should beapplied to senior staff in the nationalised industries and similarpublic sector organisations.    It did not, in his view, follow that ifCabinet now decided to change one of these decisions it necessarilyhad to change the other.    He proposed that Cabinet should firstconsider the EY(P) decision relating to senior staff.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that EY(P) had considered on the previous day their earlier decision relating to senior staff.    They had considered a memorandum by the lord privy Seal which indicated that the EY(P) decision so far had only been implemented in respect of 31 senior staff in the British NationalOil Company (BNOC).    On the other hand there were instanceswithin seven of the nationaHsed industries where increases had beengiven to senior staff in excess of that allowed by the EY(P) decision.Some of these payments pre-dated the EY(P) ruling but in the caseof the Post Office the chairman had now told the Secretary of Statefor Industry that his Board had decided to ignore the 5 per cent rule in a settlement involving senior staff.    There were four othernegotiations pending in the nationalised industries where similar difficulties might be anticipated.    It was already clear that in theelectricity supply industry Mr Lyons, negotiating on behalf of seniormanagers, would be extremely unwilling to accept less than he hadnegotiated for the power engineers and a row with him might prejudice negotiations elsewhere in the industry.    More generally,if senior staff in the nationalised industries earning  13, 000 or more were to be restricted to 5 per cent then it was hard to see why, inequity, other staff in the public sector, including the National Health10
Service and the Armed Services, should be treated differently, andthis would be a major factor when the Review Body reportsrelating to these other groups became available.    EY(P) had considered whether, if their earlier decision were rescinded, therewould be any difficulty over the senior staff of the BNOC who hadalready been paid on the basis of that decision but had been assured by the Secretary of State for Energy that any change affecting thesestaff could be carried out without publicity.    It had been the almostunanimous decision of EY(P) that their earlier decision should berescinded so that there should be no general restriction, other thanthe general pay guidelines, applied to the pay of senior staff.In discussion it was argued that, when EY(P) had reached their decision on 21 December, they had been influenced by the advice ofsponsoring Ivfinisters that if they did not apply the same ruling to senior staff as Cabinet had decided for board members then theproblems of differentials between members and staff would beexacerbated.    That argument was still valid.    This group of people were also relatively highly paid and a decision now to rescind the5 per cent decision would in effect mean that they would all getaround 10 per cent.    This would consolidate the view that therewas an entitlement for everyone to 10 per cent in this round andlimit the room for dealing flexibly and equitably with individual cases on their merits.    On the other hand it was argued that,although the Government could fix the salaries of board membersof nationalised industries they could not exercise the same degreeof control over the salaries of staff in those industries which was essentially a matter for management.    Moreover attempts tomaintain the 5 per cent decision would be inequitable when somenationalised industries had already settled above that figure beforethe EY(P) ruling and in a situation where no special restrictionexisted on increases for the higher paid in the private sector. nor was it in the Government&apos;6 interest to penalise top management inthe public sector if they wanted that sector to perform well.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed on balance that the decision reached by EY(P) on 21 December in relation to senior staff in the nationalised industries and similar public sector organisations should berescinded and that pay settlements for the staff in question shouldbe subject only to the operation of the pay guidelines generallyapplicable, and any other relevant factors applying, on a case bycase basis.    The Secretary of State for Energy should review the salaries authorised for senior staff in the BNOC in the light of thatdecision.11
The Cabinet -1. Took rote, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Energy to be guided accordingly.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as requested by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy at their meetingon 31 January, EY(P) had reviewed the question of board members&apos;pay at their meeting on 22 February.    He had reported theconclusions of that meeting to the Prime Minister in his minute ofthe same date.    In their discussion the Sub-Committee had had regardto the representations received by the Prime Minister from lord Boyle and from the nationalised industries chairmenthemselves but had felt by a small majority that it was right not torecommend any change in the decision which Cabinet had reached in December.    He recognised that it was presentationally moredifficult to change the Cabinet decision on members1 pay than to alter the EY(P) decision on senior staff;  nevertheless his personal view was that there was a very strong case for doing so, and foragreeing that this group should have increases of 10 per cent all roundfrom 1 January.    Such a change would have to be presented as aresponse to the representations made, particularly from Lord Boyle.In discussion it was argued that Lord Boyle and the nationalised industries chairmen had made out a strong case for allowing10 per cent increases for members, having regard to the treatmentthey had received since the Top Salaries Review Body&apos;s report in1974.    In this case it was not a question of reopening an agreement reached by two parties but simply of revising an earlier decision which had not yet been implemented since no payments had yet beenmade to board members following Cabinet&apos;s decision in December.On the other hand it was argued that, unlike senior staff in the nationalised industries, the pay of members was directly under theGovernments control.    It would be very damaging if theGovernment was now seen to be giving way to pressure.Circumstances had not changed since the Cabinet&apos;s Decemberdecision and that decision should be upheld.    It was however, alsoargued that the issue needed to be considered in relation to the response which the Government would give to the various review body reports they would receive over the next few months - the armed Forces Review Body, the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; review body, and the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB).    It was clear thatthese reports would be recommending substantial increases and itmight be that the Government would find it necessary to make12
immediate payments of, say, 10 per cent in response to them.There would however be difficulty in doing so in relation to nationalised industry board members because they would havealready been paid 5 per cent under the Cabinet&apos;s December decision and a further payment a few months later would look like a breach of the 12 months&apos; rule.    It seemed wrong that, having been uniquelydiscriminated against following the 6th report of the TSRB in 1974this group should be yet again treated less well than other groupscovered by Review Body reports.    This was already a matter for anxiety amongst nationalised industry chairmen.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the majority of the Cabinet were not in favour of any changein the decision which they had reached in December on board memberpay.    That ruling should accordingly stand.    On the other hand theCabinet did not wish nationalised industries board members to betreated in future less fairly than other groups covered by theforthcoming Review Body reports.    This meant treating them on allfours with the other groups even if this meant an apparent breach ofthe 12 month rule.    Care would be needed in devising a formula tocover this intention and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for EY(P) to consider the form of words to be used in givingassurance to nationalised industry board members, in advance of receipt of the next TSRB report, that they would not be furtherdiscriminated against in relation to others covered by that report.More generally the Cabinet would also wish to discuss at theappropriate time how the reports of the review bodies should be handled, taking into consideration also the position of unversity teachers who were still waiting for the implementation of an earlierindependent review.    He would consider further how this might bedone.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided accordingly.13
^ure5. The Cabinet had before ic a paper by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(78) 23) about the basis for preparing the 1978 public expenditure Survey, together with a note (CP(78) 24) by the central policy Review Staff (CPRS) about priorities in public expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the CPRS paper had been preparedto meet the argument put forward in the past that the public expenditure Survey process tended to pre-empt political decisions.It provided an opportunity for Ministers to express a view on thepolitical priorities which they wished to be considered during thisyear&apos;s Survey.    The Chief Secretary1 s paper, by contrast, dealtwith the establishment of a base case for the Survey, on which ministers would be able to take political decisions in the summer.In itself it was politically neutral.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his paper set outthe normal annual instructions for the conduct of the public expenditure review.    It started from the latest published white paper on public expenditure.    The figures in that White Paper wouldbe revalued and revised in the light of further Ministerial decisions and other agreed changes since publication.    These revised figures would be set out in the Survey reports, together with proposedadditions, reduced requirements and options for reduction indentified in the course of the preparatory work.    The intention was to circulate the report in June, for Ministerial consideration in July.Final decisions could be taken then, or if the Cabinet preferredcould be postponed until the early autumn.In discussion, it was argued that the timing of the next public expenditure White Paper might be important in an election year.If circumstances permitted an expansion of public expenditure, theCabinet might want to take political credit for this; alternatively,they might want to postpone publication until after an election. Inorder to keep these options open, an early start should be made onthe preparation of the Survey.    While there was little that could bedone to alter the direction of public expenditure during the last year of the present government, there was considerable scope for changesin the level and in the distribution of expenditure in later years.Decisions on those years should therefore be taken on the basis ofthe Survey in the normal way.In further discussion, the view was put forward that the paper by the cprs was a useful analysis of some of the questions which should beconsidered during the Survey.    But it should be supplemented byexamination of questions raised within the Labour Party, for example in the various joint Cabinet/National Executive Committee working parties, and in the Trades Union Congress-Labour Party PolicyDocument &quot;The Next Three Years and Into the Eighties&quot;. While14
there might be objections to any formal consultation with the Partymachine, there was nothing to stop officials in Departmentsexamining the relevant chapters of that document, and including theresults of their analysis in the Survey Report.In discussion of particular topics, it was suggested that the CPRSpaper correctly drew attention to the contrasts between steadily-growing transfer payments and a fall in Government-financed capital formation.    It was for consideration whether the level of industrial investment necessary to maintain a healthy economy and an adequatebasis for the Government1 a social priorities, was best achieved byadditional public expenditure on industrial investment or by appropriate tax measures.    The, paper also drew attention to theneed for additional resources to be devoted to the problems of the inner cities, but did not specifically mention the need for additional expenditure on law and order programmes.    The prison building programme, in particular, was a national disgrace and was quiteincapable of dealing with the expected rise in cximinal convictions,still les3 of permitting any effective attempt at retraining orre-education of criminals.    The growing weight of transfer paymentswithin existing public -jxpenditure programmes was the result ofManifesto commitments, for example on social security uprating,and of unavoidable demographic changes, particularly the growing number of older people in the population.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the proposals set out in the Chief Secretary1 s paper(CP(78) 23) as a basis for preparing the 1978 Public expenditure survey.    They found the CPRS paper (CP(78) 24) a useful firstattempt at identifying some of the problems of choice betweenpriorities which would face Ministers in July.    In the course of the1978 Survey, Departments, together with the CPRS and the Treasury,should examine carefully the points which had been made in discussion about the split between current and capital expenditure, aboutexpenditure on urban areas, and about the need for more resources to be devoted to the law and order programme, and about the comparison between industrial aid and other expenditure. ministers would welcome any further points which the CPRS might identify andwish to see examined during the Survey.    The Cabinet would consider the complete Survey in the summer, and would decidethen or in the autumn on the level and composition of future public expenditure programmes and on the publication of the next White Paper.He would himself consider whether any special arrangements shouldbe made to provide for a political discussion of longer term public expenditure priorities which might draw upon both the points madeby the CPRS and suggestions put forward by the Labour Party.15
