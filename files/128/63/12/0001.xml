^NTARY   1. The Cabinet were infoimed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.&quot;ij-u      0n: The Cabinet noted that the Home Secretary had circulated a revisedentary draft of the Parliamentai y statement on immigration which he wouldmake that afternoon.    The revised text took account of commentsreceived since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on Tuesday and was now ina satisfactory form.&quot;Hth2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,commenting on reports of American indecision about whether ornot to authorise production of enhanced radiation warheads (ERW),&apos; ^ said that there were valid arguments for the production of these&quot;^heg^ weapons not only on military grounds, but also because in many respects they were less offensive than existing weapons. Duringthe recent period of bad relations between the United States and theSoviet Union, the United States Administration had been ready to go ahead with production and it was in our interest to support them.Now, despite reports in the Press, relations were improving andthe Americans were anxious to make progress in the Strategic ArmsLimitation Talks (SALT) and other arms control negotiations. TheUnited States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, was shortly to visitMoscow for talks with Mr Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister.This meant that President Carter had to take more account of the arms control arguments which tended to militate against going ahead with ERW, as well as the military case.    We also attached importance to progress in the SALT and were directly involved inthe Comprehensive Test Ban negotiations.    There was a chance that agreement in both these areas might be reached this year.Moreover, we had an interest in the success of the United NationsSpecial Session on Disarmament, which the Prime Minister was to address at the beginning of June.    The decision was undoubtedly a difficult one and the arguments were finely balanced.    But inpresent circumstances the arms control arguments might be regardedas just having the edge over the military ones.As regards Congressional attitudes, it was unlikely that if a SALTAgreement were to be reached it would be rejected because of Sovietactivities in the Horn of Africa.    It was generally accepted that theUnited States Administration^ policies had been correct, although!SECRET
the problem of Soviet intentions towards Eritrea still remained.If however the Cubans had crossed into Somalia or ifFrcsident Siad Barre had taken Somalia back into the Soviet camp,this would have represented a much more serious reverse for western policy which could spill over into other areas.    We were doing our best to prevent this happening and although from apolitical point of view events in Africa could not fail to be taken intoaccount in Washington when policies were being formulated on armscontrol, the United States Administration rejected the idea of any direct linkage.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had had a talk with president Carter about the ERW question during his recent visit to Washington.    There was no doubt that this question had beenmishandled by the United States Administration, possibly throughinexperience, but also because President Carter had genuine doubts about what was the correct decision to take.    The President had explained the problems he saw on both the political and the militarysides and the Prime Minister had indicated that the decision mustbe the Presidents since the weapon would be an American one whichwould not be deployed in the United Kingdom.    His impression wasthat President Carter had decided not to go ahead with production at the present time, but there was a deep division within theUnited States Administration and the President was anxious not togive the appearance of ignoring German views.    This was why hehad sent the United States Deputy Secretary of State,Mr Christopher, to Bonn and London for consultation. the presidents intentions were honourable but he was in difficulties onchis question both domestically and overseas, and was in danger of getting the worst of both worlds.    He was anxious to get the PrimeMinister of India, Mr Dcsai, to agree to safeguards on IndiaSnuclear installations and had asked for cur help over this.    If this were not achieved the Americans would have in due courje to cut offsupplies to the Indians.    Moreover, like us. President Carter was anxious to conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban treaty this summer,and to make progress in arms control negotiations with the soviet union.    All these things could be adversely affected by a decisionto go ahead with the production of ERW, but the outcome might be to defer a decision to produce rather than to cancel production finally.It was important we should not make President CarterS positionmore difficult as the Germans had done, and so far the Presidentaccepted that we were genuinely trying to be helpful.The Cabinet -Took note.
:t0Pea:I3. THE PRIME MINISTER said the discussions with Heads ofGovernment of the European Economic Community (e.c.) on theeconomic situation would be a useful step on the road to the Economic, 11 Council    Summit in Bonn in July.    During his recent visit to Washington, he&apos;*8^&apos; a.^en had found the Americans receptive to the idea of a package of measuresPril relating to economic growth, monetary stability, capital flows includingaid, trade negotiations and energy.   President Carter, both in private andat subsequent discussions attended by Vice president Mondale, SecretaryVance, Secretary Bhimenthal and Dr Henry Owen,  the Presidents personal representative for Economic Summit matters, had been receptive toarguments about the importance of the dollar problem for world inter-national relationships.     We had been able to present a coherent strategywhich had certainly had an impression on American thinking.     Many ofthe current world economic problems were psychological and confidence could be restored if the leaders of the seven Summitcountries could show that they had definite plans which were basedon common guidelines.    It was not to be expected that at theCopenhagen meeting the Germans would agree to further reflationor that the other member states would commit themselves to specific measures.    But he hoped to secure a common understandingat the European Council, which included smaller but importantcountries not represented at the Summit, on the analysis of thecurrent economic problems.    This would be helpful for thepreparatory work to be done between now and the July Summit, notonly within the e.c., but by Finance I^ministers and the group of officials from the Summit countries.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that itwas also hoped at the Copenhagen meeting to agree on a date in 1979for direct elections to the European Assembly ar.d at the same timeto make a declaration on democracy.    This would contain languageabout the importance of direct elections which would not be welcome to some members of the Cabinet but the emphasis on democracy was important to explain and justify the economic cost of enlargement.The existence of such a declaration would give the Community someleverage if, at some future date, there was the risk of a reversion to dictatorship in one of the member states.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had arranged to have a conversationwith the Irish Prime Minister during the course of the Copenhagenmeeting.    On the Irish side, however, attempts were being made topresent this as a major confrontation and to seek to drive a wedgebetween himself and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.He intended only to have a short but a polite conversation withMr Lynch in the margins of the meeting and to ensure that the Presswas properly briefed as to precisely what took place.The Cabinet -1. Took note.3
THE M-.NISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said^cy168 that ^C mrtber private consultations withCommissioner Gundclach which held out the prospect of a satisfactory?j settlement on the internal fisheries regime at the next meeting cfWej Fisheries Council on 24 April.    The Commission wanted us to&quot;Mf7B\ C6: have bilateral contacts with the new French Government about&quot;^cl traditional fishing rights within 12 miles and were willing to helpSions, with offers of compensation.    The Commission were anxious tomake early progress because of the link between the internal and external regimes and the need to avoid a breakdown in negotiationswith third countries.    There were still considerable Parliamentarydifficulties for us, but if a settlement could not be reached soon itwould probably be several months before negotiations could be resumed and the terms might then be less favourable to us.The Cabinet -2. Took note.VttA34. The Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Foreign and^eyj Commonwealth Secretary on the current state of negotiations onWe ^Us Rhodesia (CP(78) 40).^current 9th THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he-Sue^0118&apos; and       United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, had agreed to^7gi j and attend a preliminary bilateral meeting with the Patriotic Front on- x$ and 16 April and had offered to meet the Salisbury Four (the^Ht0S.l0ris&apos; parties to the internal settlement) in Rhodesia or 17 and possibly18 April.    They hoped to hold a meeting of all the parties on25 and 26 April but could not yet say if this would be possible. on many problems he was having to negotiate not only with thePatriotic Front, Front Line Presidents and Salisbury Four but at times also with the United States.    American long term interests inSouth Africa were not necessarily the same as ours and because theyhad les3 at stake they could afford to take stronger action againstSouth Africa than we could.    We could not afford to get seriouslyout of line with them but this did not mean that we had to accepteverything they said.    One particular danger was that we couldsoon have the Patriotic Front in favour of the Anglo-american proposals (AAP) but not the Salisbury Four.    There would then be great pressures for action against Rhodesia and for this reason hehad been careful to insist that Mr Vance should attend futurenegotiations.    So far the President and Mr Vance had supported thejoint United Kingdom-United States policies against the moreidealistic, United Nations orientated, side of the Administration.But they were very much aware of the dangers in being seen to support
the internal settlement.    We might have to make a difficultjudgment.    If the Patriotic Front proved intransigent, there mightbe a case for moving towards the internal settlement.    But if thePatriotic Front were co-operative and there was little sign ofimprovement in the internal situation in Rhodesia, we might thenfind it necessary to support the Patriotic Front.    This would be a difficult decision.    At present there were some 70 Cubans inZambia and 400 to 500 in Mozambique.    Neither President Kaundaof Zambia nor President Machel of Mozambique wished to see thisinvolvement increase and would prefer a negotiated settlement onthe lines of our proposals, but they might be unable to resist it inthe event of such severe attacks from Rhodesia that their territorial integrity was threatened or if they were convinced that they had been abandoned by the West.    He doubted whether the Cubans wanted tobecome actively involved in Rhodesia but they could transform themilitary balance just by giving proper training to the ZimbabweAfrican Peoples Union (ZA.PU) and the Zimbabwe African NationalUnion (ZANU) and by protecting their bases.    Mr Nkomo had14, 000 guerilla forces, of whom some 6, 000 had some training, butthey had as yet hardly been deployed and ZAPU and ZANU were unable to combine to act effectively together.    The South Africanposition was still crucial.    The situation could be transformed ifNamibia were to move in the next week or two towards a negotiated settlement.    But if the South Africans went for an internal solution in Namibia then they would have no interest in supporting efforts to achieve an international settlement for Rhodesia.    A very difficult situation could develop with both the South Africans and the Cubansgetting actively involved.    Overall, although there was much goodwillcowards our efforts and the Front Line Presidents would prefer a negotiated solution, it was a fairly sombre picture.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Salisbury Four werepledged to hold elections before 31 December.    Bishop Muzorewawould prefer them earlier.    The question of recognition could onlyarise after free and fair elections.    A referendum, such as some people in the Labour Party had called for, would pose great difficulties and so would any attempt at direct involvement by the United kingdom on the lines of the Pearce Commission.    Assessment of the fairnessof the elections would have to be left to the judgment of the House ofCommons at the time.    Visits by Members of Parliament and freereporting would be most important.    Judgment would however bedifficult if fighting were still continuing.    This question, andparticularly the difficulty of getting the world to accept the fairnessof any elections, would have to be faced when it arose.5
In further discussion, it was recognised that although the personalrelationship between Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe appeared to haveimproved it was doubtful if there was any genuine mutual trust andthere was certainly none between their respective guerilla forces.The Prime Ministers visit to Washington had helped convincePresident Carter and Mr Vance that these divisions were a reality.The Americans were prone to listen too much to President Nyerere,who favoured Mr Mugabe over Mr Nkomo.    The latter had got tooclose to the Russians, in order to keep this option open, but hispreference was for a government of the Kenya type.    He would bedifficult to satisfy with anything less than the Presidency ofZimbabwe.    While this might previously have been open to him,he would now have a rival contender in Bishop Muzorewa.    It wasimpossible to judge black Rhodesian attitudes to the internalsettlement.    The  ve millions in the tribal trustlands had shownin the past their capacity for independent judgment and werepossibly waiting to see how things went.    Mr Sithole andBishop Muzorewa possibly exaggerated their own ability to influence the guerillas but the Bishop should not be underrated.    He wasdisorganised but he had swung the trust lands at the time of thePearce Commission and seemed to have an instinct for what people would take.    Certainly his strength in the Salisbury area had beendemonstrated recently by the huge crowd which had assembled togreet his return.In further discussion it was pointed out that if the internalsettlement did break down the pressures for action against rhodesia and South Africa would mount and could endanger our trade.    There was already a difficulty about whether certain sales to South Africa by nationalised corporations would constitute anextension of our connections and would lead to public criticism.The Conservatives were waiting to see how things evolved. Theirattitudes on Rhodesia were very mixed, but in general they wouldseize on any opportunity to criticise the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said it hadbeen uceful for the Cabinet to have a chance to review the currentposition and there was general agreement that our current strategywas the right one.    They attached importance to maintaining the closest possible co-operation with the United States.    Although thesituation was difficult, he felt slightly more optimistic than theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.    Mr Smith had a clear idea that he would have to make a deal with Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe ifthe war was to be brought to an end.    They in turn were uncertainof the support they commanded and realised that a guerilla war wouldbo a long haul.    The Ministerial Group on Southern Africa would shortly examine the various problems connected with our trade with south Africa, including the problem of new contracts with the nationalised corporations.    If agreement could not be reached, hewould bring this question back to the Cabinet.6
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.^Tlvr 5* ^he Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Prime^ Mir,      S Minister (CP(78) 38) setting out a new set of draft rules to governOf p. ^floE-ttS the political activities of members of public boards.wa THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had circulated an earlier draftof these new rules with his minute cf 21 December 1977.    They hadbeen further revised in the light of comments received fromMinisters.    The issue for the Cabinet to consider was whether newrules were needed at all, and if so, whether the amendments proposed were acceptable.In discussion it was suggested that there was a case for dispensingwith rules altogether, and leaving it to the good sense of chairmen and board members not to become too deeply engaged in political activity.    Chairmen and board members could be told onappointment that they were expected not to play too active a part in politics, especially at national level.    Against this it was argued that a strong minded chairman, particularly in his final term of office, would not easily be deterred from over-political activity orcriticism of the Government, and that the existence of formal ruleswas a powerful instrument in the hands of Ministers in such a situation.    It was also argued that the existing rules, even withthe proposed amendments, were still too restrictive.    They failedto differentiate, for example, between those potential appointeeswho held political office, and others who held equally strong politicalviews but were not local or national officers of a political Party.In some fields, for example regional and area health authorities,there was a positive advantage in appointing politically-active menand women of both Parties.    This pointed to the need for some relaxation in the existing rules.    But rules of some kind were aconsiderable protection to Ministers against criticism of politicaljobbery.    However, any attempt to operate new rules at the present justice would be controversial, and the best course might well beto postpone a decision for some months.    Indeed there was an argument for saying that the question should be opened up for public discussion before any new rules were promulgated.7
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was inopportune to issue new rules at thisstage.    Accordingly he would arrange for the Cabinet to reconsider at a later stage the question of whether rules were needed at all;  if so, what they should be;  and the possibility of opening up public discussion on the subject.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office6 April 1978S
