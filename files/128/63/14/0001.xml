&quot;f^^NTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe H&amp;use of Commons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat with the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, he wouldbe meeting the Patriotic Front in Dar es Salaam on 14 and 15 April.Ne8ja They would then go on to Johannesburg on 16 April for a meeting with the South African Foreign Minister, Mr Botha, with whom they*vj0(l8 would discuss Rhodesia and also possibly Namibia.    Thereafter he^t6jlc and Mr Vance would go to Salisbury for talks with the parties to thej &quot; internal settlement (the Salisbury Four).    He was not very optimistic&quot;:^asio about the prospects for these meetingb.    The Patriotic Front wouldr\ ^   B&apos; probably be prepared to move towards some form of negotiated settlement on the lines of the Anglo-American proposals.    Eut allthe signs were that the Salisbury Four would remain inflexible. if so, he proposed to continue low level contacts and to maintain thepossibility of a meeting of all the parties during May.    In themeantime, there was always a risk of further Rhodesia attacks onZambia and Mozambique which would aggravate the situation.the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there^Ug was growing support in South Africa for the proposals onl^nCe. Namibia made by the Western Five, particularly from the Churches.The South African Government was trying to shift the onus of a[^H8j0^ decision on to the Namibians.    The difficulty was that Mr Nujoma,5th[xt*2    &apos; the South West Africa People&apos;s Organisation leader, had made a veryhard line statement.    The best move would probably be to take thematter soon to the Security Council and seek the appointment of arepresentative who would go to Namibia for discussions with the administrator and report back.    He hoped to persuade Mr Botha,the South African Foreign Minister, to accept this, but Mr Nujomawas still refusing to agree and there was a danger that the russians would veto any resolution in the Security Council.    A majoi difficultyconcerned the future of Walvis Bay.    This was a very sensitiveissue.    From a strict legal point of view the South african government probably had a claim to it.    Our view was that WalvisBay should be part of the new Namibia but that this should be a matter for negotiation between the South African and the future NamibianGovernments.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.1
[j^8 with THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was glad that the Governmented States had been right not to join in the current general criticism of president Carter,    It wss particularly unfortunate that the Germanswore making their discontent with him known.    It would be quitewrong to regard President Carter as an indecisive mail.      He wasa man of principle who was however the first to admit that he lackedexperience.    His Administration was moreover not wellarticulated, with the result that different officials tended to advocatetheir own views.    Our role was not to voice criticism but to givethe President the fullest possible support, which he both needed and much appreciated.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.
3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland (CP(78) 42) on Nortnern Ireland&apos;s representa-tion at Westminster.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Northern Ireland (IN) had agreed at its meeting on 8 March 1978 that the Government should accept therecommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference on Northern Ireland&apos;srepresentation at Westminster that the number of seats for NorthernIreland should be increased from 12 to 17 but that the boundary commission should be given power to vary the number between 16and 18.    The Governments decision that Scotland and Wales should keep their present level of representation at Westminster after the devolution of greater powers to those parts of the country had high-lighted the extent of Northern Ireland&apos;s under-representation. the speaker&apos;s Conference had voted 22-1 in favour of its recommendation,and he did not anticipate serious opposition in Parliament to theproposed increase to 17 seats.    It was estimated that out of 17constituencies 5 would be held by non-Unionist Members ofParliament of whom most were likely to be members of the SocialDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP).    Even so the SDLP were not likely to be pleaced about an increase in the number of seats becausethey would see this as a move towards the closer integration ofNorthern Ireland with the rest of the United Kingdom.    IN had also considered the timing of the introduction of legislation to give effectto the Conference&apos;s recommendation and had concluded that the lackof Parliamentary time and the possibility that Mr Fitt would rallyenough support to make it difficult to get the legislation through quicklyprecluded a Bill in this Session, but that an undertaking should begiven in the announcement of the Government&apos;p decision on therecommendation that legislation would be brought in in the next session.    The House of Commons was likely to concentrate moxe onthe timing of legislation than on the number of seats. TheOpposition were likely to press for legislation in this Session, and theline they were taking was making it difficult for Mr Molyneaux to sustain his earlier position that a delay in the introduction of a bill was acceptable.    Once the Cabinet had reached decisions on thenumber of seats and on the timing of legislation, an early announce-ment should be made so that uncertainty about the Government&apos;attitude to the Conference^ recommendations did not grow. he therefore proposed to give the Answer which was annexed to his note to an oral Question by Mr Biffen that afternoon either duringQuestion Time, if the Question was reached, or by special arrange-ment immediately after Question Time.    This would allow theLord President of the Council to deal with any Questions that mightbe put during his statement on forthcoming Business about the timing of legislation.
In discussion of the number of seats for Northern Ireland it wasagreed that: although it might luad to pressure for more seats for england, the recommendation of the Speaker&apos;s Conference shouldbe accepted.    It was pointed out, however, that although the Catholiccommunity was about one-third of the Northern Ireland population,because of its distribution the SDLP were likely to hold only two or at the most three of the 17 seats.    There was a danger that this might lead to criticism of the Government not only in NorthernIreland but also among the Catholic population of Great Britainwhich, allied to the abortion issue which had featured prominentlyin the Garscadden oy-election campaign, could lead to the LabourParty being represented as an anti-Catholic parcy.    This could have serious electoral implications.    This possibility would be all themore likely if it could be claimed that the membership of the NorthernIreland Eoundary Commission was such that it might be predisposedtowards the drawing of constituency boundaries in a way whichfavoured the Protestants.    There might be a case for taking theopportunity of the increased work which the change in the number ofNorthern Ireland seats would give the Boundary Commission to expand its membership.    On the other hand, it was argued that to change the membership of the Commission now would be a trans-parent move which would be likely to give rise to strong political criticism in Northern Ireland.In further discussion it was pointed out that whenever legislation was introduced, it would not be in time to affect the number of seats atthe next General Election.    In these circumstances there was muchto be said for the Government not committing itself now to anyparticular timing for the introduction of a Bill but to leave itself asmuch room for manoeuvre as possible.    Moreover, the Governmentwould be in a weak position if it announced that it accepted what was for Northern Ireland a very important constitutional change but atthe same time said &apos;.hat it could not find the Parliamentary time inthis Session for a one-clause Bill.    As against this, it was argued that the Government would be faced with constant demands to make clear when it proposed to introduce legislation.    The Parliamentarytimetable was already under very great pressure, and it would bsextremely difficult to introduce a further constitutional Bill in tnisSession.    These factors would constitute a good defence for adecision to defer legislation to the next Session.    A further argument in favour of not going ahead with legislation until the next Sessionwas that this would make it easier to match the work of the NorthernIreland 3oundary Commission with that of the Boundary commission for the other parts of the United Kingdom which would then bereporting at the same time.    Nonetheless, if it was thought to bedesirable in order to relieve political pressure, it would be possiblefor the Northern Ireland Boundary Commission to start work beforelegislation received the Royal Assent on alternative schemes basedon an assumption of 17 seats.4
In further discussion it was agieed that an early announcement ofthe Covernmert&apos;8 intentions should be made.    On a matter of thisimportance, however, it was preferable that this should take theform of a Statement rather than an Answer to a Question.    In themeantime Mr Biff en1 s Question should be given a holding reply.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet accepted the recommendation of the Speaker1 s conference that the number of seats for Northern Ireland should be increased from 12 to 17 but that the Boundary Commission should be given power to vary the number between 16 and 18.    There was, however,concern that the Catholic population of Northern Ireland might feelthat its share of the increased number of seats was too small, andwith this possibility in mind the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland should review the membership of the Northern IrelandBoundary Commission to satisfy himself as to its impartiality. on balance the Cabinet was opposed to giving an undertaking now on the timing cf legislation and preferred to leave the issue open. Theannouncement of the Government&apos;s decisions should therefore notrefer to the lack of Parliamentary time in this Session as a reasonfor delaying legislation.    Instead it should make clear that therewas nc possibility of the number of Northern Ireland seats beingchanged in time for the next General Election but that legislationgiving effect to the recommendation of the Speaker&apos; a conference would be introduced without undue delay.    The Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland should announce this in a Statement early thefollowing week.    He should seek the agreement of the Cabinet forthe proposed text of the Statement.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to proceed accordingly.[P^TS The Cabinet bad before them a memorandum by the HomeL^i.J^T Secretary (CP(78) 41) on a possible increase in the deposit required^Iiqj^TARY     from candidates at Parliamentary elections.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a Bill was being prepared for introduction this Session which would increase the limits on theexpenses of candidates at Parliamentary elections, and it was forconsideration whether the Bill should also provide for an increase indeposits.    The deposit had remained unchanged since it was firstset at  150 in 1918;  it was no longer sufficient to serve its originalpwrpose of discouraging frivolous candidates;  and both the national executive Committee of the Labour Party and the Liberal Partyfavoured an increase - the former to  500, and the latter to  1, 5005
but with exemptiois for candidates who had secured nominationsreprr senting a certain proportion of the relevant electorate. Thenormal procedure would be to refer the matter to a Speaker1 conference, and the Government had earlier proposed to theOpposition that it should be dealt with in that way;  but it had not sofar prove a possible to obtain their agreement to the terms ofreference in which the Opposition wanted to include the level *frepresentation at Westminster of England, Wales and Scotland.When the issue had been discussed at the Home and Social AffairsCommittee a number of Ministers had argued in favour of an immediate increase, mainly to provide a real discouragement to the NationalFront and frivolous candidates, but others had argued that in ademocracy it was right for any person to be able to stand for parliament, and no unnecessary obstacles should be put in his or herway.    His own view was that there was a strong case for an increasein the deposit,   but it was normal for such a matter to be consideredby a Speaker1 s Conference before the Government brought forward proposals.In discussion it was argued that the deposit should be increased to a level which would not only discourage frivolous candidates but alsoreduce the scope fcr minority parties to gain disproportionate access to the media during an election campaign where they coulddisseminate irresponsible or extreme views.    Under present arrangements a Party which put up a sufficient number of candidatesgained an automatic right to time on television, wh-*ch they could buycheaply while deposits remained at their present level.    A candidatecould also obtain free postage for the distribution of propaganda tovoters in his constituency.    There was a further problem within theLabour Part-/ where some existing ci former Members of Parliamentwho had not been re-adopted were putting themselves forward for election as independents against the official candidate in order to qualify for redundancy payments.    As regards the amount of any increase, one possibility would be to raise the deposit by a percentage equivalent to the general increase in prices since 1974,and this might not be unduly controversial although the national executive Committee favoured a higher figure of  500.    An increasemight appropriately be accompanied by a reduction in the proportionof votes cast which a candidate was required to obtain in order to save his deposit:  the present proportion of one-eighth meant thatsome serious candidates were at risk cf losing their deposit and theyshould not be unduly deterred from standing in the future.Against this it was argued that a democracy should be prepared totolerate frivolous candidates in Parliamentary elections and shouldnot put too many obstacles in their way.    Moreover, the majorParties should not appear to be changing the rules in the period immediately before a General Election for the benefit of their owncandidates:  if they did so the National Front would be able to turn the situation to their advantage and claim that the Government werefrightened of the influence of minority Parties.    They would still be
able to find the increased deposits and to field a large number of candidates.    In addition, there was cause for concern in the numberof extra-Parliamentary pressure groups which were being formed;this was a potentially dangerous development and such groups shouldnot be allowed to claim that the normal Parliamentary and democraticprocedures were inaccessible to them..    It was pointed out that anincrease in the deposit at the present time could be particularlydamaging in Northern Ireland.    It would bear hardest on the AllianceParty, and the Social Democratic and Labour Party(SDLP) would see it as a measure designed by the rich against the poor, and operatingto the advantage cf the Protestant majority against the Catholicminority.    The SDLP might adopt a more abstentionist policy to the detriment of the general intereatp of the Province, and similar difficulties would arise in local government where present legislationlinked the amount of deposits to the level which applied in elections toParliament.A further difficulty concerned the Parliamentary handling of a Bill ifit were introduced in the present Session.    A Bill confined to anincrease in expenses could be expected to go through &quot;on the nod&quot;with little time having to be devoted to it;  a provision to increasedeposits would be a contentious addition and would represent an open-ended commitment in terms of Parliamentary time.    Even if agreement could be obtained with other Party leaders through theusual channels, it would be impossible to prevent amendments from being tabled by back-bench Members of any Party, and these wouldhave to be debated on the floor of the House of Commons. difficulties would also be created for the House of Lords whose time would be fully occupied for the remainder of the Session.    These problems would be increased if the Government, or even the major Parties,appeared to have avoided the normal procedure of a Speaker&apos;conference, and to have made up their own minds pre-empting icsconclusions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that themajority of the Cabinet were in favour of increasing the deposit at parliamentary elections, but considered that the matter should be put to a Speaker&apos;s Conference before the Government brought forward proposals for legislation.    Such proposals could not now be expected in the present Parliament.    In the meantime the Bill on election expenses should be confined to its present scope and should bebrought forward for enactment this Session.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.7
^ 54 The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryp?EpT&apos; of State for the Environment (CP(78) 43) on the recommendations^IvIEn atlo^Ltlonal safeguards contained in the Repoit of the WindscaleteQce THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that?jj   &apos; he had been invited by the Cabinet to report on the recommenda-. tions in paragraph 17.8 of the Inspectors Report before the 8&apos; Special Development Order (SDO) was debated in Parliament. the adjournment Debate in the House of Commons on 22 March on the inquiry Report had brought out that it would be helpful if theGovernment could react positively to these safety regulationsbefore seeking the House&apos;s approval to the SDO.    Of the 15recommendations, 13 created no problem;  but there was some difficulty with the remaining 2 - Recommendations Nos. 1 and 5 -because in each case the Inspector had proposed a kind ofOmbudsman, in the first case to deal with security precautions atWindscale and for the transport of plutonium associated with it;and in the second in relation to the fixing of radiological protectionstandards.    As for Recommendation 1, careful consideration would need to be given to the wider implications of the Inspector^proposal.    In regard to Recommendation 5, there was already a statutory body, the National Radiological Protection Eoard,charged with the task in question.    Nevertheless it wa3 essentialthat there should be complete public confidence in the arrangementsfor these aspects of nuclear safety and he was proposing to give a generally sympathetic response to the spirit of the recommenda-tions, but one which would fall short of a commitment to them.In discussion there was general support for the Secretary of Statefor the Environments proposals.    On Recommendation No. 1, itwas argued that it would be right to respond positively to theprinciple of the r -commendation, but in the realisation that whatever arrangements were decided upon there could be no questionof publishing any reports of security evaluations.    This would notnecessarily create difficulties with Parliament or the public generally, as had been instanced by the legislation for arming thecoustables of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority.Farliament had accepted the need for that legislation withoutprobing into the detail.    It would however be wrong to establish a formal body for carrying out the functions identified by the inspector, as such bodies tended to become too set in their ways.Ad hoc inquiries would be preferable.    It was important to ensureultimate Ministerial responsibility for these matters.    At present there was a Cabinet Committee charged with this responsibility.The use of ad hoc inquiries into particular problems would not conflict with this essential principle.In a further brief discussion which considered the suggestedresponse to the remaining recommendations, the following points were made:-8
a. Recommendations 3 and 4.    It was important to maintainthe confidence of local communities associated with nuclea.rplant and establishments.    Local committees had been setup but they weie not always sufficiently representative. Inparticular, they should include local union representatives.b. Recommendations 3. 4 and 9.    It was questioned whether there would be any difficulties in setting up the proposedadditional arrangements for monitoring in advance of theoxide reprocessing plant and whether there were adequatepowers to ensure that the plant could not be operated without adequate monitoring arrangements.    The problem was not however a lack of such powers, because in principle a range of conditions could be attached to the plant&apos;s operation, but rather deciding what was worth monitoring.c. Recommendation 15.    The reference in the proposedresponse to &quot;the foreseeable future&quot; did not imply a change inthe longer term from rail to road transport for fuel flasks.Nevertheless, they were regarded as being so strong and wellprotected as to be entirely suitable for road as well as rail transport.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet endorsed the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;sproposals on the Governments response to the Inspector&apos;srecommendations for additional safeguards.    The Secretary cfState for the Environment should, as he had suggested in his memorandum, clear with those of his Ministerial colleaguesconcerned, the text of the statement which he wished to make inadvance of the debate on the Special Development Order.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment to be guided accordingly.9-
frij, 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord^EMSHlP Privy Seal (CF(78) 44) about the negotiations for the introduction of^ MENTS Union Membership Agreements (UMAs) in the Civil Service.^ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that Cabinet hadSyiou last year considered an application from the trade unions for UMAsittei^ in the Civil Service, and had agreed upon the essential safeguardsfyj which should be applied.    These included a horizontal cut-off in thejiclu . non-industrial Civil Service above clerical officer level and a^teSg0li8* requirement that the agreement should operate after entry and not before, so that the unions could not dictate the terms of recruitment to the Civil Service.    Cabinet had subsequently consideredadditional safeguards, and had agreed upon a general charity optionas   an alternative to union membership.    It had decided to treatindustrial and non-industrial civil servants differently.    It had agreedthat the condition for introduction in the non-industrial Civil service should be a vote of 51 per cent of or more of those eligible to vote ina ballot of all concerned.    It had agreed that UMAs could be intro-duced in the industrial Civil Service only station by station, at thosestations where union membership was at or above a level of 90 percent.    The Lord Privy Seal and his officials had sought to negotiatethese conditions with the unions concerned, but the reaction had beenvery hostile.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic and industrial policy (El), under his chairmanship, had considered whether torecommend further concessions.    They had agreed, subject to cabinet approval, to reduce the minimum qualifying proportion from90 per cent to 75 per cent in industrial establishments, but to make no concessions on the nor-industrial Civil Service.    They recognisedthat this stand might involve industrial action by some or all of theunions concerned.    They had considered whether or not to consult the Trad4s Union Congress (TUC) before allowing negotiations tobreak down completely.    While this would serve to explain thereasons for the Governments position, the TUC would be bound tosupport its member unions and no change in their attitude could beexpected.    Finally, Cabinet would need to consider whether, if negotiations broke down, local management should be authorised totake disciplinary action against individuals who refused to worknormally as part of a campaign of industrial action.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he agreed with the conclusions of el, and with the need to make some token concession, by reducingthe proportion of qualifying union membership to 75 per cent, but otherwise to stand firm on the previous decisions.    Cabinet shouldnot underestimate, however, the strength of feeling among the unionsinvolved or their ability to cause considerable disruption.In discussion, it was argued that it was no part of the Government&apos;sduty, as a good employer, to act as a recruiting agent for the tradeunions.    The level of unionisation varied greatly between one government establishment and another.    There were serious political risks if the Government acquiesced in agreements whichforced a closed shop on to an establishment with a very low10
proportion of union membership.    The Opposition would not hesitate to exploit any such compulsion.    Against this it was argued that the safeguards which had already been negotiated completelyprotected the position of existing ron-union members.    The closed shop would aoply only to new recruits, and then only after appoint-ment.On the other hand it was argued that it was Government policy topermit the closed shop, under carefully defined conditions. TheGovernment had legislated to remove the previous statutory ban.That legislation had been aimed primarily at the bad employer, andindustrial relations in the Civil Service were in general good.Nevertheless, the Government had conceded the principal of UMAsin the Civil Service.    The difficulty stemmed from the long time ithad taken to negotiate acceptable safeguards, and from the freshconditions imposed by the Government during the negotiations. Theunions concerned, particularly the industrial unions with membershipoutside the Civil Service, found it difficult to understand the reasonsfor the Governments position.    It was very important to avoid a breakdown of the negotiations which would lead those unions intodirect conflict with the Government.    The negotiations should bekept going, therefore, as long as possible.     While it was temptingto expose the lack of support among union members generally for theclosed shop in the Civil Service, it would be a mistake to undermine the authority of the union leaders concerned.    In prolonging thenegotiations, it might be necessary to look again at the case for thestation by station approach, particularly if the unions could domcn-strate that th^ terms and conditions of service for the staff concerned were negotiated nationally.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed upon the need to maintain the safeguards which hadalready been laid down, to offer only minor concessions, but toavoid any breakdown in negotiations which would lead to industrialconflict in the next few months.    The Lord Privy Seal should therefore arrange to see the unions concerned once more, and he haddiscretion to offer them a reduction in the minimum qualifying levelof union membership at individual stations from 90per cent to75 per cent or to some intermediate figure if he judged thistactically   a better opening gambit.    If he could not settle on this basis he should report back to El, and subsequently to Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided accordingly.11
rijjj^^S: 7. The Cabinet had before them the Home Secretary&apos;3 minute&apos; L QUESTION    of 12 April 1973 to the Prime Minister reporting a discussion of theHome and Social Affairs (HS) Committee the previous day about theinclusion of an ethnic question in the 1981 Census and in the censustest proposed for 21 May 1978.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Secretary of State for social services had proposed that the 1981 Census should include a directquestion on race;  that a voluntary census test, involving 50,000households in Slough and Weymouth and proposed for 21 May thisyear, should contain the question in the form annexed to the HomeSecretary&apos;s minute;  and that a White Paper on the 1981 Census as awhole should be published at the end of April or early in May andshould include a proposal to ask an ethnic question on the basis thatthe Government would not finally decide on the form of the questionwithout further consultation, of which reactions to the test censuswould form a part.    It was not proposed to ask an ethnic question inthe Scottish census.    There was a strong feeling amongst ministers with responsibilities for social services that better information was required about the ethnic minorities, and the recent report of theSelect Committee on Race Relations and Immigration had also recommended this.    There had however been a division of view inHS Committee&apos;s discussions, mainly on the form of the questionwhich it was proposed to ask.    Although the majority of theCommittee had been in favour of including the question as proposedin the census test, a course which he himself favoured, theLord President of the Council in particular felt strongly that thiswould be ill-advised.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the census test had originally been planned for April but had been post-poned to May.    There were difficulties in postponing it further. Theethnic question was july  a small part of the test which jvas designedto try out the whole of the census operation.    For this purpose itwas necessary to hold the test at a time of year when conditions,such as daylight hours and the incidence of holidays, were comparable with those which would obtain during the census itself.    The censuswas a highly complex exercise which required careful preparationover a period of 3 years.    He was satisfied that if the census testwere further postponed, this would adversely affect the accuracy ortiming of the results to be expected from the Census.    He consideredtherefore that the census test should proceed on 21 May with or without the ethnic question, but that to omit the ethnic question would arouse stronger political reactions than to include it.In discussion it was argued that the recent focussing of public attention on the issue of immigration had created, in a pre-electionperiod, the worst possible climate for testing an ethnic questionwhich in its present form would be highly provocative.    The questionconfused colour with ethnic and national origin and the category&quot;white&quot; in particular would be open to sensational and damaging12CONFIDENTIAL
treatment in the popular Press.    Previous tests of the question hadbeen held in an atmosphere of relative calm in race relations.Nevertheless objections had been raised to it by a minority of WestIndians and in a recent New Society article which saw it both asmisleading and ae sorting out the whites from the non-whites. Inthe present atmosphere the question might well produce nusleadingor perverse answers.    It was also argued that there were objectionsof principle to a question which categorised people in the manner suggested.    This could only be justified if the categorisation wasnecessary to the duties of a public authority in providing services ofone kind or another, and there was no evidence that this was so. Theinformation required for public policies was concerned rather withsuch questions as language ability and the nature of employment or employment opportunities, and there was no separate provision of services according    to colour.    It was argued more generally,however, that there was an undoubted need for an ethnic question in the Census, as had been recognised in 1971.    The main problemlay in the form of the question, and further thought should be givento this:  a suitable alternative form might be to ask people in whichcountry of those listed they and their parents were born, somewhaton the lines of the 1971 Census or, more simply, to omit the category&quot;white&quot;&apos; from the existing form of question, though this might attractcriticism from the ethnic groups listed, and perhaps to omit the lastcategory as well whose width could create difficulty.On the other hand, it was argued that problems of multiple deprivationsuffered by West Indian and Asian communities in this country wouldnot be solved until the Government had accurate information about theextent of the problems, and this should be obtained at the earliest opportunity.    Experience in other countries had shown that governments did not commit themselves to greater expenditure and measures of positive discrimination in favour of minority groups,which the situation often required, until the facts had teen clearlyestablished.    The value of the ethnic question for the formulation of policies should not be looked at in isolation from the other questions in the census which covered housing, employment and a range of social matters and which would enable valuable and relevant informa-tion to be collated.    The form of the question had been extensivelytested over a period of years;  it had been discussed with theChairman of the Commission for Racial Equality and with leaders ofethnic minority groups;  and it had been used successfully in theHousing and Dwelling survey.    Although the category &quot;white&quot; might seem to have no logical place in the question, it provided the alterna-tive which gave the question its validity.    A question based on that inthe 1971 Census, on the other hand, which referred to parents&apos;countries of birth, would be ineffective, as it had already begun to bein 1971, and its reintroduction would be seen as a sign of weaknessin the Government and, particularly by the minority groups, as showing a lack of resolve to tackle their problems of disadvantage.It would be better to ask a direct question and to be prepared tojustify the by reference to the Governments general stance on13
immigration which was that numbers were relatively small andthat social policies bhould be devised to take account of the needsof those already settled here.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus si on,  said mat whilethe Cabinet recognised the need for census information about ethnicminorities, they rejected the form of the question proposed for the census test, in particular the inclusion of the category &quot;white&quot;. Iftherefore that test were to go ahead on 21 May with an ethnic question in it, as would be desirable to avoid speculation about theGovernments motives in dropping it. a new question must be devised and agreed by Ministers collectively.    The Secretary ofState for Social Services should accordingly arrange for the form ofthe question to be urgently considerea taking account of the suggestions made in the discussion, in particular the possibility ofa question which would ask people to indicate in which of the countrieslisted they and their parents were born.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office13 April 197814
