ARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the opposition had chosen unemployment as the subject for the Supply Day debate on Monday, 30 January, though the terms of their Motion were notyet known.    He had had tentative discussions with the Liberals, and hoped that it would be possible to devise a Government amendment to the Motion which the Liberals would support.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Gcvernmenthad suffered serious defeats in the votes on the Scotland Bill theprevious evening.    There had been a considerable delay in the taking of the second vote.    This had been caused by prolonged discussions in the Lobby involving members of the Scottish National Party and government Whips, c*bout whether the Government should seek toensure in Committee that the referendum clause should stand partof the Bill in its amended form, or whether to allow the clause to fall and seek to reinstate it ir a more acceptable fcrm on the report stage.    Had the delay continued, it would have prevented the thirdvote from taking place before the guillotine fell at 11 pm.    Points of order had been raised and the Chairman, Sir Myer Galpern, had sent the Serjeant at Arms to investigate, and had then ordered the voting figures to be reported to the Chair without further delay.He himself had at once got up and said that if there had been anyimproper delay in the lobbies, this was most reprehensible and theHouse would not condone it.    Mr Francis Pym, the Oppositionspokesman, had then protested about the incident and hadunsuccessfully attempted to persuade Sir Myer Galpern to informthe House what report he had received from the Serjeant at Arms.The Opposition were in a belligerent mood and would seek to pursue the matter.    He accordingly proposed to make a brief statementbefore the business statement that afternoon, aimed at closing thewhole affair.    This would be to the effect that he had conducted someinvestigations the previous night with Members of his own Party whohad been engaged in an altercation in the lobby about what was to happen in a subsequent division; that he thought this discussion hadbeen improperly prolonged and could have affected the timing of thenext vote, although in the event it did not do so;  and that h eapologised to the House that this should have occurred, and trustedthat it would not occur again.In discussion it was pointed out that, while the Opposition were seeking all possible opportunities to embarrass the Government onthe Scotland Bill, and must be expected to pursue their attempts toget Sir Myer Galpern to inform the House what the Serjeant at Arms1
had reported, Labour backbenchers, who were opposed to the bill and to the operation of the guillotine, were also involved and werecausing difficulties for the Government.    There was a good deal of bad feeling on the Government backbenches, which might persistfor some time anc. might also lead to difficulties on the european assembly Elections Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that once the Lord President of the Council had made an apology that afternoon,that should be the end of the matter.    It was difficult to see how theOpposition would be able to take it any further, and in any event theGovernment backbenchers should not support any attempts to do so.If the Government was to carry on, it was necessary that all labour members should be brought to understand the need to remain steadyin the presert Parliamentary situation and to suppott theGovernment;  and it was equally important that the Cabinet *tselfshould present a united front.    It would be necessary to considerlater what action the Government should take on the matters on whichthey had been defeated in Committee on the Scotland Bill.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.*ith the THE PRIME MINISTER said that at recent meetings Mr David Steel,4ber.aj the Liberal Leader, had pointed to the need for improvedconsultations between Ministers and Liberal spokesmen.&apos;teviou ^r Steel had given some instances where he considered that the*et&quot;reference Government had not kept to the spirit of the arrangement with the-fy(77j    * Liberals, and it was important to avoid any failures to consult.&apos;QnciUs- Cabinet Ministers, and Junior Ministers involved, should be careful^riute 1    S&apos; consul* an(l inform Liberal spokesmen in good time not only aboutimpending legislation but also about policy announcements. Hewould arrange for a reminder to that effect to be circulated-The Cabinet -Took note.confidential
0 T^DSURES 2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that recently the Press hadPRESS seemed to be uncommonly well briefed on matters coming beforethe Cabinet and Cabinet Committees and often on the stands which individual Ministers were likely to take.    This was detrimental to cabinet solidarity and often created a false impression ofindecisiveness.    In the few weeks since Christmas there had beena series of well-informed reports on collective Ministerialdiscussions, covering the activities and membership of the ministerial Sub-Committ2e on Pay Negotiations, miners1 pay,devaluation of the Green Pound, the thermal reactor choice, andtne problems of the steel industry.    These were all serious issues.He understood the desire of Ministers to influence public opinionbut it was not helpful to the Government, and it created extrapressures on Ministers, if the Press were informed of mattersunder consideration and of the views of individual Ministers on them.He therefore asked Ministers to exercise restraint and to consider carefully the impact which any disclosure to the Press might have on the Government1 s standing generally.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.3
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY paid thatPremier Price of Belize was torn between the chance of securingindependence and the political difficulty of making any cession of territory.    His Government could not publicly admit that they wouldbe prepared to endorse any proposal to cede territory. Privately,however, Mr Price would like us to bring his country to earlyindependence on the basis that the settlement would be put to the vote of the people of Belize without any pressure on them to accept it. Ifwe were able to narrow the gap further with the Guatemalans W3 might then be able to put the proposals to a referendum.  This might wellremit in their rejection by the people of Belize, after which pressure for independence would subside.    The fact was thai the Guatemalanshad a very weak claim but it had traditionally been backed by theUnited States.    Under President Carter, however, American support for Guatemala had weakened and the Americans were prepared to seek a compromise.    We had already pushed the Guatemalans a long way and he hoped at a meeting with the Guatemalan Foreign Minister,Dr Molina, next week to get- them to move still further. PrivatelyMr Price was in favour of a settlement and there was probably somemovement in hie position.    But he was being undermined by theOpposition Party in Belize and this made him unwilling to endorse the sort cf package we had in mind, which wculd include some form ofmediation within terms previously agreed, a treaty with Guatemala,aid and independence on the basis of some cession of territory.The assurances in the treaty would be underwritten by the UnitedStates as well as by Mexico, Venezuela and, in practice, the rest ofthe Organisation cf American States.   A. settlement on these lines should enable us to phase out our foxces within a year.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr Price wa3 looking for assuranceson defence, but the opposition to him was getting stronger and wewould need to have regard to our own interests.    We should not beseen in the role of appeasers.    We were not in a position to provideany security guarantees after independence.    We had played anhonourable role in trying to find a basis for a settlement and hadbeen largely responsible for the majorities behind the United Nationsresolutions in support of Belize.    We might find it necessary to takethe position in the United Nations that we had done our best to try tobring Belize to independence in accordance with these resolutions andthat we could not be held responsible for failure to achieve this.Before accepting definite commitments with regard to Belize theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should bring the matter again to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee and subsequently to theCabinet.The Cabinet -1*.     Took note.4
81a THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that herevi0u would be meeting the leaders of the Patriotic Front in Malta earlyefe     s next week and was likely to be under pressure from them to condemnl^g.n^e: the negotiations which Mr Smith was conducting on an internal0nclu &quot; 8t settlement.    We had adopted the position that we were aiming at atunlte8l0as&apos; peaceful settlement which would include a ceasefire.    This might bedifficult to achieve, but it was at least an honourable position. Weshould certainly avoid being implicated in Mr smith s internalnegotiations, but he could not condemn these negotiations, as thePatriotic Front wished him to do, because there were elements in them which were based on our own proposals.    The position was anuncomfortable one but we would have to live with it for the time being.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we should measure any internalsettlement reached through Mr Smith&apos;a negotiations against Our sixprinciples.    Mr Smith had always succeeded in evading these principles and it would be important to ensure that they were carriedout.    But if they were, we should not hesitate to say so.The Cabinet -2.     Took note.
fl^ERl 4. The Cabinet had before them a note (CP(78) 8) by thePOUqy Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Secretary ofState for Scotland on the negotiating position we should take inl^p^ discussions with Community Fisheries Ministers on 27-30 January.evioUsCij(78Tie: THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said^iclu  S that the Ministerial Committee on European Questions at theirknuteS*0ns&apos; meeting on 25 January had agreed that we should work for a packagecomprising adequate quotas, some improvement in Communityconservation measures with a reserved right to take nationalmeasures under certain conditions, ultimate exclusive access towaters within 12 miles of our coast and preferential access to watersbetween 12 and 50 miles.    However there was no immediate prospectof a definitive overall settlement.    The Commission saw a need forfurther discussions with ourselves and the Germans over thearrangements for preferential access and with the French over the definition and phasing out of historic rights within 12 miles.Meanwhile the Germans had sought to withhold their agreement tothe devaluation of the Green Pound pending progress in the ministerial discussions on fish:  his response had been that hewould be unwilling to participate in those discussions without an assurance of German acquiescence in the devaluation.In discussion of the substance of our negotiating position it waspointed out that the Ministerial Committee had considered that our need for access preference between 12 and 50 miles might best besecured on the basis of the preferential quota we expected to obtain.The package as a whole was likely to be more favourable for inshorethan for deep-sea fishermen.    We should resist German pressure for an early settlement on their own terms, but contacts withdraw von Dohnanyi, Minister of State in the Federal Ministry ofForeign Affairs, should make it possible to resolve the link withthe Green Pound so that we could participate in the further negotiations on fisheries.In further discussion it was pointed out that our requirements wouldnot be easy to secure and that even if we were successful thesettlement might get a hostile reception from the industry and be defeated in Parliament.    Preliminary consultation with the Liberalshad confirmed that it would be extremely difficult to secure their support.    It should be clear to our partners from experience overthe devaluation of the Green Pound that we could not accept asettlement which would not be saleable to Parliament.    It mighcbecome necessary to explain our difficulty to them at a level higherthan that of Fishery Ministers.    But our partners were showingrecognition of our political needs and had moved a considerableway to meet us on quotas.    Meanwhile we should work to convince theindustry and Parliament of the need for an early settlement onreasonable terms that would avoid a damaging confrontation with theCommunity.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were content, subject to the points made in discussion,with the negotiating position approved by the Ministerial Committeeon European Questions.    We should not reach a settlement thatwould not be accepted by Parliament.    The Chief Whip, and ifpossible the Lord President of the Council, should attend the next meeting of the Committee on fisheries so that Parliamentaryconsiderations could be taken fully into account.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Fisheries Ministers to be guided accordingly.7
5. THE HOME SECRETARY said that all the indications nowwere that there would be an overtime ban starting on 1 Februaryrather than a strike.    Contingency planning had therefore goneahead on this basis.    The oil companies expected to be able todeal with the situation by extending the timing of deliveries byabout 30 per cent.    So as to ensure that services essential to the life of the community suffered minimum disruption, the companies would be provided with a list of priority users for whom special arrangements should be made.    Apart from this, the Governmentwould not take any direct part in allocating supplies in the early stages of an overtime ban.    If, however, the ban was prolonged and serious shortages developed, the Government would need to actto reduce the demands for oil and various measures were in hand forthis purpose.    Any more serious deterioration of the situation wouldrequire measures on lines similar to those worked out for a fullscale strike, including the requisitioning of tankers and the use of servicemen to deliver fuel for essential supplies and services.Plans were in preparation for this possible contingency but he would of course consult his colleagues first if there were any question oftheir being needed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, withthe Secrccary of State for Transport, he had met the NationalOfficer of tha Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU)Mr Ashwell, and the Shell shop stewards on the previous day.Mr Ashwell had reiterated that the company&apos;s proposals were not acceptable and had pressed for consideration of the Union&apos;s demands for consolidating existing supplements of  6.15 and then adding10 per cent of last year&apos;s average earnings to the basic rate.Mr Ashwell had said that, if this proposal was accepted, the union would not ask to work overtime, although they would agree to do soat the company1 s request.    He had held out no hope of being able tomeet Mr Ashwell&apos;s demands and had asked him to go away and thinkfurther about the possibility of a deal based on increased productivity.    It seemed likely that when the Shell shop stewardsmet again on 30 January they would decide on an overtime ban.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that it now seemed inevitable that from 1 February all the major companies would ba faced with industrial action of some kind.    This wouldprobably take the form of a ragged overtime ban, and it was not clear how much support it would get.    No-one wanted a strike andthis could not be regarded as an immediate danger since any decision to call one would have to be taken at the national level ofthe TGWU.    He had spoken to Mr Len Murray and emphasised theconsequences for industry of an overtime ban.    From the time itstarted there was little doubt that all concerned would be looking for a way out, especially as the drivers would be losing one-third8I TANKERMVERs
of their normal gross pay.    Texaco were already saying that it wouldbe necessary to think again by about the third week in February.The oil companies believed they could settle on a basis which wouldprovide around a 12 or 13 per cent increase but it had been made clear to them that this would not be consistent with the guidelines.In discussion it was pointed out that if Servicemen were to be usedit would take 17 days from the start before the whole 9, 500 menwere in action.    Half of these would come from Germany andaccording to present rules, would lose their Local OverseasAllowance, which would cause hardship and resentment.   This wasbeing pursued separately.    It would also be necessary to ensurethat the Services were not put in a position where they appeared tobe strike breaking.    They would do all that was required in relationto essential services but we would need to scrutinise the list of services carefully to ensure that they really were essential.In further discussion it was suggested that in the case of an overtimeban it would be important not to give the impression that this involved a Government co.ifrontation with the Union.    We should leave, it to the companies to take the lead in publicising the need foreconomies in the use of fuel, but the Government should be preparedto support exhortations of this kind.    We should leave the public inno doubt that if the worst came to the worst, the Government would do what was necessary and we should stress the importance of asettlement which was within the pay guidelines.    The point should bemade that the industrial action was damaging not only to the countryand to industry, but also to the drivers themselves and that we hopedcommon sense would prevail.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the probable course of events and the contingency measures proposed to meet it.    Contingency plans should be completed as soon as possible so that, should thesituation deteriorate, the Government would be in a position to takeemergency action at short notice if necessary.    The outstanding points relating to priorities for supplies to essential services shouldbe settled in the appropriate committee.    They agreed with thegeneral line for publicity which had been proposed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.9
PLqyx The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of State forftSup-   NT        Employment and the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General (CP(78) 6 and CP(78) 9) about the extension ofspecial employment measures.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the Ministerial Group onUnemployment Among Young People (GEN 27) had considered the needfor continuing special employment measures when tne existingTemporary Employment Subsidy (TES), the Job Release Scheme (JRS)and the Small Firms Employment Subsidy Scheme (SFES) ran out atthe end of April.    GEN 27 had agreed that these measures should becontinued for a further year though they wished to consider furtherwhat additional measures might also be taken.    The TES was by far the largest of the present measures, covering 186, 000 jobs atDecember 1977.    Extension of TES required the approval oi theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) Commission,. Formalobjections to the scheme had been made to the Commission by the Danesand the Irish.     The Commission considered that, particularly in the textile, clothing and footwear industries, TES created a distortion oftrade and unfair competition.    They were pressing hard for reductions in ihe impact of TES in those industries.    The Commission required the Governments proposals for extending TES to reach them by the endof this month.    GEN 27 had taken the view that it was best to attemptto reach a negotiated settlement with the Commission rather than to resist any changes at all.    The options appeared to be either simply toreduce the impact of TES in the textile, clothing and footwearindustries or to attempt to offset this reduction by new measures Suchas a short-time working compensation scheme.    She proposed thatGEN 27 should consider on Monday 30 January the Government&apos;sdetailed proposals.    Further discussion with the Commission mightbe needed before then.    As regards the SFES this was at presentrestricted to the Special Development Areas and to firm3 employing upto 50 people.    The majority of GEN 27 wished to see the schemeextended to firms employing up to 200 people in Development areas and Inner City Partnership Areas.    The Secretary of State for employment wished to extend the scheme to the country as a whole.As regards  JRS the majority of GEN 27 wished to see it extendedfrom Assisted Areas to the country generally and to see the weeklypayments increased from  26. 50 to a figure around  28- 30. Theywere opposed to the Secretary of State for Employments proposal toincrease the eligibility to two years before retirement and to increasethe allowance to  40 per week tax free.    The gross cost of the GEN 27proposals in the next financial year would be  144 million.    The totaleffect on the register of all measures to reduce unemployment includingthe GEN 27 proposals by March 1979 would be in the order of 283, 000,an increase of 23, 000 on present levels.    If the impact of TES were reduced the package would need to be reconsidered.    The Group wouldthen be sympathetic to extending SFES nationally and other measuresmight also be necessary.    She recognised the need for an early announcement by the Government but it was not possible to this stage tomake a comprehensive statement.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theemployment prospects this year was gloomy and that the measures he proposed, which would reduce the unemployment register by abcut110, COO, had to be compared with the increase in the labour forcenext year of around 170, 000.    He had considered how far theindustrial strategy might help to reduce unemployment but on the basisof the forty Sector Working party  s reports it did not look as though there would be any net gain in employment.    Reflation would help buthe estimated that it cost 10 times as much to get extra jobs throughreflation than through the dpecial measure and the latter acted muchmore quickly.    He thought it essential accordingly to go for as large a package as possible.    Cn TES his soundings of the Commission had made it clear that they would expect some explicit changes to reduceits impact in the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, and alsothat they would wish to examine any new scheme brought forward to offset any reductions in TES.    He proposed to notify theCommission that we wanted to extend TES for a further year, that wewere prepared to make some procedural changes from April and tomodify its application to the textiles, clothing and footwear industriesfrom July when we proposed to introduce a short-time workingcompensation scheme for those industries, which should produce thesame register effect as continuing TES unchanged.    The newcompensation scheme would require a short Bill and he had already discussed this with the Lord President of the Council.    Once we hadnotified our proposals to the Commission we could not expect that theywould remain unpublicised and he thought it right that a statement ofthe Governments intentions should be made to Parliament by the endof the month along the lines of the draft announcement annexed to his paper.In discussion of the general employment outlook it was suggested thatthe prospects were less gloomy than had been suggested.    There hadbeen an increase in employment last year of about 100, 000 and improved growth could be expected this year.    Special employmentmeasures were needed but it had to be recognised that they tended toblunt the effect of reflationary measures.In discussion on TES it was argued that if the forthcoming negotiationswith the Commission on TES were carefully handled they could lead toa satisfactory outcome.     This could however be prejudiced if theGovernment adopted too rigid an approach.    It would be necessary toshow some understanding of criticisms on TES and to make clearour willingness to look at alternatives, since if we could not get theapproval of the Commission or the Council of Ministers to extending the schemes beyond the end of March then action under the extendedscheme would be unlawful under English domestic law.    It wassuggested that if reduction in the scope of TES were to be made in thetextiles, clothing or footwear industries then these should not applyi* Northern Ireland given the special employment iprobleme of theProvince and the importance of the textile industry there;  and also11
that if concessions had to be made on the application of TES it would bebetter to apply these to the clothing rather than the textile industry.In the clothing industry many firms claimed TES simply because their competitors had done so rather than because  they would makeredundancies.    In textiles many of the firms who had received TESwould cease to be eligible when their present support ran out and itwas not clear whether these firms would be assisted by the short-time working compensation scheme.In discussion on SFES it was argued in favour of extending the schemeto the countrv as a whole that this would incrun3 c the effect on theregister to 23, 000 as against 4, 750 if it were simply extended to theDevelopment Areas.    It would still be possible to give a preference to development Areas and Inner City Partnership Authorities by payingat a higher rate in those areas.    Expansion would also help theGovernment in their talks with the TUC about job expansion subsidies.No trouble from the e.c. Commission need be expected as they werefavourably disposed towards job expansion schemes.    Against this itwas argued that, the SFES was not cost effective and tended to subsidisepeople who would be employed in any case.    Public money was beingwasted on this scheme and on the other special employment measureswhich could be put to more effective use.    Rather than extend SFES tothe country as a whole, it might be better to prolong the period forwhich payments were made.    In the field of employment measuresgenerally it would be worthwhile considering whether further assistance might be given to the Development Commission and its a gency, theCouncil for Small Industries in Rural Areas (COSIRA) to help with problems of rural unemployment.Iii discussion cf the JRS it was argued that this was the only specialemployment measure which operated on labour supply and that as thescheme only paid out where a registered unemployed person took the job that had been released there was always a saving of unemploymentbenefit.    Pressures were developing for action on labour supplythrough, for example, the introduction of a 35-hour or 4 day week and extending the scope of JRS provided a defensible response.    Other eec countries were using schemes of thie kind.    Experience with thescheme in Assisted Areas so far had suggested that there would bebenefit from extending it nationally but that the present level of payment was too low.    Evidence suggested that the critical level in attractingapplicants was around  38 and a proposal to increase the weeklypayment to  40 tax free would greatly increase the register effect ofthe scheme.    Criticism had been made that it was a tax free allowancebut unemployment benefits were tax .free and the scheme entailed no more than swapping one tax free benefit for another.    There would beenormous complications if the benefits were to be taxable. against this it was argued that, although there was no objection to moving thescheme onto a national basis,  40 a week tax free was too high inrelation to other benefits and in relation to the taxed income of the low paid.    If people were to be eligible under the scheme 2 years beforeretirement legislation would be necessary to keep the allowance tax12
free and this could give rise to problems.    A nationally basedscheme operating two years before retirement might be seen as an indication of the Government&apos;s willingness to move on a lowering ofthe retirement age generally.    Many who might benefit under thescheme were likely to be occupational pensioners who would not need the money.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that TES, SFES and JRS should be continued for a further year and that work should go ahead on the preparationof a short-time working compension scheme for application in the textile, clothing and footwear industries.    The Secretary of Statefor Employment should put his legislative proposals for such ascheme to Legislation Committee as soon as possible. Anannouncement of the Government1 s intentions could be made by theSecretary of State for Employment in the debate on Monday30 January.    This would have to be in general terms at this stage and care should be taken to avoid giving any impression to the EECCommission that we had decided to adopt a rigid position on TES.The Secretary of State for Employment should circulate to hiscolleagues a draft of what he proposed to say.    They approved the approach which he had outlined for negotiations with the Commissionon TES:  GEN 27 should examine at their meeting on 30 January theterms of the notification to the Commission about the Government&apos;intentions.    If serious problems arose in the negotiations theSecretary of State should bring the matter back for his colleagues toconsider.    On SFES the Cabinet agreed that it should be extended toinclude all Assisted Areas and Inner City Partnership Authorities.Further consideration could be given to extending it nationally in thelight of negotiations with the Commission on TES.    On JRS they agreed that it should be extended nationally but on the present basisof eligibility.    They had reached no firm view on the size of theincrease in weekly payments which should be made;  this neededfurther consideration taking into account the level of other benefits and other points made in discussion.    The Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General should arrange forGEN 27 to bring forward fresh proposals on this point, and to consider any additional proposals including the suggestion that the development commission and its Scottish and Welsh equivalents might have anenhanced role in relieving unemployment.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theSecretary of State for Employment and the Secretaryof State for Education and Science and paymaster general to be guided accordingly.13
INefits&apos; ^ORtu &apos;* The Cabinet had before it a note by the Secretary of thea oil Cabinet (CP(78) 7) covering a draft White Paper on the benefits of north Sea oil, prepared in the Cabinet Office and incorporating aevi0Ug number of amendments made by the Policy Unit.^77) 4&quot; THE PRIME MINISTER said he was grateful to the authors of theQclUsi present draft for a version which focussed very clearly the issuesOute 5   S&apos; on which the Cabinet should now concentrate.The Cabinet considered the document section bv section. Thefollowing main points were made in discussion -i. There should be a section early in the paper takingcredit for the Governments actions in making the resourcesof the North Sea available to the British people - througheffective depletion policy, state participation, the impositionof a suitable fiscal regime, and the encouragement of technology.    The nature of the technical achievement shouldbe emphasised to avoid the impression that North Sea oil wasa totally uncovenanted benefit.ii. The introduction should also bring out the reasons forthe long decline in Britain&apos;s industrial performance and the steps which have been taken already, particularly as part ofthe industrial strategy, to arrest it.    The object was to emerge after the period of North Sea oil with a strongereconomic base.    This section should also explain the natureof the world slump and emphasise that the problems of thelast few years had not been purely a British balance ofpayments crisis.iii. The size of the additional resources described inparagraph 13 could be expressed more clearly and placed inits proper context.    Illustrative tables would help here.The existing benefits of gas as well as the potential benefits of oil should be included.    The object should however be toavoid excessive euphoria and any impression that North Seaoil was a solution to all our problems.iv. The draft should not be an occasion for announcingspecific policy changes which the Government has not yettaken.    For example, the last sentence of paragraph 8 shouldbe omitted.v. There should be greater emphasis on regional policy,to which the Government had given great importance in itsoriginal 1974 proposals for the control of North Sea oil. Allreferences to the regions should be drafted to include Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.14
vi. The references to the balance of payments shouldcarefully avoid taking a position on the appreciation of sterling, but should indicate that one of the consequences of North Sea oil would be to make it more difficult to compensate for the loss of competitiveness by depreciation.vii. The first half of paragraph 20 on &quot;The Use of north sea Revenues to Assist National Recovery1&apos; was a crucialpassage.    It needed to be rewritten so as to begin with ageneral statement that the objective was to use a temporaryincrement of resources to produce a lasting reconstruction of the economy rather than a short term spending spree.It should go on to mention how the North Sea oil revenuescould contribute to a number of different and complementaryways of achieving this, including industrial investment,energy and infra structure, and the expansion of demandthrough tax reductions.    This should not however be done ina way as to imply an ordered list of priorities.viii. The references to debt repayment in paragraph 20would be redrafted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in thelight of an announcement which he proposed to make that afternoon.ix. The section on investment in industry should avoid the impression that North Sea revenues would be devoted to maintaining existing unsuccessful industries, and should notover-emphasise direct public investment.x. The passages on energy should stress the large scale of the resources which need to be invested in existing nuclearand conventional forms of energy, and put less emphasis onthe non-conventional renewable forms.xi. The stress laid on further investment in the modernisation of industry would inevitably arouse concern about the loss of jobs, and the draft should include references to the creation of further employment in the service sector,including the public services.xii. The references to tax reductions in paragraphs 31and 32 were too sweeping.    The Government were completelyopposed to the Opposition suggestion that the whole benefitof North Sea oil revenues should be taken up in reductions in personal taxation.    But at the same time, reductions in taxation had a part to play in restoring incentives and inexpanding demand;  the breathing space offered by North Seaoil on the balance of payments made this possible.15
xiii. The section on public investment and the public services should stress the objectives of policy in these areasrather than or. the particulat services which might be expanded as additional resources became available.xiv.
