. ^MENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.flUl THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that the Governmenthad the previous evening received an unexpected defeat on Clause 82 of8 the Wales Bill.    This was the Governments first defeat on the Billkh\ Ce: and it had been brought about by an unlikely combination of Nationalists,W ?kth Liberals and Conservatives, all of whom had been seeking different*-^jej0ns. and contradictory objectives.    The amendment made no sense: its effect was that powers would be transferred from Westminsterimmediately on Royal Assent, but there would be no Assembly to take them over.    It was expected that reason would prevail at Report stage and the Clause would then be restored.In discussion it was explained that in voting to delete the Clause the conservatives had been seeking to remove the power contained in clause 82(4) which with Clause 73 enabled the House of Commons to override a refusal by the House of Lords to approve an order bringing the Act into operation under Clause 82(1).    This power should beretained if possible, but it was not of fundamental importance since the lords were unlikely to withhold their agreement on a matter whichwould have been the subject of a referendum.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theGovernment would seek to have the Clause reinstated at Report Stage.It was unlikely that the circumstances which had led to the deletion ofthe Clause in Committee would be repeated at Report Stage, but ifnecessary the Government could concede the proposed power of theHouse of Commons to override the Lords&apos; refusal to approve an order.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of theirdiscus sion.Veand THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that satisfactory progress towards metricationhad been made since the original decision 13 years ago, but during thepast three weeks the subject had become unusually controversial. Aconsiderable degree of public antagonism had been revealed which theOpposition had sought to exploit by a change of stance;  Labour back-benchers had also begun to waver in their support for the government&apos;s policy.    These events had culminated in opposition to the Weights and1
Measures Orders which were now before Parliament, and the subject was one of considerable sensitivity.    It might be possible to avoidcriticism by delaying further progress for a time, but to abandon theOrders altogether could be politically more damaging.    There was considerable support for metrication from consumer organisations,schools and others.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the developments described were disturbing.    It was important thatpolitically sensitive issues of this kind should be brought at an early stage to the notice of colleagues and discussed collectively. Therewas a constant danger that Government initiatives, however sensible,would be misrepresented by the Opposition and in the Press, and all ministers should be alive to their political implications.    The subjectof metrication should be brought to the appropriate ministerial committee for collective discussion as soon as possible.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection to proceed accordingly.2
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,as a re stilt of the lecent meetings which ne and Mr Vance, the UnitedStates Secretary of State, had attended in Southern Africa, it might nowbe possible to move on to a conference of all the parties.    There hadbeen some signs at the meetings in Dar es Salaam that the PatrioticFront were beginning to negotiate seriously, although they wereunrealistic in their demands for dominance during the transitional period and in the changes on which they were insisting in the structure of the police force.    Mr Nkomo in particular had been in a negotiatingmood, but it would be dangerous for us to take any obvious steps to try to exclude Mr Mugabe, who, if we did, would be backed by the FrontLine Presidents and who controlled the most effective guerrillafighters.    In Salisbury there was a good deal of resistance to the ideaof an all-party conference, but the argument that the internal agree-ment could not provide the basis for a long-term settlement appearedto have made some impression.    We could expect some support fromthe South Africans for the idea of a conference, and there was a good chance that this would take place some time in May.    A major problem would be deciding where it should be held.    There would be someadvantages in having it in London, but the difficulty was that Mr Smithand some members of his regime would be liable to arrest.    It mightbe possible to give them temporary immunity, but he recognised thatthere were legal difficulties about this and there was also the risk ofdemonstrations.    New York would be preferable if all the partiescould be persuaded to go there.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said theCabinet welcomed the fact that there now seemed to be a reasonable prospect of a conference of all the parties but felt that there were serious objections to holding it in London.    This should only beconsidered if we were certain that the conference would be successful.The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Chancellor Schmidt of the federal republic of Germany would be visiting the United Kingdom on23-24 April with a team of Ministers and senior officials;  and he wasin touch with members of the Cabinet directly concerned. Thediscussions would include industrial collaboration, Communityquestions, notably fisheries and the Common Agricultural Policy,Urenco   and monetary questions.3

mSECRETDQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT38COPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 20 April 1978 at 10. 30 am^OMALIES     The Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Chancellor of theki^-WARD        Exchequer (CM(78) 45) reporting discussions in the MinisterialNTS       Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay,e Negotiations (EY(P)) on the recommendations of the review bodies&apos;^XXb on armed forces and doctors and dentists&apos;pay, and making some&quot;If?^061 further proposals for the establishment of an Anomalies Board to-,Hcj&apos; ^th consider other problems of pay, initially but not exclusively, in the&apos;W 8ions* public services.    It also had before it the Seventh Report of the^3Armed Forces Pay Review Body (CP(78) 46) and the Eighth Reportof the doctors and Dentists&apos; Pay Review Body (CP(78) 47).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the two review body reports needed to be considered against the background of payarrangements for certain other parts of the public sector. Therewere a number of groups for whose pay the Government was responsible where the Government had established advisory bodiesto determine the appropriate rates to be paid.    It was now clearthat the re commendations coming from these bodies would be wellabove the guidelines.    These included the armed forces, doctors and dentists, the top salaries group and university teachers where aspecial anomaly existed dating from 1975.    In addition theGovernment has accepted substantial forward commitments in respectof firemen and, by implication, for the police where the report of theEdmund Davies enquiry was awaited.    The Cabinet&apos;s decision to restore pay research for the Civil Service would be likely to raisesimilar issues for the generality of civil servants in the following year.    It was clear that there was general dissatisfaction in thepublic services over pay for most of whom productivity deals,allowing payments outside the guidelines, was not possible. in previous discussions the Cabinet had agreed that no offers should bemade within the public service of more than 10 per cent, and thatforward commitments concerned with the restoration of previousrelativities or the elimination of anomalies should be confined to the bare minimum.    The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) inits Seventh Report, had estimated that the armed forces had fallen32 per cent behind the pay of the rest of the community.    They had recommended a pay increase in 1978 of sufficient size to ensure that
the armed forces did not fall further behind.    This indicated anincrease in the range 13. 5-14 per cent.    They recommended thatthe residue of the anomaly be phased out over two years. the doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB) had quantified theanomaly for the doctors and dentists as 28 per cent, and had recommended a settlement of 10 per cent this year, distributedunevenly between different members of the medical profession.Every time the Cabinet approved an unqualified commitment to a group of this kind, it invited pressure from other groups whoseanomalies were only slightly less serious.    It had been estimatedthat there was some 200 groups who might reasonably claimsimilar treatment.    Unfortunately the growing resentment in thepublic sector that it had been unfairly penalised by the Governmentspay policies was to some extent matched by equal resentment in theprivate sectcr at the extent to which the public sector had beeninsulated from the hardships of the last few years.    As for paypolicy generally after 1 August, the response from the trade unionsso far had been better than the Government could have expected.Even at the Scottish Trades Union Congress the previous day, the vote had been 7 to 9 in favour of continued discussions on pay withthe Government, and some trade union leaders were actually asking for a further structured pay policy.    Against this backgroundEY(P) had considered the recommendation of the two review bodies and had given some preliminary thought to possible machinery fordealing with anomalies in future.    They had agreed that there was no chance of getting union acquiescence in such machinery in time tohelp the problems of the armed forces and the other public sectorgroups whose pay would have to be settled shortly.    This was a longer term question to which Ministers might wish to return later.They had also agreed, subject to Cabinet, not to dispute the findings of the review bodies about the extent of the anomalies.    But urgentdecisions were now needed on the size of the increase to be giventhis year.    The position had been made more difficult by Pressleaks about the AFPRB recommendations and the feelings of the armed forces.    The view of EY(P) was that there should be a basicincrease of 10 per cent in the pay of Servicemen and women thisyear with such additional improvements as could be authorisedwithout undue repercussions in other parts of the economy. Theirpreference was for an increase of 2 per cent in overall pay fromchanges in charges and allowances, and of 2 per cent related to theX factor.    Both these proposals were necessarily rather arbitrary.They carried the risk of repercussions, especially from the improvements in allowances.    But some of the trade union leaderswith whom he had discussed the general problem indicated that theymight accept a measure of special treatment for the law and ordersector.    The majority view in EY(P) was that the armed forces should be given an assurance, similar to that given to the firemen,about the phasing of the AFPRB recommendations over the next twoyears.    Some Ministers felt, however, that if this commitmentwere given, the basic increase should be no more than 10 per cent.The Secretary of State for Defence, on the other hand, considered
that there should be a  10 per cent increase in basic pay, and afurther 10 per cent in respect of the X factor.    This went beyondthe recommendations of the review body.    The balance of opinionwithin the Sub-Committee had been in favour of a package ofapproximately 14 per cent on the lines he had outlined.    The Sub-Committee had found less difficulty with the immediaterecommendations of the DDRB, although there might be argumentswithin the profession on the distribution of the 10 per cent overallincrease.    The sponsor Ministers wanted a forward commitment on the removal of the anomaly, similar to that proposed for the armed forces, but the majority of the Sub-Committee could not see any way of offering this outside the law and order field without alsobringing in the university teachers and probably the top salariesgroup.    The Sub-Committee would need to  consider these groupsfurther, and agreed that the doctors and dentists settlement couldbe postponed until then.Forces Pay     THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet should know that hehad received a letter from the Chiefs of Staff expressing theirstrongly felt view that the recommendations of the AFPR3 shouldbe implemented, immediately and in full if possible, and if not,then by 10 per cent now, together with a substantial increase in theX factor and a forward commitment similar to that given to firemen.He would arrange to see the Chiefs of Staff in order to inform them of the Governments decisions when  these had been taken.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said it was unfortunate that the Cabinet discussion had been to some extentpre-empted by premature leaks of the proposals before them.But there was a real problem over armed services pay, exemplifiedby the 32 per cent gap between that and the pay of comparablecivilians which had been identified by the AFPRB.    At the bottom of the scale there was real hardship among young privates withfamilies.    The X factor, which had been intended to recognise the special hardships of Service life, had been eroded by this gap.Although he would have preferred a settlement of 10 per cent onbasic rates plus 10 per cent for the X factor, he was content to fallin with the majority view of EY(P), provided it was accompaniedby a clear forward commitment.    It was important that this shouldbe as unequivocal as that given to the firemen.    A settlement onthese lines would not be without its political difficulties. Therewould still remain a serious problem of morale in the armed forces.    On the details of the proposals, he felt the additionalincreases, over the basic 10 per cent, should be concentrated onthe X factor rather than on particular allowances.In discussion, there was wide support for an overall increase inexcess of 10 per cent for the armed forces.    It was however argued that this generous treatment was inconsistent with the line taken bythe Government on the low paid and on groups covered by wages
councils.    It would be particularly difficult to give 14 per cent tothe armed forces, if this were accompanied by a strong forwardcommitments    The firemen had only been given the forwardcommitment on condition that they accepted 10 per cent. Further-more, even if the armed forces were to be given exceptionaltreatment, the composition of the additional 4 per cent neededgreat care in presentation.    While there were obvious difficultiesin adjustments to allowances and charges, which might appear undulyartificial, it was also important to avoid concessions which couldtoo readily be copied in the private sector or in the rest of the public sector.    It was also important to ensure that these increases werenot presented, as the AFPRB had proposed, as a means of ensuring that the armed forces did not fall further behind:  this impliedimmediately that the Government expected the outturn of the presentpay round to be much more .than 10 per cent, and would promptother groups who had not yet settled to seek increases of around14 per cent too.    It might even provoke some gioups to reopenexisting settlements.    The Government should avoid giving any specific figure, and should relate as much as possible of theadditional increase to the special factors of Service life. Theannouncement should be made as quickly as possible to avoid furtherleaks.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the Government should accept the finding of the AFPRB on the eventual size of the military salary.They agreed that the 1978 pay settlement for the armed forces should comprise a 10 per cent increase in basic pay, together withincreases in the X factor worth a further 3 per cent and increases in allowances, or postponements in charges, worth a further per cent.    This would bring the total value of the settlement to14 per cent, thus meeting the recommendation of the Review Bodythat the armed forces should not fall further behind the rest of theworking population this year.    The task of precise allocation of the10 per cent would be handed over to the AFPRB as they had recommended in their report.    The Cabinet also agreed that theGovernment should undertake to eliminate the residue of theanomaly for the armed forces in the timescale recommended by the review bodies, using the same formula as in the case of the fire service.    The Secretary of State for Defence should agree the composition of the additional 1 per cent on allowances with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for employment immediately.    He would himself make an oral state-ment in Parliament on Tuesday 25 April, and would previouslyinform the Chairman of the AFPRB of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions.
The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Defence to be guided accordingly.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that although there had been no Press leaks about the report of the DDRBthere was nonetheless a great deal of concern inside and outside themedical profession.    It was important to treat this group in the same way as the armed forces.    The terms of reference of the two reviewbodies were identical, and there was the same degree of Governmentcommitment to implement their recommendations - namely to do sounless there were clear and compelling reasons to the contrary.EY(P) had agreed not to challenge the factual basis of the DDRBproposals.    The DDRB had proposed increases of only 10 per centoverall this year.    It would however be difficult to hold the medical profession to this level if the armed forces were given both 14 per cent and a forward commitment.    He therefore urged that a similar forwardcommitment should be given to the doctors and dentists, by extending the concept of a &quot;law and order group&quot; as proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer to a &quot;life or death&quot; group which would also bring inthe doctors and dentists.    The repercussions elsewhere in the health service, for example on nurses, would be minimal because these groups had already settled within the pay guidelines, and were not covered by independent review bodies.In discussion it was pointed out that there were other groups includingthe university teachers who might claim similar treatment.    Some ofthese were in fact paid at clinical rates determined by the DDRB.The medical profession had behaved badly in the past over pay, asevidenced by the irresponsible attitude of the junior doctors. EY(P)had agreed that the 10 per cent should be implemented, but had not yet reached a view on the nature of the forward commitment.    It was important that both should be announced at the same time.    The best course might therefore be to invite EY(P) to reconsider the question of doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay, along with that of the other groups likeuniversity teachers which had to be settled in the near future, and forthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring the question back to Cabinetshortly.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for the questionof doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay, together with that of the unversity teachers, to be reconsidered by EY(P) and brought back to Cabinet inthe next two weeks.
The Cabinet -2. Took note, with ipproval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.In discussion it was argued that the Cabinet could not reach a finalview on the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals without knowingmore of the pay regime which might operate after August. Anyspecial treatment for anomaly groups implied a reduction in the amount available for others.    The problem was not confined to the public sector;  there were serious difficulties in the private sector tooconcerned with the restoration of previous relativities.    There were also more fundamental objections to any kind of anomalies machinery.The questions at issue were political matters which should not be handed over to an independent and non-elected body.    Such a bodycould cause serious political difficulty by publishing its recommenda-tions at a time inconvenient to the Government.    Any kind ofpermanent machinery implied abandonment of free collective bargaining.    If it were to be created, it should be as part of a wider&quot;economic contract&quot; with the unions and shcild not be settled in isolation.    Moreover, any such machinery would be largelyunnecessary.    Its work would consist of reviewing the decisions onreview bodies already established for the purpose.    It would be seen by some as a form of favouritism, and by others as a threat to theirexpectations.Against this it was argued that the existing review bodies rapidlybecame the prisoners of their own clients.    A single body with over-sight of the whole field would be more objective.    The idea had comeoriginally from members of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), andunion opposition should aot necessarily be assumed.    In the longer term, it was arguable whether free collective bargaining could be sustained in a complex industrial society.    Permanent machinery ofsome kind might be needed eventually, and an anomalies board mightbe a useful first step.    But it was premature to open any discussions with the unions generally on this subject.    It was particularly impor-tant there should be no public indication that the Government wasthinking on these lines.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed it was premature to hold formal talks with the tuc, or with individual members of it, on the ideas in the Chancellorof the Exchequers paper. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Employment should however pursue tne general question of anomalies in informal discussions with individual tradeunion leaders.    They should not appear to be putting forward proposals
cf their own, but should seek to elicit views on what would be practicable and acceptable.    They should report the results of these discussions, along vdzh those of the more formal consultations withthe National Economic Development Council 6, at a later stage.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office25 April 1978
