I. The Cabinet discussed a number of political issues relating both to the Ilford North by-election and more widely.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, among othermatters pointed to the importance of achieving an adequate flow of press coverage of Government policy at *he weekends.    At presentmanv useful, speeches were made on Fridays but little appeared onSaturdays and Sundays when the Opposition were particularly active.Ministers should bear in mind that when not actually speaking on thesedays they could often obtain publicity by issuing to the Press the text of statements sent eg to their constituents.    In the present parliamentary situation Ministers should also be willing to make speeches on major political is sue o going beyond their Departmental briefs, chough theyshould of course clear such speeches with the responsible Minister.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
2. The Cabinet lesumed its discussion of CP(78) 12, a paperby the Chancellor of the Exchequer giving the general economicbackground to the approach to the Budget.    It also had before itpapers by the Secretary of State for Energy (CP(77) 117) by theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Minister for social security (CP(78) 10) and by the Chancellor of the Duchy of -Lancaster(CP(78) 19) together with a minute from the Secretary of State for social Services to the Chancellor of the Exchequer of 15 February.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, since theprevious discussion, a number of new figures had become available.Retail sales were up, the savings ratio was possibly movingdownwards, and unemployment was moving slowly downwards whilevacancies were rising.    There had been a bulge in the money supplyfigures, but this had only had a small effect on markets;  the idea ofa flexible approach to monetary targets had gained acceptance. the january trade figures were however very bad, and although there might possibly be some freak elements which distorted the trend,there was no sign that the propensity of the economy to import wasfalling.    The growth of exports was certainly levelling off, and this could not wholly be explained by the appreciation of the pound. world trade was growing more slowly than had been expected. although there was a developing consensus, for example in the &quot;Group of Five&quot;,in favour of global action to correct this, Japan and Germany were still standing out.    The inflation figures were much better than hadbeen hoped, and might fall from the present 9. 9 per cent annual rate to 7 per cent by the early summer and for most of the rest of the year.The trend thereafter depended on the next wage round.    This meant that those groups settling within the existing pay guidelines were nolonger accepting a cut in real living standards, unlike the previous year.    Taken together with tax cuts, most people should have a realincrease of 5 per cent in disposable income.    Against this background the Cabinet had to consider the prospects for the Budget. Thebalance of payments and the future course of inflation were the main problems, rather than the public sector borrowing requirementor domestic credit expansion.    Wage costs were still rising faster,in relation to improved productivity, than in competitor countries,while our performance on quality and reliability was poor. TheBudget must therefore concentrate on ways of improving industrialperformance.    At the same time, there was a danger that too big a stimulus would simply lead to inflation and further imports. Therewas a good case for concentrating most of the stimulus on tax cutsin order to encourage wage moderation.    Moreover something wouldhave to be done to restore incentives and to meet the Oppositionattack on this 3core.    Real earnings had fallen in recent years,while benefits had increased.    It would be a mistake to increasepublic expenditure by more than the present Contingency Reserve.The planned expenditure totals, allowing for reduced shortfall, already2^UCIES
provided for growth of 4-5 per -ent in public expenditure for nextyear.    His present inclination was therefore to concentrate the april Budget on a real reduction in personal taxation, ar.d to directany additional public expenditure which could be afforded atmeasures which would increase employment or help to reduceprices.    If he ccncluded that tne appropriate size of stimulus was too small to accommodate a significant reduction in personal taxes,there remained the option of offsetting part of the cost by an increasein indirect tax.    In a difficult political situation the best tactics wereto maintain the Government&apos;3 reputation for responsible economicmanagement.In discussion, there was general agreement with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that the main emphasis ox the Budget should be onresponsible economic management and, consistently with this, oncreating new jobs and improving competitivity.    It was argued thatan unemployment level of ljr million was unsustainable in the longterm, and threatened the whole social fabric of the country. Therewas no question of further deflationary measures at this stage.Tho issue was how fast the economy could be expanded.    But the3udget must also recognise the constraints of the balance ofpayments and of prices, and should aim at a real improvement in living standards which would help to moderate wage demands andpossibly pave the way to a new understanding on future incomes policy.In discussion of the political background, it was argued that unemployment was now reaching a level where the votes of theunemployed, and of their families, would become an important factor in the next Election.    The present situation was a disgraceto the Labour Party.    It was necessary to show that they could do better than the Conservative Opposition.    Quite apart from thegeneral level of reflation, a major element in the Budget packageshould be direct assistance to the creation of new jobs. TheGovernment would be judged by the criteria it had set in the pastincluding the emphasis it had always placed upon employment and upon expansion.    Price stability was also a main concern amongelectors, and the fear of renewed hyper-inflation 7ay just below the surface.    It would be particularly important to avoid any accelerationin the rate of price increases during the period before an Election.The Government had so far created an impression of sound steadyeconomic policies.    It could be damaged by the sudden adoption ofirresponsible expansionary policies.    On the other hand, electoratesoften gave no votes of thanks to Government for past performance.They needed an element of hope for the future in this Budget.Expectations of expansion were already being aroused, and shouldnot be disappointed.    If a relatively cautious Budget was necessary,expectations should be damped down well in advance.    It would be
useful to maintain an element oC surprise while avoiding unpopularBudget proposals.    The good effects of the 1977 Budget had been largely destroyed by the proposal to increase petrol duties.In further discussion, it was argued that the main constraint uponthe Chancellor&apos;s freedom of action in the Budget lay in the possibilityof a deteriorating balance of payments.    There was a strong case for not being frightened of deficits.    Deflation never helped the balanceof payments in the long run, because it destroyed competitivity.It was worth taking a risk by expanding the economy, and compensatingfor any deterioration in the current account by depreciation of theexchange rate.    Or if this failed, protectionist measures might bethe answer.    The failure of the world&apos;s free trade and financialsystem to deal with the large Organisation of Petroleum exporting countries (OPEC) surpluses suggested the need for compartmentation,to contain the damage which these could do.    One possible way of controlling imports would be to relate our own import ratio to thatof those countries which refused to reflate their own economies.The present level of the pound posed two problems.    It was already at a level which damaged our international competitiveness andshould not be allowed to go higher.    This could be achieved to someextend by interest rate policy and by encouragement of overseas investment.    But it was more likely that any deterioration in thecurrent account would lead to a fall in sterling.    This increasedindustrial costs and had damaging effects on domestic prices. Therewas no evidence that depreciation, whether deliberate or enforced,actively helped to promote exports.    Its effects wore off very quickly.In any case, the exchange rate was not wholly within theGovernments control, and the most it could do would be to moderatethe speed of its movement, whether up or down.    The real concern about the balance of payments was the very high marginal propensityof the British economy to import.    A high proportion of any additionto demand, particularly in the form of direct increase in personalexpenditure, went straight into increased imports of consumer goods.The failure of our exports to expand was also worrying.    Despite a wide range of Department of Trade services to exporters, we werelosing ground steadily.    This was partly due to our loss of price and product competitiveness at a time when demand in world marketswas already very depressed and competition therefore severe. Thiscontinuing world slump was an inevitable consequence of the verylarge surpluses of the oil producing countries.    These surplusesrepresented claims on the productive capacity of other countrieswhich the OPEC countries were at present unable to realise. Tothe extent that they did not spend their surpluses, the consequencemust be deficits in the trade of other manufacturing countries and areduction in the level of world demand.     The slump was therefore a consequence of inadequate financial response to the OPEC surpluses.&quot;e for our part had tried to run4
our economy at a higher level cf demand despite the balance ofpayments consequences, but had run out of cash in 1976.    This wa3 a proper responie at the time, but was not matched by most of the other industrial countries.    Ours was a small and vulnerable economy and could not pursue such expansionary policies in isolation.    The UnitedStates, on the other hand, could afford to do so, and had hitherto run alarge deficit which had helped to offset the OPEC surpluses. Itwould be right for the othei surplus countries, notably Germany and japan, to join in a concerted move towards world reflation. Therewere already several moves afoot in various international groupings to achieve this.    But it would be unsafe to count on the success of such measures at this stage.    hi the present vulnerable state of our owneconomy a unilateral dash for expansion would be dangerous.    But we need not aim at a large surplus, at least in tne short term, and weshould certainly not try to pay off all our accumulated debt over thenext few years, and thus add to the deflationary pressures in the world economy.    Return to surplus should therefore be phased over a longertime scale.    We could afford to run a deficit, provided we could persuade other creditor countries to finance it without politicallydamaging further recourse to the International Monetary Fund. by comparison with these balance of payments constraints, it was argued that monetary policy did not severely limit the room for expansion inthe 1978 Budget.    The other main constraint was the effect on prices and on wage inflation.    But it was argued that wage levels, with or without a formal incomes policy, were now largely autonomous, andwere not greatly influenced by the size of any reflationary ordeflationary measures undertaken in the Budget.It was therefore argued that there was a case for a sizable stimulus to demand in April.    The Election would probably turn upon the size ofthis stimulus.    It was in any case the only chance to restore the levelof demand which would be needed to create the necessary number of jobs to reduce unemployment to acceptable levels.    There was a case for an audacious Keynesian stimulus, which could take the form of areconstruction Budget after the restraints of the last years. TheCabinet should not be hypnotised by the short-term problems this might create.    On the other hand, the need for caution was emphasised.The Government needed to maintain an image of responsible economicmanagement in the eyes of the electorate.    But it also needed to payregard to market reactions.    If confidence were damaged by the size of the Budget stimulus, the effects on sterling and on interest ratescould be very damaging.    There was already a big stimulus to demand&quot;Uilt in, from the improvement in real disposable personal income which followed from the Stage 3 wage increase and the reduction in price inflation.    This was already bound to lead to an increase in imports.    It would be wrong to take too many risks with the balance ofPayments by adding a further large stimulus.    There was also a case for leaving something in hand for further measures later in the year.
This was sensible in terms of economic management.    There was nowinternational acceptance of the case for making a series of adjustmentsduring the year.    It was aigued that a relatively severe Budget in 1970had not been electorally damaging.    On the other hand, it had been accompanied by a promise of further relaxation later in the year forwhich the Labour Government had not been able to take the creditbecause  it was     introduced by their successors.    Any further relaxation should therefore come in June cr July rather than in theautumn when it might be too late.    There was also a case for leavingsomething in hand in order to make further concessions to the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) in an attempt to win their support for a new approach to wages later in che year.    But it would not be possible tomake any further major changes in income tax after the Budget.Industrial relations in the Inland Revenue were now so poor that staffmight refuse to implement any further changes.As to the content of any reflaticnary package, it was argued tnat thebulk of it should take the form of tax reductions.    This would helptake the pressure off wages and was the only way of securing TUCsupport for a further policy of wage restraint.    Some moderation in wages, and thus on industrial costs, was the clue to increasedcompetitivity in international markets.    It was also argued that taxreductions had the most immediate and greatest reflationary effect.They might take several forms.    In favour of a reduced rate band, itwas argued that the TUC had given this top priority.    It had been a mistake to eliminate the reduced rate band some years ago. Toreintroduce it now would be a new and attractive feature in the Budgetby comparison with the more familiar improvements in thresholds andin the standard rate.    A reduced rate band would help the working wifewhose vote was important.    But a band of any significant size would be expensive.    It should not be introduced if it involved an increase in therates of indirect tax.    That would be electorally unpopular because ofthe effect on the Retail Price Index (RPI) and the transfer of spending power from wife to husband.    In favour of reduced tax thresholds, it*a8 argued that this was the best way of dealing with the &quot;povertytrap&quot; and widening the gap between those in work and those receivingbenefit.    It would take a large number of people out of tax, and would benefit some of the lowest paid who would otherwise get nothing out ofthe Budget.    It would also provide some compensation for the loos of child tax allowances which would accompany the introduction of child benefits in April.    A reduction in the standard rate would be welcome*f it improved incentives and thus increased productivity.    But thatresult could also be achieved by a more flexible incomes policy in thenext phase.    There was an argument for giving some tax benefits to new industrial venture capital;  this would help to create new jobs.
On the other hand, it was argued that the Government was already fooheavily committed in public to a Budget which concentrated entirely ontax reliefs.    Its supporters would not accept a Budget oi this kind. Afair mix of tax reliefs and additional public expenditure was neededBut there would not be enough to satisfy all the pressure gx-oups withinand without the Labour Party.    There were arguments forconcentrating any additional spending on industrial support, thusarresting the de-industrialisation of the British economy and helping tostem the flood of imports.    Against this there were strong political objections to further industrial support, which many people saw aslargely wasted.    Considerable extra money would inevitably be neededduring the year for steel industry and for British Leviand in any case.It was instructive to compare the level of support enjoyed by these industries with that given to the highly successful agriculture industry,which had less electoral support.    There was also a political case forspending more on the social services, particularly on the health service, though this should be matched by savings or. excessively-lavish administration.    New hospitals, together with other new building, would help to revive the badly-hit construction industry. Itwould be the Governments counterpart to the increased investmentcalled for from the private sector.    Construction expenditure had a relatively low import content and was a useful way of giving areflationary stimulus.    Other new construction measures might includeassistance to factory building, particularly for small firms, and a concerted attack on the physical dereliction of big cities.    There wasno doubt that this, like unemployment, played a part in racial troublesand the breakdown of law and order which the Opposition would seek tornake a major issue in the next Election.    But there was a danger ofdissipating any additional public expenditure too widely.    It could be argued that it should concentrate on a few key areas, such as cost-effective employment measures to increase the number of jobs, and toretrain workers for fresh opportunities.    Action which would help toreduce the RPI, for example by postponing the increase in school mealcharges or increases in nationalised industry prices, might also bejustified.    All proposals for further expenditure should be judged by theProportion of British goods which they involved and the number of newjobs which they might create.    It was further argued that there was more room for increases in public expenditure than the present public expenditure programmes implied.    Shortfall had increased as a resultof the introduction of cash limits, and provided a large reservoir fromwhich additional expenditure could be financed.    On the other hand itwas argued that this shortfall was already allowed for in the Budgetforecasts, if not in the public expenditure White paper, and that therewas little further room for manoeuvre on this account.    It was1mportant, if only for confidence reasons, that any additional expenditure should be kept within the recently-published contingency reserve total.    And at this early stage in the year, it was necessaryto leave room for inevitable new items which would develop later.
There were already more claims for additional expenditurethan the Contingency Reserve could provide, and these needed to bebrought together so that the Cabinet oould take an informed view oftheir relative merits.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had completed a valuable exchange of views which theChancellor of the Exchequer wou?d take into account in further work onhis Budget.    Some differing views had been expressed but there waswide agreement that the country would regard this Budget as the test ofthe Governments competence in managing the economy.    It would therefore be wrong to appear to abandon the criteria which had donemuch to improve the position.    It was also relevant to remember thatthere mjght be another Budget before the Election.    On the other handsound economic management had to be accompanied by forward-lookingpolicies which provided a vision for the future.    The country would nodoubt be looking for a Budget which would increase joos, reduce taxes and improve the public services, while avoiding any damaging effect on confidence:  ana the Chancellor of the Exchequer *ould have to reach aview on the right mix of policies, including a combination of tax relief and additional public expenditure, to achieve this.    The public expenditure proposals which had been mentioned should be further considered by the appropriate Ministerial Committees, and the chief secretary, Treasury, should arrange for them to be brought torward tothe Cabinet at the same time as a report on the state of the contingency reserve, so that the Cabinet could consider the relative priorities ofthe different bids.    Further work would continue on matters likeindustrial democracy which would also play an important part in securing an increase in investment.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
3. The Cabinet had before them a joint memorandum (CP(78) 5) bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for employment on future pay policy together with a minute from theMinister for Social Security dated 31 January.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that thememorandum he had prepared together with the Chancellor of theExchequer concluded that there were three basic options available tothe Government cn future pay policy:  to return to free collective bargaining;  to move towards an indicative policy in which there was some central guidance as to the generally desirable level of pay settlements and as to such matters as the intervals between settlementsand acceptable grounds for higher increases, but no Government actionto enforce the policy;  or to adopt a policy of central guidance coupled with means to enforce the policy.    In considering these options theCabinet should bear in mind the way in which pay policy had evolvedover the last three years.    In the first two years of the current policy the Governments action had had the overwhelming backing of theTrades Union Congress (TUC).    In the current year, while the TUC hadbeen as helpful as it could, support from the unions had been looser and less well-defined.    The policies too had evolved.    They had startedtight - with the universal  6 a week - and had become steadily more flexible with special arrangements to cover eg productivity deals, theoperation of fair wages legislation, improvement of pension rights andso on.    The role of Parliament was also important and Parliamentaryattitudes had hardened.    Thus, whereas in 19 75-76 and 1976-77 therehad been little or no Parliamentary resistance to Government action,eg through contract terms, to reinforce pay policy, the question o.tsanctions was now a prime political issue and it was far from certainthat a new policy embodying sanctions could be carried through parliament.    In any development of pay policy account also needed tohe taken of the special problems of pay in the public sector. TheGovernment had a special responsibility here and would need to have apolicy stance no matter what broad attitude to pay policy it embraced.His own conclusion was that, if only because of the problems of thepublic sector, a return to untrammelled free collective bargaining wasnot possible.    Equally he believed that the Parliamentary difficultiesruled out a policy requiring sanctions.    He therefore, on balance,concluded in favour of an indicative policy without sanctions, thoughfor this to succeed it was in his view absolutely necessary to have thebacking of the TUC.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that one reason why the then Labour Government had lost the Election in 1970 was because it did not have the consent and co-operation of the trades union movementeither for its pay policies or for its general policies towards trades union.    The situation had been retrieved in 1974 but only after aconsiderable period of discussion with the trades unions in which a9
working concordat had evolved.    It was significant that this concordatdid not involve pay policy alone but extended more widely into economicand social matters.    While it would be difficult tc achieve, any futureagreement with the trades unions on pay would similarly have to extendinto the management of the economy as a whole.    It would in his view be particularly important for the Government not to seek to evolve apay policy which it then tried to sell to the TUC.    A workable paypolicy, il one was to be found, could only emerge from discussions withthe TUC in which problems would be examined, and solutions sought,jointly.    He agreed with the Secretary of State fcr Employment that apay policy involving sanctions could not be carried through parliament.    Equally, however, a monetarist approach to pay policy would lead to a head-on clash with the trades unions.    The right wayforward would be to open private discussions with leading personalitiesin the trades union movement and try and lay the basis for a new social contract.In discussion it was argued that the TUC had not fully taken on board theextent to which the public sector had grown in importance in recentyears.    Their thinking was still based on the view that the marketeconomy dominated in matters of wage determination, whereas thereality was that the public sector, and through that sector theGovernment, were heavily involved, willy-nilly, in pay matters andthe Government could not stand aloof.    Indeed, in a sense, the growth of the public sector made the problem more difficult because bothunions and management within it felt that the public purse was availableto support any bargains they might reach.    It was also important tounderstand the link between the next round of pay policy and theGovernment&apos;s electoral prospects.    It would be fatal for these if thepublic came to believe that the Government intended to allow, throughendorsement of free collective bargaining, a return to the rates of inflation of recent years.    At the same time it was clear that any policy adopted must be flexible enough to allow for correction of therigidities and anomalies which past pay policy had imposed on the pub-lic sector.    No rigid system of pay limits could hope to endure though there might nevertheless be scope for useful reforms in bargainingstructures eg by seeking to establish common negotiating timetableswhich could reduce the problem of leapfrogging pay claims or perhapsby aiming at settlements designed to endure for longer periods than oneyear.In further discussion considerable support was expressed for the proposition that the immediate need was to enter into privatediscussions with leading figures in the TUC in order to evaluate thePractical possibilities for agreement and to establish the parameters ofouch an agreement.    It would be particularly important that such discussions should be kept confidential and that they should be conducted10
in an atmosphere free from open speculation by Ministers about thenext phase of pay policy.    Such talks would have to take account of matters like industrial democracy and also the inherent unfairness of present policy towards some parts of the public sector.    For examplethere was growing feeling among public employees that the rewardswent to those with the greatest industrial muscle and that theGovernment traded, unfairly, on the loyalty of groups such as themembers of the Armed Forces.Finally it was argued that pay policy had to be seen in the widereconomic perspective.    Both employment prospects and living standards depended critically on holding export prices at levels whichwere competitive with those of the other industrialised countries with whom we competed in export markets.    If this were to be achievedwage cost increases in the United Kingdom had to be reduced to thelevel of those in such countries.    Increased productivity had a part toplay in this but the level of wage settlements was of overriding importance.    In this connection it was relevant that while pay policy inrecent years had had to operate against a background of falling living standards there was now every expectation that pay policy in the yearahead could be operated against a background of the biggest increase in living standards since the war.    Properly explained this ought to be a major factor in determining the attitude of the public to pay policy andit would of course have a direct bearing on the expectations andattitudes of those seeking pay increases.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it was clear that the Government could not go into an Election without a policy for pay.     There was widespread agreement that such a policy wouldhave to be flexible because otherwise it would founder on anomaliesbetween one group and another.    At the same time it was extremely important for the economy, and particularly for prospects for employment, that there should be a lowering of expectations about theacceptable level of wage increases.    The slowing down of the rate of increase in the Retail Price Index would have an important impact hereas would greater public understanding of the link between wage increases and price increases.    The Cabinet were agreed that thenext step would be for representatives of the Government to haveconfidential talks with selected members of the TUC to discuss theProblems and prospects.    He would consider how this could best bedone.    The objective would be to assess the scope for an understanding with the TUC on pay.    The Government would then have to decide its policy in the light of these soundings.    In the meantime it would be important that the Government should keep a low profile in public discussion of future pay policy.11
