^JRS The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.hifUe8ent THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was proposedftoijjg to take the Second Pleading of the Employment Subsidies Bill and of thefcOiSe Home purchase.se Assistance and Housing Corporation Guarantee BiU onistanCe Monday 20 February.In discussion it was pointed out that both were valuable ard politicallyattractive measures, and ideally they should be taken on separate daysso that full justice could be done to them in debate.    It would however be difficult to provide an extra day in an already overcrowded time-table and although there might be disagreement on some of thefinancial provisions of the Home Purchase Assistance Bill, the Oppo-sition had said that they would oppose neither Bill.    There would however be advantage in arranging for the Bill on Home PurchaseAssistance to be taken first, with the debate to be concluded ifpossible by seven o&apos;clock, and for the debate on both Bills to be finished by ten o&apos;clock.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the Home Purchase Assistance and housing Corporation Guarantee Bill should be taken before theEmployment Subsidies Bill and that agreement to concluding the debates by seven o&apos;clock and ten o&apos;clock respectively should be soughtthrough the usual channels.The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.ftTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he believed thatthe Scotland Bill would obtain its Third Reading which was due to betaken on Wednesday 22 February.    The fact that some of the: Covernmenfs supporters had contributed to the recent Governmentdefeat on the timing of the referendums made it, in his view, moreitj^ lQHs, likely that they would lend their support on Third Reading. their decision to support the amendment which required an interval of atleast three months between the date of a General Election and the dateof the referendums was particularly offensive because the Governmenthad already given an undertaking that the General Election and thereferendums would not be held at the same time.    However, this
amendment was rot so serious in its consequences for devolution asthe 40 per cent voting requirement which the Government had failed toremove at F.eport Stage tho previous night.    Once the Bill had obtained its Third Reading, it would be necessary to examinecarefully the $implications of the changes which had been made to it andtheir repercussions on the Wales Bill.In discussion it was argued that the evidence of hostility to the Bill inthe previous night&apos;s proceedings in Parliament made it at least open to question whether it would obtain a Third Reading.    If it failed to do so,as the major item in the legislative programme, the Government&apos;scredibility and ability to survive would be gravely impaired.    To carryon in theje circumstances would run the risk of adding to this defeat afurther series of reverses on the Finance Bill which would rapidlydiminish public confidence in the Governments authority and create the worst circumstances for a General Election.    Those of theGovernments supporters who were minded to vote against third reading should theretore be brought to recognise the very seriousimplications which a defeat would have for the Government and theParty as a whole.On the other hand, it was argued that the Scotland and Wales Bills werenot identified with the essential objectives of a Labour Government andwculd certainly not be regarded in England as issues justifying theGovernments resignation.    An Election at the present time would notbe welcomed by the great majority of Labour supporters, and it wouldhave damaging consequences if it were held at the present time whenprominence had been given to racial issues.    On matters which werecentral to the Governments objectives their supporters in Parliamentbad shown a considerable capacity for loyalty, even against their ownstrong feelings on particular issues;  and if the Government chose tomake a real issue of any provisions in the Finance Bill, where thescope for mischief was in any case limited by the need for a Ways and means Resolution, it was likely that backbenchers would see it as such.Nevertheless, the Government should recognise the limitations imposed by the lack of a majority and by the extent to which theattitudes of backbenchers h^d changed over the years: whileremaining committed to the Governments general aims, they nolonger felt obliged to vote automatically in favour of every measure which the Government promoted.    It was also suggested that if,baving done their utmost to secure a passage for the Scotland Bill, theGovernment were frustrated by the will of Parliament, they should use this as the occasion for opening up the essential question of the unity ofthe United Kingdom and take their stand on that.2
In further discussion it was argued that to make the Third Reading ofthe Scotland Bill an issue of confidence would in any case be counter-productive, since the Scottish National Party and those Conservativeswho supported devolution would then be tempted to vote against. Onthe o*her hand, the Government could scarcely make a deleat on third reading the occasion for an Election without havirg first made clearthat it was an issue of confidence.    What was important, therefore,was that the maximum pressure should be brought to bear on theGovernment^ supporters generally to vote for Third Reading.    It wassuggested that a positive argument which should have some appeal inthis context was that to deny the Bill a passage would deprive thepeople of Scotland of a democratic choice.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the Governments first aim should be tosecure the passage of the Bill and that this might be put in jeopardy by making the vote on Third Reading an issue of confidence.    The veryserious implications of a defeat for the Government and the LabourParty as a whole should however be brought home to the Governmentsbackbench supporters by individual members of the Cabinet under the guidance of the Chief Whip.    Such a defeat, which would be seen tohave resulted from the actions of the Governments own supporters,would gravely impair the basis of a successful Election campaign forall Labour Members of Parliament, whether or not they supporteddevolution;  it would place the Government in a virtually untenableposition in Scotland;  and, without in itself being an issue ofconfidence, it would be bound to bring into question the need for anearly General Election.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of theirdiscus sion.3
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe outcome of the talks which the Foreign Ministers of the fiveWestern members of the Security Council had separately had with theSouth African Foreign Minister and with representatives cf the SouthWest People&apos;s Organisation in New York on 11-12 February had notbeen wholly unsatisfactory.    There were some major problemsoutstanding, on which it was provrng difficult to find a basis for agreement.    But he still hoped that it might be possible to bringNamibia to independence in an acceptable way.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that duringhir visit to New York he had also talked with the other four foreign ministers about the sftuation in the Horn of Africa.    The general view was that it might be possible to save the Somalis from totalhumiliation, but this would depend on their willingness to withdraw to within the existing boundaries of Somalia.    A solution on these linesmight then be recognised in some way by the United Nations. Thesituation was a very complicated one which would require delicatehandling.    It should not be seen just as an East/West issue in whichthe problem was to resist the extension of Soviet influence. the ethiopians were supported by Kenya and received arms supplies fromthe Israelis.    It was possible that the Iranians and Saudi Arabianswould be prepared to bring their influence to bear on the Somalis andhe still hoped that the matter might be brought before the security council.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that wefaced a dilemma following the announcement in Salisbury that agreement had been reached on an internal settlement. differences between us and some sections of the United States Administration were however more apparent in public than in private, and our co-operationwith the United States in the handling of the Rhodesia problem was likely to continue.       He had succeeded in avoiding for several weekspressures to condemn the internal talks in the Security Council.There was however no sign yet that an internal settlement would leadto a ceasefire and it was too early to make any considered judgmentabout the implications of the settlement for the people of Rhodesia asa whole.    Crucial issues relating to such matters as transitional arrangements and the security forces still remained unresolved. But4
our criteria must be the Six Principles which formed the basis for our policy.    if these were genuinely fulfilled, then we ehould perhaps beprepared to support the settlement.    There were however somedangers that the internal settlement would promote an increase inviolence and we could be faced with an unpleasant situation. Never-theless, Mr Smith had moved a long way in comparison witn hisposition a year ago.    He was now prepared to bring nationalist leadersinto the Government and had accepted the principle of elections on thebasis of adult suffrage.    The piovision for 28 White members all ofwhom would be Rhodesian Front out of a total of 100 was not anarrangement which could be justified.    Bishop Muzorewa had gothimself into an absurd position over this but we should make efforts toget it modified.    We should have to continue to perform a difficultbalancing act;  if we became too involved in discussions in Salisbury weshould alienate the Patriotic Front, whereas if we appeared to besiding with the Patriotic Front we should lose influence in Salisbury.The Front Line Presidents increasingly tended to recognise theimportance of the United States/United Kingdom proposals and of theneed to bring nationalists together.    But hostility to Mr Smith was sowidespread that it was not easy to persuade people to take a rationalview.    If there were to be a debate in the United Nations in which theinternal settlement was discussed, the Front Line countries could notbe relied upon to maintain their support for oui position and there might even be difficulties in keeping the West together.    We might face a difficult decision over the use of our veto if we were faced with aresolution condemning the internal settlement.In discussion it was pointed out that the internal settlement was a much better deal for the Africans than anything which was considered at theTiger and Fearless talks.    The settlement involved a clear decision ona Black majority government and on a Bill of Rights.    Mr Smith hadresponded to consistent pressure, to which the United States/UnitedKingdom proposals had been a major contribution.    Our policy shouldbe not to deal with him but to keep up pressure for further changes which were needed.    On the other hand, we must remain open-mindedin our attitude towards the settlement.    Parliamentary opinion might think that it would be a good deal for the Africans.    We had alwaystaken the view that we could not ourselves choose who would be theleaders in an independent Rhodesia.    Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe had made great efforts, but they had overplayed their hand and failed torealise the extent of their success.    We should take our stand on free and fair elections on the basis of universal suffrage, and the other elements in the Six Principles.    If Mr Smith went ahead with thesettlement and all the Principles were put into effect, our respon-sibilities would have been fulfilled.    At this stage we could not statewhether it would be possible to hold free and fair elections.    The only way of knowing might be by judging them after they had taken place.Any other course would involve giving way to the men of violence who
claimed to have control in certain areas of the country.    If however the elections were seen to be free and fair, President Nyerere ofTanzania could be expected to accept them and President Kaunda ofZambia would probably also not stand out.    In these circumstances itwas not impossible that Mr Nkomo could be persuaded to take part inthe settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that we mustinsist on the fulfilment of the Six Principles and on the policy for negotiating a settlement set out in the statement he had made as foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on 22 March 1976.    We should avoid emphasising the &quot;internal&quot; aspects of the settlement because ofthe importance of continuing our efforts to bring the oth-3r nationalistleaders in.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would no doubt have to face awkward questions about sanctions and other unresolvedissues, but we should stand firm on our basic policy which was to bringRhodesia to independence undei free and fair elections based on adult-suffrage.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
3. THE SECRETARY OF S^ATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that inaccordance with the general line approved by the Ministerial Group onUnemployment among Young People and after contacts between officials and the European Commission he had notified the Commissionon &apos;5l January that we intended to continue the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy (TES), that no modifications to the conditions of the scheme could be made before July and then only if effective alternatives couldbe introduced.    Subsequently, members of the Parliamentary LabourParty had urged that we should refuse to make any of the changesasked for by the Commission.    The Trades Union Congress (TUC) had also been very reluctant to discuss alternatives and their resistance toany changes in TES had been strengthened by their success in securingsupport from the European TUC Executive Committee for a protest atthe attitude of che Commission towards employment measures. Hewould be meeting Commissioner Vouel the following day. Furtherexploratory talks between officials had revealed that, while we had been  examining the possibility of changes which would reduce the impact of TES in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors by approximately a quarter, the Commission were still looking for a50 per cent reduction.    He was personally not inclined to go beyond thecompromises already offered in his notification of 31 January.In discussion it was pointed out that other aids were also in dispute withthe Commission.     Commissioner Vouel would be discussing the intervention Fund for shipbuilding with the Department of IndustryMinisters.    The Commission were now challenging the application of regional development grants to sectors of surplus capacity this attitude could be dangerous in relation to jobs in Scotland and indifficult industrial sectors like steel.    We needed to avoid having ourposition eroded piecemeal by the Commission.    On the other hand itwas argued that, having regard to our legal obligations, it was important to enter into full consultation with the Commission and tonegotiate with some degree of flexibility.    Our readiness to discuss inthe past had enabled us to resist major changes.    We could not expect to take a totally negative line without this having some impact on ourposition on other important issues like fisheriee where we were aimingto reach a satisfactory settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said he hadalready asked officials to examine our general stance in theCommunity in regard to state aids.    This report should be consideredby the Ministerial Committee on European Questions and, ifnecessary, by the Cabinet in good time before the next meeting of theEuropean Council at which the question might be discussed. Theposition taken up by the European TUC was helpful.    In the meantimewe should continue to deal with each case on its merits and notprovoke a general debate in the Council.    The Secretary of State for employment should adept a tough negotiating position withfoorarybsidy
Commissioner Vouel but seek to avoid a confrontation.    The Secretaryof State for Employment would be reporting the results of had discussions with Mr Vouel to the Ministerial Group on unemployment among Young People.    The Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should consider whether a political approach to Mr Roy Jenkins wouldbe helpful.The Cabinet -Took note.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of State forEnergy, che Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP(78) 18) setting out the arguments for a North SeaDevelopment Fund, together with an outline of how such a fund mightbe operated.    They also had before them again (CP(78) 14) the draft white Paper on the Benefits of North Sea Oil, paragraphs 52 and 53 ofwhich set out the arguments for and against a fund.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the three ministers who had prepared the paper had also discussed it with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, who had not however been able to accept the argumerts it contained.    The draft White Paper set out the case for priorities in theallocation of North Sea revenues, to prevent them being frittered away,and the creation of a separate fund would underline the governments determination in this respect.    There was a lot of support in thecountry for a separate fund and the Government should use theopportunity to demonstrate its political commitment and not be deterred by practical problems which could be overcome.    A straight-forward non-statutory development fund, of say  5 billion over anumber of years, coupled with an annual report, was perfectlyfeasible.    It might cover some 2 per cent of public expenditure. the projects to be financed from it would still be judged against strictcriteria and still be allocated by Ministers, not by an independentagency.    Such a scheme would help to convince the public that a portionof the North Sea revenues had been clearly specified and set aside for investment in the future.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he shared the wish toavoid frittering away the North Sea revenues, but he was convinced thata separate fund wculd actually encourage this waste.    While a fund would have some initial political impact, this would be lost on closescrutiny, because it would be seen to be meaningless.    The key issue was additionally.    It was proposed to take a comparatively small partof total Government revenue and treat it separately from the 8
allocation of the remaining  60 billion or so.    What criteria could beused to determine that allocation?    Almost by definition, anyindustrial projects selected for support from the fund would be of lower priority than others in the existing programmes.In discussion it was argued that there were strong political andpsychological arguments in favour of a separate fond.    It would be particularly welcome to Scottish opinion.    Other political Parties hadvirtually committed themselves to the establishment of a specialScottish oil fund.    The Cabinet should not be mesmerised by thepractical difficulties.    The overriding need was to expand investment in industry and in social infrastructure.    The present allocationsystem for public expenditure was not immaculate.    There were plenty of worthy expenditure projects for which funas could not at present befound, particularly after the expenditure cuts of recent years. Aseparate fund would allow slightly less rigorous, but still entirelyrealistic, levels of financial or social return to be sought from suchprojects.    A fund would allow the public to see just what was being done with the North Sea resources.    Ideally, they would be devoted to large new readily-identifiable projects like new towns or industrialinvestments.    The arguments against a fund really struck at the rootof the whole concept of the White Paper, and if the fund proposal were rejected, it might be necessary to reconsider whether the White paper should be published at all.On the other hand, it was argued that the practical problems ofestablishing a fund could not be dismissed as administrative details.A separate fund required segregated decision making. the ministerial Committee established to run it would in effect becometrustees of the fund, with their own set of priorities.    They wouldhave, say,   1 billion extra to spend in 1980 on projects not provided in the present public expenditure survey.    That survey took full account of the available North Sea oil revenues which had already been allocated.    New projects could therefore only be financed at theexpense of existing expenditure programmes, which would involve afurther cuts exercise to release the resources, or require additionaltaxation or an increase in Government borrowing.    The Cabinet mustfeel that the present public expenditure programme reflected its ownpolitical order of priorities.    A separate fond would cut across these.The larger the fund, the more serious the distortion would become.But a small fund of say  1 billion would not use up all the oil revenues,and would thus provide no protection against &quot;frittering away&quot;. Itwould also be too small to have any real political impact. Howevercarefully defined the objects of the fund, there would be difficulty in deciding what should be financed from it, and what from normal public expenditure.    It would generate new pressures to spend. Forexample, the present English roads programme was, in the view ofthe responsible Minister, as large as it needed to be;  yet if a9
separate fund existed, he would come under great pressure to seek hisown share of it in addition to his ordinary expenditure allocation. Aseparate fund would lead to a great many pressure groups seeking theirown share.    In addition. Ministers would argue that industrial investment had already had its fair share of available resources, sothat desirable additional industrial expenditure, for example on an improved system of regional development grants, would have little chance of establishing a claim on the Contingency Reserve cr on anyfurther margin which might be available for public expenditure in later years.    The particular pressures for a special fund to benefitScotland had already been acknowledged when the Scottish DevelopmentAgency was set up (together with the Welsh Development Agency) and announced in the first Government White Paper on North Sea C:l in&apos;974.     There was no case for duplicating it.    All the objectives of aseparate fund could be achieved bv the publication of a special reportto Parliament each year.In further discussion it was argued that the White Paper on theBenefits of North Sea Oil should leave open the question of a fund.The Government should only decide this with the benefit of advice from within the Parliamentary Party, and from outside interests. against this it was argued that there had already been two years1 debate on thesubject, and that the problem could not be left to fester. Anindecisive passage in the White Paper would invite a very poor Press.It would be better to explain frankly in the White Paper why a fund wasnot practicable, to emphasise that Scotland was getting a fair share ofthe available revenues, and to promise an annual report. TheGovernments decisions could be explained to the Parliamentary Partyin these terms, but in an unprovocative manner.    Opinion within theParty was in any case divided on this question.    It might also bepossible to put the issues squarely to the Confederation of BritishIndustry (who had sought a separate interview with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer about the use of North Sea revenues) and to the national economic Development Council.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a laxgemajority in the Cabinet now opposed the creation of a separate fund.They also agreed that this decision should be stated in the forthcomingWhite Paper, which should however set out tne arguments for and against the fund and explain why a fund was not practicable.    It shouldalso set out more fully the Governments intention firmly to monitorand to report annually to Parliament on the uses which had been madeof North Sea oil revenues and resources.    He would arrange for theSecretary of the Cabinet to redraft the relevant paragraphs of thePaper for the Cabinets later consideration.    Before publication theChancellor of the Exchequer would explain the reasons why theGovernment had decided against a fund to a meeting of the10
Parliamentary Labour Party. When the White Paper was pubiishehe would introduce it by means of a statement to Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office16 February 197811
