.JJAME4 AIRSNTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following v/eek.&quot;AIRS 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had had detailed talks in Washington on 8 March with president Carter and Secretary of State Vance.    As the joint-&quot;^sia statement issued after these talks indicated, they had reached full agreement on the course to be pursued.    Despite reports of Anglo-^iou8 American differences based on a statement made in New York on,&quot;&quot;*feuCe. 8 March by the United States Representative to the United Nations,^8th Ambassador Young, we were continuing to work closely with the^U6i0ns Americans and were completely in line with them.    The strategyS;te 2    &apos; agreed was that in response to President Nyerere of Tanzania^proposal, we should try to bring all the negotiating parties togetherwith a view to bridging the differences between the position reached at the Malta talks with the Patriotic Front and the outcome of theinternal negotiations in Salisbury.    The hope was to hold a meeting in New York possibly as early as the following week, in which ha. andMr Vance would take part.    The basis for the invitation would bethe common aim of free elections with universal adult suffrage whichwould enable Zimbabwe to achieve independence in 1978.    So as toreduce the risk of rejection the invitation would not be couchedspecifically in terms of the United States/United Kingdom proposals.The offer would be made by the United Kingdom Representative tothe United Nations, who was the current chairman of the security council, within the next few days, after President Nyerere and theother main parties concerned in Southern Africa had been informed.We could not be sure that the offer would be accepted by all the negotiating parties, but, by making it, we might have a chance of avoiding a vote on the African resolution at the end of the prese.itSecurity Council debate.    The resolution was mandatory and calledamong other things for condemnation of the action of the illegal regime in negotiating a settlement and for a declaration that anyinternal settlement under the auspices of the illegal regime shouldnot be recognised by the United Nations or any member state. Itwas loosely drafted and hostile in tone, but its present wording wouldprobably not unduly restrict our freedom to recognise a settlement which was reached in accordance with our Fifth Principle.    If wewere to veto such a resolution we should be alone because neitherthe Americans nor the French would join us.    It would therefore bebetter to abstain in company with the other four Western members ofthe Security Council, and make a strong statement in support of our action, which would make it clear that we did not regard the resolutionas precluding recognition of an independent government of Zimbabwewhich had emerged as a result of the free democratic choice of thepeople of Zimbabwe as a whole.    We would attempt to get two more members of the Security Council to join us in abstaining but it was doubtful whether we would succeed.    Since Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabeintended to address the Security Council we should insist also on
Bishop Muzorewa being heard.    We would sponsor his application and had auKed the Americans and French also to support it.Reports that he had left the Security Council debate entirely to the americans misrepresented the position.    The debate was likely togo on until 13 or 14 March:  and he would himself still have anopportunity to speak if necessary towards the end of the debate.But if he did so, Ambassador Young would also have to contribute to the debate and this might not be helpful to the outcome of avoiding a vote, which it was hoped to achieve.    As regards the settlementreached in Salisbury, we might have to have some contact with a transitional government but there was no question of our recognising the new regime or of lifting sanctions until free elections had takenplace and an independent government had been formed.    We should no doubt be faced with pressure for recognition both from Salisburyand in Parliament when the proposed referendum had taken place,but we should have to resist this.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe objective was to avoid a vote in the Security Council.    We couldhowever live with the resolution in its present form and there wasno need to consider vetoing it.    We should not recognise the internalsettlement but should pursue the course outlined by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary with a view to arranging a meeting between all the parties to the negotiations.    Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe had refused to give their support to the United States/United Kingdomproposals and might not ccme;  our aim must be to try to get them,and particularly Mr Nkomo, involved, but we must not allow themto have a veto on our action.    This was a defensible line and weshould stick to it.    He hoped that President Kaunda of Zambia mightbe persuaded to use his influence with Mr Nkomo, and he had arranged for a message to be sent to President Kaunda through outnew High Commissioner in Lusaka, inviting him to come to london to talk over the situation.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were some indications thatif the Socialists were to win the forthcoming election M Mitterandwould wish to establish close relations with the United Kingdom andprobably to have less close relations with the Federal Republic ofGermany.    M Mitterand did not get on well personally withChancellor Schmidt and evidently hoped to be able to use us as achannel for contacts with the Germans.    We should welcome closer relations with the French, but could not accept the role of inter-intermediary between M. Mitterand and Herr Schmidt.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer had also been considering the international
monetary problems which could arise following a Socialist victory in France,    If a French Socialist Government were to go ahead with some parts of their declared programme, this could resultin a slide in the value of the Franc and possibly a French move towards protactionism.\N&quot; With *u[ **lRe THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would shortly visit the Federal^^n^11^0        German Chancellor for an informal exchange of views about thedevelopment of world trade.    Such talks might be useful in the context of his continuing contacts with the United States President,given the present tensions between the United States and theFederal Republic.The cabinet.    Took note.&apos;^Hg 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that hewas concerned about pressure from member states with excessrefining capacity for limitations on support for investment in new capacity in the Community which might be contrary to our interests.0Ucy He would shortly consult his colleagues in the ministerial committee on European Questions.The cabinet took note.3
.4^%ijjq &apos; 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of&apos;-lSSTn State for the Environment on the report of the inquiry for planning^ plTf4 permission for oxide fuel reprocessing plant at WindscaleScftSL- (cp(78) 32)-THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that.&apos;-viou8 over a year ago he had come to the conclusion that it was not right^re,^ for Cumbria County Council to decide on a planning issue of thish    1 -&quot;  &quot;) 8th&apos; importance and he himself had not felt competent to reach a; C&apos;conclusions judgment without an inquiry into the far-reaching issues involved.;.^tfi i    &apos; Now that the inquiry had taken place, he believed that the5^)43^ Government stood to gain greatly both internationally and with thel&apos;C^8ion people of this country.    Unlike most other European countries, we^2    &apos; had not found it necessary to go for crash programmes of nucleardevelopment.    As for the Inspector&quot;s report, it was a model ofclarity and cogency and he had already indicated his broadapproval to the House of Commons.    The Inspector had focusedattention on 3 major questions:  whether the United Kingdom shouldprocess its own oxide waste;  if so, whether the processing plantshould be built at wind scale;  and whether it would be right for usto reprocess other countries spent fuel.    On whether we shouldreprocess at all, the factor that weighed most heavily with him was whether reprocessing would adversely affect the health of notonly the workers in the plant but also the community at large. Inthis regard he found the Inspector1 s analysis very reassuring.In I960 we had decided that, irrespective of cost, we must achievestandards of safety far more stringent than those that were inter-nationally acceptable, and he was satisfied that the health hazardswould be negligible.    He was also convinced by the Inspector&apos;conclusion that wind scale was the right site for the new plant. Itwas to be expected that there would be much debate on the thirdquestion which had three main aspects:  the size of the installation;the timing, especially as an immediate start was not essential inorder to meet our domestic requirements;  and the implications ofimpending reprocessing contracts with a number of other countries.It should be expected that by the time of the debate in parliament the opponents of the wind scale proposals who were dispirited bythe conclusions of the Inspector&apos;s report, would have rallied. TheGovernment would find itself pressed on how it intended adequatelyto control reprocessed plutonium against both terrorism and use as a weapons material.    We should also have to justify our approachin contrast to that of President Carter, who favoured the storagerather than the reprocessing of irradiated elements.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that inSeptember 1975 he had first raised with colleagues the proposition that British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) should reprocessnuclear fuel from Japan, and he had suggested that a decision should be deferred until there had been an opportunity for widerpublic debate.    The Ministerial Committee on Energy had agreedthat he should sound the Chairman of the Select Committee on 
Science and Technology to see whether that Committee would be willing to undertake an inquiry into the subject, but the Chairmanhad been unreceptive to his suggestion.    Some further public discussion had taken place, however, notably after a symposiumwhich he had organised at Church House.    It had nevertheless beenright that the decision should have been left in abeyance until theresult of the planning inquiry had been considered.    The Secretaryof State for the Environment&apos;s statement on 13 March had struckjust the right note.    On the question of hazards to health fromnuclear reprocessing, there had been two developments whichwould reassure the public: the responsibility for the management of nuclear wastes had been transferred to the Department of the environment;  and the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate had become the responsibility of the Health and Safety Executive under the aegis of the Department of Employment.    He had made a point: of keeping in touch with the Japanese utilities and he had very recentlyseen the Japanese Ambassador to ensure that there was no mis-understanding about our procedural handling of the inquiry report.The Ambassador fully understood our motives, but had suggestedthat it would be helpful if it could be seen that the Governmentwas taking swift action on the Special Development Order,preferably by laying it before Parliament by 31 March. he supported the Ambassador&apos;s views.    The Japanese ambassador had also stressed, understandably, the value of the reprocessingcontract to redress the balance of trade between Japan and theUnited Kingdom.    Given the United States&apos; attitude to reprocessingthe Japanese might need to come to an understanding with the UnitedStates on &amp;e. ad hoc basis about the reprocessing by nsof fuel of American origin but this was for them.    We should haveto be ready in the debate to respond to arguments based on thepossibility of a change in the French attitude if there were a changeof Government there.    The French Left were already suggesting a moratorium for 2 -3 years on the fast breeder reactor project, butit was not clear whether this would also apply to their reprocessingprogramme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that there were a number of questionswhich the report inadequately answered and which caused her grave concern.    First, the capacity of the plant was far in excess ofwhat we should need for our own advanced gas-cooled reactors orto process Japanese waste.    This suggested the possibility that we might already be well towards being committed to the fast breederreactor.    Then there was the question of storing waste fuel in preference to reprocessing it.    Many scientists, notwithstanding the report&apos;s conclusion, believed that storage was safer thanreprocessing, particularly for uranium oxides.    The safetransport of nuclear material also presented unresolved problems.Transportation by road was particularly hazardous, as accidentsin the United States had shown.    She was concerned about whowould be responsible for ensuring adequate standards of safety in 
this regard.    Finally she was concerned about the risks of terrorism.    If jve reprocessed Japanese waste, it would have tobe transported thousands of miles across the world. Althoughthe probabilities of terrorist action were extremely small, the implications of even one incident were extremely serious. Shedid not take comfort from the conclusion of the Inspector tnat these risk would not arise for 10 years.    This did not seem very longwhen the safety of future generations was at stake.    He had also accepted that some crucially important technological questionsremained to be answered.    For all these reasons she concluded that it would be premature to confirm the Inspector&apos;s recommenda-tion.    Instead we should wait for the outcome of theInternational Nuclear Fuel Cycle Evaluation (INFCE).In discussion, there was wide support for the general approach tothe forthcoming debate in the House of Commons suggested in thememorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment. Itwas pointed out that, on 16 December 1976, the Cabinet had approved proposals from BNFL not only for improvements to theexisting plant for reprocessing fuel from Magnox reactors and forthe development of a pilot plant for vitrifying long-lived radioactivewaste, but also, subject only to the outcome of the inquiry, newfacilities for reprocessing uranium oxide fuels from AdvancedGas-cooled Reactors, including those of customers overseas. Thelast conclusion had been conveyed on several occasions to theJapanese Government.    It was argued that there were no groundsin the Inspector&apos;s report for departing from the conclusionsprovisionally reached at that time.    To go ahead with the newreprocessing plant would be in the interests of the non-proliferationof nuclear weapons because it would contribute to the desirableobjective of containing plutonium processing to nuclear weaponstates.    If this could be achieved, it would be possible to account for all the plutonium available and to control it by ensuring that only those amounts necessary for peaceful purposes would be released.    The position of Japan was particularly important: shewas heavily dependent on nuclear power, and if she could not have spent reactor fuel reprocessed for her, she would have no alterna-tive but to develop reprocessing facilities herself.    Delay couldonly encourage proliferation.     Although there was no reason to doubt the sincerity of the President of the United States who took adifferent view towards reprocessing plutonium wastes, there were strong commercial pressures in the United States towards inhibitingothers in an area where American technology was not far advanced.Finally it was relevant - although this should not of course be saidpublicly - that the time scale of the development was such that a future government could review the decision if entirely newconsiderations showed this to be desirable.6
In further discussion, reference was made to the suggestion bythe Secretary of State for the Environment in his memorandum thatwe needed to confirm that we would oe free under the terms of thevarious contracts to return highly active waste to the originatingcountry if that were thought desirable.    It was pointed out, however that the Ministerial Committee on Energy had been assured thatthe Japanese contracts would be subject to the condition that BNFLwould have the option to return waste to Japan once it had beentransformed into a solid transportable form by the vitrificationprocess under development and to terminate the reprocessingobligation if that process could not be successfully developed.This was a most important safeguard and it was desirable that weshould be able to disclose it during the course of the forthcoming debate in Parliament.    It was further argued that the safeguards for transporting nuclear materials by sea needed tightening up.That 200 tons of uranium were stolen in 1968 were grounds fordoubting whether the existing international safeguards were goodenough.    It was particularly important to face this issue if wewere to reprocess Japanese fuel.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet reaffirmed its support for BNFL&apos;s proposals for areprocessing plant for oxide fuels of sufficient size to reprocessforeign fuel as well as our own.    They therefore accepted the inspectors conclusion that outline planning permission should begranted now, subject to the additional safeguards he proposed.The Secretary of State for the Environment should, as he had proposed in his memorandum, instigate an examination by officials of the Inspector1 s specific recommendations on additional safetymeasures, and report on them to Cabinet before Parliamentdebates the Special Development Order.    The Secretary of Statefor Energy should confirm to the Cabinet the conditions in theJapanese contracts governing the return of plutonium andprocessed or unprocessed waste to the country of origin, and theextent to which these conditions could be made public in the debate.He should similarly confirm to colleagues the financial advantages of the Japanese contract and the extent to which these, too, couldbe disclosed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited the secretaries of State for the Environment and forEnergy to be guided accordingly.7
^NDlTr ^&apos; ^e Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief^Sl&apos;REs   e Secretary, Treasury (CP(79) 30) about the state of the1975 Contingency Reserve and possible public expenditure measures.DGET They also had before them a note by the Central Policy ReviewrvioUs Staff (CP(78) 33) on the same subject, together with CP(78) 27,*teice- 2**&apos; 2^ and 3* anc* 34 a11 of which dealt with various additional&apos;^8) ^ expenditure proposals.r^ute 2    &apos; THE PRIME MINISTER said that She object of the meeting was to identify, if possible, two or three items, from the lists beforethem, which would be of genuine public political and social benefit,which the Party would welcome and the public would recognise aemeeting genuine needs, and which could be announced in the Budget.There was no opportunity to conduct a complete review of public expenditure.    The material before the Cabinet was toofragmentary for this.    There might be a case for adding to the published totals of public expenditure, but the time to do this wouldbe in the summer when the Cabinet had a new public expenditure survey before it.    Meanwhile the CPRS had, quite properly,warned against the dangers of committing too much of the published Contingency Reserve at this stage.    Although their estimate of the additional claims already under consideration was probably too high, the point remained valid.    It would be a mistake to expand public expenditure so fast as to make another cutsexercise necessary later in the year.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that there hadalready been a considerable increase in public expenditure. Thedecisions last October had added 2 per cent in real terms to public expenditure, while maintaining the level of taxation constant.In practice, because of the large shortfall in 1977-78, the rate of increase between that year and 1978-79 would be of the order of4-5 per cent in real terms.    The Conservative Opposition would try to present this as an increase of 8 per cent in the following week&apos;s debate on the Public Expenditure White Paper.    In his view it would be a mistake to give any additional stimulus now by wayof public expenditure.    Any public expenditure measures decidedat this stage and announced in the Budget should be financed fromthe Contingency Reserve.    His judgment, and that of the chief secretary, was that only up to  375 million, half of the reserve for 1978-79, should be committed at this stage.    The combined effect of the measures suggested by the Chief Secretary and of a  4Child Benefit from 1 April 1979 would be to pre-empt half of the contingency Reserve for 1979-80 as well.    There was thereforean argument for leaving the decision on Child Benefit until thepublic expenditure survey.8
In discussion, it was argued that the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals were not what the Cabinet had been led to believe in their discussion about the Budget at Chequers.   While it was generally agreed thatthe main weight of the budget stimulus should rest on tax reductions,the public, and the Party and the TUC, would expect some increases in public expenditure as well,    It was politically important toprovide additional assistance to mothers and pensioners, whosevotes would be significant in the next election.    Public expenditure,particularly on the construction industry, was a better way of stimulating domestic demand direc&amp;y than tax reductions whichwould simply suck in further imports.    It would be a mistake tostick rigorously to the published figures of the Public expenditure white Paper.    The increase of  375 million suggested by theChief Secretary was much too low.    There was substantial under-spending in public expenditure, partly as a result of the introductionof cash limits, which left some slack.    (Tha Health and social security programmes, however, would not be underspent in1978-79.)Against this it was argued that the Cabinet had discussed under-spending before and had agreed that it did not offer any room for additional expenditure.    Underspending was allowed for in theBudget judgment, and was one of the factors taken into account in deciding how large a tax reduction could be afforded. However,there was a case for imposing cash limits on the Chancellorhimself, and requiring any underspending on public expenditure tobe added back to the Contingency Reserve, rather than diverted to finance tax reductions.    It was true that the TUC had pressed for additional public expenditure, but they wanted tax cuts as well.Moreover most of the additional expenditure proposed by individual ministers took the form of transfer payments, which had exactly the same economic effects (including effects on the balance ofpayments) as tax reductions.In further discussion, it was emphasised that some part of the contingency Reserve for 1978-79 had already been pre-empted bydecisions Ministers had taken on the thermal reactor programme and on e.c. contributions.    Some of the others listed in the chief secretary&apos;s paper were inevitable.    There were others, not listed,which were bound to arise during the year, including therecommendations of the Pearson Committee on Civil Liability.There might also be a case for considering a Christmas bonus to pensioners again.In discussion of individual expenditure proposals, the followingpoints were made:-a.       Social Security upratingThe latest estimates of the statutory uprating required inNovember 1978 was that it would involve an increase of11.5 per cent in existing rates.    This was allowed for in9
the published public expenditure forecast.    It would bringthe pension for a married couple to  31.20 and the singlepension to  19. 50.    The Secretary of State for social services recommended an increase of 14. 3 per cent,bringing the married pension to  32 and the single to  20.The additional cost of this increase, above the publishedfigures, would be   1 i0 million in 1978-79, and more in afull year.    Pensioners had increased their standard ofliving in real terms in the last few years, during a period when the living standards of ordinary workers had fallen.It could therefore be argued that there was no case for anespecially generous uprating.    On the other hand, it wasnot yet certain that 11. 5 per cent was the right estimate for the required statutory uprating.    For operational reasons the decision needed to be taken before the end ofMay.    But the information about earnings available wouldnot be much better than that now before the Cabinet. Itmight therefore be sensible to take the docieion early and-announce it in the course of the Budget.    Any incraasebeyond the statutory uprating would be a charge against the contingency Reserve, and it would be prudent to leave room for this ir assessing what other claims couldbe afforded.b. Employment MeasuresA series of employment measures costing  155 millionhad been considered by the Ministerial Group on EmploymentMeasures (GEN 27), and largely approved by Ministersalready.    A decision on the Job Release Scheme remained to be taken, and this was now urgent.    The Secretary ofState for Employment hoped to announce the whole packageof employment measures as soon as possible.c. Steel closuresThe Ministerial Group on the steel industry (GEN 116) hadalready agreed to a programme of supplementary measurescosting  14 million in 1978-79, subject to Cabinet approval.There was a strong case for allowing this expenditure to go forward forthwith.d. Storm Damage and Sea DefencesThere was a good case for approving this genuine&quot;contingency&quot; expenditure, at a cost of  4 million for grants to farmers and  2 million for sea defences, assoon as possible.    These maximum figures includedexpenditure by the relevant Departments in Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland.   In addition, the Department of the environment would wish to make a case for a further 8 million on coast protection works, as a result of thesame storm and flood damage.10
e. Energy ConservationThere was a strong case for approving the expenditure on assistance to industry and to private householders inEngland on the lines already endorsed by the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy, at a total cost of up to 27 million.f. Law and OrderNet expenditure of  3 million after offsets was proposedon prisons, the probation service, police civilians,equipment and magistrates courts.    Further additional expenditure might be needed later in the year to coverincreases in police pay and the recruitment of additionalpolice who would be attracted by new pay rates.g. School Meals and MilkPostponement of the increase in the school meals chargehad been agreed by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee.    There was a strong political case for this.However, if its cost was to be met by a 100 per cent grant,there was no need for an immediate announcement and itcould be deferred until the Budget speech.    The additional expenditure on school milk had the added advantage of attracting financial support from the European economic community.h. Education Capital ExpenditureThis was an inescapable recalculation, adding  40 million to the costs of school building programmes.i. Teacher training as part of the employment measures, an additional 2 million on teacher training and retraining through the manpower Services Commission was of high priority.j.       Other Environmental services the figures in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper represented amaximum bid, and the Secretary of State for the environment would be prepared to reduce these:  he would however press the case for additional expenditure of 10- 15 million on Inner City development;    8 million forcoast preservation, noted above;    4. 5 million for factory building by the Development Commission in rural areas,which would be welcome to the Liberals;  and  5 millioninvestment in the canal system.    He would also press for 50 million on housing improvement grants.11
k.       National Health service the proposals of the Secretary of State for Social services had already been discussed in the Horns and Social AffairsCommittee, which had been impressed by the case he made.He himself would give it higher priority than increasedsocial security uprating or child benefits.    There was nodoubt that the National Health Service was suffering theeffect of past reductions in expenditure and a very low rateof growth and that this was having a damaging effect on theservice.    But there was no guarantee that additional fundsallocated to the Area Health Authorities would actually be spent in improved services to patients.    Because of the structure of the unions in the Health Service, and a high level of restrictive practices, there was a real d angerthat the money would not get through to the patient.    If any additional funds were to be devoted to the Health Service,therefore, there was a strong case for making a generalallocation, but requiring each Health Authority, in consulta-tion with the relevant trade unions, to demonstrate that itcould utilise its increased funding on additional equipment or facilities, or improved services to pati*ats.1.       Child BenefitsThere was a strong case for giving increased Child Benefitspriority over other improvements in social security benefits.    They represented a substitute for tax allowanceswhich would otherwise have had to be increased in theBudget, and were not public expenditure in the same sense as other claims on the Contingency Reserve.    An increase inallowance to  4 from April 1979 was almost inevitable to offset the nhasing out of child tax allowances in that year.The issue was whether 70p of that increase should bebrought forward and paid from November 1978, at anadditional cost of  165 million in 1978-79.    A decision onthis would be needed before the Summer Recess.    It wouldbe electorally attractive, although the exaggerated claimsmade by the Child Poverty Action Group and other pressuregroups could be partly discounted.    If the increase was tobe made at all there was a strong argument for announcingit in the Budget speech.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said he wouldnot ask the Cabinet to decide that day on the detailed bids to come out of that part of the Contingency Reserve which would be allocated now and announced in the Budget.    Clearly however not all the desirable bids could be accommodated.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should consider the points made in discussion inthe further work on his Budget and should bring specific proposals12
for additional expenditure to the Cabinet in due course.    It wasthe Chancellor&quot;s responsibility to make sure that the quantum ofany Budget stimulus was correct, but he naturally took  account ofhis colleagues views in deciding on its content.    There would be afurther meeting of the Cabinet on 4 April to hear the Chancellor&apos;sproposals on this and related matters.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office9 March 197813
