TARY   l- The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.KNf pAms 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^ the assassination of Usuf El Sabai in Nicosia on 18 February had been&quot;is carried out by members of the so-called Rejectionist Front, whosepurpose was to do all they could to undermine President Sadat&apos;sinitiative.    What had happened at Larnaca airport on the evening of19 February was not yet entirely clear.    There had been evidentlydoubts about what the Cypriot authorities intended to do with the terrorists - and there had been instances in the past year where theCypriots had capitulated to pressure - but the Egyptian commandos hadundoubtedly acted without permission from the President of Cyprus.One consequence might be to make some countries less ready in future to allow military intervention by another Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said the Cabinet should know that after theMogadishu affair a plan had been made for possible British military intervention in the event of a terrorist incident overseas involvingBritish interests.    This plan, which had been approved by the ministerial Committee on Terrorism, envisaged the use of a specialelement of the Special Air Service.    A Miniscer would take charge ofany negotiating team sent overseas.    An important element of this plan was that permission from the local Government should be obtained inadvance of any British intervention on the spot.siaTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he wast^0&quot;8 considering the intern&quot;! settlement with caution and a degree of^ftfCe: scepticism.    But he had been careful to say nothing which might be\^ ^th construed as rejecting it.    The American attitude was even moreif4lta8lons( reserved than our own:  they were worried about the possibledeterioration of the situation, which could result in greater Cubaninvolvement in Zambia.    There were already about 60 Cubans in thecountry and their advice was of much higher quality than anything which was available locally.    If this number were to be stepped up to,say, 500, the Cubans could swing the balance.   But similar dangerscould result from outright rejection of the internal settlement. Hewould like more time to reflect on the situation and see how itdeveloped.    The Opposition^ reactions in the House of 22 Februaryhad been more controlled than in the previous week.    But there were still domestic political overtones which they would do their best to exploit.
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, referring tc the cuban presence in Africa generally, said that it was clear that theCubans were acting as surrogates for the Russians.    Cuban involve -ment alone was not necessarily decisive as the continuing civil war inAngola showed.    In the Horn of Africa they had had the effect of stopping the Somali advance in Ethiopia.    Despite the Somali historicallinks with the Ogaden they had been wrong to invade.    If they were towithdraw back into their own country it should be possible to mobilisestrong international pressure to get the Cubans out of Ethiopia. Thiswhole area of Africa was a very difficult one, as the Russians hadalready found.    It was essential for the West to avoid getting drawn into the situation and getting bogged down in the area.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Soviet purpose in the Horn of africa was to attempt to gain as much control over supplies of middle east oil as they could.    Sooner or later we would have to decide whether we were going to allow them to pursue this course. Thiswould involve a major test for the West and, over the next ten years or so, he foresaw the prospect of a deterioration of our relations with theSoviet Union.    The question of our future relations with the soviet union was a subject on which it would be useful for the Cabinet to havea general discussion in due course.The Cabinet -Took note.
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hismeeting with Commissioner Vouei the previous Friday had left him withthe impression that the Commission would like an agreement with us onthe Temporary Employment Subsidy (TES).    They had movedsignificantly from their initial position.    However, the proposedmodifications we had offered reducing the number of jobs supported by25, 000 had not proved acceptable.    The Ministerial Group onUnemployment among Young People had approved a modified proposal which would affect about 35, 000 jobs, although the new short-time working scheme he would be proposing was intended to cover an equivalent number of jobs lost.    While it was not legally essential todo so,  it would be very desirable to have the Employment SubsidiesBill passed before the short-time working scheme was introduced.He intended to explain to the Commission that, although he was usinghis best endeavours to introduce the new scheme by the end of May, the changes in the impact of TES on the textile, clothing and footwearsectors were dependent upon the new scheme coming into operation.He would be meeting Commissioner Vouel in Brussels on 24 February.The Commission were still seeking for an end to the TES Supplement,although alternatives such as lowering the rate of payment for thesecond six months or limiting still further the proportion of the work-force in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors which could benefit from TES, might have to be considered.    It was his intention at themeeting with Commissioner Vouel to seek agreement on the basis ofthe revised proposals approved by the Ministerial Group onUnemployment among Young People and not to go any further without reference back to his colleagues.In discussion it was pointed out that even the changes already envisagedwould cause difficulties in Parliament and further concessions would be severely criticised.    On the other hand the alternative of a short-time working scheme would be very welcome to the textile and clothingindustry, especially if firms which had exhausted their possibilitiesunder TES could be eligible.    The particular problems of NorthernIreland had been explained to the Commission but it might be necessaryto consider modifications to the TES if firms in Northern Ireland wereshown to be in direct competition with those in the Irish Republic. Onthe other hand it was pointed out that industry in the Irish Republicbenefited from subsidies, notably the tax-free holiday scheme on all exports of manufactures.    It was not clear that this was legallycovered by the derogations given to the Irish Republic under the accession Treaty.The Cabinet -Took note.
kI&quot;&apos; SHKigj^ ^&quot; The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord^Hf; President of the Council (CP(78) 21) on capital punishment in theJEND Nt Dependent Overseas Territories (DOT).^ItORTf, THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the problem ofcapital punishment in the DOT was complicated.    It arose becauseseven of our DOT had made a deliberate decision in their legislaturesnot to abolish capital punishment.    As a result of the policy laid downin 1947 by the then Colonial Secretary, Mr Arthur Creech-Jones, theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary was precluded from advising the Queen to intervene in the exercise of her Prerogative of mercy in capital cases arising in these territories, except where there had been an evident miscarriage of justice.    This meant that the decision whether or not to commute a death sentence rested with the Governorafter he had held formal consultations with local representative::. the death sentence had been carried out in four cases in the DOT sincecapital punishment had been abolished in the United Kingdom in 1965.The most recent was in Bermuda last year when the executions were followed by disturbances which required the despatch of British troops to the island.    This case had given rise to considerable interest in both Parliament and the Press in the issue of capital punishment in theDOT.    The Ministerial Group which had considered the problem under his chairmanship had agreed that the situation in the seven DOT waaout of line with present day attitudes in Parliament and in the UnitedKingdom generally and they had concluded that a change in theprocedure which effectively debarred a British Minister fromrecommending a reprieve was desirable.    There were, however,difficulties in making such a change.    The most satisfactory way would be to abolish the death penalty by legislation, but because thelocal legislatures would not be willing to pass such legislation, weshould have to proceed by means of legislation in the United kingdom parliament.    It would however be impossible to find time for thelegislation during the present Session.    Moreover it would createproblems in certain of the territories which we would be bound to consult.    The Ministerial Group had therefore reluctantly concluded that legislation should be ruled out, at least for the time being. Thealternative was to proceed by a Resolution in the House of Commonswhich would abrogate the Creech-Jones doctrine and would enable theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary of the day to tender advice toThe Queen on the exercise of the Prerogative.    The effect of adoptingthis procedure would be to introduce a two-tier system under which theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would advise The Queen on theuse of the Prerogative only in those cases where the Governor of theDOT had not granted a reprieve.    An objection to this arrangement was that if the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary recommended areprieve, this would involve overriding local views and could causeresentment in the territory.    One way of avoiding this risk would beto remove from the Governors their delegated powers to exercise the
Prerogative, but for constitutional reasons such a change wouldrequire the agreement of the local Government in two of the DOT and itwas unlikely that this would be obtained.    The Group had thereforeconcluded that despite objections to a two-tier system this was the only course available if a change in the present arrangements was to bemade in the near future.    A Private Member&apos;s Resolution would be amore suitable way of proceeding in the House of Commons than aGovernment Motion but this might involve considerable delay and analternative was an Early Day Motion in Government time.In discussion it was argued that the aim of the proposal to abrogate theCreech-Jones doctrine was the de facto abolition of capital punishmentin the DOT.    Yet it was intended to proceed on a case-by-case basis and not provide for an automatic reprieve in every case. this seemed an unhappy compromise which might be worse than the presentposition.    Moreover, if the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary ofthe day was personally an abolitionist, he would be placed in a greatmoral dilemma if a case arose on which there seemed no ground onwhich to justify a reprieve.    On the other hand, every time he advised the Queen to exercise the Prerogative he would be seen to bedisregarding the views of the Governor and his advisers and this could also lead to serious local difficulties.    It was suggested that a solution to this problem might be for the Governor to consult the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary in every case before he took his decision.This would avoid any public difference of view and leave the finaldecision in the Governor&apos;s hands.    As against this, it was pointed outthat if the decision went against the views of the Governor&apos;s localadvisers, it would be attributed to the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s intervention and the Governor would be placed in a verydifficult position.In further discussion the view was widely expressed that, irrespective of the best way of dealing with the position in the DOT, it would not bedesirable to raise the question of capital punishment in the DOT in theHouse of Commons at the present time.    It was questionable whethera Motion to abrogate the Creech-Jones doctrine would be carried.There was a growing movement in the Conservative Party in favour of bringing back the death penalty in the United Kingdom for terroristmurders, and there was a risk that this could become a major issue ina pre-Election period.    It would be a mistake to do anything atpresent which might increase that risk.    If a Resolution on capital punishment in the DOT was introduced, it could encourage publicdebate of the domestic issues and weaken the general position of thosein favour of the continued abolition of the death penalty.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thepresent position was most unsatisfactory and that he believed that any foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in a Labour Government would5
be placed in a difficult position.    The Creech-Jones doctrine did not offer him protection against pclitical pressures.    The constitutional position had been explained very carefully in the Bermuda case toParliament and to the Press, but he had still been strongly criticised for the outcome.    He had been regarded as responsible for the way inwhich events had developed in Bermuda, even though he had had no power to intervene in the processes which had led to the executions.He had not proposed dealing with this situation by seeking the total abolition of capital punishment.    There could well be local circum-stances in particular cases which would make a reprieve inadvisable.But what the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary required was thepower to intervene if necessary.    Such a change would also have theeffect of relieving the Governor of some of the intense pressure whichhe came under locally in capital cases.    He therefore remained of theview that the proposal put to the Cabinet was the right one on merits.The question of when to change the present policy was however adifferent matter and he acknowledged the force of the current domesticpolitical difficvdties.    If the Cabinet felt that for wider political reasons it would be better to wait until a new Labour Government witha majority could deal with the matter once and for all, he would beready to defend the present policy for the time being.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the present policy on capital punishment in theDOT placed the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in a mojtdifficult position and that, unless a change were made in that policy,the problems which had arisen in the recent case in Bermuda were likely to be repeated.    They agreed, however, that the present political climate in the United Kingdom made this an inopportune timeto try and introduce any change in the DOT.    They welcomed theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s readiness to continue to defend the present position.    They would consider the problem again at an appropriate time:  and would then need to decide whether to proceed bymeans of United Kingdom legislation or by abrogation of the Creech-Jones doctrine.    In the meanwhile the Cabinet&apos;s position on capital punishment in the United Kingdom remained resolutely abolitionist.The danger of stimulating public debate of the domestic issue should be pointed out to those Labour Members of Parliament who had been pressing for a change in the present policy in the DOT.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly.6
5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP(78) 20) to which were attached revised paragraphs on the north sea Oil Development Fund for the White Paper together with a minutefrom the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to the Prime Minister dated22 February 1978 suggesting some further amendments to these paragraphs.THE PRIME MINISTER said the new paragraphs were intended toreplace the last three sentences of paragraph 50 of the present draft(CP(78) 16) and the whole of paragraphs 51, 52 and 53.The Cabinet then considered the proposed new paragraphs in detail andthe following main points were made -a. It was as difficult to identify the uses to which particularrevenues had been put after the event as it would be to allocatethem in advance.    This could be brought out more clearly inparagraph 55 by adopting the amendments proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury.b. Both suggested versions of paragraph 56 were arguablyobscure in their attempt to explain that future public expenditure programmes, up to 1982, already took account ofestimated oil revenue.    A simpler approach was needed. TheGovernment prepared forward programmes of expenditure andthese would, in future, be supported by growing oil revenues.Without this assistance the country would have to forgo some part of these future programmes or bear an increase in taxation.    This was the way in which the extra revenues would therefore be used.    Against this, however, it was pointed outthat the difficulty of disentangling the uses to which North Seaoil revenues had been put from the generality of public expenditure programmes would remain.    The aim ofparagraph 56 was first to demonstrate this problem and secondto show that if an attempt at separation was made by creating aspecial fund it would inevitably lead to undertaking someprojects of a lower priority than the general run of government expenditure.    A more qualified approach was called for bywhich the Government could say that it was taking account ofthe first fruits of North Sea oil in its forward programmes andthat it would review the situation annually in the light of thetotality of Government revenue and the priorities of the day.It was important to avoid any implication that the exclusivebenefit of the oil was to permit additional public expenditure.This was but one of many benefits.
c.       Paragraph 58 again raised the problem of identifying theuses to which additional revenues had been put.     It was important to give a complete picture and the difficulty could be resolved by making it clear that the annual progress report would discuss the effects on public expenditure generally of theaddition of North Sea oil revenues.Drafting amendments were also agreed to paragraphs 52, 53 and 57.In further discussion the importance of informing the trade unions andthe Labour Party about the content of the White Paper was stressed.The Liberals would also have to be informed, and a publication datefixed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now agreed the entire White Paper apart from paragraph 56.He would consider this paragraph further and circulate a revised version taking account of the points that had been made in discussion.It was to be hoped this could be agreed without a further meeting. TheChancellor of the Exchequer would talk to the Parliamentary LabourParty about the White Paper.    A date had not been fixed but either8 or 14 March seemed likely.    It was also important to put keyTransport House officials into the picture before publication. TheNational Executive Committee (NEC) already proposed submitting a paper on North Sea oil revenues to the NEC/Cabinet meeting on13 March which would provide a suitable opportunity to discuss the contents of the White Paper.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster would inform the Liberals.     The Chief Secretary, Treasury,together with the Secretary of State for Scotland, would see the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and explore whether the TUC EconomicCommittee wished to discuss the White Paper in the context of theirrevised Budget repre-entations.    The Secretary of State for scotland would also see the Scottish TUC and the Secretary of State for wales the Welsh TUC before publication.    The publication date itself couldnot be fixed precisely yet:  clearly it should not be before 13 March.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office23 February 1978
