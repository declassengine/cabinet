PARLIAMENTARY  1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.foreignaffairsRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(78) 2ndConclusions,Minute 32. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the recent meeting in Malta had been the first occasion on whichthere had been an opportunity for serious discussion with thePatriotic Front.    The fact that a settlement in 1978 now seemed possible, coupled with the possibility of an internal settlement andpressure from the Front Line Presidents, had made them moreready to discuss the United States/United Kingdom proposals. Thediscussions had shown that there were still wide gaps between ourposition and theirs.    There was nevertheless a chance that theymight eventually be brought together with the internal nationaliuts.Bishop Muzorewa had recently written asking for a meeting in Londonand expressing concern about future arrangements for the army.It was relevant that both Bishop Muzorewa and Mr Mugabe wereShonas, and this could provide a link between them.    We shouldnot condemn the negotiation for an internal settlement, but we couldnot endorse it particularly since we must avoid aJienating opinion inthe rest of Black Africa.    Bishop Muzorewa might in any event seek to delay a settlement.    If eventually elections took place in a peaceful atmosphere and revealed real support for Bishop Muzorewaand the Reverend N Si thole, we might then have to recognise the outcome.    Meanwhile we should jtand firm on our aim of a negotiated settlement and ceasefire.    We should no doubt be subjectto criticism and domestic political considerations were involved,but we could expect general support if we concentrated on our objective of achieving a peaceful solution.NamibiaPreviousReference:CM/73; 1stConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thattogether with the Foreign Ministers of Canada, France, Germanyand the United States, he was due to meet the South African ForeignMinister and also representatives of the South West Africa people organisation (SWAPO) in New York on 10 and 11 February, to discussthe possibilities of a settlement in Namibia.    The prospects would depend on whether the South Africans and SWAPO were prepared tomake the necessary compromises.    The South Africans accepted a United Nations role, including a peacekeeping force, and alsothe arrangements for elections.    They were resisting demands towithdraw all their troops before elections took place and wanted a smaller peacekeeping force than had been proposed.    But SWAPOwere being uncompromising and if the negotiations should failresponsibility would probably not be thought to lie with South Africa.A solution on Namibia would have great influence on Rhodesia and also have a useful stabilising effect in Southern Africa.    It was also important for us to maintain access to the uranium supplies from theRossing Mine in Namibia.
east the PRIME MINISTER said that no important decisions were likelyPfevi0u to ^e taken during President Sadat&apos;s forthcoming visit to theHefPt.^ S United States.    The Americans realised that President Sadat was^(78) is under great pressure and their main objective was to prevent him^&quot;iclu ,St from doing anything impetuous.    Ho had been asked by^fiuiitg 2 President Carter for his advice on what should be done next and inreply had emphasised the importance of urging President Sadat tocontinue to work for agreement on a Statement of Principles.    He had also suggested that there would be advantage in an Arab Summit,which could perhaps be called by the Saudi Arabians.    He feared that Prime Minister Begin of Israel was going back on his earlierplans, after the initial euphoria in December.    He would be seeingPresident Sadat when he passed through London on 9 February. consummit    THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had had a letter from theFederal German Chancellor, Herr Schmidt, proposing that thenext economic Summit should take place in mid-July, provided thepreparatory work showed that it would yield useful results. Hehad agreed, stressing that in his view a Summit at about this time was very desirable to discuss in particular the slow rate of growth,the political consequences of continued high unemployment and theinstability of the money markets.    The Secretary of the cabinet would once again be his representative in the preparations for the summit.The Cabinet -Took note.2
COMMUNITYtor airsCommonfisheriesMicyPreviousReierence:CM1T61) 2ndConclusions,Minute 43. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported that in the absence of agreement on revision of the commonfisheries policy (CFP) at the Fisheries Council on 31 January, wewould for the time being apply existing Community and nationalconservation measures under our own powers;  and would consider urgently whether further non-discriminatory national measures shouldbe taken.    The main obstacle to agreement on the revision of the CFPwas German opposition to our claim for a preferential share of future growth in the fisheries in our coastal waters.    We hoped to secure inbilateral discussions with the Commission and the Germans some formof coastal preference which would assure the industry of the opportunityto catch the quotas now offered to us.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the ministerial Committee on European Questions should consider furtherour tactics in the Community and in Parliament.    They should also consider any proposal for further national conservation measures.The Cabinet -1.Took note.THE PRIME MINISTER said that negotiations with the Commission onthe Temporary Employment Subsidy had so far proceeded relativelysatisfactorily.    But further political persuasion might ultimately be needed to convince the Commission of the political necessity of temporary measures to maintain employment.In discussion it was suggested that the Commission should be discouraged from intervening directly with industry especially inmatters which Ministers might themselves be discussing with industry.There was also a need to consider our general attitude to Commissioncriticism of our state aids.    On the other hand it was pointed out thatspecific powers and duties were entrusted to the Commission underthe Treaties.    The Ministerial Committee on European Questions(CQM) had given careful consideration to the best means of safe-guarding our interests and had taken the view that we should argueeach case on its merits.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatCQM should continue to maintain oversight of our relations with theCommission and any Minister who was concerned about an individual case should raise it in CQM.
The Cabinet -2.       Took note.^ THe^^ The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of State^ Nrp ior Defence (CP(78) 11) to which was attached a draft of the statement&quot;sTlMA.te 0n the Delence Estimates 1978.-978THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the firstchapter of the draft statement attached to his note was an account ofthe Government1 s defence policy and the remaining chapters reviewedvarious aspects of the defence programme.    Chapter I followed the pattern of the 1977 Defence White Paper by beginning with a section ondetente and disarmament and continuing with passages on thecapability of the Warsaw Pact and on the defencs effort of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), including the United Kingdom&apos;contribution.    The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (DOP) had considered the balance of Chapter I and were generally satisfied with it.     Paragraph 121 of the draft statement had been amended in the lightof DOP&apos;s discussion to include a reference to Soviet activities in Africa,and the same paragraph now made clear that French forces were excluded from Figures 3 and 4 which showed the current balance ofready forces in the Eastern Atlantic and in Central Europe. Theincrease of 1, 9C0 in the Army&apos;s manpower referred to in paragraph 132had been agreed by DOP and, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, he proposed to announce it shortly in Parliament.    The increases in thedefence budget outlined in paragraph 145 of the draft statement had beenwarmly welcomed in NATO and in particular by the United States.On the other hand, there had been criticism of the new levels of defence expenditure from a number of Government supporters, though this hadperhaps not been as strong as had been anticipated.    These attackswould no doubt be renewed in the defence debate, but the main issuethen was likely to be the pay of the Armed Forces.In discussion of Chapter I of the draft statement the following points were made -a. Although there had been reasonable progress in thenegotiations on a Comprehensive Test Bar. Treaty, it was not certain that it would be possible to conclude an agreement bythe summer.    The United States Government might prefer togive priority to a Strategic Arms Limitation agreement.b. It might be appropriate for the Prime Minister to attend the United Nations Special Session on Disarmament.    We were taking an active part in the preparatory work for the session and, in agreement with our allies, were putting forward proposals of our own.
c. The timescale of 1968-77 used in Figures 1 and cappeared arbitrary, and a more accurate picture of the growth in Soviet strength might be given by showing the increase intheir capability between 1976 and 1977.    Moreover, the chartsdid not include information for NATO forces, and it was there-fore impossible to arrive at a comparison.    Against this, itwas argued that changes in defence capabilities took placerelatively slowly because of the long time needed to develop and produce modern equipment, and it was therefore possible to illustrate trends accurately only if a period of several years was used.d. The charts at Figures 3 and 4 had given rise to problems in the past and they had accordingly been left out of the 1977Defence White Paper.    Their omission had, however, been criticised by the Select Committee on Expenditure who had asked for them to be restored in the 1978 White Paper. french forces had been excluded from the NATO figures because france was not part of the integrated military structure of the alliance.    As against this, it was pointed out that Franceremained a member of the Alliarce and that there jvas no doubtthat in the event of a conflict with the Warsaw Pact her forces would fight alongside those of the rest of NATO.    Her forces were thus part of the balance and to leave them out made thecharts misleading.    It was important not to exaggerate the weakness of the Alliance.    If there were political objections toincluding French forces in the total NATO figures, they mightbe shown in a separate category.    The omission of Hungarianforces from the figures for the Warsaw Pact also distorted the picture which the charts sought to convey.    It was arguable that a more satisfactory way of presenting the balance of forces might be to drop the charts in their present form, expand the text of Chapter I as necessary and set out the figures in an annex.e. The increases in the defence budget would have a very valuable effect on our relations with the United States not onlyin the defence field but also more generally.    It was hoped to beable to make use in the forthcoming defence debate ofcomparisons of per capita defence expenditure based onpurchasing power parities which would show that our defence effort was much closer to that of the Federal Republic ofGermany than appeared from Figure 5, which was based on united States dollars.f. The section on commitments outside NATO might comemore appropriately after paragraph 141.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the statement on the Defence Estimates1978 subject to the points made in discussion and agreed that it shouldbe published on 15 February.     The Secretary of State for defence should announce the increase in Army manpower as he proposed.There was no doubt about the preponderance of military strengthenjoyed by the Warsaw Pact, but in their present form the charts in chapter I of the statement overstated that preponderance.    It was particularly important that the effect of French forces on the balanceshould be plainly brought out.    The Secretary of State for defence should consider how best to present as accurate a comparison aspossible of the forces of the North Atlantic Alliance and of the warsaw pact and should make appropriate changes to Chapter I.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Defence to be guided accordingly.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(78) 12) on the economic prospect and policies,setting out the background to the spring Budget;  a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Energy (CP(77) 117) describing a possiblenational development programme;  a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security (CP(78) 10)setting out the case for reflation and an increase in public expen-diture;  and a joint memorandum (CP(78) 5) by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment on future paypolicy, together with minutes from the Minister for Social Securitydated 31 January and from the Secretary of State for Employmentdated 1 February.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it would be usefulat this stage to have a vary general discussion about economic strategyas the background to further talks about pay and the Budget. although he could not yet give a detailed forecast of the prospects for next year,several of the critical elements would become clearer in the next fewweeks.    But it was already clear that there would be room for asubstantial stimulus in the Budget.    The Trades Union Congress(TUC) wanted  3 billion, and the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) wanted  2 billion;  but there was general agreement that itwould be a mistake to give a stimulus which could not be met from increased domestic output.    Otherwise, reflation would merely leadto inflation, and not to new jobs.    It would be a mistake to exceed thepublic expenditure totals set out in the newly-published White Paper,so additional expenditure must come from the Contingency Reserve.Taking account of reduced shortfall, expenditure in 1978-79 would be4-5 per cent higher than in 1977-78 and would increase as a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).    Inflation should remain comfortably within single figures throughout 1978, but itscourse in 1979 depended on improvements in productivity.    The growth rate of 3. 5 per cent in GDP forecast in October would now only beachieved through a reflationary stimulus.    The earnings outturnwould probably be a little over 10 per cent but unless the pay policycollapsed, the final result should be within the 12-14 per cent range.But even this added seriously to inflation and to industrial costs;taken together witn the appreciation of sterling since the autumn, ourcompetitiveness continued to fall.    In addition, the growth in world trade was likely to be smaller than we had expected, despite our efforts to achieve concerted world reflation.    Overshadowing all thiswas the threat of a collapse in the international monetary system ifthe dollar continued to weaken.    All this pointed to the need for afurther Economic Summit, possibly in July.    There was little theGovernment could do by way of intervention to aftect the course of theexchange rate, and the TUC now recognised that depreciation wouldnot necessarily save jobs.    There were some encouraging signs.Investment and sales were probably rising faster than the statistics
indicated.    Industrial investment other than in steel had risen by13-15 per cent in the past year and the CBI thought this would continue.Retail sales were beginning to move ahead fast as the October lax cutsworked through and delayed wage settlements were agreed. Asinventories of stocks were reduced, this should work thrcugh toinvestment and employment.    But there was considerable concealedunemployment and spare capacity in the industry, so the effects onthe labour market might not be rapid.    Nevertheless there was some reason to think that unemployment might have reached its peak. Inthat case, 3 per cent growth in GDP should lead to a steady slow fallin unemployment, though postponed to the extent that temporaryemployment measures had encouraged the hoarding of under-utilisedlabour.    It would not be sensible to quantify these improvements atthis stage.    The major worry was the loss of price competitiveness,made worse by disruptions in supply.    Production might not expand to match the desired stimulus in demand.    During the period when north sea oil would strengthen the balance of payments, it would be harder to offset the rapid relative increase in our wage costs by a depreciatingpound.    If the exchange rate could not be used as a policy instrument,competitiveness must be increased by other means.    The industrialstrategy held out the best hope of doing *his in the long term,supported by improved labour relations and by a move towardsindustrial democracy.    But this would not lead to a rapid quantumchange in productivity.    The burden must therefore fall on earnings,and the acquiescence or support of the unions in continued restraint on earnings was essential.    This made the case for increased tax relief in the next Budget very strong indeed, both to improve take-home pay and to increase the demand for private sector output (which workedthrough to employment more rapidly than expansion in the public services) and also to improve incentives and eliminate the povertytrap.    There were some signs of support from the unions for a continued pay policy on these lines provided that the recent improve-ment in living standards (already reflected in the Governmentsstanding in public opinion polls) could be continued.In discussion it was argued that the room for manoeuvre was less thanMinisters had expected.    They had hoped that the arrival of North Seaoil in substantial quantities in 1978 would remove the balance ofpayments constraint.    It was no longer safe to assume this. north sea oil already met half our needs and over-stimulation of the economy could easily cast doubts on our ability to maintain a balanceof payments surplus.    Moreover, in so far as the exchange rateremained high, at least in the short term, it could have damagingeffects on competitivity.    The industrial strategy would not produce any significant improvement in competitivity in the short term. Theprospects of an improvement in world trade were deteriorating. the risks of a crisis in the international monetary system were great.In this situation, it would be economically unjustifiable and politically
dangerous to take risks in the Budget, particularly if that involved risk to the balance of payments surplus.    A cautious approach to theBudget was therefore essential.On the other hand it was argued that there were great uncertainties inall forecasting, and that in the absence of any firm figures at this stagea common-sense approach was needed.    In 1976. the control of inflation had been given top priority, and as a result, unnecessarilysevere cuts in public services had been made.    A tight wages policy,carried out with loyalty rather than conviction by the trade unions,coupled with unacceptably high levels of unemployment, had notimproved productivity.    It was too late to change the strategy beforethe Election, but a fresh approach would influence the co-operation ofthe trade union movement.    In particular, improvements in public services would help to cieate more jobs.    The British economyshould no longer be exposed to uncontrollable international monetarymovements.    A different approach, departing from previous Treasuryorthodoxy, would help to get the ecoromy moving again.In further discussion it was argued that the employment situation was now so serious that the Budget strategy should err on the side of expansion, though without going to the brink which might bring disaster.The TUC had probably achieved the right balance in demanding aS3 billion stimulus, divided between  2 billion on taxation and 1 billion on public expenditure, including transfer payments. Imp-roved child benefits would have an important part to play in serving asan incentive, benefiting the lower-paid family man in work, and increasing demand.    The employment measures already adopted,while useful, were not enough and some further reflation was essential.    A growth rate of 3 per cent would probably not be sufficientto reduce unemployment, because of the considerable under-employmentconcealed in the present statistics.    The improvement in the balance ofpayments, together with the reduction in the rate of inflation, ga&quot;e theopportunity for a substantial stimulus.    The effect on the balance ofpayments surplus need not be disastrous, and if a smaller surplus ledto the depreciation of the pound, this would help with competitivity.But if the balance of payments were seen as a constraint, some formsof additional public expenditure, particularly on construction, would be preferable to an increase in consumer expenditure, because theywould have less effect on imports.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was inadequate time left for the extensive discussion which the Cabinet wished to have of its economic strategy and of the related questions of pay policy.    A meeting devotedto this alone would be desirable and could be held at Chequers on sunday 19 February.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider what further information could be made available at such a meeting.
The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion on 19 February.Cabinet Office2 February 1978
