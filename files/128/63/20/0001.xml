1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the Houseof Commons during the period 6-9 June and of the progress of the Scotlandand Wales Bills in the House of Lords.    The Scotland Bill was expected tocomplete its passage in the House of Lords and be returned to the House ofCommons at the end of June, and the Wales Bill on about 13 July.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet were grateful to the LordChancellor and the Lord Privy Seal, and to the other Ministers concerned,for the efforts they had made to ensure that the two Bills made good progress in the House of Lords.^IAMENTARYAIRSThe Cabinet -Took note.:iGN 2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had met Mr Kirillin, the^RS Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, the previous day andhad taken the opportunity to put to him the views of the British Government,, 0* and of British public opinion on the trial of Professor Yuri Orlov, a,8&apos;or member of the Helsinki Monitoring Group in Moscow.    He had made it^**lov clear that the British Government was committed to detente and regarded the trial of Professor Orlov as a matter for the Soviet Government.Nevertheless there was no doubt that the trial had adversely affectedattitudes in the United Kingdom to detente and the atmosphere in whichdetente had to operate was worse than it had been for some time. TheBritish Government did not wish to see detente wrecked and he had asked mr Kirillin to convey to President Brezhnev both the views he had expressed and the atmosphere he had described.    He had also suggested,for onward transmission to President Brezhnev, his view that it would bedesirable for President Brezhnev and President Carter to meet as soon aspossible.    Mr Kirillin had taken these points well;  he had explained the background of the Soviet Constitution and the reasons for which the trial of professor Orlov had been thought necessary, and had undertaken to conveyhis remarks to President Brezhnev.The Cabinet -Took note.1
jJjMUM 3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER informed the Cabinet^DlNG that it had been decided to change the basis on which the Bank ofEngland&apos;s Minimum Lending Rate was determined, so that the rate wouldin future be decided by the authorities instead of being set by means of a formula relating it to the Treasury Bill Rate.The Cabinet -Took note.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State^CONDUCTORS for Industry (CP(78) 62) about alternative possibilities to those of KMOS^TED Limited for establishing manufacturing capacity for silicon chips in theUnited Kingdom together with an earlier memorandum by the Secretary of^oub State for Industry (CP(78) 59) on the proposals by the National Enterprise.e*ence: Board (not) for investment in KMOS Semiconductors Limited.; (?8) 19thfusions, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that his latest*u*e 5 memorandum (CP(78) 62) reported the results of the consultations whichat the Cabinet&apos;s request he had held with the General Electric CompanyLimited (G.C) and the International Telephone and Telegraph CompanyLimited (ITT) on their intentions to establish manufacturing facilities forstandard silicon chips in the United Kingdom.    G.C was well advanced in negotiations with the Fairchild Corporation and ITT had made a firmdecision to become involved in at least part of the semiconductorbusiness, but both projects would be on a smaller scale than those ofKMOS.    He had not revealed to either company the other&apos;s plans, but had told them that the not were considering a proposal in this field and he hadenquired whether that would affect their own intentions.    Both had saidthat it would not, and had indicated that they did not expect to be alone inthe field.    They had also confirmed that they would not be seekingGovernment assistance other than under the Industry Act.    However the managing Director of G.C, Sir Arnold Weinstock, had stressed theimportance of acquiring American expertise which he recognised wouldrequire very high personal incentives.    As a result of these discussions,he was convinced that the not&apos;8 judgment should be backed.    It was relevant that the members of the not had extensive experience in industryand commerce and were of high repute in their respective fields. Theywere unanimous in supporting the KMOS proposals and their judgmentwarranted the Governments support.    Since his discussions with GECand ITT, he had consulted  Sir Leslie Murphy, the Chairman of the not,as to whether the likelihood of their competition affected his judgment onthe merits of supporting KMOS.    He had confirmed that he had not in anyway changed his view.2
In discussion it was argued that the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;discussions supported the view that the KMOS proposal should be allowedto go ahead, as they had removed the fear that the multinational companiesmight abandon their plans if the not backed KMOS.    It should however beexpected that there would be criticism which the Government would have to answer, particularly about the proposed financial structure of thecompany, and there was also the danger that competitors might seeksimilar special incentives for key personnel on the lines of those proposedby KMOS.    If KMOS sought special encouragement, for example, throughpreference in the allocation of Government or International ComputersLimited contracts for their products, this would have to be refused. Onthe other hand, it was argued that a commercial case for accepting the substantial risks involved in supporting the proposal had not been made out.    The not&apos;s estimated market share for KMOS and the expectationsof G.C and ITT were probably in total too optimistic.    Someone was likelyto be disappointed.    Moreover, it was unacceptable that the plans madeallowance for capital gains of several million pounds for a number of keypersonnel, depending on the success of the venture.    The not should be told to re-examine the capital structure from this viewpoint.    In any case,the not&apos;8 proposals had been formulated without prior knowledge of the intentions of G.C and ITT.    Approval should not be given until they hadreassessed the KMOS project in that knowledge.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that althouph anumber of reservations had been expressed the Cabinet was ready to allow the NEBto proceed with its proposal for providing financial support for KMOSLimited, provided that the Board first reassessed the proposal in the lightof what was now known of the intentions of G.C and ITT to enter the field and reaffirmed its earlier judgment.    The Board was due to meet thefollowing day and the Secretary of State for Industry should ask them to reconsider carefully their position on this account.    If they confirmedtheir support for the KMOS proposal, they should be given authority to go ahead.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Industry to be guided accordingly.3
^USSION^HE&quot;&amp;ERLYfitmenttventualideationion5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services and the Minister for Social Security (CP(78) 60) towhich was attached a draft of Chapter 3 of the proposed discussiondocument on the elderly, which dealt with the equalisation of pension agesfor men and women.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that on 17 May the Home and social Affairs Committee (HS) had considered a draft discussion document on provision for the elderly in England and Wales, to be issued as the first stage in a comprehensive review of such provision with the aim of publishing a White Paper next year.    The text of the proposed document was approved by HS, subject to the reference of one particular matter tothe Cabinet, namely, whether in Chapter 3 of the document, whichdiscussed the age of retirement and in particular the different minimumpension ages at present prescribed in the state scheme for men and women,there should be a statement that the Government regarded a commonpension age for both sexes as being, in principle, the right long-termsolution.    The age of retirement had become a matter of increasingconcern in the Labour and trades union movements, particularly in the context of the current high rates of unemployment.    In the past thetendency had been simply to press for the retirement age for men to bebrought down to 60.    On the basis that for each year by which the maleretirement age was reduced there would be increased expenditure of 500 million a year, this would cost  2y billion a year. Latterlyhowever the pressure had been directed more towards setting a commonretirement age for men and women somewhere between 60 and 65. this had been a constant theme raised at the conferences on the new pensions scheme which he and the Secretary of State for Social Services had recently been attending.    The properal had not elicited any significantadverse response from women.    The Equal Opportunities commission had recently asked for a firm Government commitment to the objective ofa common pension age.    The draft European Economic Communitydirective on equal treatment for men and women in social security,although it did not cover pension ages at present, made it clear in itspreamble that it might be extended to do so.    In the debate in the Houseof Commons on that directive the Opposition spokesman,Mrs Lynda Chalker, had indicated that the Conservative Party favouredequality in pension ages, and called for inter-Party talks to draw up an agreed timetable.    It was therefore important that the Government should maintain the initiative on the question.    The proposed chapter in thediscussion document spelt out the cost implications of any move towards a common retirement age and acknowledged the potential difficulty indepriving women of their right to a full state pension at age 60. Itcanvassed the idea of a common retirement age somewhere between 60and 65 and stressed the importance of flexible arrangements for retire-ment on a reduced pension from age 60 onwards.    There could of course be no question of committing expenditure at this stage to equalisation of4
pension ages by any particular date.    But the Government would finditself in a weak position if there were no commitment in the document to working towards equalisation as a long-term objective.In discussion it was argued that unless a long-term commitment to eventual equalisation of pension ages was given in the White Paper, theGovernment would be open to attack as appearing to evade the respon-sibility of making up its mind on the question.    If the Government reallybelieved in sexual equality it could not be seen to be taking a line on pension ages which was inconsistent with that which it adopted in other areas of policy.    Younger women accepted the logic of the suggestion thattheir eventual retiring age might in justice need to be postponed.    It was unlikely that the commitment proposed in the discussion document would cause any substantial political controversy.    Against this, however, itwas argued that it would be wrong to make a commitment in the terms proposed when the Government would not be able to act upon it in the foreseeable future;  this could be seen as a form of deception, or it wouldresult in pressures to take action earlier than would on other grounds be wise.    The Conservative commitment could be presented as anirresponsible one.    It was arguable in any case that only on a pedanticinterpretation of the principles of equal opportunity was it desirable toprovide for women to have to work for up to three years longer than atpresent, particularly in the light of the present rate of unemploymentamongst teenage girls.    It would be politically damaging to commit theGovernment to supporting such a proposal.    Moreover a recent study of retirement behaviour by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveyssuggested that about half of men over 65 would have liked to continue working and there were increasing pressures against compulsory retirement atthat age.    Although many other countries had a common retirement age,this was set, for the most part, at 65 or above.    The Governments long-term aim ought to be to provide for the maximum flexibility in retirementages for both sexes, with the individual pension entitlement depending on anactuarial calculation made in each case.    To seek to lower the minimum age at which men became entitled to the state pension would be likely toreduce rather than increase the flexibility within the state scheme for those who wished to work as long as possible.    In any case the immediatescope for introducing a greater degree of flexibility in retirement ages was within occupational schemes, which could introduce changes independently of the state scheme.    For example, the pension age for miners was already being reduced by yearly steps;  the effect of announcing aGovernment commitment to eventual equalisation of pension ages would beto stimulate similar moves in other industries.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the cabinet agreed that the question of possible equalisation of pension ages for menand women should be fully discussed in the proposed document. Themajority of the Cabinet felt however that there should be no Governmentcommitment in principle to the eventual equalisation of pension ages as
expressed in the document.    The document should discuss the possibilityof providing individuals with the maximum flexibility of choice as to theage at which they could retire, perhaps by deriving pension entitlementfrom an actuarial calculation in each particular case.    The Minister for social Security should arrange for the relevant chapter of the discussiondocument to be redrafted on these lines and should circulate a revised version to HS for approval.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theMinister for Social Security to proceed accordingly.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(CP(78) 61) to which was attached a draft White Paper on the reform ofSection 2 of the Official Secrets Act 19U.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Ministerial Group on Disclosure of official Information (GEN 29) had considered a draft White Paper earlier in the year, and the draft circulated with CP(78) 61 included a number of amendments to take account of points made by members of GEN 29, andby the Labour Party&apos;s National Executive Committee (NEC) and theParliamentary Labour Party.    It was clear that some members of theNEC, which, he had now.heard, was proposing to send a deputation to him,would not be satisfied with a White Paper in its present form:  they wouldargue that the Labour Party&apos;s commitment in the 1974 Manifesto toreplace the Official Secrets Act by a measure to put the burden on thepublic authorities to justify withholding information went beyond a reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 and that it required freedom ofinformation legislation of the kind which operated in the United States orSweden.    Although he understood that suggestions had been made to this effect, he would be strongly opposed to extending proposals for reform to section 1 of the 1911 Act which dealt with espionage.    The draft white paper was in two parts.    The first part dealt with the reform ofSection 2 of the Act on the lines recommended by the Franks committee but with changes in a more liberal direction.    He believed that theproposals stood up on their merits and he would be ready to justify themto ParHament;  they were also consistent with what the Labour Party had said when in Opposition at the time when the Franks Report had originally been published.    The second half of the paper dealt with the related butseparate issue of open government.    This was likely to arouse strong feelings among a certain section of the Governments supporters, butopposition would be by no means universal, and the draft made clear thatfreedom of information legislation on the United States or Swedish modelwas   not as simple or as effective as many people supposed. Hef
therefore sought the Cabinet1 s agreement to early publication of the white paper in its present form.In discussion it was argued that, as it stood, the draft White Paper wouldgive rise to opposition in many quarters, and there was nothing to be gained from publication when there was no early prospect of being able tointroduce legislation.    The NEC were seriously concerned that theproposals fell so far short of the October 1974 Manifesto commitment;they would also attract criticism from the Trades Union Congress, andwould be strongly attacked by all sections of the Press.    Although therewere serious arguments in favour of the reform of Section 2 and much work had been done on the proposals, it was no longer practicable to stand onthe reform of that Section alone in the face of a development of publicinterest in the wider, related issues.    The draft paragraphs on freedomof information legislation in the White Paper set out its difficulties but none of its advantages.    A much more elaborate inquiry was needed intothe merits of such legislation before the possibility of introducing it wasturned down to the extent proposed in the draft.    Publication of the white paper should therefore be deferred until the whole matter had been reviewed afresh.    There were good reasons to give for a fresh review,including public concern about incidents arising from the use of theOfficial Secrets Acts and the recent reference to the Committee of privileges of the &quot;Colonel B&quot; issue.    No doubt the Government would be criticised for deferring publication in view of the previous commitments to this, but there would be considerably less criticism than if the document was published.    It was also argued that the proposals for the reform ofSection 2, set out in the main part of the draft White Paper, would themselves be open to serious criticism.    They took no account of theextent to which the practice of disclosing official information had become more free in recent years, and the practical effect of the proposals, bynarrowing and more clearly defining the field of information whichattracted criminal sanctions, could be more restrictive than the existing legislation.    It was arguable that the present system, which left theoperation of Section 2 very much to the discretion of the Attorney General,was the best that could be devised.     On the other hand, it was argued thatthere was a strong political case for publishing, without further delay, theproposals for the reform of Section 2.    There had been repeated and recent commitments to this, and the Government would be placed in a difficult and embarrassing position if an Election were held without theproposals having been published.    Moreover, it was unlikely that thearguments for and against the proposals would be any different after an election.    The Press had themselves been the main proponents of reform of the Official Secrets Acts, and the proposals were in fact more liberalthan the recommendations in the Franks Report, a point which could bebrought out more fully in their presentation.
In further discussion there was a wide measure of agreement that if theproposed White Paper were to be published, the part dealing with opengovernment and the possibility of a public right of access to official information should be recast in order to make it clear that this was a newarea of public policy which required fuller investigation before decisions could be taken;  and the document should indicate, without making any commitment to freedom of information legislation, that the Governmentwere actively examining this aspect.    It was also suggested that the paragraphs in the White Paper dealing with open government could make more of the extent to which the field of official information had alreadybeen opened up by the Government.    The record was good and should bede scribed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the cabinet were agreed that no decision on publication of the White Paper should betaken until the Home Secretary had seen the NEC deputation and been ableto take account of their views.    Nevertheless the Cabinet&apos;s preliminaryconclusion was that the proposals in the draft White Paper for the reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 were acceptable but that the passages on open government needed recasting.    The preferred line herewould be that the Government needed more time to examine fully the issues involved in, and overseas experience of, freedom of informationlegislation and the related question of the onus of proof;  and that theywere actively examining these matters and would announce their conclusions in due course.    After he had seen the NEC deputation theHome Secretary, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, should prepare a revised version of the draft White Paper, taking account of the Cabinet&apos;discussion, and circulate it to the Cabinet together with his consideredjudgment on how the matter should be handled.    The Cabinet could thendecide whether, and, if so, in what form, to publish the White Paper.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the HomeSecretary to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office25 May 1978
