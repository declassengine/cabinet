1. The Cabinet were informed *f the business to be taken inthe Kouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that cabinet at their meeting on 1 December 1977 had invited him to consider with a small group of the Ministers concerned the scope of a new clause for the Bill which would require an Act cf Parliament to approve Treaties extending the powers of the Assembly. Thegroup had reported in favour of a new clause which would cover all such Treaties and also any Treaties extending the Assembly1 aright to be consulted.    This would offer the most comprehensivereassurance to Parliamentary anxieties.    The clause would notcatch extensions of the powers and rights of the Assembly whichwere not the subject of Treaties.In discussion it was argued that the recommendation of the ministerial Group offered the simplest and most satisfactory solution.    There would be criticism if a distinction were drawn between the powers and the rights of the Assembly.    It was essentially a consultative body and it would be anomalous to excludeits right to be consulted from the ambit of the clause. extensions of that right would encourage pressure for extending its powers.There was a clear United Kingdom interest in preserving thepowers of the Council which were rooted in those of nationalparliaments against those of the other institutions which had a morefederal character.    It would be unacceptable to open the door to aright for the Assembly to be consulted, for example, about national policies.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong to require an Act of Parliament to approve Treaties which merely extendedthe Asbembly&apos;s right to be consulted.    Given the prospectivestrength of our Assembly delegation it would be in our interests to encourage the Assembly&apos;s influence against bureaucracy in theCommu.iity.    The Cabinet had previously taken the view that theneed was to improve control of the powers and not the rights of theAssembly.    The normal procedure for affirmative resolution ofboth Houses would be adequate for the latter purpose, and a requirement for an Act of Parliament would go too far to meetParliamentary opponents of the Bill without satisfying them. Itmight at the same time alienate supporters of the Bill, would give an unfortunate impression of hostility to the Assembly and would be inconsistent w*.th our attitude to open Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that by amajority the Cabinet agreed that the new clause should require an act of Parliament to approve Community Treaties extending thepowers of the Assembly, but not Treaties extending its right to be consulted.1PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSEuropean AssemblyElections bill previous reference:CM(77) 40thConclusions,Minute 1New Clause on thePowers of theA.s semblyPreviousReference::M(77) 38thinclusions,Minute 1
The Cabinet1.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, to proceed accordingly.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he was proposing a timetable motion on the European AssemblyElections Bill on Thursday, 26 January.    This was likely to cause a row, but without it the Bill would take up an undueamount of time in the Commons, which would have a bad effecton the atmosphere.    A timetable motion was essential in order;to ensure that the Governments other business in the current session could proceed.In discussion it was suggested that this motion would raisedelicate issues in the Labour Party and in the country, sinceofficial Party policy was against direct elections and theParliamentary Party were divided on this issue.    The motionmight also be criticised as untimely, coming so soon afterdirect elections had officially been postponed until 1979. Therewas a majority for the Bill in the House, and it should be left tothat majority to carry the motion on a free vote.On the other hand it was pointed out that the motion would allow8 days in all for discussion of the Bill in ihe House of Commons,compared with the six days which had originally been envisaged in the planning of the legislative programme.    The point of the motion was to ensure that the Government&apos;s business could becarried through, and Government backbenchers generally nowunderstood that without a timetable motion this Bill would take upa great deal more time, to the detriment of other government business of major importance.    Adequate time would be allowedto complete the debate on the method of election in NorthernIreland.    What had been said to other members of the community had been intended to extricate the United Kingdom from any commitment to take part in direct elections before we were ready,making clear that we could not now meet the original date ofMay/June 1978, but only preparing the ground for a decision to postpone the elections for a year, which had not yet been taken;there wore some in the Community who still hoped for elections in the Autumn of 1978, a manifestly unsuitable time for the UnitedKingdom.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the timetable motion was not concerned with any issue oi principle,but with the need to carry the Government1 s business, an aim whichall members of the Government should support.    It would be aserious psychological setback for the Government if the motion wasnot carried.     The Chief Whip was proposing a two-line whip forthis vote, and any Ministers who felt unable to vote for the motionwould absent themselves from the House in an inconspicuous way,for instance because of other engagements.The Cabinet -I.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatMrs Barbara Castle and other Labour backbenchers had put downan Early Day Motion, which had attracted well over IOC signatures,for the removal of Judge McKinnon, and had twice been to see himto press for a debate.    Feelings against the Judge were very strong,and supporters of the Motion represented a wide cross-section ofthe Party.    He was against allowing time for a .debate, which wouldhave to be on the substantive motion to remove the Judge, becauseof the prospect that the motion would be defeated and the vote wouldappear to exculpate the Judge.    But the delegation had not been persuaded by this consideration, aiid he had promised to report theirviews to the Cabinet.In discussion it wa3 suggested that this case raised a general issueabout the limits of acceptable behaviour on which it was important that the House as a whole should express a view, which the judiciary would take note ef.    The immigrant community had been much unnerved, not only by the remarks of the Judge but also by the subsequent comments made in many newspapers and by some members of the establishment.    But matters would be made worseif there was a debate on a motion which was then defeated, and a debate concerned with an individual Judge would not be the mostsuitable occasion for dealing with the wider issues involved. Therewas a need for a concerted look at these wider issues and at all aspects of the activities of the National Front, for instance in the schools.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said mat theCabinet agreed that a debate on the motion to remove JudgeMcKinnon would not be desirable.    Other opportunities might arisefor Ministers to make comments without impinging on theindependence of the judiciary, and the wider issues involved were3
appropriate, to a more general debate on race.     There might bea need for a study in depth of the activities of the National front and the progress thty were making in the country, and hewould himself consider how consideration of this matter could best be handled.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.4
FOREIGNAFFAIRSHorn of Africa2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat a potentially dangerous situation had arisen as a result of theintroduction into Ethiopia of large numbers of Russians and Cubansand of the build up of Soviet arms.    There were many complicatingfactors involved in the dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia which made it difficult to decide how best to react.    We were in contact with our three principal allies, United States, France and theFederal Republic of Germany, about what should be done. it seemed probable that at this stage the most useful   next step wouldbe for the matter to be taken before the Security Council.Southern AfiicaPreviousReference:CM(77) 40thConclusions,Vlinute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that wewere going through a difficult period in the discussions on bothNamibia and Rhodesia.    On Namibia he hoped it would bu possibleto arrange for the Foreign Ministers of the five members of *.heContact Group to meet with the South African Foreign Ministerearly in February in an attempt to resolve the oustanding problems.On Rhodesia Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe had now agreed to meet him in Malta for two or three days from 26 January.    They were makingdifficulties over our proposals because of their wish to dominatethe scene in Rhodesia during the transitional period.   Their aimwas to ensure that whatever the results of the elections, the PatrioticFront maintained control.    We clearly could not accept this. Theywere also urging us to condemn Mr smith s discussions about an internal solution.    He had so far been careful neither to condemnnor to endorse these discussions and thought it right to continue,to take this line.    It was not necessary to take up a firm positionuntil we saw what eventually emerged.    Meanwhile his aim wasto get Mr Nkomo and Mr Smith together within the framework of theUnited States/United Kingdom proposals, but Mr Nkomo had been taking an increasingly hard line and was more and more inclined to favour a military solution.    His fear was that the Rhodesians might at some point decide to rake military action with the intention of destroying Mr Nkomo&apos;s forces in Zambia.    This would create a verydifficult situation for us.    It was undeniable that there had been some progress on Rhodesia in the internal negotiations towards the concept of one man one vote, just as there had also been progress towards a settlement for Namibia.    But such progress as had beenmade was not in a direction which either the Patriotic Front orSWAPO found satisfactory to their interests.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while in India, Prime MinisterDesai had agreed to send a lettei urging that all RhodesianNationalist leaders should get together.    Their failure to do so wasa major obstacle to progress towards a Rhodesian settlement.The fact was that Mr Smith appeared ready to offer Mr Nkomovirtually what he wanted but Mr Nkomo was not prepared to take upthe offer, or even to enter into negotiations on it.
Middle east previous reference::M(77) 40thConclusions,lAinute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere were faults on both sides in the situation which had deve lopedin the negotiations between Israe? and Egypt.       Prime MinicterBegin&apos;s aim was to maintain the Israeli settlements in Sinai,defended by Israeli forces.    There was no possibility of this beingacceptable to the Egyptians and the hope must be that he would give way on this point.    A major objective was to get Jordan involved inthe discussions since this would be essential in the context of asolution to the problem of the West Bank.    What was needed was coolheads on the part of all chose involved and in this respect the contribution of the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, wouldbe specially helpful.DdiadeviousReference-:M(77) 37thinclusions,Minute 4THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePrime Minister&apos;s visit to South Asia had been an unqualified success which had enhanced our position and stiengthened the Commonwealth.The Cabinet were grateful to him for undertaking it.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would not repeat the longstatement on his visit to the Sub-Continert which he had made in theHouse on 16 January.    There were however two points which he wished to add.    The first was that, until he had talked to people inIndia, he had not realised the full extent of the damage whichMrs Gandhi had done to the countrv during the emergency.    This hadbeen very serious and the Janata Party, which formed theGovernment coalition, had the task of restoring the situation.Speaking for the Official Congress, Mr Chavan had said that ifMrs Gandhi was prepared to admit that the emergency had been aserious mistake the two parts of Congress could be re-united. Hehad reported these remarks to Mrs Gandhi who had said only that shedid not think there would ever be a need for another emergency ofthe kind she had introduced.    The second point was the impressionhe had received of the deep attachment in India to democracy, whichhad been strengthened by recent events.    When Ministers had discussed policy towards India last year the Foreign and CommonwealthOtfice had been inclined to take the view that India should take a rather lower place in our priorities.    He had then had doubts about this view and his conviction of the importance of our relations with india had been reinforced as a result of his visit.The Cabinet -Took note.6I
communityaffairsCommonFisheriesPolicyPreviousReference::M(77) 39thConclusions,vAinute 43. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that the Fisheries Council had not yet been able to reach full agreement but the Ministers were to meet informally in Berlin onFriday 27 January with a view to reaching a final compromise.This could then be adopted formally at a subsequent Council meeting.The issue turned on how, within the Treaties, our minimum requirements of exclusivity within 12 miles and preference between12 and 50 miles could be met.    Since the meeting on 27 Januarymight well be decisive, he would need before then the agreement ofhis Cabinet colleagues on the line to take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that at the ForeignAffairs Council he had been able to secure adequate assurances from the Commission about the way in which they would conduct the bilateral negotiations with steel-supplying countries but he hadreserved the right to return to the question at the February Councilif necessary.^lateral?radeNegotiationsTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that careful draftingto meet French electoral preoccupations had enabled the Council to endorse the Commission^ proposals, including an initial offer on tariffs, for entering the substantive phase of the GATT (GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade) multilateral trade negotiations.7151:118 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that,despite French and Italian reluctance, it had been possible to secure some flexibility in the terms for negotiation of a new trade agreementwith Cyprus, following the Cypriot Presidents approaches to thePrime Minister and other European Economic CommunityGovernments.    The Germans and the Danes had joined us in theCouncil in stressing the political importance of a satisfactory settlement.The Cabinet -Took note.7
Itin^^ 4* ^e Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (CP(78) 3) on the Green Pound.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat an immediate 5 per cent devaluation of the green pound was needed in the interests of pigmeat and beef producers and processors.Production and employment in these sectors were in decline as aresult of excessive monetary subsidies on our imports notably from denmark and Ireland.    A 5 per cent devaluation would be reasonablefor other sectors which would inevitably benefit from it. Defermentof a devaluation until the common price negotiations in April wouldnot meet the immediate need and would present tactical difficultiesboth in Parliament and in the price negotiations, where our partnerswould be likely to link our need for a devaluation with their *wndemands for higher common prices.    Discussions with the liberal party had suggested that their support for an immediate devaluationof 5 per cent would be conditional on a Government commitment to afurther increase of 5 per cent in support to producers over the next12 months.    This might come by way of a further devaluation of the green pound or an increase in common prices or possibly throughthe appreciation of sterling.    An amendment on these lines to theOpposition motion calling for a 7j per cent devaluation might therefore avert the risk of a defeat for the Government in theforthcoming Supply Day debate.In discussion it was argued that an immediate devaluation of the green pound would not solve the problems of the pigmeat sector andthat those of the beef sector were not pressing.    Additional support for cereals and sugar producers was net necessary.    It would be preferable if the timing of the devaluation could be varied betweencommodities and if devaluation could be deferred until the commonprice increases were known.    While a commitment to some additional increase in support over the next 12 months might be acceptable, its extent and timing should be determined by theGovernment, taking account of the interests of producers and consumers;  and should not be dictated by Parliamentary pressures.It would be a departure from the Government&apos;s previous policy to seek a devaluation greater than was implied by earlier proposalsof the Commission.    We would still be open in the price fixing to pressure for a further devaluation.    The Trades Union Congresshad urged the Government not to devalue and would not understandtoe apparent change in policy.    The Government would be held responsible for price increases in the Autumn for basic foodstuffsof importance to low income families at a time when the retail price index might be rising in any event.On the other hand it was argued that a defeat for the Governmentwould be damaging and there was no prospect   of securing Liberalsupport without some immediate devaluation.    The Government&apos;soverriding concern in accordance with its strategy for the CommonAgriculture Policy (CAP) must be to restrain common price increases.    It was therefore better to cater for the needs of our own8
producers by devaluation of the green pound than through highercommon prices.    It would be desirable to seek deferment of theapplication of the proposed devaluation to cereals and sugar but notat the price of delaying action in the pigmeat and beef sectors. by seeking an immediate devaluation greater than that envisaged earlierby the Commission we would be in a stronger position to resist afurther devaluation later.    While common price increases and the appreciation of sterling might make a further devaluationunnecessary it would be premature to exclude the possibility.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Agriculture rhould seek animmediate devaluation of 5 per cent in the green pound, though heshould endeavour to secure the deferment of its application tocereals and sugar.    He should continue to give overriding priority to the Government1 s strategy of resisting common price increasesespecially for surplus commodities:  and he should explain to theTrades Union Congress and to the Party that it was the government&apos;s policy to meet the requirements of our producers and processors inthis way rather than compromise on our strategy of holding down thecommon CAP prices.    The Lord President of the Council inconsultation with the Minieters directly concerned should prepare an Amendment to the Oppositions Motion covering not only theGovernment&apos;s immediate intention but also, without specificcommitment, the possibility ol a further devaluation or other measures to support producers later in the year;  and should seek tosecure the Liberals   support for ouch a Motion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food andthe Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.9
MORANDUM ON-HANGE CONTROL&amp; LIAISONMMITTEE5. The Cabinet had before it a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(78) 2), covering a draft of an informationpaper on exchange control which he proposed to circulate to theParliamentary Labour Party/Trades Union Congress liason committee.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his paper was intended to explain the reasons for the present exchange control system and for the recent changes which had been madein it, together with the arguments for and against any further relaxation.    It emphasised that the purpose of exchange control was to protect the balance of payments and the reserves, ratherthan employment or investment in the United Kingdom. while this was still an important r*le, we now had enormousreserves and a strong balance of payments.    Some parts of theapparatus which were damaging in the longer term, but whichhad been necessary to protect sterling in the short term, could now be dismantled.    We were obliged under the Treaty of Rometo abolish all restrictions on capital movements within theCommunity on 1 January 1978, but as the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy had agreed, he had been ableto persuade the European Commission to accept the continuation of most of the system for a further 12 months in exchange forsome relatively minor concessions.    Those changes would helprather than hinder our objectives.    The recently-abolishedexchange cortrolo had little effect on industrial investmentoverseas by big companies, wno could either finance this out ofretained earnings or from overseas borrowing.    But they weredamaging to smaller firms, who might be able to expand UnitedKingdom production and employment if they could invest over-seas, for example in distribution networks.    He was howeveragainst any significant further relaxation.    It was difficult toquantify the effect this would have on investment at home. the inquiry carried out in the early 1970s by Professor Reddaway wasnot conclusive on this point.    He was not convinced by the argument that the abolition of exchange control would help tokeep the exchange rate down.    Some who advocated this coursehad a strong financial interest in encouraging outward investment.He thought the paper struck the right balance and would help toremove a number of current myths about exchange control.In discussion the point was made that the paper did not sufficiently emphasise our treaty obligations to get rid ofexchange controls in Europe.    But it was suggested that thiswould be better deployed orally to the Liaison Committee,rather than spelt out in the paper.In further discussion it was suggested that while the paper hadunderstandably been drafted in a low key, it contained muchexplosive material and would attract considerable criticism from the Trades Union Congress (TUC).    It was altogether toofinancially oriented, and failed to concentrate on the issues oftrade and jobs.    While the original purpose of exchange control10CONFIDENTIAL
might have been to protect the exchange rate and the reserves, ithad come over the years to be associated with a correction ofimbalance in the British economy resulting from excessive exportof capital in the past.    The large surplus which North Sea oilwould bring to the balance of payments in the next few years meant that the export of capital would again be a problem.    Although thevalue of exchange control in preserving jobs in this situation mightbe a myth, it was a widely held one which needed a fuller answer.The Treasury &apos;Economic Progress report annexed to the draftpaper provided some of the arguments.    The Secretary of Statefor Trade had submitted a paper to the National economic development Council (NEDC) during 1977 about overseas invest-ment which set out further arguments.    That paper, or parts ofit, might also be annexed to the Chancellor&apos;s draft.    It might alsobe argued that much of the money which might be invested overseaswas held in sterling by foreigners, and that exchange control shouldbe imposed on non-resident sterling.    The argumerts against thisshould therefore be set out in the paper.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet agreed with the general lines of the paper which theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to circulate to the liason committee.    An additional paragraph should be added to deal withthe question of non-resident sterling, and the Chancellor of theExchequer should consider with the Secretary of State for Tradewhether to annex to it part or all of the NEDC paper on overseas investment and its effect on employment in the United Kingdom.He should also re-examine the rest of the paper, notablyparagraphs 17 ejid 18, to see whether the presentation could be improved in order to meet criticisms which might be expected fromthe Liaison Committee,    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should circulate a revised version of the paper to the Liaison Committee,sending it to Cabinet Ministers for information at the &amp;ame time.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.11
white paper onAIRPorts policy. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade (CP(78) 4) about a White Paper on Airports Policy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE TOR TRADE said that following thedecision in July 1974 to abandon the Maplin Project, a wide-ranging review of airports policy had been initiated. consultations with those affected by airport developments had been very extensiveover 600 organisations and many individuals had made representa-tions and Ministers, including those of the Department of the environment, had been involved.    A White Paper had been expected for some considerable time and before the Recess theHouse had been informed that publication would be likely early in1978.    A clear statement of policy was urgently required becauseof the need to set up a tribunal to consider plans for a fourthterminal at Heathrow.    Knowledge of the Government&apos;s policy would be essential to objectors in formulating their representations to the tribunal.    He was conscious of the need to mitigate as far aspossible the political embarrassment that a major policy statement on this emotive subject might produce, and every effort had beenmade to this end in preparing the draft in its present form. this had been particularly the case in regard to the sensitive problemof the future of Luton Airport on which the White Paper containedproposals.    As regards Stansted, the proposal was to postpone adecision on major expansion.    As for the airports in the highlands and Islands, he believed that on grounds of efficiency all these should be transferred to the British Airports Authority (BAA), but with the exception of Sumburgh in the Shetland Islands, he had subsequently accepted the view of the Secretary of State for Scotlandthat future arrangements for these should be left for the scottish assembly to consider.    But Sumburgh was vital to the oil industryand the rapid growth of traffic there presented managementproblems beyond the capabilities of the present operators, theCivil Aviation Authority (CAA).    He was therefore proposing thatthis airport should be transferred as quickly as possible to the BAA.In its present form, he considered that the draft had avoided to aconsiderable extent the potential political difficulties and he therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to the White Paper&apos;spublication.The draft was then considered section by section and the following main points were made in discussion:-a.       Types of Airport.    The categorisation of airports waslogical, but to refer to category C airports as &quot;local&quot; mightbe judged insensitive and could cause resentment in some areas.b.       Regional Diversion.    Although statistics showed that80 per cent of passengers terminating their journeys atLondon Airport had origins and destinations in the SouthEast, it was questionable whether this applied to chartertraffic, a substantial proportion of which derived from the
Midlands.    Less disturbance might be caused if some ofthis traffic were diverted frcm Luton to other airportssuch as Birmingham Elmdon which had better facilities.On the other hand, it was argued that London was undoubtedly the area to which tourists wanted to come, andit would be unrealistic to believe mat it would be easy to change this attitude.    The White Paper&apos;s conclusions had recognised as far as possible the limitations of Luton Airport.c. Gatwick.    It was questioned whether the substantialexpansion envisaged for this airport could be accommodatedwithout a second runway.    Careful technical assessmenthad shown that a single runway would suffice at least until1990 mainly because of the introduction of \vide-bodiedairliners.    This had meant that the limitation to ax. airport1 capacity had become that of the terminal facilities ratherthan the runway&apos;s.d. Stansted.     It was suggested that expaneion of thisairport beyond a capacity for 4 million passengers a year would be unjustified, becauce of the effect on a largelyunspoilt area which at present enjoyed the lowest level ofunemployment in the country.    Whereas expansion of thisairport made sense from the limited viewpoint of airportpolicy, it was an unattractive proposition from the planningpoint of view.    The White Paper, however, contained nodec?*6ion on Stansted because none was needed now.e. Leeds/Bradford.    The conclusion (paragraph 121)that &quot;the Government does not consider that the demand is such as to justify the massive expense which would be involved in the provision of a new airport in Yorkshire andHumberside&quot; would be bound to provoke a strong reaction inJiose areas.    Without changing the essential conclusion, itwould be desirable to revise the terms in which it was expressed.f. Newcastle and Tee side.    The conclusion in favour of developing Newcastle as a regional airport would bereceived with criticism on Teeside where industry was growing more rapidly.    There was general agreementhowever, with the White Paper&apos;s conclusion that Newcastlehad advantages over Teeside, though it was questioned whether with shortened rail journey times made possible bythe Highspeed Train substantial investment in facilitiescatering for international air services only 300 miles or sofrom London could be justified.    The text needed to be looked at again to ensure appropriate balance.
g. South Wales and South-West England.    The proposal(paragraph 130) that Glamorgan should have the role of acategory B airport, but Bristol only category C would alsoattract adverse comment.    Without changing the policy,attention should be given to the White Paper&apos;s presentationin anticipation of the criticism that it would provoke inBristol.h. Northern Scotland, Sumburgh.    Although a strong casecould be made out for transferring all the Highlands and islands aerodromes to the BAA, it was right, as the latestdraft of the White Paper recognised, for a decision to await tne setting up of the devolved administration. Thepolitical considerations which underlay this conclusionapplied however with equal force to Sumburgh as to otheraerodromes in the Highlands and Islands, and its administration should not therefore be transferred tc theBAA.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals contained in the dtaft White Paperwith the exception that Sumburgh, as well as the other highlands and Islands aerodromes, should remain the responsibility of theCAA for the time being,    A number of presentational points hadbeen raised in discussion and the Secretary of State for trade should seek to agree textual changes with the Ministers concerned.In the event of disagreement, reference should be made to him fora decision.    Subject to this, the White Paper should be published as soon as possible.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Trade to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office19 January 197814
