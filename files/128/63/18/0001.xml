1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in^S the House of Commons during the following week..&apos;:e THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a Motion by^ers&apos; Mr du Cann on Parliamentary control of the Executive would be debated on Monday, 15 July.    The Motion was in wide terms and anumber of controversial issues could be raised.    He proposed to reply himself, taking the line that the Government welcomed the debate and would consider all the points made, many of which were already under consideration by the Select Committee on Procedure.It would be a useful opportunity to defuse some of the controversywhich had arisen from the publication of the book byMr Leslie Chapman.    He hoped that it would be possible to dispose of the Motion without a vote;  the Government might have difficulty in opposing it since it would be supported by a number of labour members.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the debate should be handled in the wayproposed by the Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet -1. Took note.fiill THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Governmenthad suffered two defeats in the Committee Stage on the Finance Bill.The vote on the previous Monday on an amendment to reduce thestandard rate of income tax by lp. would cost  340 million; theprevious night&apos;s vote on an amendment to raise the threshold forthe higher rates of income tax would cost  105 million.    The firstvote had been lost by 8 votes as a result of an alliance of the conservatives and all the minority Parties;  in the second the WelshNationalists had supported the Government and it had been lost by only 2 votes.    It would not have been lost if two of the three absentMembers who could have been expected to support the Governmenthad taken part in the division.    There had been some misunderstanding over the amendment to raise the threshold forthe higher rates of tax:  it had the effect not only of raising thethreshold itself, but also of raising the bands for successive higher rates, and this point had not been appreciated by some of those whohad voted for it.    The Scottish Nationalists in particular wereembarrassed at the discovery that the amendment would be of thegreatest benefit to those with the largest incomes.    The situationt
had been further confused by the fact that the amendment wastechnically defective, though the Opposition had succeeded incorrecting this by means of a manuscript amendment after theGovernment had failed to adjourn the proceedings by 7 votes. TheOpposition had not been able to carry their other amendmentsbecause the Scottish Nationalists had voted with the Government.He proposed that the Government should not announce any plans to recover the losses at this stage, but should wait to see if any morewas lost as a result of amendments during the later stages of theBill.    The position could be further reviewed as the financial yearadvanced (the money would not have to be repaid until the autumn).Much would depend on the reaction of the markets:  they had generallyreacted calmly, and although Monday&apos;s vote had contributed to acertain amount of instability on Tuesday, Wednesday had been a goodday and the situation in the following week should be favourable, withencouraging news on other aspects of the economy.    It was possiblethat some of the losses might be recovered as a result of votes in later stages of the Bill, particularly if the Ulster Unionists and theScottish Nationalists were persuaded to support the Government.But it was important for the Government not to make concessionsfor that purpose or to appear vulnerable to blackmail. Controversialamendments were still to be debated on stamp duty on house purchase,on whisky, on capital gains, and on interest on repayment of incometax, but only the amendment on stamp duty involved a significantsum of money in the current year (about  35 million), and it was hoped that the Government would in any event win the divisionsconcerned.    The Government should be well supported in StandingCommittee.    It was however important that the Government shouldnot appear formally to have accepted defeat.    That would both be politically damaging and would increase the pressure on the markets.The Governments position should be that the losses could be recovered at a later stage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatin commenting on the situation Ministers should make clear their viewthat the Opposition had behaved irresponsibly and that theiramendments were calculated to help the best paid section of thecommunity.    The defeats did not affect the Government&apos;s basiceconomic strategy;  they would see how the situation developed and take appropriate action as necessary.    Comment should however bein moderate and carefully judged terms, as had the remarks in theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s own speech, to avoid an unfavourablereaction in the markets and not to invite the response that theGovernment should go to the country.    If the question of an earlyelection were raised, it could be pointed out that the devolution bills in particular were making good progress in Parliament and the2
Government did not intend to abandon them at this stage.    It was important, both on the Finance Bill and on divisions generally, forParty discipline to be firmly maintained and to guard againstmaverick ambushes in which the Opposition might attempt to defeat the Government at times when votes were not expected.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3
*EIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidAIRS that the new Government appeared to have succeeded in establishingcontrol throughout the country and, along with most other countries,^stan we had recognised it.    We hoped that it would maintain its non-alignment but it was now known to consist of 21 Leftists, of which12 were members of the Communist Party.    Iran and Pakistan were both anxious about what they saw as an extension of Soviet influence in the area.    But this fear of Russian expansion had existed sincelong before Soviet times.    Moreover, a similar fear had been expressed at the time of the Daoud coup in 1973.    It was too early to form a judgment on this point or, indeed, about the future prospects for the new regime.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that onesignificant factor in the tragic affair of Signor Moro&apos;s kidnappingand murder had been the firm attitude of the Communist Party onthe question of law and order.    This could well have the effect ofconsiderably improving their electoral prospects.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a number of Parliaments had paidtribute to Signor Moro.    He proposed to take an opportunity of doing this at Question Time that afternoon when he would say, in answer to a Question about his engagements, that he would be going to theItalian Embassy to offer his condolences.The Cabinet -Took note.4
^FActitr        3&apos; The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forJh URING Industry (CP(78) 56) and a memorandum by the Secretary of State foetaryEmployment (CP(78) 57) on an application for assistance by KirkbyManufacturing and Engineering Company Limited (KME).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that KME hadalready received  5.4 million of Government assistance and were seeking a further  2.9 million.    Their present application followedtwo refusals of assistance the previous autumn and was based on areport by PA management consultants.    The application had beenconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic and industrial policy the previous week where an overwhelming majority had considered that further help should not be given.    Since then theMinister of State, Department of Industry (Mr Alan Williams) andthe Minister of State, Department of Employment had discussed thePA report with the consultants concerned.    PA concluded that KMEcould break even this year and make small profits in the next twoprovided all their recommendations were carried out immediately.The essence of their recommendations was that production of nightstorage heaters and fruit juices should cease at once with 130redundancies;  that management changes should be made includingthe appointment of a new Chief Executive and a non-executivechairman;  and that a new model of ventilator should be marketedswiftly.    It was in their view absolutely essential that these proposals should be implemented without delay if KME was to stand a chance ofmaking a trading profit.    Department of Industry officials weresceptical about the report.    They concluded that there was no chanceof KME achieving real economic viability.    The Industrial DevelopmentAdvisory Board (IDAB) who had considered the problems of KME ona number of occasions over the last 3j years had unanimously,including the trade union members, advised against further assistance.    If the Government gave more help IDAB would exercise its statutory right to require him to account for the government&apos;s decision to Parliament.    In addition the Department of IndustryAccounting Officer had made it clear that he would require a writtendirection authorising the necessary expenditure.    On the other handsome members of the Ministerial Committee on Economic andIndustrial Policy (El) had felt that despite this advice further helpshould be given to KME.    In particular it had been argued that the costs of closure and the costs of continuing support were about thesame.    That was true in the immediate future but since theCo-operative appeared to have no prospect of long term viabilityfurther aid would postpone closure costs rather than avoid them.The majority of El had also thought that the political effect of furthersupport would be damaging.    Whilst it was arguable that the closurewould be politically embarrassing on Merseyside this was notnecessarily the case.    There were other companies, for exampleWestern Ship Repairers, who were facing closure with similar numbers
of redundancies and whom the Government could not help.    It wouldbe difficult to justify the robust line taken in resisting pleas forintervention in this case and over the closure of Speke if KME werefurther assisted.    Beyond this the overall credibility of theGovernment1 s industrial policies was at stake.    Two separateinjections of finance had been made into KME in 1975 and 1977 andon each occasion the Government had said they were for once andfor all.    Moreover KME had itself acknowledged, on the occasion of the last injection of Government funds, that they would have to manage without further assistance.    Taken together with the lackof a real economic case for further support, these considerationsoutweighed the admittedly powerfully social arguments that theGovernment could not allow a further 645 redundancies in an area where unemployment was already in the region of 20 per cent.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theprevious decisions to refuse help should not prejudice properexamination of the present case.    There were two new importantmaterial factors.    First there was a surprisingly promisingindependent assessment of KME&apos;s prospects.    PA consultants were of high repute and would not lightly risk their reputation. Secondthere had been a serious deterioration of the employment situation on Merseyside.    There had been a series of closures of whichSpeke II was the worst but by no means the only case.    The recentdeputation from Liverpool which had met the Prime Minister hadbeen told that the Government would play its full part in bringingnew prosperity to the area.    That assurance would look thin if, inthe face of the promise offered by the PA report, the Governmentwas to abandon the Co-operative.    PA reported that the KMEmanagement had improved but it needed further strengthening.They were prepared to second two managers to the Co-operativefor this purpose.    They also noted an improvement in morale andthe tempo of production.    These were important changes in thecompany1 s position but even more significantly the market forKME&apos;s main product - radiators - was forecast    to expand by26 per cent in the current year.    Alternative capacity in theUnited Kingdom could not expand sufficiently to meet this extrademand and if Kirkby closed imports would be stimulated. beyond this KME now had a new air conditioning product which wasacknowledged to be the best design of its kind available. production costs were low and the Co-operative was on the verge of signing a production and marketing agreement with a second company whichwould ensure a market.    The costs of allowing the factory to closewould approach  1.8 million in the first year and would be about 1.45 million in the second and subsequent years so long asunemployment remained at a high level.    The cost over two years was roughly equivalent to the sum now requested by KME.    If thePA report proved correct and KME traded at a profit the costs of6
support would be less than the costs of closure.    In short cabinet had to decide whether it was better to spend money on keepingworkers unemployed or on maintaining them in productive jobs.In discussion it was argued that there was an economic case for support.    The factory, from 1966, had had a disastrous history.When KME had been established in 1974 its future had been bleak.But the workers had been ready to take responsibility for the enterprise^ future.    Although they still had problems they had madesubstantial progress in turning that situation round.    The PA report was an illustration of this success.    It forecast a modest tradingprofit.    KME&apos;s prices were keen in a growing market.    Their presswork profits were good.    They had secured Ministry of Defenceapproval for their press work which could boost this side of thebusiness.    They had secured a promise of a reduction in ratesfrom the local authority.    PA was prepared to inject new management.Moreover PA were a reputable company which did much government business and their reputation was at stake.    The Governmentshould consider two main criteria - whether there was a saleableproduct and a ready market.    KME had both and this distinguishedthem from other companies facing closure, such as Western ShipRepairers for whom there was no possibility of orders.    The sums involved were very small compared to those of the support given tothe private sector.    On the other hand the economic case was weak.If it were persuasive KME would be able to secure support from theNational Enterprise Board or the banks.    The PA report should betreated sceptically.    It had been considered by the Government1 sown experts, IDAB, who included trade unionists, and they had advised unanimously against support.    The Government should beprepared to stand by that judgment rather than risk large sums in supporting the reputation of a firm of consultants.    Moreover whilstKME might generate some modest profits they would not becomeviable in the sense that these would be sufficient to finance their future development.    And they would only make profits if all thePA recommendations were accepted.    This would not be the case.KME had received the report during March and had taken no stepsto implement even its first stages.    The existing directors did nothave a good record putting into practice consultants advice.    It wasnot accurate to compare the costs of giving more help now with the costs of closure.    The company was not viable in the longer term and further costs, either in the form of further support or in termsof a postponed closure have to be incurred in due course. Therewere competitor firms some of whom had already received financialassistance who were keen to develop in the same market.    To supportKME would unfairly undermine employment in other parts of thecountry.
In further discussion it was argued that the credibility of theGovernment&apos;s industrial policy was at stake.    The Government had made considerable progress on its reputation for firm andstraightforward dealing in industrial matters combined with a concern to protect those adversely affected by the need to follow realisticpolicies.    To give further support would be politically counter-productive for three main reasons.    First the inevitable andvociferous lobbying on behalf of the Co-operative would not reflect the views of the majority of people both on Merseyside itself and elsewhere.    Second workers in firms in comparable straits wouldnot understand why KME was singled out for special assistance.They would resent the Government giving more help.    Third theGovernment had twice given help on a once and for all basis and had since twice refused assistance.    To give a further tranche of aidagainst the advice of IDAB would be to risk a political scandal. TheScottish Daily News co-operative had been refused assistance whenit had become clearly non-viable and the time had now come withKME when the Government had to say no.    On the other hand theGovernment had to consider its position among its own supportersboth on Merseyside and more generally.    Traditional support in liverpool had been badly eroded by the Liberal Party - although thiswas an historical phenomenon - and in the present case given the PAreport it would not be difficult to justify distinguishing KME. Toallow Speke to close was part of the general strategy needed to revivethe flagging fortunes of British   Leyland.    In the case of WesternShip Repairers there were simply no orders to be had.    KME wasdifferent from both these cases.    If support was not given the PAreport would be quoted against the Government.    There were alsoother wider political factors.    The Government should not neglectits concern to promote industrial democracy, particularly when itwas about to publish a White Paper on that subject.    Nor should itbe afraid to support co-operatives and face the criticism that it was doing so just because they were co-operatives.    It was not to theGovernments credit that the manner of support for co-operativeshad involved assurances about once and for all support that were not used when giving selective assistance in the private sector;  nor thatthe prospect of such support appeared, uniquely, to move AccountingOfficers to request written directions.    Nor was it relevant that togive support to non-viable co-operatives would arguably damage theco-operative concept.    Inevitably co-operatives tended to grow outof crises.    There was after all no enthusiasm for introducing theco-operative concept into profitable companies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thecentral issue was the purpose of continuing support.    This had tobe considered against the need to maintain the Governmentscredibility not only politically but also in relation to its economic policies generally and the industrial strategy.    It had been argued8
that to allow KME to close was to take the easy course and that theCabinet should choose the more difficult course of supporting theco-operative against the advice of officials and IDAB, and againstthe inevitable criticism that the Government would be bowing to political pressure.    However it was Cabinet&apos;s clear view that theGovernment could offer no further assistance to the co-operative.There was no economic case for further support and the politicalneed to maintain credibility, to avoid being seen to single out KMEas a special case and to maintain firm and sensible economic policies in the face of political pressure outweighed the socialarguments in favour of giving more help.    To give more help wouldbe to take the soft option.    There would however be inevitablepolitical protests and the PA report would be cited in evidenceagainst the Government.    In defending its decision therefore theGovernment should take the line that if the PA report was sopersuasive and KME was, against the best advice available, a viableconcern it was free to seek further financial backing through thebanking sector or the National Enterprise Board.    The Secretaryof State for Industry should make this point in communicating theGovernment&apos;s decision to the KME directors.    He should take carehowever to avoid giving the impression that the Government wassteering KME towards the National Enterprise Board or that theGovernment had any expectation that the National Enterprise board would be able to assist the company.    The decision had been a difficult one but Cabinet should have in mind the fact that thecountry1 s improved economic situation was directly due to the verydifficult and harsh economic decisions which the Government hadbeen prepared to take over the past two years.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Agreed that the Government should make nofurther financial assistance available to KirkbyManufacturing and Engineering Company Limited.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Industry toinform the Directors of the Kirkby Manufacturing and engineering Company Limited accordingly and pass onthe Government&apos;s view that if they considered theCo-operative to be viable they should feel free to seek further commercial funding or assistance fromthe National Enterprise Board.9
ttRpAl^        4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forthe Environment (CP(7S) 53) and a memorandum by the Secretary oftvj0u State for Prices and Consumer Protection (CP(78) 55) on the courses;r-n open to the Government in pursuing metrication in the face of16th Parliamentary opposition.te l ns* THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that whilst there were differences of judgmentbetween himself and the Secretary of State for the Environment the outcome of their proposals would be essentially the same.    In his view the Government1 s metrication programme was right both for industry and for the economy.    But it was now clear that the so called&quot;compulsory&quot; metrication orders could not be assured a passage through Parliament.    Cabinet had to consider how to accommodatethis situation without inviting the charge that the Government hadbeen subjected to a humiliating defeat.    This was difficult becauseover the past three years the Government and the country had become increasingly committed to metrication.    Industry inparticular would react adversely to a change in the direction ofpolicy since many sectors had already taken steps towardsmetrication on the understanding that retailers would be forced toadopt sales in metric units in due course.    Beyond this manyinstitutions, for example, Age Concern, had invested considerableamounts of time and money into ways and means of making the changeeasier to understand by particular groups, such as the old. Initiallyhe had thought the best course would be to court defeat on onecontroversial order and then to explain the Government&apos;s positionfully to the country.    He no longer believed this was politicallysound.    The Government should instead make an immediate announcement covering three main points.    First it should reaffirmits stated belief in the metrication programme, in the use of metricmeasures in wholesaling and retailing, and in achieving existingtarget dates.    Second it should make known its understanding of theapprehension over the penalties originally intended to support thelegislation and its intention to suspend any suggestion of compulsionat the point of sale to the consumer.    Third the Government should announce its intention to encourage industry and commerce to stickto the programme but without legal sanctions.    If these efforts wereto lead to confusion the Government could consider again thearguments in favour of a mandatory programme at the point of retail sale.    His proposed course was designed to make the best ofa very difficult situation.    There was no way in which criticismcould be entirely avoided.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that no significant policy change was involved.    The main thrust towardsmetrication, by manufacturing industry, by packers and manydistributors had already been achieved.    There were however a10
limited number of measures the use of which at the point of retailsale had a direct impact on the public at large.    The compulsory-metrication programme would make it unlawful for retailers to sellunpacked goods in imperial measure.    This was plainly wrong. Itwould also invite defiance.    The Government should make it clearthat it intended to retain these few measures not just temporarilybut indefinitely.    This was consistent with our Community obligations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet endorsed the view that the metrication programme shouldcontinue but that there should be no legal sanctions against thecontinued use of imperial measures for non-pre-packed goods at thepoint of retail sale.    They broadly agreed with the approachsuggested by the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection, which should be announced by means of an answer toa written Parliamentary Question.    In explaining the change of policy the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection should asfar as possible make a virtue of the maintenance of imperial units atthe point of retail sale while encouraging industry, wholesalers, and retailers to stick to the original programme.    He should avoidemphasising the role of Parliament in frustrating the Government&apos;intentions although in accounting for the change to industries and organisations like Age Concern which had invested money in preparing for metrication he could admit that this was the reality of the situation.The Lord Chancellor had expressed the view that some legal difficulties over our Community obligations might remain and thisshould be clarified in consultation with the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theSecretary of State for Prices and consumer protection to be guided accordingly.11
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(78) 54) about proposals for a mandatory scheme of awards for 16-18 year olds in full-time educationwhich had been considered by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee (HS).THE HOME SECRETARY said that HS had twice considered theproposals set out in paragraph 3 of his memorandum and, although there was a majority in favour of them on the second occasion, theCommittee were not unanimous about their merits or whether itwould be right to announce a commitment to a mandatory schemeof awards at this stage.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury hadreserved his position on any commitment in advance of theconsideration of other claims in this year&apos;s public expenditure survey.On the other hand, the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General wanted to start consultations with localauthorities as soon as possible about the details of a scheme so that legislation could be prepared for next Session, and she felt that these consultations must proceed on the basis of a definite Governmentcommitment.    The level of awards and other details of any schemeneed not be settled by the Cabinet at this stage, though he thought itfair to add that the costs of a mandatory scheme were likely to be ofthe order envisaged in the Secretary of state  s proposals which amounted to about  100- 120 million a year, with about  78 milliononce-and-for-all capital costs.    This was on the basis of weeklyawards of  9 for further education (FE) students and  7 for schoolpupils.    HS had also considered an alternative scheme providing forlower awards of  6 for FE and  4 for school, but this would attractonly 12, 000 additional participants and would be less cost-effective in those terms.    However, the issue of cost-effectiveness was itselfone on which differences of view had been expressed in HS. Therewere some who argued that the benefit for poorer families generallyshould be taken into account in assessing the value of the scheme.Doubts had also been raised about the value of continued education,particularly for those living in deprived areas, but the Secretary ofState had dispelled these, in his own mind, by explaining that at least50 per cent of the additional participants could be expected to followvocational courses, particularly in FE.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that her proposals must be consideredagainst the background of a very generous system of awards fothigher education (HE) in this country whereby 50 per cent of studentswere on full awards and only 20 per cent received no award; by contrast, the abysmally low level of support for 16-18 year olds infull-time education under the present arrangements which in 1974-75,before local authorities started to cut back on discretionary grants,averaged  125 per annum for only 2. 5 per cent of school pupils and12
 79 per annum for 36 per cent of FE students;  and the widedisparity in staying on rates corresponding to family income levels.In consequence of this sharp difference in educational support policy the proportion of children from professional families going into HEwas increasing.    Of the estimated 45, 000 additional participants(48, 000 if Scotland were included) under her proposals, a largeproportion could be expected to follow vocational courses in FE, andthere was also increasing provision for such courses in the schoolcurriculum whose value, however, would be diminished if the pupilsconcerned did not then continue their education in FE colleges.The difficulties of encouraging young people to stay on in full-timeeducation had been compounded by the rule which enabled young people to attend part-time courses for 3 days a week without losingsupplementary benefit and by the Manpower Services Commission(MSC) programme which provided a weekly allowance of  19. 50.Evidence was beginning to come in of students wishing to leave FEcolleges and rely on the social security system;  and representations from the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, the Trades UnionCongress, the National Union of Students and other bodies had all,while supporting the MSC programme, expressed concern about the anomalies which it created.    She therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;8authority to discuss proposals for a mandatory scheme on the basis ofa 90 per cent specific Government grant.    These discussions wouldbe without commitment to the level of maximum awards, although sheconsidered that it would be unrealistic to contemplate amounts lessthan  7 for FE and  5 for school pupils and she personally believedthat her proposed figures of  9 and  7 respectively were right. Theintroduction of mandatory awards at HE rates, involving an additional cost of  20 million per annum, for students aged 19+, who were atpresent eligible only for discretionary awards, was a logical, butnot a necessary, consequence of her proposal for the 16-18 age group.To await the outcome of this year&apos;s public expenditure survey beforeconsulting local authorities would mean that the Government could not reach firm decisions until the middle of next year since to announcedecisions without consultations would invite opposition from localauthorities.    EquaUy, there would be no point in consulting localauthorities except on the basis of a definite commitment to a mandatory scheme since she had already had exhaustive discussions with them and other bodies about the problem in general terms.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that there would be nodispute about the desirability of encouraging more children fromfamilies of manual workers to stay on in full-time education. Thequestions to be decided were whether the Secretary of State&apos;sproposals would achieve this objective, and to what extent; andwhether they should have priority over other expenditure programmes.On the first question, the reasons why children left school were thesame as those which persuaded them to be absent from school before13
reaching school leaving age;  and money would not persuade the vast majority to do otherwise.    On the second question, housing andother environmental factors were at the root of the problems ofdeprived areas, and much expenditure was needed to solve them.It was also doubtful whether the contribution of the educational system to the industrial well-being of the country would most effectively be increased by a mandatory scheme of awards. a means-tested scheme would inevitably lead to pressures for the relaxation or removal of the means test, and there would bepressures from local authorities for the 90 per cent specific grant to be increased to 100 per cent, as was already the case in other fields.    80 per cent of the awards would go to those staying onanyway and, to the extent that continued education involved financialhardship for poorer families, the social security system existed inorder to deal with it.    On the other hand, if the purpose of the awards,as the Secretary of State had indicated, was educational, it was relevant that the proportion of 16-18 year olds in full-time educationhad increased from about 20 per cent in 1964-65 to 30 per cent lastyear and was forecast to be 33 per cent in 1981-82;  the effect of theproposals would be to increase this figure by a further 2 per centonly.    He saw no reason why the Secretary of State should not discussher proposals generally with local authorities but without committing the Government in any way or pre-empting other claims on the public expenditure programme.In discussion there was a wide measure of support for the principleof a mandatory scheme.    It was argued that, although parentalattitudes and the attitudes of children themselves to full-timeeducation, particularly school education, were undoubtedly a factor in determining the choice, the attitudes of parents of working classfamilies was changing in favour of continued education and, largelyas a result of the Labour Governments reform of the secondary education system, the children of those families had developed amore natural feeling for school; it was also the case that ethnicminorities were particularly anxious to advance the education oftheir children.    The main outstanding problem was the lack offinancial support, and this had been compounded by the level of allowances offered in MSC schemes for those who were unemployed.These schemes were likely to continue, and there would be aparticular difficulty about the lack of financial support in FE for those who, having completed a MSC course, wished to return to full-time education.    In any event, a high rate of youth unemployment,which was likely to persist for some years, was in itself a sufficient reason for the immediate introduction of a system of mandatoryawards for full-time education.    Furthermore, there was a closerelationship between lack of education and inability to secureemployment;  and there was at present a serious shortage of skilledoperatives of all kinds.    The proposals would therefore contribute14
to the Government&apos;s industrial strategy, but it would be important that vocational courses for those staying on should be properlyorientated towards the needs of industry.    Moreover, even if a mandatory scheme had only a fractional effect on the numbers stayingon, it would provide a thrust in the right direction which, apart fromeasing the financial burden of poorer families whose children alreadystayed on, might give further impetus to the benefits of raising theschool leaving age which had not so far been a universal success.On the other hand, it was argued that the proposals were based onan unrealistic view of the school system and of the attitudes of young people to it.    There was evidence of a profound alienation amongstyoung people from school education which also, for a time, souredtheir attitude to full-time education of any kind.    The real problem was to find means of encouraging young people to return to full-timeeducation when their experience after leaving school had inclinedthem, as was often the case, towards this.    It was also argued thatthere was no strong public feeling in favour of a scheme of financial support for 16-18 year olds.    Parental attitudes, as well as theattitudes of the children themselves, were still the most criticalfactor in decisions to leave full-time education, although it might be true that ethnic minorities retained a higher regard for it. Theinterests of people in deprived areas generally would be much betterserved by spending  100 million a year directly on the inner urban areas programme which would double the present expenditure.In discussion of the timing of any Government commitment to a mandatory scheme, it was argued that it would be a great mistake to enter into a commitment in advance of the public expenditure survey, without knowing, in the absence of consultations with localauthorities, whether such a scheme would produce the educationalbenefits claimed for it, in terms both of the additional numbersstaying on and of the relevance of educational provision which couldbe made, or what the Government&apos;s other priorities for expenditure would be.    Educational expenditure would already be increased as aresult of the decisions taken before the Budget whose effect would carry on into subsequent years, and available resources would bereduced by the recent amendments to tax provisions in the finance bill unless the effect of these amendments was reversed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, while a majority of the Cabinet strongly supported the principle of a means-tested scheme of mandatory awards for 16-18 year olds, considerablereservations had been expressed about the wisdom of entering intoa commitment in advance of consultations with local authorities, whowere in the best position to judge the educational effects of any scheme,and of this year&apos;s pubHc expenditure survey.    The Secretary of state should therefore enter into consultations with local authorities on thebasis, which could be publicly stated, that the Government were15
anxious to have more children staying on in relevant education, thatthey would be ready in due course to commit themselves to a mandatory scheme which would ensure this, but that the details and timing of such a scheme would need further discussion.    The aim off the consultations with local authorities would be to discuss thedetails, scope, nature and likely take-up in terms of newparticipants of a scheme;  and also the relevance of the coursesavailable to the needs in working life of those who might be attractedto stay on.    There would be no commitment to the scale and cost ofany scheme.    Similar consultations would be undertaken by theSecretary of State for Scotland.    The two Secretaries of state should report the outcome of the consultations to the Cabinet in due course for decisions to be taken.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General and the Secretary of State forScotland to proceed accordingly.16
Kd benefitq child tax-owancesf olderI^oub fence:?78) Uth^teisions,6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP(78) 52) by theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary,Treasury about the withdrawal of Child Tax Allowances (CTAs) from april 1979.    The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum(CP(78) 29) by the Minister for Social Security about the uprating of child Benefit.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that when the cabinet decided on 4 April that Child Benefit should be increased by 70p from november 1978, as the first instalment of an increase to  4 from april 1979, they had agreed to defer a decision on whether CTAsfor children over 11 as well as those of children under U should be withdrawn in April 1979.    Withdrawal of the CTAs for older children would substantially complete the phasing in of Child Benefits, save800 staff for the Inland Revenue and reduce the net cost to theExchequer in 1979-80 by some  50 million.    Both he and the chief secretary, Treasury were agreed that it was right to withdraw theCTAs for all children in April 1979 when the main increase in ChildBenefit would be made.    As the Cabinet had previously recognisedwithdrawal of the CTAs for older children in 1979 would cause anapparent drop in net benefit for some famiHes as compared withtheir position in November 1978 when Child Benefit would be increasedwithout any accompanying change in the CTAs.    But most familieswould be better off following the April 1979 changes as compared withtheir position in April 1978.    He recommended that the cabinet should endorse the recommendation in CP(78) 52 that CTAs for allchildren should be phased out as from 1 April 1979.In discussion it was argued that the recommendation in CP(78) 29gave insufficient weight to the arguments against abolition of allCTAs from April 1979.    If the recommendation were accepted therewould be many families who would stand to lose even though ChildBenefit was increased.    This would be particularly so for thosefamilies in receipt of housing benefits.    If they received housingbenefits families on the basic rate of tax with children under 16 would stand to lose between 9p and 19p per child and those with childrenover 16, between 28p and 39p, on the basis of current housing benefitthresholds.    Up to 40, 000 families might stand to lose. Peoplelosing money as compared with their position immediately prior to april 1979 would not look back to April 1978 and see that, over theyear, they had gained.    It would be better, accordingly, to defer theabolition of CTAs beyond April 1979 especially as the housingthresholds could not be adjusted until the following November.    On theother hand it was argued that most people would have regard to theactual cash payment made to them in Child Benefit in April 1979 andwould see that they were better off than a year earlier.    To put offabolition of CTAs for a further period would simply postpone the17
problem and it was best to make the change at a time when a sizableincrease in Child Benefit was being made.    The Cabinet had accepted when they decided on a two stage increase in Child Benefitrather than a single stage that some families might be worse offnext April as compared with the previous November and thisconsequence should not be challenged now.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas common ground that almost all families would be better off inApril 1979 as compared with April 1978 even with the abolition ofCTAs for all children from April 1979.    The changes in child benefits in November 1978 and April 1979 had to be regarded as asingle package.    The Cabinet accepted that the abolition of CTAsfor all children should go ahead from April 1979, notwithstanding the financial loss this would mean for some families as comparedwith their position in the period November 1978 - March 1979.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office11 May 197818
