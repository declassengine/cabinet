1. The Cabinet discussed specific proposals for additional expenditure. Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.s2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Report of the SelectCommittee on Race Relations and Immigration had been published on 21 March, and the Conservative Party intended to make a policystatement about immigration on the following Friday, 7 April. Hewould like the Cabinet to take a political view on whether theGovernment should take the initiative by making an interim statementof its own, which could coincide with the publication of the Controlof Immigration Statistics on Thursday, 6 April.    He had asked theLord Chancellor and other Ministers to meet and prepare the draftof a possible statement which the Home Secretary could make in theHouse of Commons on 6 April, and this draft had been circulated to members of the Cabinet with the Lord Chancellor&apos;s minute of3 April.    He was grateful to the Lord Chancellor and to the other ministers concerned for the work which they had done, at short notice and during the Easter Recess.In discussion it was recognised that an interim statement would bean unusual response to a Select Committee&apos;s Report, and by making it the Government might appear over-an:cious;  it could be argued that since a full response would be needed later, the Government ought to reserve its arguments and not appear to provoke unnecessarycontroversy.    The attitude of the Governments own supportersought also to be taken into account, some of whom would wish theGovernment to react strongly against the Report.    On the other hand,considerable advantage was seen in making a clear and positivestatement which would place the Government&apos;s views on record andto which the Conservatives would have to react.    Without it thediscussion in the weekend papers would be dominated by the viewsof the Conservative Party;  if a statement were made the Government&apos;sown views would also be given prominence.    It would be an importantopportunity for the Government to influence the future course of the argument, including the Supply Day debate which the Conservativeswere likely to demand in the near future.    The Government could now argue that numbers were under control and criticism could onlycome from political or mischievous motives;  and that the mainemphasis should in future be on improving race relations.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the majority of the Cabinet agreed that a statement shouldbe made to coincide with the publication of the Control of ImmigrationStatistics on Thursday, 6 April, and the Cabinet should now considerits terms.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of this part of their discussion.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the draft which he had circulated attempted to give a clear and positive statement of theGovernments policy but there were difficulties, particularly overthe possibility of further major immigration from the Indiansub-continent.    He had referred in his minute to his discussionwith the Law Officers and with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary about the negotiations which had taken place with theGovernment of India from the late 1960s onwards, and the resultingcommitment to accept, if necessary, further significant numbers ofUnited Kingdom Passport Holders (UKPH) who were now in thatcountry.    In view of this commitment it could rot be said that the argument about numbers was now over, and in dealing with it theGovernment would need to avoid playing into the hands of its critics,and at the same time to avoid alarming the immigrant community.For this reason the draft could not be absolutely clear or expliciton this aspect of the problem.It was pointed out in discussion that the contingent problems offurther immigration from the Indian sub-continent had always been recognised, but the Indian Government had no wish to press thematter, and nothing would be gained by parading them.    There wasa risk that the Conservatives might seek to embarrass theGovernment by demanding a system of quotas, as a result of whichthe full extent of the contingent liability - which the Conservativesthemselves had accepted when in office during the early 1970s -might become known.    It might be suggested to the Conservativespokesman on Home Affairs (Mr Whitelaw) that neither the conservatives nor the Government could benefit from an argument which brought these details to light, but it was difficult to see whatthe Conservatives would have to lose by raising the quota issue andthe problems for the Government should not be insuperable. there might be an argument with the Indian Government, but total numbers -about 39, 000 - were manageable and a system of quotas, if adopted,would not necessarily involve more than an arrangement underwhich the United Kingdom Government would meet its remainingobligations to UKPH over a period of time as the Labour Governmenthad done when the problem first presented itself in the late 1960s.The Governments own position should however be that quotas werenot necessary since numbers were now falling.2
In further discussion, the view was expressed that the statement should be made shorter and more positive, and that it should be set in the context both of the Select Committee&apos;s Report and of the newstatistics with their indication of falling numbers.    It should alsoemphasise the importance of good race relations, and pick up other points from the Select Committee&apos;s Report as necessary.    It should concentrate on a limited number of important issues and not attemptto deal comprehensively with the Report.    It should be in terms which would bo readily intelligible to the general public and itshould have regard to the anxieties both of the indigenous populationwho feared the prospect of further large-scale immigration, and ofthe immigrant community who feared further restrictions on their right to bring their families to this country and on their normalrights as citizens once they had become settled.    Points to be covered might include not only the fall in primary immigration, batalso measures to prevent immigrants from taking illegalemployment, the Government&apos;s opposition to a register of dependantsor cf a system of quotas, and its rejection of the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations for limiting the admission of children to those under 12 and for an independent inquiry into a system of internalcontrol.    It would however be important not to appear too negative,or coo enthusiastic, in responding to the Select Committee&apos;srecommendations:   some of the Governments own supporters werecritical of them but they were unanimous and reflected serious concern in the country as a whole.    There should be :.o reference in the statement to the inclusion of a question on ethnic origin in the1981 Census (which would need to be further considered), or toimmigration through the Republic of Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that in theHome Secretary&apos;s absence in the United States, the Minister of State,Home Office, would prepare with the help of the Secretariat, afresh draft of the statement, taking account of the points made in discussion, and would circulate it for final comment as soon aspossible.    The Home Secretary would then make the statement inthe House of Commons on Thursday, 6 April.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Ministerof State, Home Office, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office4 April, 19783
^CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT36COPY NOCABINET9thLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 11th Conclusions Minute 1Tuesday 4 April 1978 at 10. 30 am^JjI-t- The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,&apos;^      ^B        Treasury (CP(78) 39) on possible public expenditure measures^G^y involving a call on the Contingency Reserve, which might be announced in the context of the Budget.    They also had before them!fevi0Ue an earlier paper (CP(7B) 30) by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, on&apos;^enCe *-le same 3ubject, and a minute from the Secretary of State for theHome Department to the Prime Minister dated 23 March, dealingxlug. *** with the frequency of payment of unemployment and supplementary\e s0ns. benefit.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the key question was how much of the Contingency Reserve of  750 million for1978-79 should be committed and announced in this early stage inthe financial year.    In his paper he proposed expenditure totalling 375 million, which would leave a further  375 million unallocated,compared with  550 million at the start of the financia.1 year 19V7-78.To commissioners much more than this would damage the credibilit/ of theGovernment&apos;s economic policy.    The Budget forecast assumed a shortfall  on expenditure during the year of just over  ? billion, butthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had taken this fully into account in deciding upon the tax changes he intended to introduce. his proposals lefi no room for an increase in Child Benefit in November.An increase of 70p then would cost  165 million.    If this were approved, together with the other measures he suggested, 540 million out of the Contingency Reserve of  750 million wouldhave been allocated before the year began.    There were a number of potential claims on the Reserve, including a possible Christmasbonus and further support for industry, quite apart from thegenuinely unforeseeable contingencies.    It was only prudent toleave a sizeable margin for these.    For that reason, despite the strong political pressures, he would prefer not to increase ChildBenefit in November.
In discussion, it was recalled that public expenditure in 1977-78had fallen short of the published forecasts by almost  4 billion,despite decisions taken during the year which had been intended touse up virtually the whole of the planned Contingency Reserve. Therehad been a number of reasons for this.    Seme of the new programmeshad been slow in starting.    The introduction of cash limits had probably depressed local authority expenditure.    There had been anumber of unexpected developments, like the better price realisedfor the British Petroleum (BP) shares which the Government hadsold during the year, reduced debt interest payments as interest rates fell and the change in the method of providing finance forexport credits.    It was inevitably difficult to forecast expenditureon very large programmes like the National Health Service and theDefence Budget, even comparatively late in the financial year. Butspending Ministers *rere always reluctant to admit to an emergingunderspend.    In 1978-79, the treasury s latest estimate was thatthere would be an underspend of just over  2 billion.    There was always a risk that this would be exceeded, but equally it might provean overestimate.    It was unlikely that the special factors wh^ch had operated the previous year would be repeated.    There were howevermany volatile elements in the forecast.    Nationalised industryborrowing from the Government, being the residual of very largeexpenditures and receipts on trading activities, were particularlysubject to fluctuations.    Slippage of a few weeks in some large capital programmes could jirrilarlv produce substantialunderspending.    However, the forecast of  2 billion underspendhad been taken into account in forming the Budget judgment. Itwould be published in the Financial Statement and Budget Report(the &quot;Red book&apos;) at the time of the Budget.    To use this underspendingas justification for additional public expenditure, going beyond the published Contingency Reserve figures, would therefore be to doublecount.    There was no question of concealment;  all decisions to incur expenditure from the Contingency Reserve would have to be reported to the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons.But there was a case for considering the Contingency Reserve as areservoir, into which underspends would be surrendered as they wereidentified, and from which new expenditures would be authorisedduring the year.    On this basis, the size of the Contingency Reservemight be considered as  2, 375 million.    Yet the Chief secretary proposed to authorise additional expenditure of only  37 5 million.The remaining  2, 000 million had been allocated to tax reductionswithout full consideration by Cabinet, although there had beenextensive discussion of the possibilities.    There was also a case,in the longer term, for getting away from annual public expendituretotals towards a series of rolling targets which could be updated duringthe year.    For the moment, however, confidence factors and theneeds of the 1978 Budget meant that additional expenditure must be confined within the published totals for the Contingency Reserve.2
In further discussion of individual expenditure programmes, thefollowing points were made -i. Agreed items.    Expenditure totalling  193 million,on employment measures, European Economic Community(e.c.) contributions, the thermal reactor programme, anddevolution and other minor items, had already been charged to the Contingency Reserve.    The relevant cabinet committees had similarly approved, subject to Cabinetagreement, expenditure on measures to help steel closureareas and on a postponement in the increase in the school meals charge in the autumn of 1978.    Additional expenditurehad also been considered bilaterally between thedepartmental Ministers and the Chief Secretary, treasury on measures to relieve storm and flood damage, on law andorder, and on school milk, all of wnich were listed in Table 1of the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper (CP(78) 39).ii. Education capital expenditure.    A new estimate ofthe planned expenditure during 1978-79 levealed an additional cost of  40 million in England and Wales;  this was arecalculation of the cost of an existing programme and not an additional bid.    The figures for Scotland were being discussed separately between the Secretary of State and theChi ef Secretary, Treasury.iii. Future training and retraining.    The Chief secretary had proposed to agree to additional expenditure of  2 million,but an increase of  2.5 million for the United Kingdom e.s awhole would allow similar additional expenditure in scotland to be undertaken.iv. Energy conservation.    The Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy (EY) had already approved expenditureof  2 million on assistance to industry for energy conservationmeasures.    A further  25 million approximately could be spent on grants to private householders to insulate their homes properly, but it had not been possible to agree onthe details of a feasible scheme which could be announcedbefore the Budget.    While there was a good case for anearly announcement, it would be a mistake to make this until a scheme was available, because to do so would deter privatehouseholders from making improvements at their own expense and risk bringing insulation work to a standstill.This item should therefore remain as a possible call uponthe Contingency Reserve to be considered later in the year.
v. Environmental services.    The Chief Secretary had proposed expenditure of  20 million, in place of a much larger bid put forward by the Secretary of State for the environment.    It would include expenditure on politically -attractive items such as further factory building by theDevelopment Commission in depopulated rural areas and the clearance of derelict land in the inner cities.vi. National Health Service.    The proposed allocation of 25 million was not adequate to allow significant improvementin the Health Service throughout the United Kingdom. Theproblems had not been overstated, as the discussion in theHome and Social Affairs Committee (HS) had recognised.The expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State, asdeveloped in discussion with the Central Policy Preview Staff andthe No. 10 Policy Unit, would allow a useful real increase in thestandard cf service.    It wouid be carefully monitored toensure that it actually reached the recipients of services,and created new jobs for nurses, doctors and ancillary grades.The expenditure would create additional demand in the1979-80 and later years which would have to be considered as part of the Public Expenditure Survey during the summer.It was impossible at this stage to estimate accurately the costof any scheme of assistance to vaccine-damaged children,and this should be excluded from any total approved by theCabinet, and left as a potential claim on the contingency reserve.vii. Child Benefit.    The previous rates of Child Benefitwere  1 for tne first child and  1. 50 for subsequent children.    The changes now coming into force would increase this to  2.30 for all children from April 1978, involvingincreases of  1. 30 for the first child and cf 8Op for subsequent children respectively, but this extra benefit wouldbe counterbalanced by reductions in child tax allowances.Nevertheless families as a whole would be better off as aresult of these changes.    A decision to increase benefits to 4 in April 1979 would implement the Government&apos;scommitment to phase out chila tax allowances and replace them by Child Benefits.    The issue for consideration was whether to anticipate this further increase by bringing in a 3. 00 rate from November 1978, an increase of 70p fromthat date.    This would be politically attractive, and would bring benefit to 7 million mothers and 14 million children.It would pre-empt any attack by the Opposition, who were making wild promises of increases in Child Benefits. Itwould meet the wishes of the Trades Union Congress and ofthe Labour Party, although it would not go so far as many of4
the Party would wish.    The addition would count ao public expenditure but was really a substitute for increases inchild tax allowances which would otherwise have beeninevitable in this Budget.    It would assist the average family,but woidd do nothing, of itself, to eliminate the poverty trap.An increase in November would coincide with the annualpensions uprating.    It would come into payment at a timeof maximum political impact.    It would be much betterreceived than an announcement in the 1978 Budget of anincrease effective from April 1979, which would be too remoteto have any real effect.    However, because of its effect onfamilies presently receiving means-tested benefits whichwould be withdrawn at the seme time, the change would have little or no effect on the very poorest families, although no-one would actually lose as a result of the change. the presentation of the change would therefore need very great care:  it would have to be made clear that no-one lost as aresult of the change, although not everyone could expect to gain, and that the increase of 7Op in November was a first instalment of the April increase;  without this, the increasein April 1979 would appear to be too small to offset tnephasing out of child tax allowances at that point. Althoughan increase in November wouid involve a further large callon the Contingency Reserve, and leave little room for manoeuvre later in the year on other items, tnc politicalcase for it was overwhelming.viii.     Pensions uprating.    The size of the increase inNovember 1978 was governed by the statutory requirement that long term rates should rise by at least the amount of theincrease in earnings over the past year, while short term benefits should increase by an amount at least sufficient tocover increases in prices during the same period. Thelatest forecast of earnings was 11.43 per cent, which indicatedan increase in the basic single pension to  19. 50.    It wouldhave been politically attractive to introduce a  20 pension,which would have been sufficient to offset increases in earnings of as much as 14. 3 per cent, but the cost of doing this was prohibitive.    There was however a strong argument for increasing the single pension to  19. 60, equal to anearnings increase of about 12 per cent, leaving a emailmargin for error.    Short term benefits should increase byat least 6.8 per cent to offset the latest forecast increase in retail prices, and it might be prudent to increase this further to 7 per cent.    Pensioners and other long termbeneficiaries had gained most over the last few years, andtheir standard of living had been protected at a time whenaverage earnings in employment had fallen substantially.
Short term beneficiaries had at least received protection against increases in prices over the same period. Thepolitical case foi further increases was not thereforeoverwhelming.    The long term benefits should therefore be restricted to 11.43 per cent and announced in the Budget,while the exact amount of the increase in short term benefit should be decided in discussion between the Chief Secretary,Treopury, and the Secretary of State for Social Services.ix.        Unemployment benefits.    The discussion in HS(reported in the Home Secretary1 s minute of 23 March 1978to the Prime Minister) indicated general agreement with theproposal to i educe the frequency of payment of unemploymentbenefits from weekly to fortnightly.    This followed theCabinet decision in July 1976 to undertake pilot trials of sucha scheme.    These trials had been entirely successful.Despite criticism from the Civil Service unions, there hadbeen very little complaint from the beneficiaries themselves and no Press criticism.    The trials had covered some60, 000 claimants at 36 offices.    If the scheme were nowintroduced generally there would be annual savings of 4- 6 million, with considerable reductions in 6taff, butthe cost of introducing the scheme (involving payment one week in advance) would be a once-for-all  37 million which couldnot be accommodated within the expenditure programme ofthe Department of Employment.    Against this, it was argued that an announcement of a national scheme would be widelymisunderstood and could be presented as unduly generousto beneficiaries.    When HS considered the question, theyhad not understood that supplementary benefits would be covered by the new scheme, although this misunderstandinghad since been corrected.    There was a risk of adversepublicity.    While the scheme was acceptable in principle,its introduction would be better deferred till another year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now agreed upon the additional expenditure to be announced in the Budget.    They had noted that decisions already taken on employment measures, e.c. contributions, the thermalreactor programme, and devolution and other minor items, totalling 193 million, had already been charged to the Contingency reserve for 1978-7q.    They confirmed the decisions which had already beentaken in the appropriate Cabinet Committees on measures to helpsteel closure areas (up to  13 million in 1978-79), on storm andflood damage and sea defences (up to  4 million), on law and order(up to  3 million) and the postponement of the school meals charge( 62 million) and on school milk ( 6 million).    They noted that arecalculation of the capita? expenditure programme of schools in 
Englanc and Wales would cost a farther  40 million.    They agreedto proposals on teacher training and retraining at a cost of 2. 5 million (as opposed to  2 million proposed by the chief secretary) and of  2 million on the industrial energy conservationscheme.    Any further expenditure on energy conservation should remain as a potential claim on the Contingency Reserve when afeasible scheme had been devised.    They agreed to expenditure of 20 million cn environmental services and of  50 million (as opposedto  25 million proposed by the Chief Secretary) on the national health Service.    This sum excluded any later expenditure whichmight be necessary on vaccine damage.    The Secretary of State for social Services, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should arrange for this expenditure to be carefully monitored toensure that it achieved the purposes intended by the Cabinet. ChildBenefit should be increased by 70p from November 1978, to beregarded as the first instalment of an increase to a basic rate of 4 from April 1979.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should discussthe best presentation of this decision in his Budget speech, includingthe need to explain why some people would receive no net gain, withthe Secretary of State fcr Social Services.    Long term social security benefits should be uprated by 11.43 per cent from november 1978, bringing the single pension to  19. 50 with corresponding increases in other rates.    These increases shouldbe announced in the Budget speech.    Short term benefits should beincreased at the same time, by an amount between 6.8 per cent and7 per cent.    The exact figure should be discussed further by theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, but should involve no greater claim on the contingency reserve than was necessary to meet the statutory requirement.The Cabinet were in favour of the proposal to pay unemployment and other benefits fortnightly in future, but they agreed that it wouldbe wrong to make the change this year.    These decisions meant thatthere was very little left in the Contingency Reserve for 1978-79.All future claims on the Reserve would therefore have to beconsidered very rigorously indeed.    The total effect of these measures, taken together with the tax changes which the Chancellornow proposed, was very impressive indeed.    It was absolutely essential if the Budget was to have its maximum political impact,that the individual decisions should not be allowed to leak out one at a time.    Accordingly, he would arrange for circulation of theCabinet&apos;8 conclusions on these items to be deferred until after theBudget.    Members of the Cabinet should be careful not to discuss these decisions, with junior Ministers, political advisers or senior officials in their own Departments.    Any necessary consultationabout the presentation of the decisions on social security should be confined to the very minimum of those who needed to be involved.7
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of theidiscussion by the Prime Minister and invited all ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet office April 1978
