^MENTARY      1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thej. ---*o vauiii^i, fc *****&quot;  w* v. ------House of Commons during the following week.^nentary THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a Motion toe8e refer to the Committee  on Privileges the matter of publication bythe Press and the Droadcasting authorities of speeches in parliament would be debated on ?. May.     The Motion would be tabled in his ownname;  there were several other Motions on the Order Paper,demanding references to the Committee on various grounds, but hisMotion was in wide terms which would enable the Committee onPrivileges to consider all the points which had been raised.    It wasnot directed against any particular Members although the events ofthe previous Thursday would no doubt be mentioned in the debate. Ifthere were no reference to the Committee which satisfied all theMembers who had tabled motions, the subject would continue to beraised during Business Questions and on other occasions wheneveropportunities occurred.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed it was right for the Motion to be tabled and that itshould be in the name of the Lord President of the Council;  it shouldnot lead to a difficult debate.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.^ an Areas      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that\ **0me although the Inner Urban Areas Bill had completed its Report StageJj0^e Assistance  and Third Reading the previous evening, delaying tactics by thef$ot s*ng Opposition had prevented progress on the Home Purchase Assistanceiu^*0n and Housing Corporation Guarantee Bill.    Arrangements would havee   Bill to be made for the remaining stages of the latter Bill to be taken on av.Sc separate occasion.    In addition the Government would need to findn e:  Special     time for a half-day debate on the Special Development Order for^ent wind scale:   the 40 days allowed for the existing Order would soon runout, and a debate should if possible be arranged within the nextfortnight.8j . &apos; It was pointed out in discussion that half-day debates were difficult&apos;lijg. to arrange and there was always a difficulty that they would be lost if\% ^0lls* the other business arranged for that day overran its time.Discussions on the timing of a debate on the Special DevelopmentOrder were taking place through the usual channels;  the debate would not necessarily have to take place before the existing Order ranout of time, but a debate within the 40 days would demonstrate thatthe House of Commons was expected to take a real decision on
whether the development should take place or not.    A debate outsidethat period might give the impression that the Government wasattempting to manipulate the situation in order to impose a decision which it had already taken.    Progress on the Home PurchaseAssistance and Housing Corporation Bill had been frustrated by anunexpectedly long debate on the Inner Urban Areas Bill which hadpreceded it:   the large number of amendments to be debated had prevented the Whips from moving the closure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that discussions would continue through the usual channels about the timing of the debate on the Special Development Order;  time wouldhave to be found on a future occasion for the Home PurchaseAssistance and Housing Corporation Guarantee Bill to complete itsremaining stages in the House of Commons.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.b and THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that following theGs discussion in the Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial-vi^ Policy (El) on 24 April, it was proposed to proceed with the draftt^s Weights and Measures Act 1963 (Potatoes) Order if a Parliamentaryfyv majority could be obtained for it.    This was a permissive Order&apos;.t]u , , which provided for both imperial and metric measures to be used inV;te j0U8* parallel for the sale of potatoes from 1 May;  it was the least* controversial of the four Orders which were now under consideration.Discussions would take place through the usual channels and with theGovernments own supporters to obtain the greatest possible support for the Order;  it was relevant that Sir John Methven, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, had recentlyintervened with the Opposition to press them to take a more favourableattitude towards all four Orders.In discussion, it was explained that although in terms of public opinionit would not be sensible to start a programme at the present timeleading to the compulsory conversion to metric measures, thiscourse was rot open to the Government:  the options were either toproceed with the programme, or tc stop it half way with all theconfusion and criticism that were bound to follow.    There weregenuine anxieties among many members of the public which had to betaken into account, especially for those who found metric measuresdifficult to understand, but the metrication programme had beenmoving forward for a number of years and metric measures were already in widespread use, for example in agriculture. Mostthoughtful opinion and most cf the interests directly concerned werein favour of ic    As regards the draft Order on potatoes, this was apermissive order which would not make the use of imperial measures
illegal and although it prepared the way for a time when metricmeasures would be compulsory there would be a fresh Order and afresh opportunity for Parliamentary debate at that stage. Thetrade were ready to start selling potatoes in metric measures fromthe following week and there would be serious difficulty if they were unable to do so.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the Government should proceedwith the Weights and Measures Act 1963 (Potatoes) Order if itcould be assured of Parliamentary support.    They recognised thatthe balance of the practical arguments was in favour of continuingwith the metrication programme, but the instinctive dislike of many people for compulsory orders which would prevent the use offamiliar measures had also to be recognised.    If any Memberwished to have the prospect of further compulsory ordersdiscussed in Cabinet, notwithetanding the conclusions of the ElCommittee, then appropriate arrangements would be made.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.3
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat if developments over Namibia resulted in agreement on asettlement in the next few weeks, this could involve a major changein the political situation in Southern Africa.    The South african government had made a substartive move by accepting the Five Powerinitiative.    The South West African People&apos;s Organisation (SWAPO)had not yet given their answer.    If they rejected the initiative thiswould lead to familiar arguments and pressures in the United nations in the face of which we should have to stand firm.    If howeverSWAPO were to accept the Western initiative and with it the proposalsfor elections and security arrangements, this would be an importantstep.    A settlement in Namibia vould have particular significancefor the United Kingdom because of our interest in uranium from theRossing Mine.    Movement over Namibia would make it more likely that the South Africans would be prepared to put stronger pressure on Rhodesia and it was possible that it might lead to their making a start on dismantling the institutional basis for apartheid. Withthese prospects it would be a mistake to embark on economic measures against South Africa at the present time.    Things couldhowever go wrong and there were some elements in SWAPO whowould try to disrupt any progress towards a settlement. Neverthe-less there were some grounds for hope.    There was bound to be agood deal of discussion and lobbying in the United Nations and thedespatch of the Secretary General&apos;s special reprosentative to Namibiawould have to be authorised by a resolution of the Security Council.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he didnot accept the assumption, which had been made in Press reports,that the reply from the Salisbury Four to the proposal for an all-Party conference amounted to an indefinite rejection.    It was more likely to be the case that they wanted more time to make the internalsettlement work first.    There was little chance of arranging ameeting in the next few weeks, but it was unlikely that there would beany significant change in the situation in that period. PresidentKaunda of Zambia&apos;s talk with the Prime Minister during his forth-coming visit tc London would be important because of the influence which President Kaunda had on Mr Nkomo.    An important issue which was under consideration was that of the level of british representation in Salisbury.    He would like to send a more seniorrepresentative to maintain contact with the Salisbury Four. the americans agreed with this and he hoped it might be possible to make an announcement soon.    But if the Executive Council demanded, as acondition, the right similarly to send a representative to London, thiswould have to be rejected.    He also thought it right to resist pressure from the Patriotic Front to declare the African organisa-tions participating in the internal settlement illegal because of theirassociation with the Smith regime.    If this were done, members 
of these organisations would be unable to continue to come freelyto this country and it was clearly important that this freedomshould be maintained.The Cabinet -I.      Took note.THE PRIME MINISTER said the Anglo-German meeting earlier in the week had been well worth while.    There had been usefulbilateral discussions between a number of Ministers.    He had hadtalks with Chancellor Schmidt both tete-a-tete and with the twoForeign Ministers.    It did sot appear that the Federal Chancellor&apos;sideas for using part of the currency reserves in Europe to bringabout greater monetary stability had advanced very much since their earlier discussion in March.     Such ideas would hold romeattractions for Pre sident Giscard of France.    Chancellor Schmidthad made it clear that he would resist public pressure for earlymoves to stimulate further growth in the German economy but it seemed likely that he would be willing to do something as part of thenegotiations at the Bonn Summit in July.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was currentlyengaged in difficult negotiations in Luxembourg to decide onCommon Agricultural Policy prices.    As agreed by the ministerial Committee on European Questions the Ministers chiefly concerned would meet later in the day if it seemed likely that a finalpackage was emerging.    The Belgian Government was pressing fora greater increase in the milk price.    It seemed likely   that weshould be able to secure satisfactory terms for the continuation ofthe Milk Marketing Boards.The Cabinet -Took note.5
4. The Cabinet considered a draft White Paper on industrial democracy circulated under cover of a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP(78) 48) and a memorandum by the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General (CP(78) 49), reporting on consultations with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and making recommendations on possible changes to the text of the White Paper to take account ofthose consultations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that proposals for a draft White paper on industrial democracy had been considered several times by the ministerial Committee on Economic itrfci: jy (EY).    At their meetingon 12 April they had generally endorsed a draft of the White paper which was, with minor modifications, the version now circulated tothe Cabinet.    The proposals in the White Paper fell into two distincthalves:   the proposal for a statutory right for employees to be consulted, through their representatives, on major proposals affecting them, and the statutory right to minority board representa-tion which would come at a later stage.    Both matters would be covered in the same legislation but it was important to keep the twoapproaches separate.    The legislation would also provide companies with the option of a two tier board and the right to employeerepresentation would be on the top board, though companies wouldnot be obliged to adopt the two tier structure and could concedeemployee representation on a unitar/ board If they so wished. the objective was to encourage the development of voluntary arrange-ment as far as possible with the legislation available as a fallback.Legislation would not force employees to move down the road ofindustrial democracy if they did not wish to do so.    There was no prospect of legislation this Session and the objective of publishing the White Paper was to put on record the Governments own views onthe ways in which progress could be made and to provide an acceptable basis for constructive discussion with both sides ofindustry.    There was accordingly a need to avoid putting forward proposals which would antagonise one side or the other to the point that discussion would prove impossible.   The proposals put forward in the draft White Paper would undoubtedly be criticised by both the tuc and the CBI but, subject to the outcome of discussion on thepoints raised in the CP(78) 49, he thought it would be possible to getthe right balance and to carry discussions forward towardslegislation.    The objective should be to publish the agreed documentas soon as possible and before the main trade union Conferencesbegan.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the meetings with both the CBIand the TUC had been less hostile than she had expected. Therewere, nevertheless a number of points where the TUC and the CBIwould like to see changes to the draft and she had identified these in her paper.    The CBI continued to be opposed to any right of6
representation on boards but they accepted that the Governmentcould not compromise on this.    Beyond that they were concerned at the lack of recognition of the role of non-trade unionists andfeared that the proposals would make thepe employees into secondclass citizens.    For the TUC on the other hand a main issue was theextent to which the proposals did not stick rigidly to the singlechannel approach under which rights in relation to industrial democracy wculd be strictly limited to members of recognisedtrade unions.    The TUC wen. also much concerned that therw was no reference to parity of board membership and about the long delayfollowing legislation before the right to board representation would come into effect.    On the other hand the CBI did not want any changes on these points.    Both the CBI and the TUC, for differentreasons, were disposed to prefer a new national body, such as theIndustrial Democracy Commission proposed by Bullock, to theaddition of new statutory functions in relation to industrial democracy to the existing work of the Advisory Conciliation and arbitration Service (ACAS).In general discussion of the White Paper it was argued that,particularly as there was no immediate prospect for legislation,the aim should be to publish proposals which would command thesupport of the Labour Party and the Trade Union movement ratherthan to hold a balance between the differing views of the CBI and the tuc.    Opposition from the CBI could be expected but every effort should be made to reduce the prospect of criticism from the TUCwhich could be much more damaging politically.    It was, however,also argued that the most important need, if industrial democracy wasto be advanced, was to keep discussion going and not totally toalienate either side.    Nor was it true, in any case, that the present draft tried to deal even-handedly between the views of trade unions and management.    From the trade union point of view it provided a major step forward in terms of a right to board representation towhich the CBI were still opposed in principle.In discussion of the text of the White Paper it was argued that paragraph 11 should be amended along the lines proposed in Annex E.This would provide for an appeals mechanism to test whether a JointRepresentation Committee (JRC) met the two criteria proposed inparagraph 11 of the draft as circulated concerning its representativecharacter.    These criteria required the JRC to be broadlyrepresentative of the inaependent recognised trade unions in thecompany which in turn had to be broadly representative of the employees as a whole.    The proposed revision at Annex E wouldprovide a right of appeal for a urion on whether the JRC was properlyrepresentative of the unions in the company and would provide afurther right of appeal for any substantial homogeneous group of employees on whether the JRC was representative of employees as awhole.    The appeals procedure would provide a necessary checkagainst the exercise of statutory rights   by a non-representative body.    Against any amendment to paragraph 11 it was argued that7
there would be an extremely strong trade union reaction against theproposal to give a right of appeal to non-trade unionists whichwould be seen as an attack on the principle of the &quot;single channel&quot;,and would create practical problems in terms of drafting thelegislation, and could discourage the formation of JRCs.    It wasalso suggested that companies might encourage employees to appeal against the composition of a JRC in order to frustrate its work.Trade unionists would strongly oppose any proposal which appearedto give non-trade unionists the right to interfere in trade unionprocedures.    It would be unwise to provoke this oppositionespecially as proposed amendments to paragraph 11 would not meetthe CBI wish for non-unionists to have a right to participate in theJRC.    On the other hand strong support was given to the proposalfor individual trade unions to have a right of appeal if they felt theJRC was not properly representative of all the unions in a company.It was suggested that most firms employing 500 or more were alreadywell unionised so that the problem of a JRC unrepresentative of theworkforce as a whole would arise infrequently.In discussion of the proposal to provide for the option of a two tierboard structure with the right to board representation linked to thepolicy board it was suggested that experience incther cour.tries had shown that such supervisory boards exercised only a weak influence over the affairs of companies.    It was questioned whether it was right to abandon the unitary system proposed by Bullock. in response it was said that the TUC had at first wanted a two tierstructure and although they had now abandoned this stand theywere not opposing this aspect of the Government&apos;s proposals.Experience elsewhere did not in any case support the view that the supervisory board had little power.    The Annex to the White Paperexplained that in the United Kingdom it would have clearly defined and important functions in relation to control of the company. Theadoption of a lower tier management board responsible for day today decisions will however help to make board representation of employees more acceptable to companies.    This was important.Legislation would not mean that employee representation would haveto be on the policy board as the company and the JRC could agreethat employee representation should join a unitary board.In relation to the proposal in paragraph 26 of the White Paper thatthere should be a delay of four to five years between legislation andthe coming into force of the statutory right to board representation,it was argued that this length of time would cause a loss of momentumin the development of industrial democracy.    The TUC had expressedthis view very strongly and some concession should be made,preferably in the White Paper rather than subsequently. possibilities-ities were to refer simply to &quot;a substantial period&quot; and leave thequestion of definition until legislation or to go for three or four years.If the latter then this might be linked to the date of establishment ofthe JRC rather than the anactment of legislation.8
In further discussion a number of minor amendments were agreed.These included changing the tide cf the White Paper to &quot;IndustrialDemocracy1&apos;;  accepting amendments proposed in Annex D to cp(78) 49 in relation to paragraph 2 (but not paragraphs 1 and i),paragraphs 20 and 21 (with any consequential amendments necessaryto paragraph 22), and paragraph 25.    The amendments proposed in annex D to paragraph 30 were not accepted but it was agreed that thelast sentence of that paragraph should be deleted and the previoussentence extended by the addition of &quot;and this might make it moredifficult to raise capital&quot;.    The amendment to paragraph 31 to annex D was accepted.    It was also agreed to consider a revised version of the opening paragraph ol the White Paper which, it hadbeen suggested, did not adequately express the philosophy ofindustrial democracy; and to consider a reference in paragraph 17to the need to ensure that, in groups with subsidiaries in differentregions of the United Kingdom, the interests of the different locationswere taken into account in discussions of company proposals.    It wasagreed to leave unchanged references in the draft to the right to discussion rather than replace them by reference to a right to consultation as it appeared that the trade unions would prefer theformer wording.THE PRIME MINISTEP., summing up the discussion, said that their discussion on the amendments proposed to paragiaph 11 had raisedimportant issues.    The majority view of the Cabinet was that itwould be right to provide for an appeal by a trade union if it thoughtthat the JRC was not properly representative of unions in thecompany, but that it would not be acceptable for non-trade unioniststo have a right of appeal on the grounds that a JRC was not adequatelyrepresentative of the employees as a whole.    Companies would stillbe free to consult as much as they liked with non-union employees andthe White Paper should make this quite clear.    The Cabinet would,however, wish to have information about the extent of unionisation withfirms of 500 employees or more and the Secretary of the cabinet should arrange to provide this.    On the question of the length of time before the right to board representation came into effect the white paper should say that this would be three or four years after theestablishment of a JRC.    A number of other amendments had beenagreed in discussion.    The Cabinet had been unable to conclude theircon side ration of the draft and would resume at their meeting onThursday 4 May.    Before that meeti-ig the Mini3ter for social Security would put forward a possible revision to paragraph 1and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would put forward an addition to paragraph 17, along the lines they had suggested in discussion.    Subject to the outcome of their further discussion,publication should be as soon as possible.    The Secretary of Statefor Education and Science and Paymaster General was to becongratulated on the way in which she had co-ordinated the work onthe White Paper and should be named as one of the presenters of theWhite Paper, in addition to himself, the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Trade.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Prime Ministersumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned tc be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 April 197810
