1. The Cabinet were info rmeil of the provisional arrangements forthe business to be taken in the House of Commons during the week beginning Monday 3 April.fc:attlentar&quot;********* THE PRIME MINISTER said he had noticed that Opposition members were making increasing use of Parliamentary Questions as a means ofeliciting information which could then be assembled to providematerial for a concerted attack on the Government, for exampleduring his own Question Time.    He therefore asked Ministers to takeparticular care to identify Questions whose underlying purpose was ofthis kind and to frame their replies, with suitable political content,accordingly.    The broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings, whichwould begin after Easter, might also have implications for the form ofAnswers, for example where it would be normal to refer back to a previous Answer.    These implications were for the ministers concerned to judge in each case.    He himself intended to make moreuse of prepared statements after Questions.    He would be making such a statement on the Pearson Report that afternoon, and he would be making a similar statement on North Sea oil in the following week.The Cabinet -1.        Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the ministerial group on British Leyland (GEN 70) had considered British Leyland1 scorporate plan and the recommendations of the National EnterpriseBoard (not) on it.    Nrither the British Leyland Board nor the NEBwere in any doubt about the seriousness of the company&apos;s position.Their recommendations were aimed to reverse the decline and ensurethe survival of the company on which 190, 000 employees were directlydependent and many others indirectly.    The Board&apos;3 proposals, whichhad the unanimous backing of the not, were for an injection of 450 million of public funds in 1978 in the form of new equity capital and for a longer-term assurance, in more general terms, that theGovernment would be willing to meet the cost of British Leyland&apos;sprogrammes within the  850 million remaining of the  1, 000 millionceiling on public funding recommended by the Ryder Report, providedthat performance was satisfactory.    The Ministerial Group, underthe Chancellor of the Exchequers chairmanship, had endorsed these recommendations.    He therefore proposed to inform Parliament byWritten Answer before the Recess that the Government would bring its full proposals for British Leyland to Parliament immediately afterthe Recess but that in the meantime he was authorising the not to1
make available i.275 million to British Leyland which was necessary tocover the repayment of short-term loans and to meet immediate cashrequirements.    As soon as practicable after Parliament resumed,there would be a debate on the necessary Orders to provide the 450 million of equity capital.    This would involve raising the borrowing limits of the not from  700 million to  1, 000 million. Hewould arrange at an appropriate stage for an abridged version of theReport from the not to be placed in the Library and would take stepsto inform the Liberals and perhaps the Conservatives of his intentions in advance.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that his talks on the previousSunday with Chancellor Schmidt about the world economic situation had been valuable.    The latter had recognised the seriousness of thepresent situation but was in p. fatalistic frame of mind.    He had,however, encouraged the Prime Minister to pursue the idea, which hehad already begun to form, of visiting Washington for talks with president Carter.     The purpose of this visit, which he intended tomake in the following week, would be to try and persuade the Fresidentof the need for the major world leaders, and in particular thePresident himself and Chancellor Schmidt, to devise measures whichwould instil a sense of confidence in the future of the internationaleconomy.    In consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer he hadbeen giving a lot of thought to the possibilities.    Each country mighthave to follow some course to which it was opposed:  but the object would be to agree upon a common collective programme for moregrowth, greater intervention in the exchange markets and longer-termhelp to the developing countries.    Such a programme might be ratifiedat the Summit Meeting to be held in Bonn in July, but it would be important to make progress in the meantime.In discussion it was suggested that while an initiative of this kind waswelcome, there v/as a danger that any programme based on anideological commitment to the existing trade and monetary systemswould fail to solve the underlying problems.    It was also suggestedthat what was chiefly lacking was any kind of collective commitment to economic growth and full employment and that there was a need to stimulate demand generally in underdeveloped areas.2
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would report further to theCabinet on his retnrn from Washington and that in due course therewould be an opportunity for the Cabinet to have a fuller discussion ofthe longer-term issues relating to the world economic situation.There was however an immediate need for action to engender a sense of confidence.The Cabinet -Took note.3
3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Israeli response to the Palestinian terrorist raid had beenvirtually inevitable.    Most countries were therefore trying to avoidsevere condemnation of Israel18 action, although there was considerable pressure from the Arab States for this     This was the view he hadtaken and the French Foreign Minister, to whom he had spoken on theprevious day, felt the same.    Whether it would be possible to hold this line would depend on how long the Israelis stayed in the Lebanon.Their tactical aim was to clean up the border area and they wanted to exclude all Palestinians from a strip of six to ten miles on the Lebanonside.    If they withdrew there was a strong possibility that thePalestinians would return to the border area.    The Israelis mightinsist aa a condition of their withdrawal on some guarantee that thiswould not happen.    There might be a role here for a United nations force.    He had been trying to get the Lebanese to accept such a forcein Southern Lebanon:   so far they had resisted, but the Americans now seemed ready to support the idea.    He hoped to avoid this latestincident being taken to the Security Council.    The Syrians had not become involved and other countries in the area were acting so far with considerable prudence.    But IsraePs intentions were not clear and asmall mistake could lead to a serious conflict.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that asregards Somalia the task for the West was to try to avoidPresident Siad Bane, now that he had been defeated, thinking that theonly country to whom he could turn for support was the Soviet Unior..Despite our efforts, mainly in the form of aid, we could not rule outthe possibility that the Russians would succeed.    They had powerfulmeans of providing support which they would be unscrupulous in using.They had infiltrated the country heavily over the past few years. Thewithdrawal of Somali forces from Ethiopia had been carried out in an orderly manner and there had been no sign of Cubans or Ethiopianscrossing the border into Somalia.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the response to our proposals, made jointly with the Americans, for a newconference of all negotiating parties had been poor.    The offer we had made was a fair one and there was still the possibility that we might beable to rally enough support.    But he was not optimistic.    The partiesto the internal settlement were now likely to go ahead and establish an interim government with portfolios being held jointly by one black andone white Minister.    The further this process went the harder it wouldbe to achieve any change in the arrangements, for example by bringing in Mr Nkomo:  and the demands made by each side would become
tougher.    He personally had some doubt about whether the internalsettlement would survive because Mr Smith would seek to use it as a means to further his own ends.    But the situation could changeradically if Mr Nkomo could be persuaded to join, or if Mr Smithdeparted from the scene.    A senior Foreign and Commonwealth Officeofficial was going to South Africa in order to make contact withrepresentatives of Mr smith s regime.    This would be done quiteopenly, in association with an American representative, and neitherthe British nor the American official would be going to Salisbury.THF PRIME MINISTER said that in view of continuing british responsibility for Rhodesia, the Cabinet should have an opportunity ofreviewing developments and discussing our policy.    He would be grateful if the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would circulate a paper for this purpose after the Easter Recess.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would like to inform the Cabinetthat the test of a British nuclear device was to take place shortly at theAmerican underground test site at Nevada.    The purpose of the testwas to improve our knowledge of warhead design and it was related tothe existing programme for maintaining the effectiveness of theBritish Polaris force.    After the event simultaneous Press statementswould be made in the United States and in this country.    His colleagues would have seen reports in the Press that the Chinese had conducted a nuclear test on 15 March:  this was of course an atmospheric testwhereas the British test would take place underground.    To put our programme in perspective, we knew on the basis of classifiedinformation that the Americans had conducted. 18 tests in 1977 and theRussians 21.    When the proposal for a British test was made he considered whether it might have any bearing on the comprehensivetest ban negotiations which were currently taking place in Geneva.Reasonable progress had been made since these negotiations startedsix months ago, but there were still some difficult problems to be resolved.    These concerned measures for verification, the duration ofthe treaty and procedures for dealing with the Soviet wish to find an acceptable basis for exempting peaceful nuclear explosions from the banon weapon tests.    We ourselves had not wanted to exempt peacefulnuclear explosions but the Russians were pressing for this.    If it were possible to reach agreement on a tripartite basis, the intention was that negotiations on a multilateral treaty should then continue in theConference of the Committee on Disarmament.    It was too early to forecast how soon this point would be reached.    He had discussed with
the Secretary of State for Defence whether ic was necessary to go ahead with our test now that these negotiations were under way. Thelast test we had conducted was in August 1976, and they had concluded that until there were clear prospects that the negotiations for a testban were likely to be successful it would not be in our interest to refrain from conducting a test wh?ch was necessary for maintaining the effectiveness of our cwn nuclear weapons.    This was also the view taken by the United States and the Soviet Union.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.
P^J^TIVE 4. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the&apos;&quot;^7-78    ***E Legislation Corr.mii.tee had recently completed a review of thelegislative programme for 1977-78, the conclusions of which had beenPrevj0 reported to the Prime Minister in his minute of 9 March.    It had^f6re 8 become clear that the full programme could not be taken through bothHouses if Parliament were to rise by the end of July with normal^cci   . ^ recesses at Easter and Whitsuntide.    He was grateful for the^*Ute8l0n8&apos; co-operation of his colleagues in the Legislation Committee in agreeing to the proposed solutions.    The Committee had leluctantlyconcluded that the Bills on Companies, Weights and Measures,Education (Scotland), Local Authority Works (Scotland) and criminla justice (Scotland) would have to be dropped, and that the Bills onElectricity, the Co-operative Development Agency, and OffshoreInstallations could only proceed if they had the requisite support ofother Parties.    As regards Electricity, the Secretary of State forEnergy and he had done their best to obtain Liberal support for theBill and had persuaded the Liberals to meet representatives of theunions and of management, but the Liberals were not prepared tosupport those parts of the Bill which provided for the re-structuringof the industry.    Their reasons had been set out in a recent letter tothe Secretary of State for Energy from the leader of the Liberal Party,Mr. Steel;  they were different from the reasons which had been advanced at an earlier stage, but there seemed no prospect of persuading them to change their minds.    He had discussed thesituation with the Secretary of State for Energy and had concluded thatit would be necessary to confine the Bill to the measures on Drax Band nuclear safety which the Liberals had said they were prepared tosupport.    Discussions were continuing through the usual channels onthe Offshore Installations Bill, on which the attitude of the opposition was not yet known and it was not possible to take a final view at thisstage.    He hoped that the Co-operative Development Agency bill might be published and introduced during the following week: the conservatives would be opposed but a significant section of the LabourParty attached great importance to it, and there would be particular value in publishing the Bill before the Co-operative Party held itsAnnual Conference over the Easter weekend.    The Bill was ready,the Liberals were expected to support it and, although there could beno certainty at this stage, it might be possible to find time for aSecond Reading in the House of Commons shortly after Easter.In discussion, it was explained that the Opposition spokesman onenergy had also been approached about the Electricity Bill, but hadbeen unable to give any assurance of Conservative support on Secondor Third Reading.     The omission of the provisions on restructuringwould be a great disappointment to the industry, and to provide somereassurance it would be desirable to publish a White Paper setting outthe provisions which would have been included in the Bill.    A furtheradvantage of a White Paper was that the Select Committee on the nationalised Industries would soon be considering the electricity industry, and although its reactions were unpredictable it would be helpful for the Committee to have the Governments consideredproposals before them.7
In fur*her discussion it was acknowledged that precise calculationscould not be made of the amount of time which the various government Bills would need to complete their passage through parliament, or of what provisions should be made for contingencies,but the paramount aim would be to complete the Session&apos;s business bythe end of July, with no spill-over in the autumn.    Bills on Steel and parliamentary Pensions were still to be introduced and there was theprospect of serious congestion in the House of Lords, but a good starthad been made on the  Scotland Bill the previous evening, and it was hoped that the Wales Bill would reach the House of Lords in good time.It was pointed out that Ministerial discussions were taking place ongrants to private householders to enable them to insulate theirproperties as a means of saving energy.    It had been hoped that any statutory cover which might be necessary could be provided byadditions to the Home Purchase Assistance Bill or to the Finance Bill,but the prospects were not encouraging and separate legislation might therefore have to be considered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Legislation Committee&apos;s proposal, in which theMinisters concerned had reluctantly acquiesced, to drop the Bills onCompanies, Weights and Measures, Education (Scotland), LocalAuthority Works (Scotland) and Criminal Justice (Scotland), and they agreed that the Bill on Electricity would have to be confined to theprovisions on Drax B and nuclear safety.    The Secretary of State forEnergy would prepare a White Paper on his proposals for restructuringthe industry, which should be circulated for collective clearance bycolleagues in the usual way;  White Papers on other subjects whichwould have been covered by legislation could similarly be prepared and considered.    In drafting these White Papers, and in making any announcement of decisions not to proceed with Bills, it would be important to avoid any commitment for legislation in next Session.Discussions would continue through the usual channels on the OffshoreInstallations Bill, and in the circumstances outlined by the lord president of the Council, the Co-operative Development Agency bill could be published and introduced in the House of Commons in thefollowing week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.8
^RATION&quot; g^ 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (CP(78) 36) cohering a draft White Paper which itwas proposed to publish the following week on the future of the british steel Corporation (BSC).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. INDUSTRY said that it had become clear during 1977 that BSC was in deep financial trouble.    Other steel industries were similarly placed in the depth of the worst recession for40 years.   The downturn had been dramatically fast.    As a result, theCorporation had been left with substantial surplus capacity, existing and under construction, and enormous financial losses. Followingdiscussion by Ministers, first in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (EY) and then in two small Ministerial groups(GEN 116 and GEN 127), he had prepared the programme outlined in his memorandum and in the draft White Paper.    It was impossible to reconcile the three objectives of a viable steel industry, an industry of substantial size able to meet all the demands which might be placed on it, and a humane approach to the social consequences of rundown.Nor could the long-term future size of the industry be determined with certainty in present conditions.    He had therefore recommended a stage-by-stage approach, both to the closure of existing plants and to future capital investment.     The Trades Union Congress Iron and SteelCommittee had taken a responsible and co-oparative attitude and withtheir assistance, some closures had already been negotiated; others were under discussion.    It was clear that the Corporation would need a substantial capital reconstruction.    He had considered an immediatewrite-off of large amounts of Public Dividend Capital and of advancesfrom the National Loans Fund.    But Ministers in EY had concluded that it would be premature to announce a massive write-off, whichcould be as big as  2. 4 billion, in the present world uncertainties,and that it should be postponed if possible.    Accordingly, alternativeways had been sought cf financing the Corporation during the next oneor two years.    He proposed to make further advances under Section 18of the Iron and Steel Act 1975, making it clear to Parliament ihat these could not be remunerated until after a capita.1, reconstruction, the size of which could not be determined precisely at this stage. these advances would need to cover future capital investment, as well as theservice of existing loan obligations.    Those obligations could not bereduced without legislation, which would be inappropriate at this stage.Legislation would however be needed to increase the Corporation^present borrowing limits.    He recognised that the course proposedmight cause international difficulties, particularly with the UnitedStates.    The Ministerial groups had also considered various measuresto offset the impact of the immediate closures of local communities;these had all been agreed between the Ministers concerned.
In discussion it was argued that there would be a serious risk of losingthe American market for steel exports if a capital reconstruction werepostponed and money were advanced to the Corporation meanwhile inthe form proposed.    The measures suggested looked too much likedirect grant assistance.    On the other hand, it was argued that theGovernment could not seek fresh Parliamentary authority for furtheradvances to the Corporation without making the Corporation^financial future clear.    The presentation of these proposals in thedraft White Paper had therefore to be very carefully considered, and ifan acceptable formula could not be found, it might be necessary to reconsider the decision to postpone the capital reconstruction.In further discussion it was argued that all previous forecasts of steeldemand had proved wide of the mark.    There was no reason to suppose that the present forecasts were any better.    It would be important notto cut the Corporation down too far.    Against this it was argued that officials, under the chairmanship of the Minister of State, Departmentof Industry, made a careful study of likely future steel demand. Theirforecasts had been checked against the independent predictions madeby BSC.    It was only in the most exceptionally optimistic case thatthere was any possible shortage of steelmaking capacity emerging inthe next five years.    There was sufficient flexibility built into theproposed programme to allow capacity to be expanded, whether bypostponement of closures or by new investment, should this situationarise.    This should be brought out more clearly in the White paper.A number of drafting points were agreed in the course of discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the main proposals put forward in the paper bythe Secretary of State for Industry (CP(78) 36) and specifically with proposals on steelmaking capacitv and closures, on product mills, andon capital development.    Cn the proposals for a capital reconscruction,the Cabinet agreed on the need for an eventual capital reconstruction.They agreed that it was desirable to avoid a large write-off of capital in the immediate future, and that this decision should if possible be postponed until the world market position became clearer. this meant that it would be necessary to continue advancing further financeto the Corporation.    The scheme proposed by the Secretary of State for industry, involving the use of Section 18 of the Iron and Steel Act 1975,seemed the best course available.    But the Cabinet recognised that itwould be difficult to present this decision in a way which would not run the risk of countervailing action in the United States, and possibly of difficulties with our Community partners.    The Cabinet thereforeagreed to the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s proposals, subject to asatisfactory formula being found for their presentation.    The Secretaryof State for Industry should arrange for officials to prepare a freshversion of the draft White Paper to deal with this difficulty and to cover
all the other points raised in the Cabinet discussion.    He should discuss the redrafted text with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a minister from the Department of Trade, later that evening.    The results ofthat discussion, with the proposed revised text of the White Paper,should be submitted to him as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office16 March 1978
