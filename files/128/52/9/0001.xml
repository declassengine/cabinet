-THE CABINET1. The Cabinet welcomed Lord Windlesham on his assumption of the office of Lord Privy Seal.PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.New ParliamentaryBuildingPreviousReference:CM(73) 6thConclusions,Minute 3THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL informed the Cabinetthat some difficulties might arise in deciding how to deal with the debate on 25 June about the new Parliamentary building.   It was proposed that there should be a free vote; and, if so, there mightbe a majority in favour of proceeding with the new building, especially-cially since the all-Party Early Day Motion urging that it should be built as planned, in full and without further delay,, had receivedconsiderable support.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer had already indicated that the additional public expenditure which would berequired could not be contemplated during the current or thefollowing financial year.   Moreover, the new building couM not inany case be started for some three years, since the  Cannon RowPolice Station would first have to be rebui It.  &apos; But a difficult situation might arise unless the Government were prepared toindicate that they were not sa^Mng to rule out the fafraj?(B provision of6 now Parliamentary building; and this should p&amp;sferably be madecltwu? in the Resolution which would have to be tafc&amp;ed in advance ofthe debate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Resolution might indicate that the needfor a new Parliamentary building was recognised but that for anumber of reasons it would not be possible to make an early startin constructing it.    A Resolution on these lines would notnecessarily commit the Government to the design which the Houseof Commons Services Committee had accepted, despite, the considerable objections (to it which had been expressed.,^    Thedraft of the Resolution should be circulated for consideration by theCabinet at their next meeting.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Secretary of State for the environment, to proceed accordingly.LUni UULiM i inu
MaplinDevelopmentBillThe Cabinet agreed that the Lord President, the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Chief Whip should considerwhether any further amendment to the Maplin Development Billshould be proposed in the House of Lords in the light of theamendment recently made in the House of Commons requiring the appropriate Minister, together with the Civil aviation authority and the Maplin Development Authority, to review alltechnological developments affecting the operation of civil aircraft before authorising the construction of the airport toproceed.    They should report their conclusions to theappropriate Committee, which should also consider any othermatters which might be raised about the remaining stages ofthe Bill.EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRS3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said there had recently been encouraging progress in some areasof the European Community^ work.    Agreement had beenreached on the invitation to the developing countries concerned to attend a meeting in July on the re-negotiation of the Yaoundeconvention.    Agreement also seemed likely on the policy to beadopted towards the countries of the Mediterranean.    But inother and rather more important areas, including the discussions on the second stage of Economic and Monetary Union and the preparations for the international trade negotiations, progressseemed likely to be more difficult and slow;  and the next fewmonths might prove to be a period of considerable frustration.The Council would shortly be discussing some modest proposalsfor reforms in the Community&apos;s working procedures and for anincrease in the powers of the European Assembly over theCommunity Budget.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that there was no reason to suppose that the recent outburst of violence by Protestant extremists in Belfast or the bombingby the Provisional Irish Republican Army in Coleraine represented a revival of terrorism at a heightened level.    There would, nodoubt, be further incidents during the two weeks leading up to theelections to the Northern Ireland Assembly; but there were grounds for hoping that those elections would take place without undue disturbance, as had the local government elections in May.But it was difficult to predict their outcome;  and it was unlikely to be immediately apparent whether the successful candidateswould include a sufficient number willing to co-operate in creating the new Assembly and making it effective.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.
5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat there appeared to be little scope at present for conciliationor other action by the Government in the various industrial disputes in the motor industry.    There was deadlock in thestrike by 4, 500 Chrysler workers at Ryton, Coventry, aboutthe docking of 1^ hours1 pay for body-shop men accused of sub-standard production on 24 May;  and the management had refused to negotiate with union officials until the strikersreturned to work.    Reports that they were seeking a confrontationwith the unions, however, were incorrect;  and they were anxiousto retain the goodwill of the substantial minority of workers whowere opposed to the strike.    It might prove possible to promotenegotiations by the weekend.Perkins Engines of Peterborough had decided to close down their four plants and to lay off the 5, 700 workers who had been on ar 11 week overtime ban and go-slow in support of a claim forparity with their colleagues at the parent Massey-Fergusontractor plant in Coventry.    Although both parties professedwillingness to resume negotiations, any compromise acceptable to the unions might well be in breach of the Pay Code; and thisargued against a Government inquiry.The hopes that the dispute concerning the grading of 80 men atthe British Leyland works at Cowley, which had halted productionand caused 12, 000 workers to be laid off, would be resolved onthe previous day had not been fulfilled, since the company1 s payproposals had been rejected.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the loss of production in the motor industry as a result ofindustrial disputes was a matter for increasing concern.    Thepublic believed that obstinacy was being displayed by both sides of the industry; and, unless the present disputes were resolvedquickly, the Government would be liable to be criticised forinactivity.    The Secretary of State for Employment should therefore keep the disputes under close review and should consider what action the Government might take if they wore not rapidlysettled.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for employment to be guided accordingly.4
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(73) 64) reporting the interimconclusions of the group of Ministers (GEN 168) who had been considering future policy towards the Building Societies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the group had begun by considering possible long-term measures.    two major requirements had to be satisfied.    First, there must be a steady flow of finance into the mortgage market; second, some protection against the combined effect of increasing house prices and unusually high mortgage rates was needed for the most vulnerable of those who were buying a house for the first time.The group had considered two possible methods of stabilisingthe availability of funds.    The first involved control of theminimum liquidity ratios to be observed by the Building Societies,while the second envisaged that the Government, or perhaps anindependent Corporation, would be responsible for calling in andreleasing deposits.    Neither scheme would require an exchequer subsidy; and either could, if necessary, be associated with the short-term control of Building Society interest rates.    It would bedesirable to avoid, if possible, legislation which would be complex and controversial; and discussions with the Building SocietiesAssociation (BSA) had therefore been put in hand in order toascertain whether a satisfactory voluntary scheme could be agreed.As regards first-time purchasers, two possible approaches hadbeen considered, both of which would be financed by the Societiesthemselves.    The first was an extension of the &quot;low start&quot;mortgage schemes, under which gross annual payments beganat a lower but finished at a higher level than under an orthodoxannuity mortgage.    The second envisaged that an interest-reducingloan would be available when the mortgage rate exceeded a certainfigure, with a view to reducing the amount of the interest paymentsduring the first few years of the mortgage.    These possibilitieswere also under discussion with the BSA.As regards the short-term measures to be taken on expiry of thepresent bridging grant, the Ministerial group considered thatinformal consultative machinery should be set up with the BSAto monitor the flow of mortgage funds;  and they had alsoauthorised discussions with the Association in order to explore thepossibility of introducing by the autumn, on a provisional basis,model mortgage schemes to help first-time purchasers.    much would depend on the level at which the mortgage rate was fixedwhen the bridging grant ended in July.    Clearing bank depositrates had been falling since April;  and the inflow of investmentfunds to the Societies in April and May had been at a high level.There were therefore grounds for hoping that the mortgage rate would be fixed at something less than 10 per cent.    There were some indications, however, that a section of opinion within theBuilding Societies considered that a 10 per cent rate would be5ROLE OF THEBUILDINGSOCIETIESPreviousReference:CM(73) 22ndConclusions,Minute confidential
necessary in order to ensure that sufficient funds would be availableto support the housing programme at its present level.    But forthe reasons indicated in the annex to CP(73) 64 Ministers had unanimously concluded that the subsidy should not be continuedbeyond July, whatever the level of the mortgage rate.    If it were fixed at 10 per cent, the Government would have to announcepublicly the long-term arrangements which they had in mind andalso the plans for the early introduction of model mortgage schemes to help first-time purchasers.    The mortgage rate was likely to befixed at a meeting of the BSA on 12 July.    Discussions with theAssociation which had been arranged for 28 June should make it possible to secure an indication of their probable decision; andthere should then be sufficient time for further representations tothe Societies, if necessary.In discussion, it was suggested that, although the recentpreliminary exchanges with the BSA had shown that they werereceptive to the proposed long-term and short-term measures and to proposals for preventing excessive increases in housevaluations, their inability to control their members might preventthe arrangements envisaged from becoming fully effective.    Forthis reason alone it might prove impossible to dispense with legislation.    Moreover, any arrangements which might be made,whether voluntary or statutory, might constitute a restrictivepractice and therefore intensify pressure for the building societies to be referred to the Monopolies Commission.    It was particularly important,that effective steps should be taken to limit the excessive increase &quot;the house valuations upon which loans bythe Societies were based.    This had been a major factor in therecent rapid increase in house prices;  but there was at present no effective incentive to the Societies to exercise restraint.    In presentcircumstances even the creation of a mortgage shortage might be preferable to the continued increase in house prices; and thecurrent overload on the construction industry reinforced this conclusion.    One possible remedy might be to relate the size of loans to the valuation of houses twelve months previously.Measures on these or similar lines were particularly urgent in the context of the present discussions with the Trades Union congress and the Confederation of British Industry about counter-inflationary measures at the end of Stage Two of the pay and prices policy andof the reported 10 per cent increase in house prices during thefirst quarter of 1973.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in CP(73) 64 and agreed, inparticular, that there should be no question of any renewal of thebridging grant when it expired in July.   It should be made clear to the Building Societies as rapidly as possible that, whateverarrangements might be agreed for the long-term, the Governmentwould not be prepared in the interim to accept action on their part6
which would be prejudicial to the development of counter-inflationary policies.    At present the societies investment rate was significantly more attractive than the rate offered to saversby the Government; and there was a very substantial inflow of investment funds.    The house building programme, however,was not expanding significantly; and there was therefore a very real danger that the Societies would fail to apply reasonablerestraint to the valuations upon which loans were based and, as aresult, would initiate a renewed rise in house prices.    the alleged increase in prices in the first quarter of 1973 wasdisturbingly large; and it was important that its accuracy shouldbe checked.    The Building Societies must be prepared to exerciserestraint in relation both to their interest rates and to thevaluations of houses;  and, if they were not willing to do sovoluntarily, urgent consideration should be given to the statutory powers which it might then be necessary to seek.    Work should accordingly be put in hand urgently in order to analyse the scopeof legislation for this purpose and to prepare draft legislative proposals on a contingency basis.    Meanwhile, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the Secretary of State for the Environmentshould meet the leaders of the Building Society movement at avery early date, well before the meeting of the BSA on 12 July,and should leave them in no doubt about the governments attitude.    He would himself be willing to see the representatives should this be desirable.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the environment -i. to arrange to meet the leaders of theBuilding Society movement, as indicated inthe Prime Ministers summing up;ii. to arrange for urgent consideration to begiven to the scope of legislation on the lines indicated in their discussion;and to report the outcome to the Cabinet.3.      Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inconsultation with the Minister for Housing and construction, to examine the validity of the reported increase in house prices during thefirst quarter of 1973.
MEMBERS&apos;OUTSIDEFINANCIALINTERESTSPreviousReference:CM(73) 7thConclusions,Minute 77. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council CP(73) 66 about Members1 OutsideFinancial Interests.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that in thediscussions which the Cabinet had authorised him to undertakewith Conservative Members of Parliament there had been general acceptance that the House of Commons should be invitedto pass a Resolution which would constitute a code of conductfor Members in relation to the disclosure of personal financial interests.    A code of this kind, which he now proposed shouldbe confined to the provisions of paragraph (ii) of Appendix A to cp(73) 66, would go some way towards satisfying the requirementsof the present situation.    The general feeling at a meeting of the1922 Committee on 5 April, however, had been firmly opposed tothe establishment of a register recording such interests.Meanwhile, the Parliamentary Labour Party had decided infavour of a compulsory limited register open to the public,rejecting a proposal put forward by a Party Committee that sucha register should be available for inspection only by the officersof the Party and Mr Speaker; and they had recently indicated that they were now in a position to discuss the matter further with the Government.It now appeared essential to establish a register of some kind,both in order to protect Members themselves against unfairimputations and also to reassure public opinion, which was particularly sensitive to the issues involved at the present justice.    A register on the lines proposed in Appendix B to cp(73) 66 seemed to be the minimum which would be acceptablefor these purposes.    Its scope was both practical and moderate,providing for the registration of interests regarded as relevant to a matter before the House as well as for appointments such asdirectorships, etc; and it was based on the voluntary principle.The proposal would accord to Parliament the respect which wasits due and would at the same time allow for the exercise of a proper degree of responsibility and discretion on the part of individual Members.    If the Government did not now makereasonable proposals of their own on this matter, the initiativewould be lost to the Opposition and pressure would develop for measures which might well be more repugnant still.In discussion there was general agreement that the government must now take some action.    The nature of the proposedregister, however, presented very considerable problems;and some concern was expressed that a merely voluntary registerwould not be regarded as adequate by public opinion.    It might therefore be preferable not to propose a register unless it werecompulsory.    Moreover, the public would not readily accept thepropesed exclusion of normal shareholdings from its scope.    But,8
if disclosure of shareholdings were to be prescribed, it would be important, in the interests of reasonable privacy, to establishthat the obligation attached only to Members of Parliament and did not extend to eg their families.    Moreover, the proposal forthe recording of interests relevant to a matter before the Housemight give rise to difficulty in practice, since Members wouldnot necessarily appreciate, or be aware, when their interestsbecame relevant in this respect.    Finally, there was the widerrisk, which might nevertheless have to be accepted, that theestablishment of a register would stimulate public pressure forthe disclosure of other matters, to the point at which the intrusioninto the personal privacy of Members would become whollyunwarrantable.In further discussion it was suggested that the interests recorded in the proposed register would not be regarded as constituting a wholly new category and that the register might be more acceptable to Members if it were presented as providing theopportunity for the recording of interests which under presentpractices would be declared by a Member when speaking in theHouse.    The register would thus provide a means of assistingMembers in this respect; and this could perhaps be made clearerif the two proposed Resolutions were amalgamated into a singleResolution.THE PRIME MINISTER   summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord President should now seek to carryfurther his discussions with the Opposition in the light of thepoints which had been made.    In particular, he should seek tosecure their agreement that any register which might be establishedshould be voluntary in character.    The definition of the interests which Members would be able to record in such a register presentedconsiderable difficulties; but the proposals in Appendix B to cp(73) 66 appeared to provide a suitable basis for discussion.The register should be regarded as providing an opportunity for members to record interests which they judged to be relevant to matters with which they were concerned in a Parliamentarycapacity but had no means of disclosing unless they happened to bespeaking in the House.    It might be helpful in this respect if theResolutions relating to the code of conduct and to the register werecombined; and further consideration should be given to this possibility.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s srunming up of their discussion.9.:-v;;r-;;;:; :7
2.      Invited the Lord President:-i.    to resume his discussions with theGovernments supporters and, in particular,with the 1922 Committee on the lines proposedin CP(73) 66;ii.    to enter into discussions with theOpposition Parties as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up;iii.    to report the outcome to the Cabinet assoon as possible.
8.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of State for wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food (CP(73) 67) proposing that regional development grants should be extended to slaughterhouses.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment (RE) had recently considered a proposal by the agriculture Ministers to extend regional development grants to slaughterhouses.    The Committee had concluded thatthe proposal could not be justified on grounds of regional policy; and they had invited the Agriculture Ministers toconsider whether any necessary financial subvention forslaughterhouses could be provided by their Departments.But it appeared that this was impracticable without fresh legislation.    The Agriculture Ministers   however,considered that there was a strong and exceptional case fortheir proposal.    Expenditure on the construction and improvement of slaughterhouses in assisted areas hadformerly qualified for building grant under the local employment Act.    Building grants had now been superseded regional development grants, for which slaughtering,being classified as a distributive rather than a manufacturingtrade, was not eligible.    But this classification was basedon the outdated concept of a slaughterhouse as a local facilityprovided for the use of retail butchers, whereas modernslaughtering facilities were increasingly of the &quot;meat factory&quot;type, designed to satisfy national and export requirements.Their industrial character v/as recognised both in NorthernIreland, where slaughterhouses attracted Government aidunder an Industries Development Scheme, and on theContinent, where slaughtering was included as a manufacturingactivity in the statistical classification of the european economic Community (e.c.) and slaughterhouses wereeligible for aid under the Community&apos;s Agricultural guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) provided that they were alsoassisted under national legislation.    Moreover, modernslaughterhouses attracted processing plants and othersecondary industries and thus offered valuable employmentprospects for the areas in which they were situated;   moreslaughterhouses were required to standards approved by the eec in order that the livestock industry might take full advantage of the increased opportunities for export to theCommunity and for intervention buying; and improvedfacilities for exporting meat in carcass form would reducethe export of live animals.    In order to meet the concernexpressed in RE about the possible repercussions of the11
proposal on other distributive industries the activityqualifying for grant might be restricted to the traditionalprocess of slaughtering and exclude the more refined preparationof the meat which modern slaughterhouses also undertook.Both in the meat trade and among the Government s supportersthere had been concern in the past about the difficulty of finding capital for private enterprise to develop new -slaughter -house facilities; and a strong reaction must be expected if itwere now to appear that slaughterhouses were to cease to qualify for assistance from regional development funds.   For all these reasons it would be appropriate that slaughterhouses should bemade eligible for regional development grants by means of a variation Order which would appropriately define the activity.Is?., discussion the advantages of encouraging modern slaughteringfacilities and the development of slaughterhouses to EECstandards were recognised.    Past experience gave little support to the view that these developments would take place without some measure of assistance from the Government; and thepossibility of securing aid from FEOGA funds might sufficientlydistinguish this case from other contenders for regional development grant.    On the other hand RE had considered thatto seek to assist slaughterhouses by means of regional development grants would be inconsistent with the objective ofthe Industry Act, which was essentially to attract to the assisted areas industry which had a genuine choice of location.    The factthat the economics of meat production now encouraged the location of slaughterhouses in the producing regions, whichcovered large parts of the assisted areas, might indeed make such an inducement unnecessary; and the expenditure involvedin the proposal, amounting to  1 million over five years, mightbe better deployed in other ways to stimulate employment in the assisted areas.    A restricted definition of the activity qualifying for grant would be difficult to defend; and to concede this case would inevitably stimulate pressure for similar treatment fromother industries, particularly seed processing, fish filleting andtyre repairing.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised the desirability of securing modernslaughterhouse facilities.     But, in view of the objections to theuse of the Industry Act for this purpose, the Agriculture ministers should consider further, with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, thepossibility of providing any necessary measure of government assistance from agricultural funds.12
The Cabinet -Invited the Secretaries o  State for Scotland andWales and the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to consider ways in which assistance forthe development of slaughterhouse facilities couldbe provided from agricultural funds.Cabinet Office14 June 197313
