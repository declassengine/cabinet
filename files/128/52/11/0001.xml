parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.Publication ofParliamentaryPapers0The Cabinet were informed that the publication of Parliamentarypapers was being seriously delayed as the result of strike action bythe printing workers.    The latter had been offered the maximumincrease which was permissible under Stage 2 of the Governmentscounter-inflationary policies; but they were seeking to insist on an improved offer.    The dispute had already been in progress forsome time; and there was a danger that it might spread.    Copiesof the Official Reports were now appearing some days in arrear;and Order Papers and other Parliamentary documents were also being delayed.    The conduct of Parliamentary business would be seriously impeded if the present situation persisted:  and progress with legislation would become particularly difficult if, for example,Parliament were asked to proceed with the Report Stage of a Billin the absence of any record of the proceedings at Committee Stage.It would probably become necessary, therefore, to make an early announcement about the introduction of emergency printingarrangements similar to those which had been made in 1969.Debate onImmigrantsTHE HOME SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that some difficulty was to be expected in dealing with the debate which was to takeplace on 26 June about the position of certain immigrants.    Whilepublic sympathy for illegal immigrants in general was limited,considerable opposition had been expressed in a number of quarters,including the Race Relations Board and the Community relations commission, to the retroactive provisions of the Immigration Act,1971.    The recent decision by the House of Lords confirmed thatthe Act did not protect immigrants who had entered the UnitedKingdom illegally, even though previously an illegal immigrantwho had successfully escaped detection for six months had beenimmune from deportation.    It could be expected that there wouldbe some unfavourable repercussions in the field of race relations;and it was unfortunate that specific attention had not been drawn tothe retroactive provisions when the Act was being considered byParliament.    But it was necessary, both on merits and forpresentational reasons, firmly to maintain the governments position;  and he proposed to do so in the forthcoming debate, while making it clear that he would consider, individually and on its merits, each case in which deportation was proposed.
MaplinAirportPreviousReference:CM(73)^e^r 31^1-Conclusions,Minute /JX     *****The Cabinet considered a number of presentational matters connected with the development of the Maplin airport.It was reported that the Maplin Development Bill was due to beconsidered on Second Reading in the House of Lords on 26 june and that it was intended at an appropriate later stage to move an amendment which would require the Secretary of State for the environment, before approving the letting of a reclamation contract,to lay before Parliament a report on certain technical mattersrelevant to the decision whether development should proceed.This would be open to debate;  and there would therefore be anopportunity for the project to be described, and the case for it tobe set out in detail, before a final decision was taken.    TheGovernment would have a fairly wide range of choice as regardsthe timing of such a debate, since much still had to be done before a contract could be let;  and in the meantime it could be stressed that the Maplin Development Bill was only a procedural Measure,the enactment of which would not in itself imply any final decisions about the nature or timing of future developments at Maplin,    Onthe other hand, it might be desirable that the public should be given at an early date a full and balanced account of the governments proposals and of the reasons for them.    The forthcomingdevelopments at Maplin were likely to be increasingly in the publiceye, as a result of, for example, the publication in the near futureof consultative documents about the access roads and the associatedNew Town and of the report of the Nugent Committee on DefenceLands, which contained a recommendation that the remainingdefence facilities at Shoeburyness should be removed to Tain.Moreover, public opinion was becoming increasingly critical ofthe Maplin project, partly in terms of the expenditure involvedbut even moie on the grounds that an airport at Maplin was nolonger necessary.    It was important that these doubts should beconvincingly answered.    Moreover, there were other sources ofpublic anxiety which should, if possible, be removed - for example,the allegation that the new road and rail links would involve thedestruction of unacceptably large numbers of houses;  and the suspicion that the Government were considering the development oflarge-scale port facilities at Maplin which would confer unreasonablylarge benefits on the south east at the expense of other regions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the need to re-pre sent the project as a whole to public opinion at the most appropriate point.    He would consider further how this might best be done.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion,
OVERSEAAFFAIRSChina2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that the recent visit to London of the Chinese Minister forForeign Affairs, Mr Chi Peng-fei, had been successful and hadusefully prepared the way for a visit by the Prime Minister to china at a later date.    Mr Chi Peng-fei had not pressed the issueof official Chinese representation in Hong Kong.Nigeria THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe State Visit to the United Kingdom by the Head of State of nigeria, General Gowon, had also gone well.    General Gowonwas currently Chairman of the Organisation of African Unity;and his visit was, therefore, particularly timely.    Rhodesiaremained the key issue in our relations with Nigeria; butdiscussion of it during the Visit had not given rise to difficulty.*Iran THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaton the occasion of his recent visit to Tehran for the meeting ofthe Central Treaty Organisation he had had a useful meeting withthe Shah of Iran.    Our relations with Iran were good;  and therewere   prospects of considerable sales of arms.    The Shah was concerned about the situation in Iraq, where Sovist influencewas strong.    Iran&apos;s relations with Saudi Arabia and the united arab Emirates had somewhat recovered from the low point markedby the Iranian seizure of the Tunbs Islands.North Atlantic        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that atTreaty the recent meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Council intganisation Copenhagen there had been no disposition among the members(including the United States themselves) to endorse the earlierUnited States proposal that all the various elements - defence,economic and monetary - in the relationship between the UnitedStates and Europe must be dealt with within a single conceptualframework.He had not come under heavy pressure from the allies on thequestion of our Icelandic policy;  and it was clear from his exchangeswith the Icelandic Foreign Minister, Mr Augusstson, that the icelandic Government would not support any assurances by theSecretary-General of NATO, Dr Luns, to the effect that, if we withdrew the ships of the Royal Navy which were at presentpatrolling the fishing grounds in dispute, the Icelandic gunboatswould not resume their harassment of our trawlers.    For thepresent, therefore, there seemd no alternative to continuing our policy of providing naval protection for the trawlers.3
The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.4
EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRS3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) of the european economic Communities (e.c.) had reached agreement at their meeting on 18-19 June on a satisfactory agricultural content foran agreement between the e.c. and the countries bordering theMediterranean.    A meeting of Transport Ministers which was tohave been held in the following week had been cancelled when ithad become plain that French intransigence in insisting that theissue of the weights and dimensions of commercial vehicles mustbe discussed would make any real progress towards a commontransport policy impossible at this stage.The e.c. Commissioner responsible for competition policy,M Borschette, was to visit London that day for further discussions about the de-limitation of those areas in the United Kingdom(&quot;central&quot; areas) within which there would be an upper limit on thelevel of State aids given to any project.    The Ministerial Committeeon Europe had agreed that in these discussions we should seek to insist on arrangements for the United Kingdom which would bothenable us to maintain our present measures of regional assistance^        unimpar^ed and would avoid any formal distinction between different parts of our present Development Areas which wouldresult in some being designated as &quot;central&quot; and hence equatedwith the richest parts of the e.c..    The Committee had also agreedthat the most favourable solution from our point of view would provide that our non-assisted areas and Intermediate areas would be designated as &quot;central&quot; while the rest of the United Kingdom would begiven some other designation which would recognise the nature ofour problem areas and would allow us to continue to assist them onthe present scale.    Even if such a solution was generally acceptable to M Borschette, however, he might still press that some part ofthe United Kingdom should be designated as &quot;peripheral&quot;.     TheCommittee had been unable to agree whether in that case we mightconcede that Northern Ireland should be so designated, since some ministers believed that it would be difficult to defend any divisionof our problem areas into different categories even if none of them was made &quot;central&quot;.In discussion it was suggested that a distinction of designationbetween Northern Ireland and the problem areas of Great Britain(including Scotland and Y/ales) could readily be defended.    It wouldbe equally acceptable in Northern Ireland that the Province shouldbe treated in the same way as the rest of the United Kingdom or that it should be designated as &quot;peripheral&quot; if that would make it easier to reach agreement with the Commission.wf5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be preferable that Northern Ireland should be treated in thesame way as the rest of the United Kingdom in terms of the de-limitation of areas for the purposes of controlling State aids.But its designation as &quot;peripheral&quot; if essential to achieve asettlement,   might be acceptable.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.6
4NORTHERN 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDIRELAND said that the Provisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army wouldprobably attempt to raise the level of violence in the period leading up to the forthcoming elections to the new Assembly in NorthernIreland; but there were grounds for hoping that the polling dayitself would not be unduly disturbed.    It was impossible to predictthe outcome of the elections with any confidence.    But it was not impossible that they would result in an Assembly in which a majorityof the members would co-operate in making our constitutional proposals effective.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.t
/5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat the dispute about grading which had caused 12, 000 workers atthe British Leyland works at Cowley to be laid off had now ended.The men directly affected had accepted pay proposals which theyhad earlier rejected.The dispute which had led the management of Perkins Engines ofCoventry to close their works might be resolved later that day ifnational officials of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workerscould persuade the local shop stewards to accept proposals for asettlement which had been agreed with the management on theprevious day.An attempt by the Lord Mayor of Coventry on the previous day to overcome the deadlock in the strike by Chrysler workers at Rytonhad failed.    Although this initiative had led to the resumption of negotiations, the unions had subsequently rejected a proposal bythe company to defer for three months, and to make subject to satisfactory performance, the payment of fall-back and holiday pay to those of the men held most directly responsible for sub-standardproduction.    There was now a serious risk that the strike action would spread throughout the Chrysler Group;  and he therefore proposed to meet the Managing Director of Chryslers later that day in order to discuss the steps which the company might now take to prevent a further deterioration in the situation,    A debate on aPrivate Member&apos;s Motion on Industrial Relations in the motor industry was due to take place in the House of Commons on thefollowing Monday;  and, unless an end to the dispute was in sightby then* it would be necessary to consider the desirability of settingup an inquiry.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Secretaryof State for Employment,
6, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(73) 71) about the position of Clay CrossUrban District Council and the implementation of the housing finance Act.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe hearing of the Clay Cross councillors&apos; appeal against theirsurcharge by the District Auditor for losses incurred as a result of failure to implement the Housing Finance Act had now been fixed for9 and 10 July.    If their appeal were dismissed, they would becomedisqualified for office.    The constitution of a fresh council,however, was affected by legislative provisions whereby certainelections to fill casual vacancies were at present suspended.    Butthis suspension would cease to have effect in a number of areas,including Clay Cross, once an Order establishing successor parish councils had been made and brought into operation.    Such an order was now necessary in order to give effect to recommendationsrecently received from the Local Government Boundary Commission.If new councillors were elected at Clay Cross, however, theywould probably pursue the same policies as the present councillorsand refuse to implement the Housing Finance Act.    The making ofthe Order could be deferred; but such a course would be difficult tojustify.    If elections could not be held, it would be open toDerbyshire County Council to appoint a substitute council.    But theywere not under any obligation in this respect;  and they might eitherrefuse to co-operate or ask for a Housing Commissioner to beappointed before they appointed a council for the other functions ofthe local authority.    In the circumstances it would probably be preferable not to defer the making of the Order,    The appointmentof a Housing Commissioner should be considered, however, if thecouncillors lest their appeal.    This step had previously been avoided; but, if it were taken at once, it would serve to preventthe new councillors from repeating the process of defiance.In discussion there was general agreement that an unfortunatesituation might arise in Clay Cross if the Order establishingsuccessor parishes were not made.    The vacancies resulting fromthe disqualification of all the councillors would remain unfilled;  and,since Derbyshire County Council would probably not agree to appoint a substitute council, there would not be an authority to administer the services entrusted to the council of the Urban District of ClayCross,    &quot;While there was a risk that the appointment of a HousingCommissioner at Clay Cross might encourage other local authoritiesto believe that, if they were recalcitrant, they would in future beable to divest themselves of responsibility for implementing theHousing Finance Act, the Clay Cross councillors would be seen tohave suffered a defeat if they lost their appeal;  and this should deterother authorities from adopting a similar attitude of defiance.    it
could be argued that to appoint a Commissioner forthwith would not allow opportunity for the new councillors to adopt a more responsible attitude.    On the other hand it would be preferable thatthey should not be given the chance to repeat the defiance of their predecessors.    In Wales Housing Commissioners had been successfully appointed earlier in the year, both at Merthyr Tydfiland at Bedwas and Machen.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, if the Clay Cross Councillors failed in theirappeal and thus became disqualified, a Housing commissioner should be appointed forthwith.    Such an appointment should only be needed, however, until 1 April 1974, when the new district council which would be established under the reorganisation of localgovernment would become responsible for implementing the housing finance Act.    The Order to give effect to the Local GovernmentBoundary Commission^ recommendations in relation to successorparishes should be made forthwith and should be brought intooperation at an early date.Further rent increases were due to be made in October;  and,although it would be right in principle to adhere to the policy inthis matter which the Government had so far pursued with success,it might be desirable that the Committee on Counter inflationary measures should consider the implications of the forthcomingincreases before any public statement about them was made.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment -i. l;o arrange for the Order relating tosuccessor parishes to be made forthwith and tobe brought into operation at an early date;ii. if the Clay Cross councillors lost theirappeal, to arrange for a Housing commissioner to be appointed forthwith.3.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer toarrange for the Committee on Counter inflationary measures to consider the implications of the increases in council house rents which were dueto be made in October.10
Cabinet Office21 June 197311*THE ELECTRICAL   7. The Cabinet considered possible developments in theENGINEERING electrical engineering industry.    Their discussion, and theINDUSTRY conclusions reached, are recorded separately.
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTiCOPY no cabinet the ELECTRICALENGINEERINGINDUSTRYPreviousReference:CM(72) 48thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cm(73) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 7Thursday 21 June 1973 at 11.15 am the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that at their meeting on 2 November, 1972, the Cabinet had agreed that theReyrolle Parsons group (RP), a major employer in the North Eastthen under threat of liquidation, should receive Government supportunder stringent conditions until its long-term future could besettled.    At that time Messrs N M Rothschild were examining thegroup&apos;s position.    Their report had subsequently concluded thatRP was not viable in its present form and that a majorreconstruction was required;  and, although RP had contestedthese findings, they had conceded that they must be associated witha larger group in order to ensure greater financial stability.    Thethree possibilities which had now emerged were a takeover by theGeneral Electric Company (G.C); by a consortium of Clark-Chapman/John Thompson, Hawker Siddeley and British Insulated CallendersCables; or by Westinghouse Electric.    There had been no support for an association with other companies in Europe.    Neither of thesolutions involving British companies had been pressed with muchvigour; and each would involve substantial support, of the order of 10- 20 million, from the Government,    The ministerial committee on Economic Policy (EPC) had accordingly concluded that a takeover of RP by Westinghouse Electric was acceptable inprinciple, subject to satisfactory assurances about employment, inview of the large number of jobs at stake in the North East and inScotland, and about the role which RP would play in theWestinghouse organisation, with particular reference to research and development.    The Westinghouse Board had not yet decided infavour of the takeover;  and they might seek correspondingassurances from the Government about their status in the UnitedKingdom, particularly with reference to their freedom to tender for contracts for power station orders.    They were aware that theGovernment would not allow them to compete with the new nucleardesign and construction company for United Kingdom orders for nuclear islands; but they would be able to compete for contracts
for ancillary equipment, such as turbo-generators, for nuclear power stations.    The Westinghouse main Board were due todiscuss the possible takeover on 27 June;  and it would be helpful if the Minister for Industrial Development could be in a position by then to give them an indication of the Governments attitude.In discussion it was pointed out that Westinghouse had already been prevented from further expansion in the French market and that inthe longer term they intended to meet demand in Canada solelyfrom their Canadian plant.    There might therefore be a danger that the activities of RP under Westinghouse control would be tooheavily concentrated on the United Kingdom market and so resultin redundancies among the work forces of other british manufacturers of heavy electrical equipment.    It would thereforebe desirable to obtain assurances, if possible, that RP would continue to be able to compete for contracts in the european economic Community (e.c.), the United States and Canada.    TheGovernment, however, could influence to a considerable extentthrough the electricity generating boards the allocation of ordersbetween different manufacturers;  and it was known that one ofWestinghouse^ objectives in seeking to acquire RP was to obtain a further base for expansion within the e.c..    There was, indeed,some risk of a critical reaction from other members of the e.c. tothis extension of Westinghouse&apos;s European activities; and our postsabroad should be fully briefed to deal with any questions of this kind which might arise if the Westinghouse takeover of RP becameeffective.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister for Industrial Development should inform Westinghousebefore their Board meeting on 27 June that the Government wereprepared to endorse the proposed takeover in principle, subject totheir providing satisfactory assurances in particular about theirpolicy towards employment in RP factories and the maintenance of adequate research and development capacity in the United Kingdom.Thereafter, the Minister should negotiate the required assuranceswith Westinghouse, in consultation, as necessary, with theSecretary of State for Employment and other Ministers concerned.If the takeover were successfully accomplished, there might wellbe public criticism that a further major British company had passedunder United States control, particularly in view of the currentdisquiet about the Chrysler dispute; and the Minister for IndustrialDevelopment should therefore keep in close touch with the HomeSecretary throughout the negotiations with a view to ensuring themost effective public presentation of the reasons which had led theGovernment to accept the takeover.2
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Minister for Industrial Development -i. to inform Westinghouse Electric thatthe Government had no objection in principle to their proposed takeover of Reyrolle Parsons;ii, in consultation with the Home Secretary,the Secretary of State for Employment and other ministers concerned, to negotiate withWestinghouse Electric satisfactory assuranceson the points mentioned in discussion.Cabinet Office21 June 19733
