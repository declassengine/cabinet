He was grateful to them for their response to the Ministerial Groupls proposals.    In the case of the Tradeand Industry block of expenditure the Secretary of State had not felt ablo to accept the full reductions proposed.    V/hereas theGroup had proposed a reduction of  20 million in selectiveregional assistance and  30 million in selective national assistance to industry, the Secretary of State had only acceptedreductions of  5 million and  15 million respectively.    TheSecretary of State had suggested, instead, a reduction in therate of non-selective regional grants to industry or a delay in payment of these grants; but these alternatives seemed open to considerable political objection.    Compared with the Group,proposed reduction of  85 million for this block of expenditure,the Secretary of Statefs proposals totalled only  45 million, ofwhich  11 million was contingent on postponement or cancellation of the national satellite programme.     On nationalised industrycapital expenditure, the Secretary of State did not feel that areduction of  30 million in the steel investment programme wouldbe practicable; but he judged, subject to discussion with thechairman of the British Steel Corporation, that  12 million mightbe possible, with additional reductions on other industries tomaintain the proposed total reduction of  70 million.    TheMinister of Posts and Telecommunications was prepared to acceptthe proposed reduction of  30 million in Post Office capitalexpenditure.    But he had made it clear that this would havea significant effect on the waiting list for telephones;  and theCabinet might therefore wish to consider, in the light of their
discussion of the other items, whether some slightly smallerreduction would be preferable.    On health and personal social services, a reduction of  21-1 million was now proposed, subjectto the agreement of the Secretary of State.    On overseas aid,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was not available for consultation; but the Minister for Oversea Development was prepared to accept a reduction of  20 million, subject to thePrime Ministers approval.    On Maplin airport, the reductionof  8 million had been agreed by officials a,s the effect of adeferment of the completion date.    The present target date of1980 now seemed no longer realistic; but, since the Bill was atpresent before Parliament, there might be a presentationaldifficulty in announcing this at present.    On common services, ithad been indicated that the savings from building postponementsmight be more than offset by foreseen new requirements; but it did not seem to be possible to accept additional commitments inthis field at a time when other programmes were being cut.Taking the programmes as a whole, the total reductions whichhad emerged from his discussion with the Ministers concerned(excluding Defence) now amounted to  522 million, of which 70 million was subject to confirmation by the Ministers concerned.The net total so far confirmed was therefore about  450 million,which did not seem to leave sufficient margin for any additional expenditure which might be thought necessary to enable publicopinion to accept some cf the major savings now proposed.General In discussion it was suggested that the implications for theindividual programmes of the reductions now proposed would depend on whether these reductions were regarded as affectingthe single year 1974-75, or foreshadowed similar reductions in expenditure in each of the subsequent years.    The present proposals were in fact limited to achieving reductions over thenext 2 years.    For the subsequent years, the Cabinet had alreadyrecognised the problem created by the pre-emption of the contingency reserve provided in the last Public expenditure white Paper;  and they would be reverting to that question whenthey received the annual report on the Public Expenditure Review.But acceptance of the particular reductions now proposed did notnecessarily imply any commitment to make similar reductions in the later years.    The reconstitution of the contingency reserve for those years was a separate matter, which would need to be considered on its own merits.2
Presentation The presentation of the present proposals would also need to beconsidered further.    Some of the proposals, for example on agriculture and industrial training, would be defensible as partof a combination of measures announced as a major effort toreduce overheating in the economy but would be difficult to defendin any other context.    For some other programmes, however,such as education, a major announcement would involve moredifficulty than a decision to slow down the implementation ofexisting programmes by administrative action.    The method of presentation would also need to take into account the likelyreaction of the Governments supporters in Parliament and thecountry and of public opinion generally, as well as the implicationfor the forthcoming discussions with the Trades Union congress and the Confederation of British Industry, who would be particularly concerned, respectively, with expenditure on thesocial services and programmes in support of indxistrial growth.All these presentational issues would need further consideration in the light of the decisions taken on the proposals.In the case of some programmes considerable shortfalls were now expected in the planned level of expenditure.    For 1973-74the net shortfall exceeded  200 million; and some credit mightbe taken for this.    For 1974-75, the total shortfall was very considerably outweighed by estimating changes in the otherdirection; and it was not therefore possible to give credit to individual Departments for the shortfall which was likely to occur.But, -where shortfalls were expected in individual programmes,it would be preferable, in public presentation, to indicate thisrather than to incur the odium of a deliberate reduction in the planned provision.In discussion of particular programmes the following main points were made:-Trade and It had been thought necessary to propose some reduction in industry selective assistance to industry in order to maintain thepolitical balance of the reductions as a whole.    The projectsbeing supported by these programmes of assistance were,however, important for exports and for the industrial growth onwhich future public expenditure programmes ultimately depended.The amounts available for selective regional and national assistance were already committed well into 1974-75; and theoriginally proposed reductions would leave little scope for morecommitments for that year.    This would entail the abandonment of the new regional machinery which had already been successful in obtaining additional finance from the private sector for regional industrial investment.    It would also reduce the level ofexpenditure below that formerly incurred under the local employment Acts;  and it would leave insufficient funds to
finance projects proposed by the task forces set up to deal withcoal and steel redundancies.    If any further reduction wasnecessary beyond the amounts now suggested,  5 million for selective regional assistance and  15 million for selective national assistance, the Secretary of State would prefer to reduce .he rateof. grant payable on non-selective regional assistance, although this would clearly involve considerable difficulty.    On civilaerospace projects the proposed reduction would involve defermentof the HS 146 project and of the project for a 30, 000 lb thrust aero-engine.    The saving which might be obtained on the spaceprogramme would depend on the reaction of other European countries to the initiative recently made by the Minister for Aerospace and shipping in this field.Employment The proposed net reduction of  20 million allowed for increased expenditure of  15 million on the Training Opportunities Scheme.The saving would be found by postponing the change from levy togrant financing by one year.    This would be unwelcome to theGovernment&apos;s supporters; but it could be justified as part of ageneral reduction in expenditure programmes.    It would benecessary to make special arrangements for the financing oftraining in the construction industry.In view of the importance of the steel investment programme for industrial growth, a deliberate reduction in the capital programmerecently approved did not seem possible; but, subject to confirmation by the British Steel Corporation, there would probablybe a &quot;slippage&quot;, of the order of  12 million, in any event.    Theremainder of the  70 million reduction proposed for industriessponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry and theScottish Development Department would fall primarily on distributionservices in the gas and electricity industries, which would reducethe standard of service to consumers.    No reduction was proposedin expenditure on electricity generating equipment; and there wasa risk that this programme might need to be speeded up.    some reduction was proposed in aircraft purchases by the British AirwaysBoard; and it was- proposed not to sanction a helicopter service to north Sea oil installations, on the assumption that this could beprovided by private enterprise.    For the railways, a reduction of 10 million should be possible; and the programme would be fullyreviewed later in the summer.    The proposed reduction of 30 million in capital expenditure by the Post Office would adversely affect the waiting list for telephones; and there was acase for considering a rather smaller reduction.4NationalisedIndustrfllsCapitalExpenditure
Substantial reductions were proposed in the road programme andin miscellaneous local services.    This would involve a35 per cent reduction in new commitments for trunk roads and a50 per cent reduction in new commitments for principal roads.The planned road programme would thus take longer to complete;but the shape of the strategic trunk network would not be changed.The reduction on miscellaneous local services would fallprimarily on capital schemes controlled by loan sanction.    In thecase of water and sewerage there would be no growth in the current year, instead of a planned increase of 7 per cent; and theie wouldbe an actual reduction in locally determined schemes.    Theproposed reductions, taken together with the increases in expenditure on housing, should be presented as a major shift of resources reflecting revised priorities.    Care would, however,need to be taken to obtain the right geographical distribution ofthe economies, as well as j&amp; satisfactory balance betweenreductions in capital and current expenditure-    The reductions should bear hardest on those parts of the economy which were most overloaded; and priority should be given to projects ofparticular local value.    The reorganisation of local governmentwould tend to observe the comparison between one year and thenext;  and it might be possible to justify an announcement of theproposed reductions now on the grounds that the new localauthorities would need to know the Governments overall intentions as a basis for their own planning.There would be particular difficulty in making commensuratereductions i:i Scotland and Wales.    In Scotland there was strong pressure to build up infrastructure for the North Sea oil industry;and reductions could not be justified on the grounds of any over-loading of the economy.    It would, however, be possible to makea reduction of  5 million on roads, compared with the proposed 10 million, and a further  5 million on miscellaneous local services; and this would enable expenditure in support of theNorth Sea oil industry to be exempted from reduction.    In Wales,it could not be argued that a reduction in the road programmerepresented a shift of resources towards housing, since theproposed changes on housing would not benefit Wales.    wales was also lagging behind the rest of the country in the constructionof motorways.    While some reduction could be made, it would need to be a smaller figure than the reduction made in Scotland.kosstThe present system of^improvement grants was also puttingexcessive pressure on resources;  and changes were at present under consideration which would restrict the grants payable on second houses and enable conditions to be imposed so as toprevent abuse of the grant system.    A draft White Paper would shortly be considered by the Home and Social Affairs Committee.5
The proposed reduction, consequential on a postponement of thecompletion date of Maplin airport raised a serious presentationalproblem.    Although it seemed clear that the present target datecould not be adhered to, it would seriously jeopardise thepassage of the present Bill through Parliament if this change were announced now.    Once the Bill had been passed, there was a case for announcing the rate of progress likely to be achieved inconstructing the airport.    It was also questionable whether anannouncement needed to be made at this stage about the ChannelTunnel, since negotiations were still continuing and, if the project were cancelled, an additional  4 million would become payable in cancellation charges.    On the Thames Barrier somepostponement seemed justified, although this would pre-emptconsultation with the Greater London Council and the other authorities concerned.education the proposed reductions would involve severe cuts in capitalexpenditure commitments on universities and polytechnics andwould be very unpopular with the communities concerned.    Theeducation programme was also making an additional saving inthat parental contributions to students)grants had risen, becauseof the effect of inflation on incomes, by more than the amount ofthe recent increase in the level of grants.    Expenditurereductions of the order now proposed could not be justifiedunless very substantial and genuine reductions were made inother public expenditure programmes.Health andPersonalSocial ServicesHere also the reductions proposed would involve severe defer-ment of schemes of high priority to improve conditions in hospitals and to provide local health centres.    The figure nowproposed,  211- million, could be contemplated only on thebasis that other major programmes bore a proportionate shareof reductions and that public office building was severelyrestricted.    It would also be desirable to make modest increases in some programmes cf special sensitivity, for example services for the deaf and disabled, which would help to make the overallreduction more acceptable to public opinion.SocialSecurityThe proposed reduction of  5 million under this heading could beachieved by removing the right to unemployment benefit fromworkpeople who were temporarily suspended from work.    It was,however, for consideration whether this change should be made ata moment when discussions were just about to be started againwith the Trades Union Congress.6
aw and The proposed reduction of  8 million was on account of order expenditure on police, prisons and law courts.    The reduction was acceptable to the Home Secretary; but the Lord chancellor would wish to discuss the reductions in expenditure on law courtsfurther with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Agriculture The proposed reduction of  25 million was acceptable as part ofa major reduction in public expenditure generally; but, if therewas no general announcement, it would be preferable not to mention it at this stage, since it could anyway not be implementeduntil the next annual review.Civil Service The proposal envisaged that civil service manpower, which amounted to 700, 000 on 1 April, 1973, should rise to no morethan 715, 000 by April, 1974, and should then be restricted tothat level for a year.    While this would create real problems insome Departments, some reduction in the previous plannedestimates seemed desirable, particularly if the Governmentwere to press local authorities to restrain the very large recentgrowth in manpower in local government.    Major office building for the civil service should be severely restricted, although some minor schemes might usefully continue.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now been able to consider the main political andeconomic implications of the proposed reductions in expenditure programmes, with the exception of defence.    For the most part,the reductions now proposed were acceptable to the ministers concerned provided that commensurate reductions were made inother programmes.    The Cabinet would need to resume their discussion again later in the week, to examine the amount of thereduction in the defence programme and to consider further theimportant presentational issues which had been raised.    In themeantime the Chancellor of the Exchequer should complete anyfurther necessary discussions with individual Ministers.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tocomplete any necessary further discussions with individual Ministers concerned.3.      Agreed to resume their discussion again later in the w&amp;ek.Cabinet Office16 May? 1973 7
