3. THE LORD PRESIDENT said that he had considered,in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s recent discussion, the form of the motion about the new Parliamentary building which would best discharge the Governments undertaking to enable theHouse of Commons to reach a decision on this matter while not committing the Government to undertake the project inany particular form in the immediate future.    As a resulthe proposed to table a Motion &quot;That this House approves theconstruction of the proposed new Spence/Webster Parliamentarybuilding in due course&quot; but to arrange for an amendment tobe proposed at the same time, substituting &quot;a newParliamentary building,: for &quot;the proposed new Spence/WebsterParliamentary building&quot;.      If this amendment was debatedbefore the substantive Motion, the Governments purpose should be achieved.In discussion it was suggested that, if the amendment wascarried and the substantive Motion was accordingly notdebated, those Members who favoured the Spence/Websterbuilding might feel that they had been deprived of theopportunity to express their view.    It would therefore be preferable to table two Motions, one in terms of the Spence/Webster building, the other in terms of &quot;a newParliamentary building&quot;, and to arrange for them to be debated together.Cabinet Office19 June 19732

There were some indications, however, thatrelatively small modifications to those proposals might satisfya large section of African opinion; and this view vended to be confirmed by a letter which he had recently received from ;Bishop Muzorewa, who seemed to be supported by a majority ofthe African National Council (ANC), putting forward proposalswhich were not unreasonable in themselves.    But Mr Ian Smith,the leader of the Rhodesian regime, continued to insist that the africans must accept the 1971 proposals as they stood,justifying his attitude on the grounds that most sensible Africanshad modified their views since the Pearce Commission testedRhodesian opinion in that year but were prevented by ANCintimidation from openly declaring that they would now acceptthe proposals.    He had provided no evidence, however, tosubstantiate this claim; and he had merely suggested that, if theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary visited Rhodesia, arrange-ments would be made for him to meet a number of &quot;responsible&quot;Africans who would express to him privately their support for asettlement on the 1971 basis.    This suggestion was clearlyunacceptable.    But the Governments supporters would not be content that the Government should appear to remain whollyinactive; and it might therefore be helpful if the permanent under Secretary of State, Sir Denis Greenhill, visited Rhodesialater that week in order to convey a considered reply toMr Smith&apos;s proposal and to assess the local situation at first hand.The visit must be conditional, however, on Mr smith s agreeing that Sir Denis Greenhill should be enabled to have discussions withBishop Muzorewa and other leading Africans as well as with members of the regime in Salisbury.
But, although thin visit could contribute to the more convincingpresentation of the Governments policies it was unlikely to revealany real flexibility in Mr smith s attitude or, therefore, any-immediate prospect of progress towards a settlement.    If so,there would be no effective alternative to renewing sanctions inthe following November; and it would be important to prepare the way, by private discussions with the Governments supporters,for an announcement to this effect on about 12 July.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that,subject to any reconsideration which might be required in thelight of Sir Denis GreenhillS visit to Rhodesia, the cabinet approved these proposals in principle.    It was important, however,that the regime in Salisbury should not be allowed to form theimpression that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would beprepared to visit Rhodesia on the ambiguous basis which Mr smith had proposed; and the terms of the message which it was proposed that Sir Denis Greenhill should convey to Mr Smithshould be reconsidered from this point of view.    TheGovernments supporters might be more reluctant to contemplate the renewal of sanctions than in previous years; but the majorityof them would probably accept it on broad grounds of national interest.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office19 June 19732
