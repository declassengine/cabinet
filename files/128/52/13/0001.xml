The Cabinet were informed of the business to be1.GreeceRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(73) 34thConclusions,Minute 2Soviet Uniontaken in the House of Commons during the following week.to attract critical comment in Parliament, where he waswell known to a number of Members.    This might be themore untimely in that the former King of Greece was about to pay a private visit to this country and might even be intending to settle here.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that shortly after the recent visit to Rhodesia by the Permanent Under Secretary of State,Sir Denis Greenhill, the leader of the regime in Salisbury,Mr Ian Smith, had delivered a speech in which he had adoptedan uncompromising attitude about the conditions of a constitutional settlement.    So far as we knew, the meeting which Mr Smith had undertaken to arrange with Bishop Muzorewaof the African National Council (ANC) was still in prospect;but the speech was likely to make it more difficult for the ANCto negotiate constructively with the regime.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that the Secretary of State,who was attending the opening proceedings of the Conferenceon Security and Co-operation in Europe in Helsinki, had taken the opportunity to discuss certain related issues privately withthe Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, whose attitude had been disappointingly negative.    In particular, he had maintained his opposition to the suggestion that Rudolph Hess,the former Nazi leader, should be released from SpandauPrison on compassionate grounds; and he had refused to discussthe question of the emigration of Soviet Jews, in contrast to themore co-operative attitude on this issue which Mr Brezhnev had adopted in the United States.    He had also returned a non-committal reply to the suggestion that he might visit thiscountry on his way back to the Soviet Union from the next session of the General Assembly of the United Nations.1
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that the recent assassinationof General Hammad Shehab, the Minister of Defence, hadintroduced an additional element of uncertainty into theinternal situation in Iraq, especially since General Shehab,who had been closely associated with the President of Iraq,was one of the stronger members of the regime and arepresentative of the more moderate wing of the Baasth Party.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
UROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRSSugar RefiningMarginPreviousReference:CM(73) 34thConclusions,Minute 33. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that since the Cabinets previous discussion of the sugarrefining subsidy there had been consultations with the EuropeanCommissioner responsible for Agriculture, M Lardinois.    TheCommissioner now appeared to understand the serious political implications if the Commission abruptly announced its opinion thatthe subsidy was illegal; and he had agreed to delay publication inorder that we might raise the issue in the Council of Ministers(Agriculture) Meeting on 16-17 July.   He had suggested that weshould formally seek a derogation under Article 93 of the Treatyof Rome, when action by the Commission would automatically be suspended for three months.    To this extent the situation was nowless tense; but we should need to continue to press for asatisfactory conclusion.New ZealandPreviousReference:CM(73) 34thConclusions,Minute 3The Ministerial Committee on Europe had considered further therequest by the Government of New Zealand for allowance to bemade for the depreciation in the value of the   sterling in relationto the special arrangements for the prices of New Zealand dairy products.    The Commission had applied to our imports underthese arrangements the monetary compensatory amounts intro-duced to offset the depreciation of the   against the Communitycurrencies;  and they now expected us to transfer the sums involved to New Zealand.    We had so far refused to do so,partly on the grounds that the products concerned were not in freecirculation within the Community and partly because any concession in this respect to New Zealand could have majorrepercussions in other contexts.   -But it might become difficultto sustain this position, since we should be seen publicly to be in dispute with the Commission in order to avoid meeting the NewZealand request.    The New Zealand Government had proposedthat the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Walding) should visit the United Kingdom shortly in order to discuss the subject; andwe must now consider urgently the various options open to us and seek to ascertain whether the Commission might be prepared toaccept some alternative arrangements.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the statements by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 34thConclusions,Minute 54. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that in some respects the result of the recent election to theproposed new Assembly in Northern Ireland had been gatherdisappointing.   The Social Democratic and Labour Party hadfared well; and, provided that they could maintain PartyX       discipline co^aslon, they should constitute a significant element in the Assembly, which would be genuinely representative of the roman Catholic community.    But the Alliance Party had obtainedrather fewer seats than they had expected; while the non-officialUnionists, who were opposed to the constitutional proposals inthe recent White Paper, had been relatively successful.    In thesecircumstances, although it should be possible for the Assembly tomeet at the end of July or shortly thereafter, it was difficult toestimate the prospects for the appointment of an Executive.The process of negotiating with the various Parties in order toelicit some consensus of view about its composition might well prove to be protracted.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland.
5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat a County Court judgment on the previous day in a test caserelating to the Counter-Inflation (Temporary Provisions) Act,1972 had found in favour of an employee of the LondonCo-operative Society (LCS) who had claimed payment of a  1per week increase in wages for 5 weeks between 1 January, 1973,when the increase had been due to be paid in fulfilment of anagreement concluded in February, 1971, and 4 February, 1973,the day before that on which the Government had made an Orderfreezing the payment-of the increase to all LCS staff on theground that it contravened Section 3(2) of the Act.    It was perhaps significant that the LCS had not availed themselves oftheir right to claim that Section 3 of the Act had relieved  them of the obligation to pay the increase in question; and it waspermissible to infer that they had wished to pay it.    The right ofappeal lay only with the Society, who would have six weeks in which to consider their position but were unlikely to carry the matter anyfurther.The judgment would open the way for the Union of Shop Distributiveand Allied Workers (USDAW) to reach agreement with the LCSthat there should be similar payments to some 50, 000 workers inthe LCS and similar Co-operative Societies.    But, although there were suggestions that other groups, such as the agricultural workers, who had had agreed increases in pay deferred by the standstill might also be able to benefit from the Courts ruling,there were unlikely to be cases where the circumstances wereprecisely the same.    Moreover, paragraph 113 of the Stage pay Code made it plain that an equivalent amount to a-ny suchpayment arising from an obligation incurred before the introductionof the standstill must be counted against the Stage 2 pay limit forthe group in question.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit was unfortunate that the operation of the legislation giving effectto the counter-inflation policy should have been successfullychallenged; and it would be a matter for concern if other unions were able to follow the example set by USDAW.    There might be some doubt, however, about the Courts judgment in this case,on the grounds that it appeared to have ignored the fact that,because of the provisions of Section 3 of the Act, no legal obligation to pay the increase was involved.    The Secretary ofState for Employment should seek urgent advice from the LawOfficers on this point.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.5SNDUS TRIALAFFAIRSOperation ofC ounte r-Inflation(temporary provisions) Act1972
6.        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(73) 74) about the Channel tunnel project.THE MINISTER FOR TRANSPORT INDUSTRIES said that thematerial was now available on which the Cabinet could decide whether the Channel Tunnel project was desirable in principle,provided that acceptable financial terms could be negotiated.Cross-Channel traffic had grown rapidly in recent years and was expected to continue to increase still further.    If this traffic was to be accommodated, only two courses of action were opento the Government - either to continue to rely on the developmentof sea and air services or to supplement them with a Tunnel.The studies by consultants indicated that, on central assumptions,the project would pay and would be cheaper in the medium andlonger term than the alternative.    It would provide the regionswith improved through transport services without any substantialnew concentration of development in the South-East; and it wouldrelieve the roads to the ports of some of the growth in ceoss-Channel traffic.    Against these considerations had to be set the damage to a limited area of South-East Kent; the fact that theTunnel would require a large amount of investment in the years to 1980, as opposed to the more gradual cost of the alternative;and the consequent higher sensitivity of the Tunnel to variations in traffic and revenue, although v^gy^ pessimistic assumptionswould be required in order to j sduT5e       return as low as10 per cent.   The full benefits of the Tunnel would only beobtainable if a new high-quality rail link was provided, at an estimated cost of  120 million; and this had already been acceptedby the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.The financial terms proposed by the private companies involved,however, were unacceptable; and he had agreed with his Frenchcolleague a reply inviting them to consider alternative terms,based on the advice of financial consultants.    As regards thequestions of procedure and presentation which would now arise ithad been agreed with the French Government that it would beimpossible to settle the outstanding issues and to sign theAgreement dealing with the second phase of the work by the endof July, as had originally been envisaged.    Provided that thefinancial terms could be settled in time, however, it would stillbe desirable that a White Paper should be published before the recess; and the necessary short Money Bill should be enactedbefore the end of the present Session in the Autumn in order toenable the Agreement to be signed in November.    It would then benecessary to present a Hybrid Bill at the beginning of the next session in order to authorise our participation in the third phase of the project, involving the constructions of the Tunnel itself.
In discussion it was suggested that the principal function of theTunnel would be to carry tourist traffic and that it would makeonly a relatively small contribution to the carriage of inter-national freight.    It would be unlikely, therefore, to contributesignificantly to the relief of congestion caused by heavy lorrytraffic on the roads.    Moreover, the construction of the tunnel would make a heavy demand on resources during a relatively short period, whereas the development of sea and air services could be more gradual and more easily adjusted in the light ofrevised forecasts of traffic.    The public expenditure surveywhich would shortly be presented to the Cabinet would reveal aserious pressure on resources during the later years of the survey period; and some unpalatable decisions might need tobe taken in order to implement the Cabinets earlier decision that the contingency allowance should be reconstituted.    this problem would be aggravated if room had to be found for majorinvestment projects such as the Channel Tunnel and Maplinairport.    There would be serious risk of public criticism if, asa result, it was not possibj^fully to implement the recommenda-tions of the task forces which were studying the provision of alternative employment in areas threatened by coal and steelclosures or if reductions had to be made in social programmessuch as hospitals which were already widely regarded asinadequate.    There would also be criticism of the environmentaldamage which the Tunnel terminal works would inflict on an attractive area of the countryside.On the other hand, on the assumption that a high quality rail linkwas provided, it would be possible to provide through railservices to Scotland and other regions of the country.   agreement had already been reached between the British and other Europeanrailway authorities for the use of British rolling stock on theContinent in order to facilitate this.    While the project hadattracted adverse comment in Scotland, there had been no generalcriticism in Wales.    The congestion caused by heavy lorrytraffic would be no less severe if the Tunnel were not built;and, although a considerable proportion of the traffic through theTunnel would admittedly consist of tourists and private cars, a significant amount of freight would adopt this route, so relieving the roads and cross-Channel ports.    There had been generalagreement at the Cabinefs recent discussion of the Governmentssocial and economic strategy on the need to give priority to continue investment as a prerequisite of the expansion on whichsocial and other programmes ultimately depended.   The Tunnelwas the cheapest and most economic means of dealing with thegrowth of traffic; and a decision to abandon the project at thisstage might appear to be inconsistent with our position as amember of the European Economic Community.7
It followed that, if a decision was taken to proceed with the project primarily on economic grounds, it would be desirable toencourage the maximum use of the Tunnel for the transport of freight and to emphasise that, because it would be linked with themain rail network, it should bring considerable advantages toregions other than the South East.    Even on this basis, however, a major effort would be needed to convince some of the government&apos;s supporters of the merits of the project.    It would be preferable,therefore, not to attempt to debate the Money Bill before the summer Recess but to defer it until the end of the Session in theAutumn.    This might also enable the Government to avoidconceding unduly wide terms of reference for the Select Committeewhich would consider the subsequent Hybrid Bill.    The Money Billshould also be drafted in a form which was not readilysusceptible to detailed amendment.    Provided that the financial terms were settled in time, however, there might still be advantage in publishing a White Paper before the Recess, in order to providea basis for influencing public and Parliamentary opinion in favourof the project.In further discussion the following main points were made: -a. Although the funds for the project would be found mainly from the private sector, the Tunnel would make aconsiderable demand on resources and the Government-guaranteed finance would be raised in competition withthe Governments own borrowing.    Nevertheless, the costof the Tunnel project, apart from the rail link, would not enter into the public expenditure survey.b. The Tunnel might be open to greater securityhazards than other forms of cross-Channel transport.This risk, however, had already been carefully studied;and it appeared that it could reasonably be discountedin the light of the precautions which would be taken.c. In view of the French Governments interest in the project, it was for consideration whether we should seek to obtain some concession from them in return for our participation in its next phase.    It might be worthexploring this possibility in the context of the currentdiscussion about the size and weight of heavy lorries.In general, however, it was illusory to suppose that theFrench Government would concede us any significantadvantage in acknowledgement of our agreement to proceedwith the project, although, if it were abandoned, theywould be likely to react sharply.8
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, provided acceptable financial termscould be secured, the Channel Tunnel project should be allowedto proceed to the next stage.    Before giving final approval,however, the Cabinet would wish to be satisfied that the terms were satisfactory.    The Minister for Transport industries should therefore continue his discussions with the FrenchGovernment and the companies and should report the outcomefor the Cabinet&apos;s consideration.    The Cabinet confirmed the viewof the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy that, if theTunnel were to proceed, a high-quality rail link should beprovided as part of the project.    A White Paper could not bepublished until the financial terms had been approved.    Ifterms could be settled and approved in hime, however, there might be advantage in publishing a White Paper in July, in orderto influence public and Parliamentary opinion in favour of the project.    The Secretary of State for the Environment should therefore circulate a draft of the White Paper to the cabinet for consideration as soon as practicable.    But no attempt should be made to secure the Second Reading of the necessaryMoney Bill before the Summer Recess.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for the Environment andthe Minister for Transport Industries to proceed accordingly.9
7.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP(73) 73), to whichwere attached draft consultation documents on the motorway/railaccess routes from outer London to Maplin and on the New Towndesignation area.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the draft consultation documents had been considered by the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment.The two main issues remaining for decision were the treatmentof the road connection from Maplin within inner London and the timing of publication.    On the first, the consultation documentshowed the road link (and, similarly, the rail link) only as faras the periphery of London, where it connected with the outerLondon orbital road.    At that point there would be a veryconsiderable dispersal of road traffic from Maplin; and thevolume proceeding to central London would be relatively small.There were conclusive legal and practical objections to delineatingthe road link from the periphery into central London.    The natureof the inner London road network was a separate and self-contained issue; and it was also one of the major subjects dealtwith in the Lay fie Id Report on the Greater London development plan, which was currently before him for decision.    Moreover,a radical review of all their major road proposals had recently been announced by the Greater London Council (GLC),with whom early consultations would be necessary.    But, althoughit would not be possible in the consultation document to define theroad link beyond the periphery of London, it would be desirable atthe time of publication to refer to the major expansion in the road and rail connections with Heathrow and Gatwick which would be unavoidable if existing airports had to bear the entire brunt of thevery great expansion in air travel which was to be expected duringthe next two decades.    As regards timing, it was proposed that publication should take place on 23 July, which was in fact theearliest practicable date.    Any further postponement would be liable to create suspicion that the documents had been deliberatelywithheld until after Parliament had gone into Recess; and defer-ment until after the Recess would involve unacceptably long delay.In discussion it was suggested that the treatment of the road linkproposed in the draft consultation document would weaken the credibility of the Maplin project.    But there seemed to be no practical alternative.    It would accordingly be necessary toemphasise that primary responsibility for the London road networkrested with the GLC, with whom there would be urgent consulta-tions; that the main flow of passengers from Maplin to central london would travel on the rail link; and that the new airportwould produce only a small addition to the total road traffic to central London.
As regards timing there was general agreement that, eventhough there might be some adverse reaction from those affectedby the proposals discussed in the consultation documents, early publication was desirable.   Despite the unfavourable commentwhich might be provoked if the documents were published only afew days before the Parliamentary Recess, the progress of theMaplin Development Bill in the House of Lords would be facilitated if they were available early in the week beginning23 July, when the Committee Stage was due to begin.    On that basis, it might be preferable to postpone until the Autumn therestatement of the Government&apos;s policy on the Maplin project asa whole in order to allow time for public reaction to the consultation documents to become evident.    A draft of theproposed restatement would be available very shortly forconsideration; and the question of timing might then be examined further.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet agreed that it was not possible for the consultationdocument to delineate the road link beyond its junction with the outer London orbital road.    It would have to be made clear,when the document was published, that primary responsibilityfor the road system within London rested with the GLC; that immediate discussions were being inaugurated with them; andthat any failure to make proper provision for road traffic inrelation to Maplin must be laid at their door.    As regards timing,the Cabinet agreed that in the interests of facilitating the progressof the Maplin Development Bill in the House of Lords, the consultation documents should be published on 23 July.    there might be advantage in arranging for the simultaneous publicationof a short document presenting the proposals to the public in clear and simple terms; and immediate consideration should begiven to this possibility.    The draft of the proposed restatementof the Governments policy in relation to the Maplin project as awhole should be circulated during the following week; and furtherconsideration should then be given to the timing of its publication in relation to that of the consultation documents.    In the mean-time, it would be important to avoid any public indication of thedecisions which the Cabinet had reached.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment -i,    to arrange for the publication of the consultation documents on 23 July;
ii. in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council, to consider the simultaneouspublication of a short document presenting theproposals in simple terms;iii. to inaugurate immediate discussions with the glc on the steps to be taken in order to make provision within Greater London for the additionalroad traffic likely to be generated by the newairport at Maplin^3.    Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrangefor a draft restatement of the Governments policy inrelation, to the Maplin project as a whole to be circulated for consideration during the following week.Cabinet office July, 197312
