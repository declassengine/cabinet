PARLIAMENTARY   10 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.capital punishment:Northern Ireland(emergency provisions) bill the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill was due to receiveits Second Reading on 17 April,    It would have the effect of abolishing capital punishment in Northern Ireland in so far as theprovisions of the Special Powers Acts were concerned..    By virtueof the Northern Ireland Criminal Justice Actg 1966p however,, the death penalty would still remain for certain other offences$ includingthe murder of a police officer or a servant of the Crown0    TheMinisters concerned had formed the view that the Bill should now beso amended as to abolish the death penalty entirely in NorthernIreland,,    He therefore proposed thate on Second Reading, heshould announce the Governments intention to table a new Clauseto that effectg which would be debated in Committee of the ^hoteHouse, and would be the subject of a free vote.    During the debate on the Clause he proposed to argue that, when the Parliament at westminster had abolished capital punishment and had reaffirmedits opposition to its reintroduction in the previous day8 s debate ona Private Member&apos;s Bill, it would be wrong that it should beretained in any part of the United Kingdom.    He would also maintain that the Bill provided for trial by judges alone in the case of certainterrorist offences;  that the imposition of a capital sentence in atrial conducted without a jury was manifestly unacceptable; that itwas inequitable that persons tried by jury should be liable to the death penalty, while those who were tried by judges alone were not;and that this constituted a further strong reason for abolishingcapital punishment in Northern Ireland.    He might also wish toindicate that in his personal judgment capital punishment was not an effective deterrent in a terrorist situation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that in this matter it was objectionable ttot only that the law should differ as between one part of the United Kingdomand another but also that within Northern Ireland itself capitalcharges should attract different sentences according to whetherthey were tried by jury or not.    It was also right that the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland should indicate his personal convictionon the issue.    But it was for consideration how much he should say we announcing, on Second Reading, that a new Clause would beintroduced; it might be desirable that he should confine himself to giving a fairly clear indication, at that early stage, of the reasonsfor introducing the Clause.    A Motion to commit the Clause to aCommittee of the whole House should be tabled before the recess and should be debated as soon as possible after Parliamentreconvened.
The Cabinet -Took notes with approval^ the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the President of theRepublic of Vietnam,, Mr Nguyen, van Thieus had called on him on10 April,    As regards the situation in South Vietnam the president had said that the Communist forces in the South had been receivingconsiderable reinforcements of tanks and heavy artillery;  and,although he did not think that they represented an acute danger atpresent, he feared that they might do so in 6 months&apos; time unlessthe United States were able to bring pressure to bear on theirsuppliers.    The President had also been seriously concerned aboutthe position in the Khmer Republic.    He had evinced a low opinionof the Khmer army and had judged that much would depend on thesuccess of the United States in bringing a restraining influence tobear on the Governments of the Soviet Union, the people s republic of China and North Vietnam.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,together with a number of other countries, we had evacuated women and children from our Embassies in Phnom Penh in view of the deterioration in the situation in the Khmer Republic, particularlyin the neighbourhood of the capital.    The position in Laos wassimilarly unsatisfactory.    The proposed provisional Governmentof National Union had not yet been forced and the outlook was uncertainTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therewere signs of renewed instability in Cyprus.    But, although therehad been a number of acts of violence, the situation was not yetcritically dangerous.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Prime Minister of Iran,Mr Hoveyda, had just concluded a successful visit to this country,during which he had expressed interest in the development of joint industrial ventures with the United Kingdom, with a view,, particularly.to exploiting third markets.    In reply he had impressed on mr Hoveyda our concern about the slow progress which was beingmade in implementing the understanding reached at St Moritz betweenthe Shah of Iran and the oil companies.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.3
-EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRS3, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)on 9 and 10 April had reached no decisions on levels of pricesunder the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 1973-74 andwould be returning to the subject at a further meeting on16-17 April.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said Ms visit to Romeon 9 and 10 April had been useful in clarifying the attitude of theItalian Government towards the Community0      There were several matters on which the United Kingdom and Italy hadcommon interests;    andt   since the Italian Government were clearly anxious to treat us as sillies in Community affairs,  itwould be to our advantage to follow up this possibility by further Ministerial contacts,,The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.INDUSTRIALAFFAIRS******National HealthServiceAncillaryWorkersPreviousReference:CM(73) 22ndConclusion SjMinute 640 THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat on the previous evening he had met the leaders of the fourunions representing the National Health Service ancillary workers;and he now hoped that it would be possible to reach agreement withthem on a pay settlement which would bring the current industrial action to an end after the meeting of the Ancillary Staffs Council onthe following day.    This could well involve agreement to set time limits on the introduction of incentive bonus schemes under an existing agreement, together with the advancement of theintroduction of the 1973 instalment of progress towards equal pay for women, which was now due on 1 October0    The settlement would, however, be in accordance with the Pay CodeIn discussion it was pointed out that Press reports were tending to make it appear that the Government were now ready to make payments in excess of the limits permitted by the Stage 2 pay policyin order to secure a settlement of the ancillary workers1 dispute.Now that so little support for industrial action seemed to persistit was essential to make it clear that this was not so and that there could be no question of approving a new productivity agreement.It was also desirable in the present circumstances to avoid making any larger concession than was necessary as regards the advancement of the equal pay instalment, even though this mightbe permissible under the Pay Code, in order to avoidrepercussions elsewhere; in particular, there appeared to be no grounds for making this concession retrospective.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould seek an opportunity, during Question Time in the House ofCommons that afternoon, to make it clear that the intention asregards productivity would be only to implement an existing agreement? which was permissible under the terms of the Pay Code,While it might prove desirable to make some concession as regardsthe advancement of the implementation of the current year*sinstalment of the move towards equal pay for women, this shouldbe the minimum necessary in order to secure a settlement.The Cabinet -10 Took note, with approval? of the summing up of their discussion by thePrime Minister and invited the Secretaryof State for Social Services to be guided accordingly,,british railways BoardPreviousReference:CM(73) 18thConclusionseMinute 5THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe British Railways Board saw some prospect that a meeting to beheld that afternoon with the three rail unions on the annual payclaim might lead to a settlement within the terms of the Stage pay policy.The WaterIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 22ndConclusion s,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe employers in the water industry were now hopeful that theresult of the ballot of manual workers in the industry would leadto a settlement within the terms of the Stage 2 pay policy.The CivilServicePreviousReference:pM(73) 18thon elusions,Minute 5THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the National Staff Side seemed likely to agree to pay proposals now under consideration for thenon-industrial Civil Service which, while complying with the stage 2 limit, would give some preference to die lower paid staff
FordsPreviousReference:CM(73) 22ndConclusions,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the shop stewards at Fords appeared to be having difficulty in maintaining the confrontation with the employers in the face of decreasing support from the workers.    Their consequent reluctance to convene a mas3meeting or to hold a ballot was preventing the dispute from beingresolved,.    Fords, who claimed that there had now been a significant loss of production,, were nevertheless adopting a firmattitude;  and the loss of earnings by those who were engaged in non--co-operation might soon lead to increasing pressure on the leadership to end the dispute.Harland and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that&quot;Wolff there was a dispute about pay and conditions of service at Harlandand Wolff, Belfast, which could lead to industrial action by 9, 000workers.    This would have obvious implications for security in thecity and must therefore be a matter for concern.    On the otherhand there was also a risk that a settlement of the dispute on theonly terms which at present seemed likely to achieve this would constitute a breach in the Stage 2 pay policy, which could have repercussions elsewhere,,    He therefore intended, despite thepossible risk to security, to ensure, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Employment as appropriate, that the Stage 2policy was upheld in this case.The Cabinet -2. Took note of the statements by theSecretary of State for the Environment, theLord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for northern Ireland.^16
THE HS 146 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryAIRCRAFT of State for Trade and Industry (CP(73) 53) proposing that theGovernment shoTold provide launching aid for the hawker siddeley HS 146 aircraft.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy had invited him to bring before the Cabinet the request made in May, 1972,by Hawker Siddeley for launching aid for the HS 146 aircraft.This HS 146 was a feeder airliner accommodating up to100 passengers, with a range of about 1000 miles.    It would bepowered by four American Lycoming engines;  and negotiations were in hand to arrange for parts of the engines to be manufacturedunder licence by Rolls Royce (1971) Ltd.    The aircraft would be developed for service in 1976-77 at an estimated cost of 8C million (at January, 1972, prices), of which it was proposedthat the Government should contribute  40 million.    hawker siddeley had agreed to finance the rest of the development, allthe production and any cost overruns;  and the Government wouldrecover their contribution, by a levy on sales, at about the point when the project as a whole broke even.    These were terms morefavourable than the Government had obtained in any previousagreement on launching aid;  and, although the market was uncertain - the aircraft would be sold in small numbers to smallairlines over many years- - the Committee had been impreesed bothby the aircrafts commercial prospects and by the extent to whichthe firm were prepared to back their own judgment of its future.They had also accepted that support for the project was compatible with the Governments strategy towards the aircraft industry as awhole and that it would not conflict with other projects which might come forward.    Work on the HS 146 would provide hawker siddeley with about 5000 jobs over 8 years, most of which wouldprobably be at Hat field; in addition, about 300 jobs would be likelyto be created at Shorts in Belfast.As with other new aircraft projects there was no provision forthe HS 146 in the present forecasts of public expenditure;  and theproposed support would therefore constitute a claim on the contingency reserve.    This did not imply that support for the civil aircraft industry should necessarily continue at its present levelof  150 million.-, . But in the absence of some new projects itwould decline to a total of  27 million in 1976-77; the number of design staff would be reduced from 4500 to about 2500;  and weshould rapidly cease to have a significant capability in the design and construction of civil aircraft.    Moreover, Hawker Siddeleywere the most capable British firm in this field; they had a strongmanagement and enjoyed a consistent record of fulfilling their contracts and observing their prices.    If support for this project was refused, however, there was a real risk that they wouldlargely withdraw from the aircraft industry.7
THE MINISTER FOR AEROSPACE AND SHIPPING said that theDutch Government, who were supported, although with lessconviction, by the Federal German Government, had represented that the project would compete with the VFW/Fokker F 2 .    Thetwo companies had been asked to study the scope for co-operation on one aircraft or the other.    But they had failed to reach agreement;  and the Dutch Government were now concerned mainly to secure a firm decision without further delay.    They wouldprobably acquiesce reluctantly if we proceeded with the project;but Fokker&apos;s reaction would be liable to be sharp.    Theprovision of launching aid might also be challenged by theCommission of the European Communities (e.c.) under theprovisions of the Treaty of Rome limiting State aids to industry.In order to reduce this risk Hawker Siddeley should be invited toplace an appropriate proportion of the work with anothermanufacturer within the e.c.; and the Commission should be given notice of our intentions before any public announcement was made.In discussion there was a wide measure of agreement on the need to support a firm whose past record of performance in this fieldcommanded confidence and whose managerial abilities would be ofthe first importance for the successful reorganisation of theBritish aircraft industry.     Even if a competitor to the HS 146were to appear, the estimate of sales suggested a return of some 300 million by 1985;  and for these reasons the launching aidprovided by the Government would contribute both to the viabilityof the aircraft industry and to the growth of the economy as awhole.    The firm had indicated that they could not afford to waitany longer for a decision;  and the Government were now payinghalf the cost of keeping the project in being.    There were thereforecompelling arguments against further delay.Nonetheless it was a matter for concern that a decision must betaken on this project in isolation.    The Cabinet were seekingsavings in public expenditure of the order of  300 million to 350 million in order to re-establish the contingency reserve;  anda commitment now to support the HS 146 must entail correspondingeconomies elsewhere.     Moreover, although the estimates ofexpenditure on support for the civil aircraft industry set out at annex B to CP(73) 53 might fall within the range recommended bythe interdepartmental group of officials which had reported in 1972on the future of the industry, they did not include pi*provision for additional expenditure which might arise from the current reviewof the programmes for Concorde and the RB 211 aeroengine.    Itmight well prove impracticable to support both the HS 146 and the medium-range airliner, even though the latter was identified inthe Annex as the most important opportunity for civil aviation inthe next few years.8
As regards the international implications of the proposal, theCabinet were advised that the provision of launching aid for anysolely national aircraft project within the e.c. would be strictlyincompatible with the provisions of the Treaty of Rome;  and theKS 146 should therefore present no greater problem in this contextthan any other wholly British aircraft.    But, although hawker siddeley and Fokker had found no basis for collaboration, it wasregrettable that it had once again proved necessary to offend theDutch Government in relation to a civil aircraft project.    Jt was desirable that, before the Governments decision was announced,a full exposition of their views should be given to the european commission, even though it should be made clear at the sametime that the Government were not seeking the Commissionsapproval.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, while reluctant in present circumstances to add to thedemands on public expenditure, considered on balance that theHS 146 should be supported both in the long term interests of theaircraft industry and as a contribution to the growth of the economy.They therefore approved the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal toprovide launching aid to Hawker Siddeley, subject to appropriateconfirmation of the company5s financial strength.    They wereconscious of the difficulty which this decision might cause inrelation to our e.c. obligations;  and arrangements should be madeto explain the reasons for our decision to the other governmentsconcerned and to the European Commission, on the lines indicatedin discussion.    It would also be desirable for Hawker Siddelfsyto provide opportunity for European firms to sub-contract for thework, provided that there was no dilution of their sole management of the project.The Cabinet -1.      Authorised the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry to offer Hawker Siddeley a government contribution to the cost of launching the HS 146 aircraft on the basis set out in CP(73) 53, subject to the satisfactory outcome of a review of the financial strength of the Hawker Siddeley Group.2.      Invited -i.     the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, to arrange for the Governments decisionto be communicated to the Dutch and Federal german governments and to the Commission of the european communities, as indicated in their discussionj.
ii.     the Secretary of State for Trade and Industryto invite Hawker Siddeley to arrange for an appropriate proportion of work on the HS 146aircraft to be sub-contracted to other manufacturerswithin the European Economic Community.10
NATIONALHEALTHSERVICEREORGANISATIONTop Salaries6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP(73) 55) about the top salaries in the reorganised National Health Service (NHS),THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thattho timetable for NHS reorganisation, which was planned to takeplace at the same time as the local government reorganisation on1 April, 1974, required that the most senior posts, for doctors andfor the chief officers in the non-medical posts, should beadvertised early in May,    These were new posts serving authorities which were to be responsible for administering integratedhospital, local authority and family practitioner services;  and,as such, they were not specifically provided for in the Pay Code,although it was necessary to have regard to the comparable salaries in the present separate services,    It had not been possible inconfidential negotiations on the chief officers1 salaries to reach agreement on the levels which Ministers had authorised inFebruary, ie  8, 745 for the most senior administrators and 6,105 for the chief nursing officers.    He had therefore sought authority from the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay negotiations to offer increased maximum salaries of  9,350 for administratorsand  6, 935 for nurses.    He had also proposed that he shouldseparately recommend to the Doctors&apos; and dentists Review Body(DDRB) that the salary of Regional Medical Officers of the largestRegions should be  10, 000 and that the doctors should be eligible,like hospital consultants, for distinction awards, the amount ofwhich would be abated by the amount of any responsibility allowancewhich they received in excess of the basic salary of  7, 350.    Therewould be only 14 Regional Medical Officer posts;  and these would carry much greater responsibility than the present equivalent posts?either in the Regional Hospital Boards, where the salary was atpresent  9, 500, or at Medical Officer of Health level, where somesalaries were at present over  12, 000.    An award by the DDRB of 10, 000 for community physicians was unlikely to causeembarrassment in reaching agreement on the salaries of the chief officers.    But, if he was not able to put forward the system ofmerit awards, it was likely that, taking account of the presentsalaries of the doctors concerned, the DDRB would make a much higher award, which he would then have to reject.    This would leadto a dispute with the profession.    The Sub-Committee, however,had felt unable to agree to his proposals because of the constraintsof the counter-inflation policy and the possible repercussions of theproposed salaries elsewhere.    They had proposed, instead, that heshould arrange for the non-rnedical posts to be advertised at thefigures so far offered.    But these took inadequate account of theincreased responsibilities and would almost certainly lead theNational Association of Local Government Officers and the RoyalCollege of Nursing to advise their members not to co-operate inthe reorganisation.    This could lead to a postponement of its11
implementation and, possibly, to delay in the local government reorganisation.    He was willing, however, to advise the NHSStaff Commission to advertise the top posts for the chiefadministrative officers at &quot;not less than&quot;  9,000 ( 6, 300 fornurses) and to inform the Staff Sides that negotiations would continue with a view to settling the final salaries in the light of theDDRB*s recommendations for doctors.    He would still propose toput the case to the DDRB that the top medical salary should be lQa 000j on the basis that a system of distinction awards wouldalso be introduced.    While the Staff Sides would be unlikely toagree to the proposed non-medical salaries, the prospect thatthere would be further negotiations should avert the possibility thatthey would refuse to co-operate in the reorganisation.In discussion there was general recognition in principle of theimportance of ensuring that the reorganisation of the NHS proceededsmoothly and in parallel with the local authority reorganisation, inorder that both might take effect on the due date.    The fact thatthe chief officers concerned would be paid marginally less than,officers in local government occupying comparable posts were atpresent receiving demonstrated that there was little risk ofrepercussions in the local authority field.    On the other hand manyof the staff filling the new posts would have held the correspondingposts in the existing NHS;  and it was necessary to consider the implications for pay policy of granting substantial increases in pay to staff at these levels.    Moreover, whereas under the localgovernment reorganisation the number of top posts had been substantially reduced, there had been no reduction in the numberof top NHS posts and it could not therefore be claimed that the totalcost to the Service &quot;:as being reduced.    In addition, the salarylevels proposed in CP(73) 55 involved an increase over thoseagreed by Ministers in February, which were themselves higherthan the equivalent existing salaries;  and the proposed concession of an undertaking to resume negotiations after the DDRB had recommended the salaries for community physicians would to allintents and purposes amount to an undertaking to increase the chief officers&apos; salaries still further.    It would be preferable to give anundertaking that there should be an independent review of salariesnot later than one year after the reorganisation came into effect.Nor did there appear to be any valid case for linking the salaries of administrators to those of doctors in the new Service,particularly when it was proposed that the latter should also be eligible for distinction awards.    The justification for distinctionawards, which would be open to all community physicians and could in some cases lead to total remuneration of  14, 700, was in any event less obvious than in the case of the clinical consultants8 who did not spend a substantial part of their time engaged in administrative duties and were more likely to resign from the NHSin order to devote themselves to private practice.    It was difficult12
to believe that those who constituted the senior management of the nhs would be prepared to take action to disrupt the reorganisationin an attempt to secure additional remuneration which, whileconstituting an insignificant addition to their total salaries, wassubstantial in terms of the pay policy.    Such action would undoubtedly alienate public sympathy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet1 s discussion of thiscomplex matter had revealed the need for further information inorder to enable a decision to be reached.    The Chancellor of theExchequer should therefore arrange for further consideration to begiven by the Ministerial Committee on Counter-inflationary measures to the appropriate levels of salary for the most seniorposts in the National Health Service.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer toarrange for the Ministerial Committee onCounter-Inflationary Measures to consider further the salaries for the most seniorposts in the reorganised National health service.13
7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Home Department (CP(73) 54), to which was annexeda draft White Paper indicating the Governments comments on theReports of the Royal Commission on Tribunals of Inquiry (1966Cmnd 3121) and the Committee on the Law of Contempt as ic affectsTribunals of Inquiry (1966 Cmnd 4078),THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft White Paper took account of comments by the Home and Social Affairs Committee.The Royal Commission had recommended the retention of the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, but had made a numberof detailed suggestions aboui the practice and procedure of suchTribunals.    The majority of these proposals were acceptable,including the recommendation that there should be no appeal fromthe findings of a Tribunal.    Certain other recommendations,however, would have to be accepted in the spirit rather than in theletter, for reasons which were indicated in the draft White Paper;and the Commission^ recommendation that Tribunals should nominate counsel other than a Law Officer to act on their behalfshould be rejected.    Seven of the recommendations would entailamendment of the law.    But they amounted to little more thanglosses on the 1921 Act;  and the Government need not accept any commitment at present about the timing of the consequentiallegislation.    The Departmental Committee on the Law of Contempthad been established in reply to criticism of a suggestion made bythe then Attorney General that public comment on matters which itwas the function of the Aberfan Tribunal to investigate might besubject to the law of contempt even in advance of the constitutionof the Tribunal.    The Committee had concluded that the law ofcontempt applied only to Tribunals once they had been set up; butthey had also made certain suggestions for clarification andmodification, which seemed likely to be favourably received by thePress.    It was not proposed that any reference should be made inthe White Paper to Northern Ireland, even though Tribunals hadbeen set up under the 1921 Act by the Northern Ireland Government,The Home and Social Aff ai r s^Cjmimi ttee had suggested that, in viewof the interest which the^First DivisionAis^^^ation^of)Civil Servantshad shown in Tribunal procedures after the Vehicle and GeneralTribunal, there might be advantage in giving the Civil Service staff side an opportunity to comment in confidence on the governments proposals before the White Paper was published.    But there wereweighty arguments against this course.In discussion there was general agreement with the terms of theWhite Paper, although it was noted that, since the circumstancesof each Tribunal were different, it was difficult to formulateconclusions which could be of general application.    Some doubt was expressed, however, about the validity of the statement in14
paragraph 20 of the draft White Paper that witnesses could not begiven advance notice of what another witness might intend to say,or be supplied with copies of another witness!s statement, withoutthe latter&apos;s consent,   It might be preferable for the relevantsentence to be omitted.   As regards consultations with the CivilService Staff Side, it was suggested that, despite the concern which many civil servants felt about the issues involved, it would beinvidious to single out the Civil Service for specially favourable treatment when several other interests might feel that they had an equal right to be consulted.    Moreover, it would be undesirable toset a precedent of this nature in a field where consultation was notthe normal practice.   A preferable course might be to adopt a procedure which was well established in other connections by givingthe Staff Side confidential access to an advance copy of the white paper at the time when similar copies were made available to thePress,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,subject to the point which had been raised in discussion, the cabinet agreed that the draft White Paper should be published and that, whenopportunity offered, legislation should be introduced to give effectto those recommendations of the Royal Commission which requiredit.    In principle there should be no advance consultation with theCivil Service Staff Side; but a copy of the White Paper should be shown to them in confidence at the same time as similar copieswere supplied to the Press.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Home Secretary to arrangefor the publication of the White Paper.3.        Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, to arrange for an advancecopy of the White Paper to be shown in confidence to the Civil Service Staff Side on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister.(cabinet Office12 April 197315
