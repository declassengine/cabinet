The national economy was now responding to themeasures which the Government had taken to stimulate growth; andthe Governments purpose must now be to ensure that growth wassteady and v/as not distorted by shortages of plant and manpower orby excess demand.    Employers must be satisfied that theGovernments counter-inflationary policies were not incompatible with productivity and profits;  and the trade unions must be reassuredthat the level of employment and real earnings would continue toimprove.    If action was not taken to control the growth in public expenditure in certain areas and sectors of the economy,, the wholestrategy would be at risk.    The Government had already succeeded in introducing a more refined control of prices and pay than any previous Administration; their task now was to temper the growth of public expenditure without recourse to arbitrary reductions, whichmight affect the areas where investment was needed or undermineconfidence by appearing to presage a return to deflationary policies.Political and economic considerations alike suggested that the presenttime was ripe for the Government to adjust their priorities in public expenditure; and it was important that this should be seen as acontrolled response to changing circumstances rather than asprecipitate reaction to impending crisis,.action^,    The cabinet should therefore review the whole range cf programmes in orderto reach a general consensus about the measures which now needed to be taken.
TOP secret the CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that between thesecond half of 1972 and the first half of 1973 the economy had been growing at a rate well in excess of 5 per cent;  and most reputablecommentators, as well as the Governments own advisers, agreedthat action must soon be taken to ensure that this rate of growth wassteadied.    The Governments programmes for 1973-74 exceeded thoseof their predecessors by  1, 064 million at constant price.3, and by 628 million for 1974-75; and changes in estimating assumptions,though producing a net saving of  200 million on the current yearJsexpenditure, would increase expenditure in the following year by 250 million.    To increase taxes, whether direct or indirect^ wouldin present circumstances put the whole success of the Governmentscounter-inflationary policies at risk.    It was therefore of the utmost importance to moderate the growth of public expenditure over thenext two years.    The proposals in his minute were the unanimousjudgment of the group of Ministers concerned, who had givenprolonged consideration to the problem in the light of the guidelinessuggested by the Central Policy Review Staff,    None of the savingsthey proposed would require legislative action.    They also had inmind the need to leave room for increased expenditure on certain services such as housing.    They believed that it was essential toproduce net savings of  500 million in 1974-75;  and the gross totalof their proposals, as set out in Annex II to his mirute, amounted to  701 million,,In discussion, the importance of restraining the growth of public expenditure was generally endorsed;  and there was a wide degreeof support for the approach adopted by the Chancellor of theExchequer, although it was represented that, until the ministers responsible for particular programmes had considered the proposals in more detail, it would not be possible to determine exactly howsavings should be realised.    On the other hand it must be recognisedthat a large part of the savings proposed would fall to be negotiatedwith local authorities, not all of whom would be sympathetic to theGovernments aims,    A sufficient margin must be allowed for this,as well as for increased expenditure on other programmes, some ofwhich would be a necessary price to pay for securing major savingselsewhere.    It was, indeed, for consideration whether a net saving of  500 million would satisfy public opinion as a sufficient measureof retrenchment.    But, if savings of this amount were secured in1974-75, the effects would flow through to public expenditure programmes in later years; and this would be reflected in thenext survey of public expenditure0In discussion of particular programmes the following main points were made -top secret
The forthcoming announcement of a major investment programme by-British Leyland would do much to confirm predictions that capital investment was now recovering.    It was therefore important that,within the total package, disproportionate reductions should not be imposed on expenditure which contributed to growth, particularlyselective assistance.    Investment in steel and in energy was vital to national growth;  and on purely economic grounds, certainaerospace projects seemed better candidates for savings.    Moreover,experience had shown that only when the economy was expanding was it possible for regional industrial policies to be applied effectively;and the present opportunity to correct regional imbalances should notbe let slip.The defence budget was so composed that four-fifths of the expen-diture to the end of the next financial year was already committed;and, although savings in establishments and manpower might seemattractive, they could probably be secured only in the fields of research and development, equipment and construction.    In any event, however, reductions in expenditure could not be made without regard to their effect on defence capabilities and their internationalrepercussions.    It would therefore be unwise to promise savings in expenditure without close consideration of their effects.    Moreover,several members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation were atpresent seeking to reduce their contribution to the Organisation^expenditure;  and the problem of sharing the burden of the north atlantic Alliance was due for discussion between member governments early the following month,.    It would be particularly unfortunate if the United Kingdom were at that time to announce asubstantial reduction in defence expenditure.    On the other hand we still spent a higher proportion of gross national product on defencethan most of our allies;  and there would be widespread criticism if a comprehensive programme of retrenchment in public expenditure wereto receive no contribution from the defence budgetsReductions in these programmes would attract widespread criticism;and, although it was necessary to relieve the strain on theconstruction industry, care would need to be taken to ensurethat the economies to be sought on this account reflected actualshortage So    It would, for example, be unfortunate if the hospitalprogramme was reduced while office building continued unchecked.In a wider perspective, reductions in programmes of such politicalsensitivity could only be tolerated if it was clear that no othercategory of public expenditure had escaped close scrutiny;  andit would be desirable to include enough flexibility to enable some increase in current expenditure to be made in areas of particularneed,
The proposal to defer for a year the change from financing theIndustrial Training Boards by levy to a grant system would undoubtedly arouse criticism among the Government1 s supporters in Parliament,, as well as from the Confederation of British Industry,But it offered the prospect of securing substantial savings in thecurrent financial year.In further discussion it was recognised that the timing of any announcement was of critical importance.,    Public commentwas already canvassing the prospect of reductions;  and it wasvery desirable that the Government should retain the initiativeby announcing their conclusions before the pressure of circumstancesappeared to force a decision on them.    Moderate measures ofretrenchment taken in good time would be more effective thanseverer measures taken in an atmosphere of crisis.    To thisend it would be desirable to make an appropriate announcementbefore Parliament rose for the Whitsun Recess,    On the otherhand it would be impracticable in so short a space of time for theMinisters concerned to settle a range of detailed measures,    But,although on previous occasions announcements of this kind had beenmade in general terms, it would sacrifice credibility and mightundermine confidence if Ministers were unable to specify whatsavings were intended,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had had a useful exchange of views.    There was generalagreement on the need for timely action to restrain the growth of demand which public expenditure would place on the economy inthe next two years; and there had been a wide measure of support for the approach adopted by the group of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The cabinets discussion, however, had revealed some difficult areas, particularlydefence (where account must be taken of the internationalrepercussions of reductions in spending), trade and industry,and the social services;  and most Ministers, while not dissentingfrom accepting the targets for their Departments, wished to consider in more detail how the savings should be secured.    This raisedquestions of timing and confidentiality,    It was important that theGovernment should be seen to hold the initiative in taking thenecessary measures of retrenchment, and not appear to havebeen forced by events into indiscriminate economies.    An early announcement was therefore desirable; but this carried the risk that, if savings had not been agreed in sufficient detail for ministers to give a fairly precise indication of where they would occur, anappearance of uncertainty might be es-eated.    The ministers concerned should therefore discuss further with the Chancellor
tqs* secretof the Exchequer, as a matter of urgency, the detailed allocation of savings within their own expenditure programmes.    In doing this they should preserve the strictest confidentiality and should takecare that the general scope of the programme should not be disclosedprematurely.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.20        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer -i, To discuss with the ministers concerned the detailed allocation of savings on Departmental programmes.ii. To circulate a further statement of themeasures agreed in the light of their discussion,3*        Agreed to resume their discussion at an earlydate.Cabinet Office14 May 1973
