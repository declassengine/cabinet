PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to beAFFAIRS taken in the House of Commons during the following week.    Itwas proposed that the House should reassemble after the recess on 16 October and that the present Session shouldend about a week later.    The new Session was likely to begin on 30 October.Maplin AirportPreviousReference:CM(73) 36thConclusions,Minute 8The Cabinet were informed that the draft restatement of theGovernments policy in relation to the Maplin project whichhad been before them on 12 July had been amended in the lightof comments made by Ministers.    It would now be issued asbriefing material for the Governments supporters and wouldalso be made available to the Press.    It would be followed inthe autumn by the longer and more detailed re-presentation of the project which the Cabinet had invited the Secretary ofState for the Environment to prepare.The ChannelTunnel ProjectPreviousReference:CM(73) 35thConclusions,Minute 6The Cabinet were informed that the financial discussions withthe private companies involved in the Channel Tunnel projecthad not yet been completed and that it would accordingly not bepossible to issue a White Paper before the Recess.    Considera-tion must therefore be given to the timing of the introduction and publication of the Money Bill, which should be enacted beforethe end of the present Session in the autumn.    There wereobjections to its introduction before the White Paper had appeared;and a preferable course might be to append a draft Bill to theWhite Paper when it was published.-1-
9ELECTORAL 2. The Cabinet considered the question of the electoralARRANGEMENTS       arrangements which should apply to local authorities inIN GREATER Greater London.london the HOME SECRETARY said that the Ministerial Committeeon Regional Policy and the Environment had recentlyconsidered the difficult question of the use which should bemade of the power provided in the Local Government Act, 1972,to modify the timing and frequency of local government elections in London.    The decision to be taken was whether all members of each London borough council should come up for election together every four years or whether one-third ofthe councillors should retire in each of the three years betweenelections to the Greater London Council (GLC).    At present,county councils, the GLC and the London borough councilshad whole-council elections.    All borough councils outside london, however, retired by thirds; and in the urban and rural districts the Council could choose between the two systems.So far as the London boroughs were concerned, the Committeehad concluded that, in principle, election by thirds was preferable, on the grounds that it would make for more efficient local administration by ensuring greater continuity of experience and avoiding abrupt changes in the composition of Councils and that, since elections would be more frequent,the local political organisations would be enabled to functionmore effectively.    Opinion in the Conservative Party, though not unanimous, was strongly in favour of election by thirds,which was also supported by the Liberal Party.    The LabourParty, however, and 25 out of the 32 London boroughs,favoured whole-council elections.    The situation was complicated by the fact that, when the Local Government bill was before Parliament, specific undertakings had been given bythe Ministers concerned that the powers relating to london would be used to enable the Government to do what the GLC andthe London boroughs wanted them to do.    In the light of this commitment there would clearly be difficulty in evading whole -council elections.In discussion it was suggested that, although on merits there could be little doubt about the desirability in principle of election by thirds, the undertakings given to Parliament were so specific that the Government neither could, nor should seek,to evade them.    It might not be necessary, however, for animmediate decision to be taken on the matter.    There was general agreement that the next elections should be in 1974;and this could be announced at once.    These elections wouldhave to be on the whole-council basis which at present applied,because election by thirds would call for substantial adjustments to ward boundaries and these would take some time to complete.If it were later decided that election by thirds should begin toapply in 1978, when the next elections would be due, it would bepossible to complete the necessary redrawing of ward boundariesin time, so long as the decision was taken not later than 1975.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat it was perhaps unfortunate that the Government should havebeen committed to give effect to a decision taken by some other authority.    The Cabinet agreed that election by thirds was inprinciple desirable.    In relation to the elections due in 1974,however, there could be no question of breaching the under-takings which had been given in Parliament; and the whole -council basis must therefore apply.    But this should not imply that the possibility of changing the present electoral arrange-ments must be permanently excluded.    An early announcement should therefore be made that there would be local elections inLondon in 1974; that they would be on the present whole-council basis;  and that further consideration would be given tothe arrangements which should apply to subsequent elections.The Governments decision should be indicated informally inadvance to those of their supporters who represented Londonconstituencies.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for the Environment,to arrange for an early announcement to be madeaccordingly.3
OVERSEAAFFAIRSAfghanistan3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that the King of Afghanistan had been deposed during his absence abroad; and a republic had been declared.    This was an unwelcome development.    General Daud, the leader of thenew regime, was anti-British and pro-Soviet in his sympathies;and the Soviet Union might have connived at his seizure of power.    The change would be of concern both to the Shah of Iran,because it would increase Soviet influence in Afghanistan, andto the Government of Pakistan, because General Daud hadalready reaffirmed his support for the separatist Pakhtunistanmovement.    The situation in some parts of the country remotefrom Kabul was not clear; and it was possible, though perhapsunlikely, that some support might rally to the King.PortugalPreviousReference:CM(73) 37thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Prime Minister of Portugal, Dr. Caetano, had appeared tobe very pleased with his visit to this country.    Little furtherinformation had become available to cast light on the accuracy of the charges that there had been a massacre in the TeteProvince of Mozambique in 1972; but Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Lisbon, who had visited the area, believed, asa result of informal contacts which he had made there, that the allegations were not true.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
9EUROPEAN 4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERCOMMUNITY said that the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) at their affairs meeting on 16-17 July had agreed to a derogation for theUnited Kingdom sugar-refining subsidy until 1 July, 1974.The Council had also discussed proposals by the commission for a future Community sugar regime, including arrangementsfcr meeting the commitments to the developing countries whichwere members of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA).But no conclusions had been reached.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that he had haduseful discussions with French Ministers in Paris on 16-17 July.It was becoming increasingly clear that, although the FrenchGovernment were not unwilling that the programme of measuresagreed at the European Summit should be put into effect, their concurrence in practice would be conditional on their obtainingsatisfaction on certain issues.    They were particularly anxious that the independently floating currencies should rejoin theCommunity monetary arrangements; and they were reluctant to see significant progress in the international trade negotiations in the absence of an assurance that there would begenuine progress towards international monetary reform.    Theirattitude on these questions reflected their concern about thecontinued depreciation of the United States dollar and the actionwhich the United States Government had taken to suspendexports of soya beans.THE PRIME MINISTER said that we should not be undulyinfluenced by the attitude of the French Government, which was their customary posture for purposes of tactical negotiation.We had already derived advantage from the first six months ofour membership of the Community; and good progress wasbeing made in implementing the Summit programme.    We mustbe prepared to defend our own interests as vigorously as theFrench Government defended theirs.5
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 3&amp;hConclusions,Minute5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERNIRELAND said that the Protestant marches on 12 July had passed off quietly.    There had been a number of seriousbombing incidents in the last few days, involving both theProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army and Protestantextremists.    In general, however, the level of violenceremained low.His consultations with the political Parties continued.    Atthis stage they were adopting intransigent positions; but itshould still be possible to hold the first meeting of the newAssembly on 31 July.    Agreement had not yet been reached on a candidate for the post of its Presiding Officer.    Thenominee of the Social Democratic and Labour Party mightwell prove to be very suitable.    The Unionists would preferone of their own number; but their candidate was not soimpressive.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.6t
INDUSTRIAL 6. The Cabinet gave further consideration to policy toAFFAIRS counter inflation.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Counter-InflationaryPolicyPreviousReference:CM(73) 37thConclusions,Minute 3The Coalmining        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that industry the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)had proposed that their next pay settlement should date from1 November, 1973, rather than 1 March, 1974, which wouldbe the date required by the 12 months&apos; rule under the pay code.    If they maintained this demand, they might find themselves taking the lead in opposing the introduction of theGovernments proposals for Stage 3.    Much would depend upon their view of developments during the next few weeks andof the course of the forthcoming TUC Congress.The NewspaperIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 36thConclusions,Minute 5The Newspaper Publishers Association (NPA) were stilldiscussing with the unions in the printing industry, other thanthe National Society of Operative Printers, Graphical andMedia Personnel (NATSOPA), the possible basis for a settle-ment of the pay dispute in the newspaper industry.    Itappeared that this might now take the form of the payment to acharity of a sum equivalent to the increase which would havebeen paid, had the Pay Code permitted.    This would notcontravene the Code;  and there could be no objection as long asthe charity was a recognised one.    But it would be necessary to try to ensure that the scheme agreed was not one which, although in accordance with the letter of the Code, contravened its spirit,as would be the case if the charity were a new one designed toensure that the prohibited payments were made in another way.The Charity Commissioners, however, would be unlikely to beprepared to recognise a charity of this kind.    Some of theemployers in the industry would not be opposed to the pay board&apos;s making an Order to prevent any payments being made,if this proved both possible and desirable.    Lord Goodman was at the sana time endeavouring to improve the NPA&apos;s relationship with Mr Briginshaw, the General Secretary of NATSOPA.
Mr George Hill The decision of the Amalgamated Union of EngineeringWorkers (AUEW) to defy a ruling by an industrial tribunalthat they should pay  2, 800 compensation to Mr George Hill,who had been expelled from the union after he had refused tojoin a strike, gave rise to a situation in which Mr Hill:sremedy lay in seeking to ensure enforcement of paymentthrough the County Court under the normal process of civillaw.    Neither the National Industrial Relations Court nor theGovernment therefore had any locus in the matter, even thoughan earlier tribunal had decided that Mr Hill&apos;s expulsion fromthe AUEW had been an unfair industrial practice.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Secretaryof State for Employment.8
PUBLIC 7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theEXPENDITURE        Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(73) 81)about public expenditure to 1977-78.    They also had before them a previous memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) on reference: the same subject (CP(73) 83); and a Note by the ChancellorCM(73) 4th of the Exchequer (CP(73) 82), to which was attached the 1973Conclusions, report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC).Minute 5THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that, whenthe programmes of public expenditure had been determined forthe purpose of the annual White Paper in December, 1972,(Cmnd. 5178), the Cabinet had recognised that the contingency reserve was virtually fully committed.    Moreover, in spite ofthe substantial reductions made in 1970 immediately after thepresent Administration had been formed, the programmespublished in December, 1972, considerably exceeded thosepublished by the previous Administration.    The Cabinet had therefore agreed in January that a fully adequate and uncommittedreserve must be re-established.    The proposals in Cmnd. 5178had generally been well received as regards the medium-term.Such criticism as there had been had mainly concerned the short-term; but this had been met by the reductions which,with the Cabinefs agreement, he had announced on 21 May.For the later years, from 1975-76 to 1977-78, however, the costings of individual programmes in the 1973 PESC report,together with an appropriate uncommited reserve, would nowraise the rate of growth of expenditure substantially above the levels published in Cmnd. 5178 for those years.    Moreover,although the costings included realistic estimates for certainprogrammes which had not yet been finally decided, they didnot include additional demands by Ministers totalling 315 million by 1976-77.Against the background of the present uncertain international monetary situation and the fears which were being expressed about possible &quot;overheating&quot; of the economy, it was essential to demonstrate, both to Parliament and to inter-national opinion, that public expenditure would not exceed the totals published in December.    He proposed, therefore, that public expenditure for 1975-76 and 1976-77 should be limitedto the totals published in Cmnd. 5178, while including anadequate contingency reserve;  and that the trend to 1977-78should be similarly adjusted.   This would permit personal consumption to increase at an average annual rate of 3. 0 percent from 1972 to 1978, although even on this basis the realburden of personal taxation would be increasing.    The CPRShad drawn attention to the fact that, even if these proposals were adopted, the contingency reserve would leave little room for manoeuvre.    But it would not be realistic to propose lowertotals for public expenditure than those which he was now seeking.
In accordance with the Cabinet1 s decision in January, certain modifications of policy which would help to restore an adequatecontingency reserve had been summarised in Table 2 of thePESC report.    This material, however, had to be usedselectively if it was to serve the Governments main objectives,including economic expansion and the restraint of inflation;and he was not now asking for any decisions on individual programmes.    He proposed, instead, to consider thepossibilities in consultation with the Ministers concerned andto bring forward specific proposals in October,    At this stagehe was asking the Cabinet only to endorse this programme ofwork and to agree that the level of total public expenditure should be limited as he had indicated.In discussion it was suggested that, although the effect on confidence in sterling of the published public expenditure figures needed to be given full weight, the quality and quantity of the services provided, for example in the social services and in aid to development areas, was also important.Some of the proposed reductions summarised in Table 2 ofthe PESC report would be unacceptable to the ministers concerned; and the reductions did not appear to bear withequal weight on the various programmes.    Moreover, if theproposals for additional expenditure were accepted, theadoption of the limits proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer would require a reduction in total public expenditureof about  1, 200 million.   This could not be achieved withoutmajor policy decisions;  and the Cabinet would need time toexamine the strategic priorities to be accorded to the differentexpenditure programmes and to other objectives such as,  opexample, counter-inflationary policy.    It might therefore bedesirable, before specific proposals were brought to theCabinet in October, that the Cabinet as a whole should have afurther general discussion of these issues.On the other hand there was a basic dilemma, which had been emphasised in the CPES memorandum and in their recentstrategy presentation, that, if faster economic growth was to beachieved, room must be left for an improvement in thebalance of payments and for investment to modernise industry.The present moment offered a unique opportunity to achieve these objectives; but it would require action of a kind whichwould not necessarily be popular.    The PESC report indicated that the cost of existing programmes would require an average annual increase of public expenditure of 3j per cent in demand terms, and of private consumption by only 2.\ per cent.    by contrast, the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals wouldenable each to rise at approxirra tely 3 per cent; and anyslower rate of growth for private consumption could jeopardise
the counter-inflation, policy and economic expansion.Table 2 of the PESO report only summarised variousmodifications of policy which had been identified as feasible;and acceptance of the Chancellor of the Exchequers present proposals did not imply any endorsement of this Table asguidelines for the programme of work which he had proposed.All that was being sought at this stage was agreement on thetotal limitations suggested, together with endorsement of theproposed programme of discussions which should result in specific proposals being brought forward for consideration by cabinet in the autumn.    In the meantime, it would still bepossible to give further consideration to the strategicpriorities as a background to the proposed bilateral discussions.In further discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet needed to review the prospects for public expenditure against thegeneral background of the allocation of the gross national product to various uses.    A judgment of the appropriate total for public expenditure was also affected by the assumptionadopted about the future rate of expansion of the economy.The medium$term economic assessment had forecast an average annual increase in the gross domestic product of 3. 9 per centin real terms between 1972 and 1978; and, although the achievement of a higher rate of growth need not be ruled out,*he considered view of Departmental economic advisers wasthat it would be imprudent to base public expenditure programmes on any more optimistic assumption at this stage.It would nevertheless be instructive to examine in greater detail the allocation of national resources in percentage termsbetween the different main programmes.    In interpretingsuch information, however, regard would need to be paid tothe extent to which the different programmes themselvescontributed to economic expansion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldhave bilateral discussions with Departmental Ministers on thebasis proposed in CP(73) 81 and should bring forward proposals in October with a view to final decisions being taken by theCabinet at that stage.    These discussions,however, should notbe confined to, or prejudged by, the particular suggestions inTable 2 of the PESC report.    Moreover, it would not bepossible for some of the more urgent expenditure proposals at present under consideration to be deferred until final decisions could be taken in the autumn.    In order to provide a background against which the bilateral discussions could be conducted the Cabinet wished to have an early general discussion of the strategic priorities and the balance to be
struck between the different expenditure programmes, bearing that mind the extent to which these programmes themselvescontributed to economic expansion.     For this purpose, theCabinet would need further information about the proportion ofnational resources devoted to the main expenditure programmes.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate information about the proportion ofnational resources devoted to the main public expenditure programmes.DEFAULT ONTHE housing finance ACTSPreviousReference:CM(73) 33rdConclusions,Minute 68. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP(73) 80) about thelate implementation of the Housing Finance Acts.THE MINISTER FOR HOUSING AND CONSTRUCTION said thatin England and Wales 32 local authorities had failed to implementby the due date the rent increases which had become effective inthe previous October.    in 15 areas in England some 200councillors in all might be surcharged as the result of beingadjudged by the District Auditors to be responsible for the resulting losses.    In Wales 5 areas were similarly affected.If the law were allowed to take its course, the councillors held responsible would be disqualified from holding office for aperiod of 5 years;   and in some areas, where the losses of rentincome had been very heavy, a number of them might be rendered bankrupt.     There would be no good grounds, however,for the Courts or the Secretary of State to allow an appeal againsta surcharge or to afford any relief.    Any kind of amnesty wouldrequire legislation.    But, while such legislation might beregarded as justified in order to avert an unduly harshpunishment, the councillors concerned had acted in full knowledge of the possible results.    To relieve them of the duelegal consequences would therefore create a disquietingprecedent; would seem unfair to those councillors who had been opposed to the Act but whose respect for the law had led them to implement it by the due date; and might cause some councillorsto feel that the rent increases to be made in the coming Octobercould be postponed with impunity.    It would be desirable to defer any decision with regard to an amnesty until the progressin implementing those increases could be assessed.
The Cabinet were informed that in Scotland 25 local authority-areas were affected.    The decision to make surcharges north of the Border, however, rested with the Secretary of State,who possessed a certain element of discretion, although it was doubtful whether it would be appropriately exerci sed ir. thecases concerned.In discussion it was suggested that those who had decided to implement the legislation, whether out of respect for the lawor because of the severe penalties which disobedience mightentail, would be dismayed if the consequences of defiance, ofwhich the councillors concerned had been clearly aware, werenot now incurred.    Ratepayers had suffered losses as a resultof this defiance; and they could not be expected readily tosupport an amnesty.    Moreover, it would be undesirable toencourage an assumption that future defiance would not bedealt with in accordance with the law.    On the other hand thelegislation had been implemented and the law had ultimatelybeen observed; and it might now be considered unnecessary to press the issue to the point of insisting that the substantial number of councillors concerned should incur the very severepenalties which would necessarily be involved if no amnestywere given.    If the law were allowed to take its course, a numbeof by-elections would be needed, and the smooth establishmentof the new local authorities in April, 1974, might be affected;court action might be required in order to enforce recovery ofthe relevant sums from the councillors concerned;  and incertain cfrcumstances the possibility of their commitment to prison for contempt of court might arise.    A series of events of this kind, spread over a period of many months and attended by considerable publicity at each stage, was not an attractive prospect.    A major political decision was thereforeinvolved.In further discussion it was suggested that, if an amnesty wereto be conceded in principle, it would be difficult to justifymaking an exception in the case of particular authorities.Moreover, it was unsatisfactory that under the legislation as it stood at present penalties would not in any way be related tothe extent of the defiance.    A very short period of defiance in alarge area might incur a larger penalty than a much longer period in a small area.    It might, therefore, be preferable toprovide for some adjustment in the provisions relating topenalties in order to take account of such considerations.Alternatively, it might be desirable to provide for only a proportion of the total loss to be recovered.    It might be appropriate, however, not to modify the provisions relating todisqualification, since the councillors concerned had in factshown themselves unfit to hold office.
It was noted that District Auditors would probably not begintheir audits in the relevant areas before October;  and on that basis their reports might not be completed before March, 1974.In the course of their investigations they would be required togive opportunities for representations to be made to them about any proposed surcharges.    In this connection, it was recalled that, when the question of a surcharge on councillors who hadbeen responsible for the illegal provision of free school milkhad been under consideration, it had been decided that, ifthe councillors gave assurances about the implementation of the relevant legislation in the future, it would be proper for the relevant expenditure to be authorised by the Secretary of State;and the recalcitrant councillors had thereby been persuaded to conform.    The possibility of adopting similar tactics in relationto the housing finance legislation should now be considered.    Ifsuch a procedure was not possible in this case, it would nevertheless be necessary to consider carefully whether other means were available for showing a measure of clemency andavoiding the need for specific legislation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that a decision should not be taken until theautumn.    At that time they would be able to consider the extentto which the October, 1973, rent increases were being implemented and the progress with Stage 3 of the counter-inflationary policy.    It would be necessary to bear in mind thatthe councillors concerned, with the sole exception of those atjClay Crosrs, had ultimately akcnowledged the necessity to complywith the legislation.   The Government&apos;s policies, therefore, hadbeen successful in this respect;  and it might not be readilyunderstood why severe penalties must now be exacted.   Theintroduction of legislation to provide power to confer an amnesty,however, was not an attractive course.    The alternatives ofrelieving councillors of financial liabilities but leaving themsubject to disqualification, or of providing for more equitablefinancial penalties, should therefore be considered.    It was important also that the possibility of arranging otherwise thanby legislation for the councillors to be relieved of the prospectivesurcharges should be fully   explored.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales: -
i.     to explore further whether it would bepossible to relieve the councillors concerned of the prospective surcharges without recourse to legislation;ii.     to consider whether, if a decision were takento introduce legislation, it would be appropriate:-a. to provide for the councillors to be relieved of financial penalties but to remain subject to disqualification;b. if financial penalties were retained, toprovide for such penalties to be exacted on amore equitable basis, on the lines indicatedin the discussion;iii.     to make a further report to the Cabinet onthe matter at the end of September.3.      Invited the Secretaries of State for the environment, for Scotland and for Wales to arrange that the institution of audits in the relevant areas should be deferred so far as was practicable.Cabinet Office19 July 1973

It had then emerged that the pay board saw objections to the Government&apos;s proposals in thisrespect on the grounds that threshold arrangements of the kindenvisaged would impose an excessive administrative burden on their existing staff.    He had accordingly concluded that itwould be unwise to announce an intention to introducethreshold arrangements in Stage 2 during the parliamentary debate on the previous day; and the Pay Board would nowconsider what action could be taken to deal with the situationin the remainder of Stage 2 if the Retail Price Index continuedto rise.    In the light of their suggestions he would be preparedto discuss the matter with the Trades Union Congress and the confederation of British Industry with a view to a laterannouncement.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office19 July 1973i
