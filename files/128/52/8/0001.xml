ft.THE 1. The Cabinet considered an issue affecting the Royal Family.royal family The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.MINISTERIAL 2, THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that inquiriesRESIGNATIONS        which the police had for some time been pursuing for other purposeshad recently brought to light allegations about the conduct of certain members of the Government,    Since these might have securityimplications, he had commissioned the necessary inquiries forthwith,on the basis that they must not prejudice the police investigation of activities which might in some instances lead to criminal charges.As a result the Lord Privy Seal and the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for Defence for the Royal Air Force had thoughtit right to tender their resignations.    Their reasons were different;but both of them had given assurances, in their respectivestatements, that they had not been subjected to any pressurecr blackmail and that their conduct had not involved any breach of security.    Somewhat similar allegations had been made by aGerman magazine about a member of the British Diplomatic Service;but the magazine had subsequently acknowledged that it was referring to the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence for theRoyal Air Force.    There was no reason to suppose, therefore, that national security had in fact been endangered by any of the incidentswhich had culminated in the resignation of the two Ministers or thatsuch of the current allegations as involved the Government had not now been dealt with.    It might nevertheless be wise to secureindependent verification of this point by referring the whole matter to the Security Commission; and, if the necessary consultation withthe Leader of the Opposition and the Chairman of the Commissionindicated that this course would be generally acceptable, he couldannounce a decision to this effect in the Parliamentary statement which he would in any case have to make later that day.In the course of a brief discussion it was agreed that, if any furtherinquiry into the incidents in question was needed, it would certainly be preferable that it should be arranged by means of a reference tothe Security Commission rather than by recourse to the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921, or to any special form of quasi-judicial investigation.ft
PARLIAMENTARY 3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the week following the whitsun recess.The Cabinet were informed that the remaining stages of theMaplin Re-development Bill were likely to be satisfactorilycompleted in the House of Commons, although the Governmentmajorities might be small.    In these circumstances it didnot appear desirable that a report should at this stage becommissioned on the likely levels of aircraft noise at Maplin,Heathrow and other relevant airports.
OVERSEAAFFAIRSIcelandPreviousReference:CM(73) 29thConclusions,Minute 44. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that Norway had offered to mediate in our fisheries dispute with Iceland. While we might reasonably accept this offer, weshould not accept arbitration in the matter.THE HOME SECRETARY informed the Cabinet that steps werebeing taken to ensure that presentation of the dispute by the news media adequately reflected the Governments position.These included reinforcing the information side of our embassy at Reykjavik, briefing leading journalists and arranging forjournalists to be included in the Royal Air Force Nimrod aircraft operating in the area.Mutual andBalancedForceReductionsTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatduring his recent discussions in Bonn the Federal german chancellor, Herr Brandt, had shown an inclination to agree to exclude indigenous forces from any agreement for Mutual andBalanced Force Reductions, at any rate in the first stage.    Thiswas a welcome development, which would assist in ensuring thatthe member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationentered these negotiations on the right footing.3
BECi-y:fEUROPEAN 5. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that community he had held full and valuable discussions in Paris with the affairs President of France, M Pompidou earlier in the week.    Theyhad been largely dominated by the question of Europeanrelationships with the United States.    President PompidouPrime Minister^      &apos; had accepted the importance of these relationships but hadMeeting with the maintained reservations about some aspects of them.    He wasPresident of not prepared at the moment to take part in any discussions with france on the United States Government on European Defence; and he had21 and 22 May also been unaccommodating about the arrangements for thePresident of the United State% proposed visit to Europe,He had accepted that, so far as defence was concerned,President Nixon might meet the NATO Council; but he hadbeen opposed to any joint meeting between the President and representatives of the members of the European Community,either at Head of Government or at Foreign Minister level.He had suggested, instead, that President Nixon might meetthe Presidents of the Council of Ministers and of theCommission but that, otherwise, his contacts with member countries of the Community should be bilateral.President Pompidou had, however, confirmed the Frenchcommitment to progress in the multilateral trade negotiations and had appeared less sensitive than formerly on the questionof reform of the international monetary system.    He had emphasised the inter-connection of these two negotiations;but he had been inclined to believe that each could be dealtwith on itn merits and that there was a good prospect ofsecuring a satisfactory conclusion to both within the nexteighteen moatfee.President Pompidou had also reaffirmed French adherence tothe programme for the future development of the Communitywhich had been prescribed by the European SummitConference in October 1972, including the establishment of a regional Development Fund; and he had agreed with our viewthat Community Funds used for regional development must beput to good use and be subject to proper control.    He had alsopaid tribute to the recovery of the British economy.    But hehad been concerned about the attitude of the nigerian government to the re-negotiation of the Yaounde Arrangements;and he had suggested that we might use our good offices to persuade the Head of the Nigerian Government, General Gowon,to adopt a more constructive attitude on this issue.
In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the meeting ofthe Council of Ministers (Energy) on 22 May had made little progress and, in particular, had been unable to agree guidelinesfor the Commission in producing proposals for a Communityenergy policy.    This was largely the result of Frenchinsistence that an organised oil market throughout theCommunity was a precondition for establishing co-operationbetween Community and other consumer Governments.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatwe must maintain the pressure on our Community partners to adhere to the agreed timetable for the work commissioned bythe Summit Conference.    The formulation of a Communityenergy policy was a matter of great importance; and we must continue to seek to ensure that it would be given thenecessary priority.The Cabinet -Took Note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.5
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSDiscussionswith tuc and CBI onCounter-InflationPolicy6, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had agreed on the previous day that there might be further discussions with theGovernment about the future of the economy; had approved theattitude which their representatives should adopt on the questionswhich they would wish to have discussed;  and had agreed that any conclusions would need to be reported to the TUC Annual congress in September for its endorsement.previous reference &apos;.sCM(73) 2$th conclusions,Minute 5HarlandandWolffPreviousReference:rCM(73) 2$th conclusions,Minute 5THE SECRETARY OF STATE F OR EMPLOYMENT said that thePresident of the Boilermakers&apos; Union, Mr McGarvey, had now decided to support the attitude of the local union officials at Harlandand Wolff in Belfast^ who were seeking to insist on the payment of productivity bonuses before they would be prepared to discuss the pay settlement under Stage 2 of the pay policy.    A further meeting-was to be held that day in order to try to resolve the dispute.There were undoubtedly dangers in the present situation^ both for the Governments economic strategy and for security in NorthernIreland; and it was to be hoped that a settlement within the terms ofthe pay policy would prove possible.unemployment the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theunemployment returns to be published that day would disclose afurther and substantial decrease of about 100, 000 in the total numberunemployed.    The most substantial reductions had occurred inScotland and the North West of England.    A shortage of skilled workers was now becoming apparent in some trades.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Secretary ofState for Employment.
POLICY ON 7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of housing State for the Environment (CP(73) 63) and the Secretary of StateIMPROVEMENT    for Scotland (CP(73) 62), to which were appended draft white papers on house improvement policy.Draft White THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatPapers a vigorous programme of improvement to older housing was anessential element in the Governments housing strategy.    A greatdeal had already been achieved in this respect;  and improvement grants were being taken up in record numbers.    But it was important to sustain this effort in order to demonstrate theGovernments determination to deal urgently with the nation&apos;sexcessive legacy of sub-standard housing.    The Department ofthe Environment had completed a PAR study of policy on olderhousing, v/hich had shown that, when the legislative authorityfor higher improvement grants in Development and Intermediateareas expired in June, 1974, a reduction in the total of grantaided improvement could be accepted on the basis that resources would be concentrated on dealing with the most serious areas of housing stress and deprivation.    The draft White Papers therefore proposed the establishment of Housing Action Areas, within whicha wide range of special powers and additional financial assistance would be deployed in a concerted attack on the worst housing conditions.    It was also proposed to give more encouragement togeneral improvement areas and to make the structure of improve-ment grants more flexible; to make the grants more selective;and to check possible abuse by stopping full grants for the more expensive owner-occupied properties and all grants for secondhomes and by allowing local authorities to attach conditions togrants to landlords.    It. was proposed that the White Papers shouldbe published in early June.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that it was intended that the general policy proposed for England and wales should apply also in Scotland.    Some of the detailed arrangements described in the draft Scottish White Paper were different fromthose envisaged for England and Wales; but this was attributableentirely to different local circumstances and should cause noembarrassment.In discussion the following main points were made:-a.    The draft White Paper for England and Wales hadbeen discussed with the Department of the Environmentsadviser on business rents, in order that he might considerwhether any particular difficulties could be expected in giving effect to its proposals and, in particular, whetherthey were likely to be open to abuse.    He had consideredthat they were satisfactory from this point of view, subjectto a few minor amendments of which account had alreadybeen taken.7
b. It was desirable that further attention should be givento the difficult question of the best means of co-ordinating the range of policies directed to  urban problems, of whichhousing improvement was only one.c. It would be helpful to emphasise in the draft annexed to CP(73) 63 that mobility of labour, which was being reduced by the decline of the private rented sector, wouldbe increased by the proposals described in the white papers, particularly by the increased level of activityenvisaged for the Voluntary Housing Movement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the draft White Papers subject to an expansion of the reference to mobility of labour on the lines suggestedArrangements should therefore be made for them to be published in early June.    The precise timing and the associated publicityarrangements should be agreed with the Home Secretary.The Ciabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Secretaries of State for the Environment,for Scotland and for Wales, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office24 May 1973
