1.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Government might well be defeated in the Debate which was to take place in the House ofCommons later that day on an Opposition Motion directed to preventing the issue of licences for the export of live animals forslaughter overseas.    A Government amendment had been tabledseeking to restrict such a provision to the export of live animalsto those countries where there was evidence that the BalfourAssurances were not being observed.    But, if this amendment was rejected, as seemed likely in view of the strong emotions arousedby allegations of cruelty to animals, no useful purpose would be served by opposing the substantive Motion, even though a generalprohibition of the issue of licences would place us in breach of our obligations to the European Economic Community (e.c.) and might therefore expose us to the risk of proceedings before the EuropeanCourt.    It would be desirable, however, during the Debate to keepto a minimum any reference to the implications of our EECobligations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that every effort should be made to ensure that the amendment wascarried.    But, if it was defeated, the substantive Motion should notbe opposed.2. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that he proposedto make a Parliamentary statement that afternoon in connection withthe publication of the Report of the Security Commission on therecent incidents which had resulted in the resignation from theGovernment of Lord Jellicoe and Lord Lambton.    He would be ableto say that the Government accepted all the recommendations of theCommission, including their proposals that all members of theCabinet, together with certain other Ministers who had to deal withany substantial volume of sensitive material, should be supplied with security containers in their homes and that the security briefing whichwas given to all Ministers on appointment should be amplified in thecase of certain Ministers who occupied particularly sensitive posts.The Commission had also advised that the Prime Minister should issue guidance for Ministers on the potential security implications of scandalous behaviour and of other circumstances which mightexpose them to pressure by hostile intelligence agents;  and thestanding instructions entitled &quot;Questions of Procedure for Ministers&quot;,which all Ministers should re-read at regular intervals, wouldhenceforward provide accordingly.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Prime Minister.
OVERSEAAFFAIRSmm mumRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(73) 35thConclusions,Minute 23.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he proposed to announce in Parliament on 19 July that, in theabsence of any agreement with the regime in Salisbury about an acceptable constitutional settlement, it would be necessary tomaintain sanctions against Rhodesia and that the Government would accordingly seek the renewal of the Sanctions Order in due course.Conference on security andCo-operation in europe the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that themeeting of Foreign Ministers of the countries participating in theConference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, held inHelsinki from 3 to 7 July, had been not unsatisfactory from our point of view.    The Soviet Union, together with their allies apartfrom Romania, had been put on the defensive because the western allies and the neutral countries had demonstrated that they wished tosecure positive results from the Conference and would not besatisfied with merely a broad declaration on peaceful co-operation which was the Soviet objective.    In view of this difference of objectives the second stage of the Conference, which was to open in geneva in September, might well prove to be rather sterile.    Butthe Soviet Government might feel obliged to make some concessions,especially in view of the vigorous attitude of the neutral countries.The separate negotiations on Force Reductions were to begin inOctober; and we should need to give further consideration to themost effective means of developing an agreed position to be adoptedby the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,Portugal THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that asa result of the public reaction to recent Press reports about amassacre which was alleged to have been perpetrated by thePortuguese authorities in Mozambique in December 1972, theforthcoming visit to London by the Prime Minister of Portugal,Dr Caetano, was likely to be attended by some degree of disturbance.The accuracy of the Press reports, however, was by no means certain; and, although there had been earlier rumours of fighting in Mozambique at the time in question, there had been no evidenceof any massacre.    The Portuguese Government had now announcedthat they intended to institute an inquiry into the alleged incidents;and he had suggested to the Portuguese Ambassador that this mightcarry more conviction if it were directed by the Chief Justice ofPortugal than if it were conducted by purely administrative procedures.
ftTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, since Dr Caetano&apos;s visit might now be the occasion of hostile demonstrations, the Home secretary should review the relevant arrangements for maintaining security and public order.FrenchNuclear TestsPreviousReference:CM(73) 34thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theFrench Government were likely to carry out nuclear tests in the pacific in the near future.    The New Zealand Government, whowere strongly opposed to the tests, had asked us to pass to themurgently any information which we might obtain about their precisetiming;  and this had raised difficult problems for us in terms ofour relations with both France and New Zealand.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the New Zealand Government hadnot so far made their request public;  and it was important that itshould not be disclosed.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.2. Invited the Home Secretary to review the arrangements for maintaining security and public order during the forthcoming visit to London by the Portuguese Prime Minister.ft3
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat it would be necessary to give further consideration in due course to the alleged incompatibility between the subsidy paid to united Kingdom sugar refiners and the Treaty of Rome and to thepossibility of introducing monetary compensatory amounts in respectof United Kingdom imports of dairy products from New Zealand.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that theEuropean Parliament was sometimes referred to as the european assembly.    The appropriate style, however, was european parliament;  and this title should be used consistently.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statements by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.4
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSOperation of counter -Inflation(temporary provisions)Act 1972PreviousReference:CM(73) 35thConclusions,Minute 55. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thathe had now obtained the advice of the Law Officers on the County-Court judgment in the test case by an employee of the LondonCo-operative Society (LCS) who had claimed payment of a wage increase which contravened Section 3(2) of the Counter-Inflation(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1972, in respect of the period beforethe Government made an Order freezing the payment of the increase.The Law Officers had confirmed that Section 3 of the Act provided avalid defence for all employers against payment of a wage increasein these circumstances; that, if employers did not avail themselves of that defence, it was the duty of the courts to take Section 3 intoaccount; but that, since the court had not done so and the LCS hadpreferred not to appeal against the judgment, neither theGovernment nor any other party could now intervene.    Unfortunately,it now appeared that the Pay Board had already formally approved the Stage 2 increase in pay for the group of workers concerned;  and,although the Board&apos;s lawyers were re-examining the matter in thelight of paragraph 113 of the Price and Pay Code, it seemed thatthe Board might be unable to take steps to abate the Stage increase by an amount equivalent to the deferred increase whichthe LCS were now paying.    There was as yet no sign that other unions were seeking to take advantage of the judgment in the LCStest case;  and in the circumstances the least disadvantageouscourse might be to take no further action.The Newspaper There was to be a meeting between the Newspaper PublishersIndustry Association (NPA) and the five unions in the newspaper industry on the following morning in order to discuss the dispute which had resulted from the decision of the NPA not to implement a thresholdpay agreement which contravened Stage 2 of the pay policy.    He had discussed the situation with the Chairman of the Association;  and it seemed likely that they were contemplating an arrangement wherebyan amount equivalent to the increase which would otherwise havebeen paid would be made available to improve the industry&apos;soccupational pension scheme.    Such an arrangement would not bein contravention of the Pay Code.The Motor In view of the return to work of the employees at Perkins EnginesIndustry at Peterborough there were now no major industrial disputes in the motor industry.previous reference:*CM(73) 34th^Conclusions,Minute 55
THE PRIME MINISTER said that preparations for the next meeting with representatives of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), to beheld on3L7 July, were being made by the Ministers most closely concerned;  and all the measures which might possibly form a basis for an agreement with the TUC about the Stage 3 pay and pricespolicy were being carefully examined.    Since it might provedesirable to give some indication of the Governments intentions in this respect during the Parliamentary debate on the opposition motion of Censure on 18 July, it might be necessary for the Cabinetto consider the issues involved on the previous day.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Employment.6
6. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that, although there had been no significant deterioration inthe general situation in the Province, sporadic violence continued^In the political context he had now secured agreement that the newAssembly would hold an initial meeting at Stormont on 31 july  andthere was some hope that a member of the Social Democratic andLabour Party might emerge by general consent as its PresidingOfficer.    The formation of an Executive, however, would be amore difficult task;  and it was impossible at present to predictwith any certainty the outcome of the negotiations on which he was now engaged for this purpose.    But he had made it clear to all theParties concerned that a decision could not be deferred indefinitelyand that the position must be resolved, one way or the other, by mid-September.The position xnight be further complicated by the fact that twojournalists who had secured certain evidence about a recent murder,on the strength of which the Attorney General had instructedcriminal investigations to be put in hand, might now refuse their co-operation in these investigations on the ground that they werenot prepared to disclose their sources.    As a result a potentiallyawkward political situation might develop.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.
ROLE OF THEBUILDINGSOCIETIESPreviousReference:CM(73) 31stConclusions,Minute 67. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the question ofmortgage finance.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that at their meeting on 14 June the Cabinet had invited him, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for the Environment, to arrange urgentdiscussions with the leaders of the Building Society movement aboutthe control of interest rates at the expiry of the bridging grant.Two meetings had taken place with representatives of the building societies Association (BSA), during which it had been made clearthat the Government would be prepared, if necessary, to seekstatutory powers for this purpose and had satisfied themselves that legislation would be technically practicable.    At the second meetingthe BSA representatives had reported that the 10 largest building societies would support the maintenance of a mortgage rate of9^ per cent and had indicated that they were confident that a majorityof their Council would endorse this view at their meeting during thefollowing week.    There had been less agreement on the appropriatelevel for the investment rate; but there was little doubt that itwould be in the range 6. 3 per cent to 6. 5 per cent.    The BSArepresentatives had indicated that they regarded this as a temporaryrate structure, which would need to be reviewed in the light of developments as regards interest rates generally and of its effecton the societies funds.    But they expected to be able to maintainthe 9-  per cent mortgage rate until about the end of the year.    Thestatement which would be issued by the Association following themeeting of the Council would present the decision as their own,although indicating that it had been reached after consultation withthe Government.    It would not refer to the level of housevaluations upon which loans were based; but it would indicate thatpreference would continue to be given to first purchasers and to thepurchasers of new houses.    Moreover, the restrictions on specialadvances would be retained.The reduction in the investment rate would inevitably lead to some limited reduction in the in &quot;flow of funds;  and this should help to restrain house prices.    There were already signs that the rate of increase in prices had been significantly reduced.    A recent surveyindicated that, whereas house prices had risen by 25 per cent inthe second half of 1972, they had increased by only 8 per cent in thefirst half of the current year.    Moreover, it appeared that in thesouth of England the price of older houses had fallen.As regards the longer term satisfactory progress was being madein the discussions with the BSA about the introduction in the autumn of voluntary and informal arrangements for providing special assistance to first-time purchasers and about more formal plans,which might have to be supported by legislation, for the stabilisation of mortgage finance and the provision of help for first-time purchasersAgreement might be reached in time for a report to be made to theCabinet in the first half of September.8
In discussion it was suggested that the restriction on the availability of mortgage funds which was likely to result from a lower investmentrate might lead to an increase in the demand for loans from localauthorities.    Decisions might soon be needed, therefore, about thepossibility of increasing the resources available to them for thispinrpose.    There was likely also to be some slowing down in theoutput of new houses.    On the other hand the Governments purpose was to ensure that the total funds available from all sources for house purchase were sufficient to maintain house building at asatisfactory level without provoking excessive increases in theprices of houses;  and it would be helpful if this could be made clear to the building industry in order to anticipate any loss ofconfidence on their part and a consequential reduction in the levelof house building.    But, even if there were some reduction in thenumber of new houses completed, this would be an acceptable price to pay in return for securing a halt in the rapid upward trend in house prices.    In connection with the development of longer termplans it might be desirable to bear in mind the possibility of some adjustment in the composite rate of tax paid by the building societies and of further measures to encourage the availability ofland at acceptable prices.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theMinisters who had taken part in the discussions with the BSA wereto be congratulated on the satisfactory outcome. Furtherconsideration should now be given to the proposal for an early meeting with representatives of the construction industry in orderto explain to them the Governments policy about finance for house purchase and to indicate that it gave no grounds for a reduction inthe scale ofJ *eprivate house building.    It was desirable in relationto the development of Stage 3 of the Governments counter-inflation -ary policies that agreement with the BSA on longer-term proposalsfor the stabilisation of mortgage finance and related matters shouldbe reached by the beginning of September.The Cabinet1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to examine the possibility of consultations with the building industry on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the environment, to report to the Cabinet in the first half of September on the discussions with the BSAabout the long-term stabilisation of mortgage finance.9
8.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP(73) 78), to which was annexed a draftre-statement of the Governments policy in relation to the Maplinproject as a whole.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, if the cabinet considered the draft text acceptable, there were several ways inwhich it could be used.    It might form the basis of a majorMinisterial speech;  or it might be published as a popular pamphlet,perhaps with diagrams and illustrations; or, if elaborated in rather more detail, it might appear as a Parliamentary publication,eg. a White Paper.    But there might be procedural objections to apublication of this kind before the Maplin Development Bill had become law, having regard to the convention that a Governmentshould not spend public money in seeking to persuade public opinionabout the merits of a Bill currently in the course of parliamentary debate.In discussion it was suggested that a speech alone would not makesufficient impact on public opinion, particularly in view of the factthat broadly similar ground had been covered in the recent letterfrom the Prime Minister to Mr Toby Jessel, MP, which hadattracted considerable pablic attention.    A possible alternative course would be to publish the text together with the consultationdocuments on the traffic corridor and the New Town area on23 July, on the ground that it would contribute to a more informedpublic discussion o  those documents.    On the other hand, theremust be doubt whether it would be wise to publish a re-statement ofpolicy immediately before the holiday season, since its impactwould quickly be lost;  and publication might therefore be preferablein the autumn, when it could be followed up by a sustained publicity campaign.    In the meantime there were several immediate uses towhich the draft might be put.    It could provide valuable material for speeches by the Governments supporters; it could formvaluable briefing material in relation to the Committee Stage of theMaplin Development Bill in the House of Lords, which was to betaken in the week immediately preceding the Recess;  and it mightform an appropriate basis for a television programme.    Subsequently,an extended version might be prepared and issued as a publisheddocument.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were attracted by the general content and presentation of thedraft circulated by the Lord President of the Council and agreed thatuse should be made of it in securing the effective public presentation of the Governments policy in relation to the Maplin project.    any minister who wished to offer detailed comments on the draft should send them to the Lord President of the Council as soon as possible.Publication of a text on these lines immediately before the holiday10
period might be untimely; but urgent consideration should be givento its other possible applications on the lines suggested in discussion.It would be helpful if a campaign by Government backbenchsupporters and others could be launched and sustained during thecoming weeks;  and further thought should be given to the publicationlater in the year, after the enactment of the Maplin DevelopmentBill, of a document based on the draft, possibly in a more extendedform.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for the Environment, theSecretary of State for Trade and Industry, theLord Privy Seal and other Ministers concerned,to consider urgently the immediate uses to whichthe draft re-statement of policy might be put, onthe lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with theLord President of the Council and the Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry, to consider thepublication of an elaborated version of there-statement of policy later in the year and to circulate proposals to the Cabinet.11
9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications (CP(73) 77) proposing an increase inthe levy on independent television,THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the levy had been introduced in 1963 in response to public criticism of the profits which werebeing made by the programme companies.    But in its present formof a charge on advertising revenue it bore heavily on the weakercompanies;  and both the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA)and the programme companies themselves would prefer a levybased on profits.    The Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting (BG)had examined possible methods of introducing a levy of this kind.But it had so far proved impracticable;  and the choice now appeared to lie between increasing the existing levy or allowing the programme companies to continue to make very high profits.In discussion it was suggested that in a period of incomes restraintthe profits currently being earned by the programme companies inexploiting a franchise at the Governments disposal would attractwidespread criticism.    The rate of the levy had, indeed, beenhalved in 1971; but since then the companies&apos; revenue from advertising had so increased as to yield an average return of some55 per cent, rising to 100 per cent and more in the case of somecompanies.    It was unfortunate that the Minister&apos;s proposals for a voluntary second-tier rental based on profits, which the IBA wouldhave undertaken to administer by agreement with the programme companies, could not be implemented; but the Law Officers had advised that the statutory basis of the existing levy gave no scopeto introduce different arrangements on a voluntary basis and thatany attempt to do so would be open to challenge both in the courts and by the Public Accounts Committee.    There was reason tobelieve, however, that the programme companies would acquiesce,albeit reluctantly, in an increase in the rate of levy if this were tobe combined with a firm commitment by the Government to legislate for the introduction of a system based on profits;  and theopportunity might be taken to elaborate the Governments proposalsfor such a system, as well as for the allocation of the fourthtelevision channel and related matters, in a discussion document which might be issued early in 1974.On the other hand an increase in the rate of levy would be keenlyresented by the programme companies;  and, although the IBAcould exercise some discretion in relieving the smaller companies of the obligation to pay the lowest tranche, an increase of as muchas 50 per cent in the rate would inevitably create severe problems in certain cases.    It would be particularly unfortunate if UlsterTelevision, whose support for the Governments policies inNorthern Ireland was a valuable corrective to adverse commentfrom other quarters, were to be put at risk by such a step.12
Moreover, the levy in its present form had been under attack beforethe Government took office;  and it would be difficult to argue thatthe system could not be changed because it was now too late to legislate during the life of the present Parliament,,    Rather thanincrease the rate of the levy in its existing form (which wouldrequire the laying by 16 July of an Order requiring affirmative resolution of both Houses) it would be preferable, despite theheavy burden of prospective legislation in the next Session, tointroduce a short Bill (which might be confined to enabling powers)to change its basis.    The intention to legislate would be a sufficientanswer to any criticism about the excessive profits of the programme companies which might meanwhile be expressed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the need to moderate the excessive profits of theprogramme companies but considered that to increase the presentlevy would be objectionable in itself and would give rise to needlesscontroversy.    Since the Law Officers had advised that there was nomeans of increasing the levy otherwise than as prescribed by statute, urgent consideration should now be given by the ministers concerned to the possibility of introducing a short Bill, either afterthe Recess or at the outset of the next Session of Parliament, toauthorise a profits-based levy on the lines which the ministerial committee on Broadcasting had recently considered.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office12 July 197313
