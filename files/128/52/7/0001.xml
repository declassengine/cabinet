1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2, The Cabinet resumed their discussion about the implement-tation of the Report of the Robens Committee on Safety and Healthat Work,THE HOME SECRETARY recalled that at a recent meeting theCabinet had decided that the functions and scope of the proposed new central Authority should be on the lines described inAppendix 2 to CP(73) 60 (Model A); but that there might bea case for limited departures from those detailed proposals,provided that they were kept to the minimum, and that any ministers who wished to suggest such changes should discuss them with him.As a result it was now suggested that the new Authority should nothave responsibility for safety on farms or for the agriculturalInspectorates concerned;  that exceptions should also be madein respect of the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate and the IndustrialPollution Inspectorate in Scotland; and that special arrangements should be made in respect of educational premises.    His ownconclusion was that a case had been made out for excluding theagricultural industry, bearing in mind both its special nature andthe scope of the responsibilities of the Agricultural Ministers.Special considerations also seemed to apply in the fields ofeducation and health; and here the appropriate course mightbe for regulation-making powers to be exercised jointly by theSecretary of State for Employment and the relevant departmental ministers,    But it was not desirable that exceptions should be madefor the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate and the Industrial PollutionInspectorate, since this would undermine the general principleprescribed by the Robens Report that there should be a singleunified Authority, whose responsibilities would extend not merely to the health and safety aspects of arrangements in places of workbut also to the effects of those arrangements on the safety and health of the general public.    Moreover, the transfer of the two Inspectoratesto the new central Authority need not entail any loss of their individual identities.Decisions on these questions should, if possible, be announced during the debate in the House of Commons on the following Mondayon a Motion related to industrial injuries.In discussion, it was maintained that there were good grounds for theview that the Alkali and Clean Air Inspectorate should remain outsidethe new central Authority, albeit on the basis of arrangements forclose liaison.    This view had been strongly urged by the
Confederation of British-Industry (CBI) and by the chemical industries Association.    The Inspectorate was concerned withgeneral environmental questions rather than with safety and health;and, although there was no question of transferring to the newAuthority any of the other responsibilities of the Secretary of Statefor the Environment for environmental and pollution questions, itwould be difficult to exercise those responsibilities if the Alkali^ tl&amp;Inspectorate did not continue to be integrated with the Department.The merging of this expert and reputable Inspectorate would be widely regretted;  and there would be a risk that its present closeworking relationship with the Public Health Inspectors of local       ,authorities would be disrupted.    Similar arguments applied to       (the Industrial Pollution Inspectorate,    Model A, if accepted \unamended, would require this small Inspectorate to be dismantledin order to make possible the transfer of some of its members to thenew central Authority; and this would be particularly unfortunate ata time when the possibility of pollution caused by North Sea oil wasgiving rise to substantial public concern,On the other hand the transfer of the Inspectorates to the centralAuthority would not involve any loss of identity or impair the irrelations with other bodies.    Indeed, their standing might be enhanced;  and the exchange of knowledge and experience betweenthe various Inspectorates would be valuable.    Moreover, theAHui*. *a)Authority would be answerable to the Secretary of State for the environment for the administration of the Alkali Act,In further discussion it was emphasised that the presentation ofthe decision would need careful thought, particularly in the lightof recent accidents involving the deaths of several miners, since this would affect the attitude of the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM), who had close relations with the^^^^^^mspectorate and placed great confidence in their judgment.    It would be important,therefore, that the Governments proposals should be explained inadvance to the leaders of the NUM; .and the (^CBI should be similarlyforewarned of any decision to transfer the7lnspectorate0    If theannouncement of the Governments decision during the following monday!s debate could be made in general terms, there would betime to explain its detailed application to the interests concernedbefore any public statement had been made and, in particular, to reassure them that the transfer of an Inspectorate to the newcentral Authority need not involve any loss of identity or expertise.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the solution proposed by the Home Secretary.Safety on farms and responsibility for the relevant agriculturalInspectorates would thus not be among the functions of the newcentral Authority.    In relation to health and educational premises,
regulations should be made jointly by the Secretary of State for employment and the relevant Departmental Ministers.    The Alkaliand Clean Air Inspectorate, together with the relevant parts of theIndustrial Pollution Inspectorate, should be transferred to theAuthority.    But the Secretary of State for the Environment shouldtake an early opportunity of informing the CBI of the government&apos;s decision on this issue and of giving them suitable assurances,particularly in relation to the continuing identity of the Inspectorateand the responsibility of the new Authority to the Secretary of Statefor the administration of the Alkali Act.    The Secretary of State for employment should give similar explanations to the NUM in relationto safety in mines.    In the meantime, the announcement in theforthcoming Parliamentary debate should be made in general terms and should not anticipate the communication of some of the more detailed decisions to the interests concerned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister5ssumming up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment and theSecretary of State for Employment to proceed accordingly.COMPANY 3, The Cabinet discussed certain aspects of the reform ofLAW company law.REFORM--- The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recordedPossible separately.inquiry into LonrhoLimitedunderCompaniesLegislationHI3
4. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that the defence and Oversea Policy Committee had considered earlier that morning the latest developments in the Icelandic fisheries dispute.    As theresult of a recent clash between our trawlers and the Icelandicgunboats, the trawlers had now withdrawn outside the 50-mile limitand it seemed probable that they would refuse to return unless theywere afforded protection by the Royal Navy.    If sos the icelandic government would be in a position to claim that they had won a decisive victory; and the prospects of reaching an eventualagreement with them, which would enable our trawlers to re-establishtheir claim to fish within the limit, would be very small,,    TheMinister of Agriculture intended to clarify the position by discussionwith the trawler owners later that day; and the Committee had concluded that, if this meeting confirmed that the trawlers wouldnot return within the limit without Naval protection, we had no realalternative to providing a Naval escort.    They had accordingly decided that, in these circumstances, the frigates which were already in or proceeding towards Icelandic waters should movewithin the 50-mile limit, where their commanders should have discretion to deal with the situation as they judged best, subjectto their not using gunfire without specific Ministerial authority,for which purpose he would hold himself available, together withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Defence, to give whatever decisions were required at short notice.    In informing the Icelandic Government of our intentionswe would also make it clear to them that we remained ready to resume negotiations at any time.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC), in a recent comment onthe situation^ had referred to the waters in question as aconservation area,    Although the Icelandic Government hadchosen so to designate them, the designation was not one whichwe ourselves accepted; and representations should be made tothe BBC accordingly.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the proposed arrangements for affording Naval protection, ifnecessary, to British trawlers in Icelandic waters,2* Invited the Home Secretary to make appropriaterepresentations to the British Broadcasting corporation in relation to their recent comment on the Icelandicwaters in question.
5.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat the Council of Ministers, at their meeting on 14-15 May, had considered proposals from the Commission on a number ofimportant issues arising from the European Summit Meetingof October 1972.    The outcome had been generally favourable to the United Kingdom, although in all cases considerable further negotiation would be required before we could be certain that our objectives would be achieved.    The discussion on regional policy had revealed a general acceptance of the outline proposals madeby the Commission, although the French representative had adopted a critical attitude.    In the discussion on the renegotiation of association arrangements for developing overseas countriesour opposition to any attempt by the Community to seek reciprocaltrade concessions had been supported by all except the French.There had also been a useful discussion of the Community1 s approach to the forthcpmmg multilateral negotiations under the Genes-alAgreement or.;Trade, a*k3/SCdteif &amp;fc which had served to clarifysome points of difference.The Community would probably approve, within the next few weeks,some modest proposals by the Belgian Government for animprovement in its working procedures, to which we should be ableto give our support.    Within their limits they should be beneficial,But4. in the absence of some more drastic measures of reform^ itmust remain doubtful whether the Community1 s procedures wouldbe efficient enough to enable it to complete the complex tasksrequired by the Summit programme.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 26thConclusions,Minute 66, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that, despite two unfortunate incidents in the last few days, thesituation in Northern Ireland in terms of public security continued tobe relatively stable.    In addition, there had been a general welcomeby the leaders of nearly all the political Parties, with the exceptionof Mr Craig, for the Governments constitutional proposals.As he had indicated in reply to a Parliamentary Question on theprevious day accommodation was being prepared in the officialresidence of the Governor against the possibility that it might become appropriate for members of the Royal Family to payregular visits to Northern Ireland,    There was no present intention,however, that Her Majesty The Queen should herself visit theProvince oECONOMIC 7.

The Cabinet should also consider, however, thepublic presentation and the timing of their decisions.    In the lightof the recent improvement in the trade returns confidence in the economy was reviving; and the Governments principal purpose should therefore be to foster this confidence by showing that firmaction was being taken to moderate the growth of public expenditure,while allaying any fears of precipitate reversion to deflationarypolicies.In discussion it was suggested that a number of issues remained to be resolved as regards the reductions to be made in individual programmes and the extent to which these reductions should beopenly announced in the forthcoming statement.    In the case ofthe health and education building programmes there would be considerable political advantage in relying, so far as practicable,on the deferment of programmes by administrative means andrefraining from announcing specific reductions.    On the otherhand it was essential that the net total of the announced reductions should be at least  500 million.    There was, indeed, a case for seeking to announce a larger total, eg  650 million, in order toleave more room for manoeuvre and to allow for some modestincreases in expenditure on programmes of special sensitivity.
Reductions on this scale, however, did not seem to be attainable; andany increases in expenditure should therefore not be announced at thepresent time.    If, in the light of revised estimates of the shortfallon other programmes, scope for such increases subsequentlyemerged, it would be preferable to retain them for deploymentlater in the year, in the context of the next phase of the Governmentscounter-inflationary policy.In further discussion it was suggested that, although there might be some political advantage in a rather later announcement, it would be preferable, in order to avoid speculation, that the governments intentions should be made known as early as possible in the comingweek.    The timing would need to be further considered, however,in the light of more detailed examination of the Parliamentary andpolitical considerations and the availability of Ministers.    in presenting the reductions the Government should claim positivecredit for restraining the growth of public expenditure in orderto free resources for continued expansion of the economy; andthey should emphasise the redeployment of resources which wasthe main purpose and justification of some of the proposals,particularly in the field of the Department of the Environment.Care would need to be taken, however, about the presentation of the Scottish and Welsh elements in the proposed measures,where the same considerations did not necessarily apply.    Itwould also be important to demonstrate that sufficient control was being exercised over office building;  and the scope for reducingthe public office building programme should be carefully examined.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that anannouncement should be made during the following week of net savings in public expenditure totalling not less than  500 million in 1974-75.He would discuss with the Secretary of State for Defence later in theday the economies to be effected in defence expenditure.    As regardsthe other programmes the Chancellor of the Exchequer should discussany remaining points of doubt with the Departmental ministers concerned and, if necessary, with himself, with a view to achieving the minimum net total of  500 million.    Thereafter the Chancellorof the Exchequer should discuss the public presentation of theGovernments decisions with the Home Secretary and the lord president and should agree with the Departmental ministers concerned the manner in which individual items should be dealtwith.    The Lord President should consider further the detailedtiming of the announcement in the light of the points made in discussion.
The Cabinet -1. Agreed that an announcement should be made during the following week of public expenditurereductions amounting to at least  500 million in1974-7502.

COMPANYLAWREFORMPo s sibleInquiryinto LonrhoLimitedunderCompaniesLegislationIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTThe Cabinet considered, in the light of recent court proceedings,the desirability of promoting an inquiry under theCompanies Acts into the affairs of Lonrho Limited.THE MINISTER FOR TRADE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS said thatthe report of the recent court proceedings gave grounds for thinking that there might have been misconduct on the part of some of the directors of Lonrho Limited in relation, for example, to failure to disclose information to fellow Directors, the terms of occupancyof certain company houses and the nature of advances made tocertain private companies.    In at least one instance the misconductmight amount to a criminal offence;  and in others there might havebeen a breach of trust in relation to shareholders.    There were several factors which made the matter particularly difficult to dealwith.    Some of the companies concerned were trading in Rhodesia;complex and potentially embarrassing questions of taxation and exchange control were involved; and the company1 s position inrelation to a number of independent African States had been invokedto suggest that any action against it might jeopardise its considerableassets in Africa,    If it were thought that action should be taken bythe Government, three possible courses appeared to be open.First, under Section 109 of the Companies Act 1967 the Departmentof Trade and Industry could examine the company*s books.    Actionon these lines might lead to the initiation of a prosecution; but itwould not result in a report which could be published.    Second, the shareholders of the company could, if they wished, ask theGovernment to appoint inspectors under Section 164 of theCompanies Act of 1948.    Third, the Government could themselvesdecide to appoint inspectors under Section 165 of that Act,    The two latter courses would lead to the preparation of a report which couldbe published; but it was unlikely to be available for at least 18 months.It could be argued that action under companies legislation was unnecessary since, as a result of the court proceedings, the shareholders were already aware of the relevant facts.    ButCOPY NO1 e)cabinet confidential annex cm(73) 29th Conclusions^ Minute 3Thursday 17 May 1973 at 11. 15 am
the extent o  the public interest which had been aroused seemed topoint to the need for some form of inquiry.    There would be certain advantages in waiting to see whether the shareholders would seek an inquiry.    But they were not meeting until 31 May;  and the consequential delay might suggest that the Government wouldhave preferred to prevent full disclosure of the facts and had only been compelled to promote an inquiry by pressure fromthe shareholders,,    If the Cabinet decided that the right course was to set up an inquiry immediately under Section 165, it wouldbe possible to announce this decision in reply to a parliamentary question that day.In discussion it was suggested that, since the recent courtproceedings had given significant grounds for supposing that members of the Board of Lonrho might have been guilty of miscon-duct, there was adequate justification for invoking Section 165without further delay.    On the other hand an inquiry might havea seriously adverse effect on the fortunes of the company^particularly as regards its investments in Africa; and thiswould be contrary both to the national interest and also to theixiterests of the shareholders.    The Government was entitledand, indeed, obliged to take these considerations into account in deciding whether to invoke Section 165,    Little information about thema however, was available at present; and it thereforeseemed inadvisable to take an immediate decision to set up an inquiry,,    Even if too great a delay would be involved in deferringthis decision until after the meeting of shareholders on 31 May, itwould be wise, before reaching a conclusion, to make an urgentassessment of the likely consequences of an inquiry,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that strong arguments had been advanced for theestablishment of an inquiry.    To wait for the outcome of the shareholders&apos; meeting or to call for the company&apos;s books wouldinvolve undue delay and might be interpreted as an attempt by theGovernment to prevent disclosure of all the facts0    Action underSection 165 of the Companies Act 1948 might therefore be preferable.Such an inquiry, however, would extend over a wider field than the allegations which had been made during the recent court proceedings;and it might take a very considerable time to produce its findings.A final decision should therefore be deferred until there had beena fuller assessment of the implications, including the possibledanger that an inquiry might precipitate the nationalisation of thecompany*s assets in Africa or otherwise prejudice its prospectsin a manner which would be unjust to the shareholders.    The HomeSecretary should accordingly arrange for these questions to be examined as a matter of urgency, with a view to an announcementof the Governments conclusions being made at the beginning of thefollowing week,
The Cabinet -L, Took note, with approval^ of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.Z c Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Minister for Trade and Consumer affairs and the other Ministers concerned, to proceed accordingly,,Cabinet Office17 May 1973
