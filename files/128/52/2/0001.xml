EPARLIAMENTARY  1.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theAFFAIRSOVERSEAAFFAIRSMiddle EastRhodesiaHouse of Commons in the week following the Easter Recess,The Cabinet agreed that Ministers in charge of Departments shouldtake care to arrange their foreign travel, so far as possible, in sucha way as to ensure that they would be present in the House ofCommons on days when their Departments were at the head ofthe list of Parliamentary Questions,2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Government of the Lebanon, strongly backed by the egyptian government, had tabled a Resolution in the Security Council of theUnited Nations condemning the Government of Israel for havingcrossed an international boundary in their latest attack on Arabterritory and used terrorist methods in a neighbouring country.In its present form the Resolution would be liable to attract a UnitedStates veto.    We bad approached the French Government in order to enlist their co-operation in producing a more balanced form of words;but they would not collaborate for this purpose.    We must therefore seek to ensure some modification of the Lebanese Resolution, atleast to the extent of adding to a condemnation of Israel a call forall terrorist activities to cease.    Our relations with the arab countries, including the recent discussions which the Secretaryof State for Defence had held with the Government of Saudi Arabia,might require us to lean somewhat further towards the Arab countriesthan we should otherwise judge right.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therecent attitude of the Rhodesian regime had seemed likely to reducepressure in Parliament from those who were opposed to themaintenance of sanctions against Rhodesia.    But the recentacquisition by Rhodesia Airlines of Swing 720 aircraft, whichhad apparently been obtained illicitly from a German source, was likely to renew Parliamentary criticism of our policy on sanctions.
Indo-China THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Indo-China was deteriorating,    Phnom Penh, the capitalPrevious of Cambodia, was now virtually invested; and the United states reference: Government had felt obliged to bomb targets in Laos.    AlthoughCM(73) 23rd the situation in South Vietnam was reasonably stable at present,Conclusions, it could come under renewed pressure as a result of the unrestrainedMinute 2 Communist activity in these neighbouring countries.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
3.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat the main current topic of interest in the European economic community (e.c.) was the negotiations for common agricultural prices in 1973-74: but there was so far no firm news of the progress on the meeting in Luxembourg,    Once a settlement had been reached on this it sue the attention of the Community would be increasinglyfocused on those areas of longer-term policy on which action hadbeen prescribed by the meeting of Heads of Government in Parisin October 1972,,    The e.c. Commission would shortly produce aseries of reports on these issues, including the content of the second stage of economic and monetary union, social policy and regional policy.
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat Mr Brian Faulkner, the leader of the Unionist Party, was underpressure from Protestant extremists within the Party.    It was perhaps unlikely that he would yield to this pressure by abandoning the position which he had publicly adopted in relation to ourconstitutional proposals; but the official Unionist candidates for the election to the Assembly might now include some advocatingextreme views as well as some who followed Mr Faulknerss more moderate lead.The Irish Republican Army had recently mounted a major propaganda campaign against certain of our Army batSelions, notably the2nd Parachute Battalion; and this campaign had enlisted some support from Roman Catholic opinion both north and south of the border.    There could be no question, however, of reducing ouractivities against terrorists, which had recently led to a markedreduction in the level of shooting.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland,
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSNationalHealthServiceAncillaryWorkersFreviousReference:CM(73) 23rdConclusions,Minute 45. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidthat the ancillary workers1 dispute in the National Health service was now over and that, although it was arguable that the managementside had been unnecessarily generous in bringing forward the date ofthe introduction of the 1973 instalment of progress towards equal pay for women, the settlement was within the terms of the Pay Code.In discussion it was noted that the backdating on equal pay was of little interest to other trade union negotiators and that the settlementreached had been generally endorsed by the Press and public opinion.Harlandand WolffPreviousReference:CM(73) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthe dispute about pay and conditions of service at Harland and Wolffremained a cause for concern and could yet deteriorate further.The Boilermakers Union had advised acceptance of the managementsoffer, which was within the terms of Stage 2 policy; but the localshop stewards had recommended rejection.    There was to be a further meeting later in the day.The MotorIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that thestalemate at Fords was continuing, with sporadic trouble but nointensification of the dispute.    At Vauxhalls shop stewards had rejected a pay offer within the Stage 2 limits and had called for industrial action.    A strike at two plants of Rubery Owen, nowin its third week, was leading to some laying off of labour by other firms in the motorcar industry.NationalDay ofProtestPreviousReference:CM(73) 17thConclusions,Minute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the degree of stoppages during the projected day of national proteston 1 May would probably vary greatly by industry and by region.The main essential services should be maintained; and the principalimpact on the community was likely to be caused by interruptions in transport services.    There was accordingly some risk that many people would merely remain at home and that this would create the appearance of greater industrial dislocation than would in fact be the case.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Parliamentary Session since Christmas had been a long andtesting one and that the Cabinet would wish to express to the leader of the House and the Chief Whip their appreciation of all the efforts which had been made in order to carry forward successfully theGovernment&apos;s policies, despite the extreme difficulty of certainissues, including in particular the Governments proposals for northern Ireland.    The counter-inflation policy was now the criticalissue.    The Government had been successful in withstandingexcessive increases in pay; and it would now be essential toput even greater effort into restraining the increase in prices,Unless the Government were successful on this front also, theywould forfeit both public support and the prospect of improvedrelations with the trade unious.    But the position would be complicated by several pre sentationally difficult issues whichwould arise in the period immediately ahead, including the increasein steel prices, the negotiations for 1973-74 prices under the common agricultural Policy and a significant rise in our imports; and it wouldbe the more important for the Government to maintain a steady frontto public opinion and to make clear thoir determination to deal with prices in a way which would ensure the success of Phase 3 of the counter -inflation policy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.6. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he appreciated the inconvenience which was caused to Ministers and Departmentsby the additional security precautions which were currently beingenforced.    It would be premature, however, to contemplate any relaxation of these precautions in present circumstancesj  and allconcerned should co-operate in making them fully effective.7. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that he had appointed Mr J J B Hunt to succeed Sir Burke Trend as Secretaryof the Cabinet on the latter&apos;s retirement at the end of September.Cabinet Office17 April 1973
