parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.    It was intended that Prorogation should take place on 25 October;and the new Session was due to be opened on 30 October.FOREIGNAFFAIRSThailand2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that the stesdent riots in Thailand had led to many-casualties and the political and security situation had deterioration-ted badly.    With the departure of leading members of thecorrupt military regime and the introduction of largelycivilian government, calm had returned.     The King hadplayed an important role in securing a return to order.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.Middle east previous reference:CM(73) 47thConclusions,Minute 3The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the latest developments in the Middle East.    Their discussion and theconclusions reached are recorded separately.
OIL SUPPLIESPreviousReference:CM(73) 47thConclusions,Minute 2Prices3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYinformed the Cabinet that following;the abortive negotiations betweenthe Organisation of Petroleum,- Exporting Countries ^and. the oil companies in Vienna the previous week, the six major Gulfproducers had unilaterally announced increases of some70 per cent in the posted price of oil, and had included provisions for increasing the price to reflect the price of oil on the freemarket, which they could then influence by limiting supplies.The immediate increase would add some  420 million to theUnited Kingdom balance of payments in a full year;  it would put up the cost of petrol at the pump by 1. 5p a gallon probably rising to 2p by the end of the year;  and would add 0. 4 of a point to *3fceretail price index.    The member states of the Organisation of arab Petroleum Exporting Countries had further announced thatwith effect from the end of September they would cut backproduction by a minimum of 5 per cent every month for an indefinite period until the objectives of the Arab states againstIsrael had been achieved.    This action was aimed principallyat the United States; but the dependence of other countries on united States oil companies meant that the effect on Europegenerally would be severe.    For the United Kingdom a reductionof 5 per cent in supplies of Arab oil was equivalent to areduction of 3. 5 per cent of total supplies. But given that something like a month&apos;s supplies were in transit at any time, the firstimpact of this cut could be expected towards the end of November;and by mid-January our total supplies might be reduced by some7 per cent, and so on progressively.    In the face of this threat,economies in the use of oil could be achieved by publicity andexhortation; but if the Arab states1 campaign continued, it wouldbe necessary by the New Year to consider the introduction ofschemes of rationing and allocation.Contingency THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the CabinetPlanning would wish to know the position regarding contingency planning.There were clear advantages in having a Bill to confer thenecessary powe rs, rather than relying on the Emergency powers act.    The Bill was being printea forthwith and would be ready for introduction, if needed, on the following Monday.    It would benecessary to have Regulations under the Bill to indemnify the oil companies against claims for breach of contract, and othermatters;  and these were being prepared.    Preparations were also being made for the oil companies to impose initial cuts of up to 10 per cent on consumers, for administrative instructionsto public sector bodies on ways of achieving economies, (e.g.reduction in heating standards, speed limits, etc), and forexhortations to private industry and the public a$ large.Preparations for motor fuel rationing were being brought toC(: W; EVIDENTIAL
immediate readiness.    Some 17 million vehicles would be involved, and this would necessarily be a complex operation which would take time to introduce.    He had authorised consulta-tions to be held with the postal unions, and the necessary work of printing and distribution to be completed, so that if necesraryrationing could begin in about five weeks1 time.    The PrimeMinisters Chief Press Secretary would co-ordinate arrangementsfor publicity.In discussion it was suggested that the public presentation of theGovernments plans should not coiwey the impression thatrationing was imminent, as this might lead to panic buying andhoarding by the general public.     The emphasis should be onthe precautionary nature of these measures against the possibility that the Arab states might persist in their campaign over a periodof time.    It would be important to ensure that the oil companiesdid not raise their prices within the next three months.    But anapplication by the companies to the Price Commission on the basisof allowable costs must be expected to have a reasonable prospectof succeeding;  and if the price were to be held it might benecessary to take powers under the Liquid Fuels Bill to controlthem.    It was further suggested that these developments were likely to presage a period of growing stringency in the supply of oil;  and that in addition to the contingency preparations nowbeing made urgent consideration should be given to other measures,such as the control of oil exports from the United Kingdom, thepossibility of advancing the supply of oil from the North Sea, andfuture policy with regard to energy supplies, in particular thebalance to be struck between oil and coal.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theLord President would arrange for the Civil Contingencies Unit topress ahead the contingency/preparations to deal with a reductionin the supply of oil; and that the Secretary of State for defence would arrange for the Task Force on Oil Supplies to give urgent consideration to ways in which oil supplies could be maintained.The Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs, in consultationwith the Lord President, should examine ways of controlling theprices charged by the o?l companies in the light of the increasesnow announced by the producing countries.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.
4COMMUNITY informed the Cabinet that the&quot; meeting of the Council o:f Ministers atAFFAIRS LUXEMBOURG- ON 15 October had discussed the mandate to be given to theCommission  or the negotiations which had now opened for a new convention of Association between the Community and the presentAssociated States and the eligible developing commonwealth countries,    It had not proved possible to reach agreement onthe policy the Community should adopt on requiring tradereciprocity from the developing countries or on measures to helpsta.bilise their earnings from exports of primary commodities,but a decision on these issues would soon become urgent.    Ashort discussion by the Council of the Commission^ proposalsfor the establishment of a Community Regional development fund (RDF) had been of note only for a statement by the IrishForeign Minister in which he had gone some way towardsthreatening that the Irish Government would reject proposalsfor the Fund unless these were amended to give much improvedbenefits to Ireland.     The Italian Minister for regional development had given some support to the Irish criticisms.Discussion of the RDF would be resumed in the Council inNovember.In a brief discussion, it was noted that the opening positiontaken by the Irish on any issue was never to be regarded as their final position.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.
THE QUEEN&apos;S 5. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Lord PresidentSPEECH ON of the Council (CP(73) 99 and 101), to which weare annex&amp;d    draftsTHE OPENING ft)/? The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.OF parliament the Cabinet considered the draft speech paragraph by paragraph.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthey &apos; agreed that it would be necessary to include a reference to the situation in the Middle East and that the termsof paragraph 8 about the dispute with Iceland over fisherieswould have to be kept under review so that account could betaken of any further developments.    Further consideration should be given to the passage on housing   WITHa view, if possible, to clarifying the reference to thedevelopment of land for housing.    There was at present no reference to agricultural policy and a passage on this subject should be prepared.    The draft speech should be amendedaccordingly and, with the incorporation of the other amendments which had been suggested in the course of discussion, should be circulated to the Cabinet for further consideration at their next meeting.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President of the Council to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office18 October 1973
IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS government copy no cabinet confidential annex cm(73) 48th Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 18 October 1973 at 11. 00 amFOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(73) 47thConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatactivity in Sinai suggested that a major battle might be about to begin.    There v/ere however encouraging signs that the UnitedStates and the Soviet Union were now pursuing the search for peace.    They were in close touch with each other, and the SovietPrime Minister, Mr Kosygin, was in Cairo.    We ourselves had continued our efforts with the Arabs.    He had seen the soviet ambassador that morning.    There were indications that theGovernment of Israel might well be prepared to accept a cease-fire, including an arrangement for demilitarised zones.    Our, policy over the coming days must be related to these efforts toobtain a cease-fire.    In view of the continuing criticism of ourembargo on tha supply of ammunition and equipment to the battle-field countries and, in particular, of the allegations that we weredenying to Israel supplies which that country had a right to expect,and which she badly needed, he wished to inform his colleagues that there was not the slightest shortage in Israel of any of heressential requirements, and that no shortage was at presentforeseen.    If we were to lift the embargo we would be obliged tosend to Jordan twice as much as we would send to Israel, and wewould have to send to Egypt important military equipment of a kind which they did not hold at present.    The Arab oil producing states had announced their intention to cut the supply of oil.    It waspossible, however, that it would take them some time to put thisdecision into effect and he intended to use all the available devicesof diplomacy to persuade them not to do so.    We were possibly theonly Western country in a position to influence them.    We wouldsacrifice our ability to influence the peace moves and Arab policy on oil if we were to reverse our decision on the embargo.    He wastherefore convinced that the embargo must be maintained.    In the debate which was to be held later that day, there would no doubt be strong criticism of this policy from both sides of the House.HE would listen carefully to all the arguments    :: 1 &quot;&quot;&quot; &quot; &quot;&apos;-that might be advanced, but he would urge the House to view the
matter in the light of our total national interest, which was in thefirst place to get the war stopped, would repeat his assurance thatour policy, including the embargo policy, would be kept continuouslyunder review,    and   would ask the House to allow maximum room for the exercise of our diplomacy over the coming days and not tofetter the Government.In discussion it was agreed that the forthcoming debate would be conducted in an emotional atmosphere with divisions within theOpposition ranks as well as on the Government side.    The outcomewas uncertain.    It was suggested that for the sake of bothParliamentary and public opinion the Government should make itclear that it was a matter of the deepest concern to them that neither side in the war should be overwhelmed, and that if there were a danger of that happening, there would have to be a radicalreconsideration of our policy.    This was necessary in order to counter the fea.r that we had insufficient regard for Israel&apos;interests.    The Government must also be prepared to deal with the complaint that by continuing to send arms to Arab countries outsidethe battlefield area, we were failing to follow an even-handed policy as between the Israelis and the Arabs.    It was also argued thatwhile it was important that we should have the greatest possibleroom for diplomatic manoeuvre our ability to take an initiative wouldbe gravely impaired if the Government were defeated in Parliament,or succeeded only by a very narrow margin.    While, therefore, theGovernment should not reverse its policy, it would be important togive the maximum reassurance to its critics that the policy was notimmutable if circumstances changed.    It might be useful to link themaintenance of the present policy with the fact that peace moves were currently afoot in which we were closely involved, with the implication that our policy would be reviewed if they failed.    It wasalso suggested that since the Opposition were not united, theirleadership might be interested in avoiding a vote if the Governmentcould make some move towards them.    In this way a form ofnational policy might develop and last at least over the coming dayswhile the active search for a cease-fire was being pursued.    Inthis connection it was noted that the Leader of the Oppositionapparently had it in mind to suggest that the lists of the embargoed,items should be examined with a view to authorising the supply ofsome of them, not limited to one side alone.    It was felt, however,that this proposal, as it stood, presented difficulties as formidableas those which would attend a decision to lift the embargo altogether.On the other hand, it might be possible to ask for time to considerthe Opposition^ proposals, subject always to the overriding consideration that our first aim must be to persuade the Arabs andthe Israelis to stop fighting; to welcome further consultation withthe Leader of the Opposition, and to undertake to make a further statement the following week.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although there was undoubtedly much Parliamentary and public concern about the Governments policies, and Israeli propagandahad achieved some success in this connection, the measure of support for those policies should not be underestimated.    Therewould no doubt have been as much criticism if we had continued tosupply ammunition and equipment to both sides.    If we changed our policy at this critical moment, when some tentative movestowards restoring peace were being made, we wuuld sacrifice theopportunity to assist those moves.    The immediate problem was for the Government to emerge credibly from the debate.    TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would give furtherconsideration to the line he should take in the debate in the light ofthe points made in the CabinetS discussion.    While there were difficulties in accepting the proposals of the Leader of the Oppositionas they stood, there might be advantage in avoiding commitmentseither way about our future policy.    For the time being our presentstance was clearly right but it would have to be kept under review inthe light of developments.    In view of the critical importance of the debate it seemed desirable that the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, who was to open it, should also wind up.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office18 October 19733
