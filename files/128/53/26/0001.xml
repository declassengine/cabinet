1. The Cabinet welcomed Mr Ian Gilmour on his assumption of the office of Secretary of State for Defence.PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.ParliamentaryHoursThe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(74) 2) about changes in the days and times ofsittings of Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that a change in Parliamentary hours would have to be justified in terms of fuel savings and staffconvenience or for its psychological effects during the currentemergency.    In fact, however, very substantial savings in electricity had already been achieved;  and neither a reduction inthe length of the Parliamentary week nor an adjustment of theworking day so as to make more use of daylight was likely to savemore than another 10 per cent of electricity, while the saving from both measures taken together was unlikely to reach 20 per cent.Staff had already been helped by changes made in catering facilities.The case for either change would, therefore, havelito be argued inthe House largely in terms of its psychological contribution to thepresent situation: and he doubted whether there was sufficientforce in this argument to justify the practical difficulties whichwould be involved for Ministers and their Departments.    Moreover,he had learned since writing his memorandum that the Oppositioncould be expected to vote against both proposals,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were agreed that a proposal to change the presentParliamentary hours could not be justified in terms of fuel savingsover and above those already made and would not significantlyassist the Governments handling of the industrial situation.    TheLord President should, therefore, announce in Parliament at asuitable opportunity that the Government had decided not to ask parliament to adopt a shorter working week or to change its hours.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Lord President to proceed accordingly.
3,        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there seemed a fair prospect that agreement on a measure ofdisengagement between the Egyptian and Israeli armies would bereached by the end of the month.    Both Governments realised thattheir armies were vulnerable in their present positions, and thatdisengagement would be to their interest.    Disengagement might take the form of a limited Egyptian military presence on the eastbank of the Suez Canal with an area further east, occupied by theUnited Nations forces alone, separating the Egyptians from the Israelies. II in the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePresident of the United States, Mr Nixon, had sent messages to thePrime Minister and to Heads of Government in France, Italy, theFederal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, canada and Japan inviting them to be represented at senior ministerial level at a meeting to be held in Washington in February to discussthe international energy situation.    One of the purposes of themeeting would be to develop among consumer countries a concertedposition and thereafter to seek a meeting with representatives ofthe oil producing countries.    President Nixon also envisaged the participation in the meeting of a representative of the european commission, I!This was a welcome development and early consideration would haveto be given to our representation at the meeting and the policies tobe followed, .The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.2
that the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) would resume itsdiscussion of a Regional Development Fund on 14/15 January.Bilateral discussions with the German Government had not resolvedthe differences which had arisen over this question and it was expected that they would stand firm on their proposal for a smallfund.    The prospects for progress were, therefore, not good.Continuing deadlock would create political difficulties bothdomestically and in the Community as a whole.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.3
5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that at the meeting of the Unionist Council on 4 January, theagreements reached at the Sunningdale Conference had been rejected by a substantial majority.    Before the meetingMr Faulkner had decided that if the vote should go against him hewould ask for a. maeting of the Standing Committee of the unionist party, but the debate had been so bitter and he had been subjected to such strong personal attack that he had decided to resign fromthe leadership of the Unionist Party forthwith, although not from membership of the Party,/, On balance this was probably the rightdecision.    A riajor political struggle had now begun.    Mr Faulkner^opponents would seek to persuade his,supporters in the Assembly to ;defect, but so far he had lost only two of them, and his present strength in the Assembly was 19 members.    His opponents in theUnionist Party intended to call a meeting of its Standing committee as soon as possible in order to choose a new leader.   A number of candidates were in the field and at present there was no clearfavourite for the post.    Mr Faulkner was waging a campaign tosecure public support for his position.    He did not enjoy widepopularity and in view of his political history many Protestantswere disinclined to trust him personally.   Although he would himselfpursue the campaign vigorously his group were not adept in the field of public relations, and this might prove a serious weakness.    the policies followed by the Government of the Republic in the comingweeks would be of crucial importance.    The arrest by the Gardaof a number of IRA suspects on 3 January and their subsequentrelease had been regarded in Northern Ireland as a fiasco.    Theproposed message from the Prime Minister to Mr Cosgrave, thePrime Minister of the Irish Republic, would be timely.The Cabinet - %Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.4
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSCurrentIndustrialDisputesPreviousReferences:CM(73) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4 and cm(74) 1stConclusions,Minute 46. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe action of the British Railways Board (BRB) in suspendingdrivers who refused to obey instructions was unavoidable; it was becoming increasingly hard to justify paying up to  33 a week tomen who were not working.    The reaction of the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had been cautious:they had said only that they would consider cases on their merits.The BRB management did not expect an all-out stoppage.   services would be severely disrupted for a day or two, but it was possiblethat some members of ASLEF would not wish to continue theirindustrial action unless a strike were called, and ASLEF was nop ma position to give strike pay.   For the time being there was nodifficulty on any freight trains, including those that carried coal.The next few days should show whether the action by managementwould produce an improvement or a deterioration in the services.His meeting with the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) had beendepressing.    The moderate members of the executive were clearlyunhappy, but they said little and when they ppoke they played intothe hands of the militants.    Even the moderates made it clear thatthey would not settle for anything less than an immediate cashoffer.    The NUM executive were now meeting to consider their next steps; but it seemed unlikely that they would agree even to holda ballot, since the militants did not believe that the majority wouldvote for a strike.    All that could be expected was a decision tocontinue the present ban on overtime working.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the response of volunteers to drive ambulances had been extremelyencouraging,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that at a meeting inthe National Economic Development Council the representatives ofthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) had said that they accepted thatthe situation in the mining industry was exceptional and they undertook that if the Government would make possible a settlement between the miners and the National Coal Board the other unions would not use that as an argument in negotiations for their ownsettlements.    The manner in which the statement was brought forward at the meeting and made public afterwards suggested thatit was intended more as a propaganda exercise than as a seriousoffer.    In his Press conference&quot; after the meeting he had said thathe was grateful for the tuc&apos;s statement but that it did not seem toprovide the answer.    He had pointed out that the TUC had not given any assurance that other groups would not seek exceptional treatment.He had made it clear that the Government could not agree to any settlement in breach of the Stage 3 Pay Code.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received a letter from theGeneral Secretary of the TUC formally confirming the text of the tuc statement and asking the Government to give it carefulconsideration.    At the same time the Leader of the Opposition had put down a Private Notice Question asking the Prime minister whether the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer represented the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.In discussion it was argued that the Government had gone( as far as could be expected in offering to reconsider the future of the coalindustry.    The offer to discuss the long-term manpower situation inthe mines did not refer only to pay questions; there could begenerous proposals for employee participation, for pensions andfor the provision of special health treatment for miners, whichmight produce a settlement if offered at the right time.   It was argued that, if a more severe system of pay restraint were to beintroduced with special concessions for the miners the Governmentwould appear to the public to be conceding that the miners had an exceptional case not adequately covered by the terms of Stage 3;and since the public was also aware that the Counter-Inflation Actincluded a provision enabling the Government to permit a settlementturned down by the Pay Board, people would inevitably ask why thepower should not be used to settle the present dispute.    There were no means of putting pressure on the miners, and as unemploymentincreased public opinion was likely to turn against the Government.They should therefore make a final all-out effort to reach asettlement with the NUM.   Against this it was argued that theGovernment had given frequent assurances in Parliament that theprovision for overriding the Pay Board would not be used to buy offindustrial action.    Any settlement with the miners beyond the termsof the Stage 3 Pay Code could demonstrate once for all that theGovernment could never withstand the monopoly powers of unions:and this would not only put an end to all possibility of a rationaleconomic policy but would strike at the heart of democratic government.In further discussion it was argued that since the TUC proposal could not produce a settlement of the dispute it must be handledprimarily from the point of view of public opinion.    Owing toloosely-worded reports in the newspapers, many people had theimpression that the TUC had offered that if the Government would settle with the miners beyond the terms of Stage 3 all other unions would remain within the Code,    The aim of the Government must beto convince the public that the TUC had not made this offer;preferably the TUC should be made to admit it themselves.    TheGovernment had always professed itself willing to meet the TUC todiscuss any subject that the TUC liked to raise.    It would help interms of public opinion if the Government were to take the initiative6
in inviting the TUC to discuss this question;  and in order to avoidarousing too much public expectation of a settlement it would be right to hold the meeting as soon as possible.    It was true that by-calling the meeting the Government might be said to be consideringthe possibility of a settlement in breach of the Stage 3 Pay Code,but as there was no chance of the TUC actually producing an assurance that such a settlement with the NUM would not lead to similar demands from other unions, the question would not inpractice arise.    At the same time the Government could use theParliamentary debate on the fuel situation and the Private notice question to question the validity of the TUC offer and to make it ,clear that the Government would not consider any settlement in breach of Stage 3.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould invite the TUC by telephone to a meeting that evening.    Ifthey could not come then he would offer to meet them the following day or as early as they could manage.   His reply to the private notice Question would fully support the statement made by theChancellor after the meeting of the National Economic development council.    Every opportunity should be taken to make it clear that,although the Government were naturally willing to discuss any proposals that came from the TUC, there were a number of questions to be asked about their current offer, and the Governmentwould not in any case contemplate a settlement with the NUM in breach of the Stage 3 Pay Code.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.
7, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTrecalled that at their meeting on 20 December 1973 the Cabinet had agreed that studies should be put in hand of possible methods ofsecuring additional finance for house building from the private sector.    He had discussed with the Paymaster General how this could best be handled and as a result had on the previous day hada preliminary meeting with the Governor of the Bank of England,The latter had agreed that the proposals which had previously been mentioned to the Cabinet merited examination and would be arranging for them to be studied.    He hoped to be able to make a further report to the Cabinet towards the end of the month.11The Cabinet -Took note.8
8. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRYsaid that 15 per cent of the output of the British Steel Corporation(BSC) was produced by electric arc furnace, and that virtually thewhole of the output of steel from private firms - amounting to about10 per cent of total output - was produced by the same process.At present the normal restrictions were being applied to the supplyof electricity for steel manufacture; but if these were removed anincreased output of about 60, 000 tons a week would be obtainable.This compared with a total reduction in output which at presentamounted to about 120,000 /ions a week, though this figure would no doubt shortly increase.    There would, however, be an additionof about 1 per cent to total demand for electricity; and the decision whether to pay this price for the increased output of steel thusobtainable called for a very careful weighing of the balance ofeconomic advantage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that this was a matter calling for urgentdecision.    The Secretary of State for Energy, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, should consider! it immediately and report theconclusions reached to him.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for energy and the other Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office10 January 1974    /
