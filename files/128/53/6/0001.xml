THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY5S government copy no cabinet the PROGRAMMEFORCONTROLLINGINFLATIONStage 3PreviousRef e rence:CM(73) 44thConclusions,Minute confidential annex cm(73) 45th ConclusionsFriday 5 October 1973 at 11, 30 am the Cabinet resumed their consideration of Stage 3 of theprogramme for controlling inflation.    They had before them anote by the Secretary of the Cabinet (CP(73) 95) to which was attached a draft White Paper, and a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(73) 96) on the proposed landhoarding charge.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since the Cabinet discussion onthe previous day, agreement had been reached on the outstandingquestion concerning the treatment of nationalised industries in the consultative Document on the Pay and Price Code for Stage 3, andarrangements had accordingly been made for the consultative document to be published.    It was however crucial from both theindustrial and the economic point of view that Stage 3 should get off to a good start.   In the Code itself, action had been taken to meetpoints made in discussion by the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and Trades Union Congress (TUC).    In particular, steps had been taken to ensure that investment would not be held backby the Price Code;  and the Pay Code provided for a movement, inan orderly way, towards freer collective bargaining.    consideration had however also been given to other matters, falling outside the code itself, on which representations had been made to theGovernment.With regard to housing, action had already been taken to increasethe needs allowance for the calculation of rent rebates with effect from 1 October.    Agreement had also been reached with theCouncil of the Building Societies Association (BSA) on astabilisation scheme for mortgage funds.    While this would not beof immediate benefit, it would be a safeguard against a furtherexcessive rise in house prices if mortgage funds again becameplentiful.    Discussions had also been held with representatives ofthe building societies on the possibility of assisting first-time house
purchasers by reducing the rate of interest payable on mortgagesover the first 5 years.    The building society representativesbelieved that such a scheme would be feasible.    Rather thanseeking Government finance, they had appeared to favour initiatingthe scheme themselves, possibly with a Government guarantee against any default on the eventual repayment of the interestremitted during the initial 5 year period.    A scheme on these lines would be discussed by the Council of the BSA during the following week.    The problem of the supply of building land had been tackledby the issue to local authorities of a circular aimed at reducingdelays in the grant of planning permission.    Consideration had also been given to ways of dealing with the problem, which hadfigured prominently in the discussions with the TUC and CBI, of profits on land transactions.    It would not be possible in the timenow available to make any statement on this subject when the consultative Document was published, but possible alternativemeasures were being examined^ and these would have to beconsidered in due course along with the future of the proposed landhoarding charge.    Action had however been taken to deal with the criticism of excessive bank profits arising from recent increases in interest rates.    The Bank of England had now arranged with the banks that a lower rate of interest would be payable on specialdeposits.    This would reduce the banks1 profits by  30- 35 million in a full year.    While this figure might be criticised in relation tothe total size of bank profits it could be defended by reference tothe need for the banks to build up adequate reserves.Ways had also been sought of achieving greater stability in food prices.    Action was already being taken to hold down the retail price of milk, and this could be continued.    Attempts had beenmade to find some means of stabilising the price of a list of goods which entered into the normal weekly shopping basket: whilenegotiations with the retailers to this end had so far been unsuccessful, these efforts could be continued.    The other mainpossibility which had been considered was a subsidy on the priceof bread.    As a result of the very high prices which were now being paid in the forward market for hard wheat, the price of a standardloaf was forecast by the Ministry of Agriculture to rise from 11 ^pnow to 14p in April 1974;   and representatives of the millers had suggested that the increase during that period might be as much as4p, bringing the price of a loaf to 15fp.   Against this backgroundvery careful consideration had been given to the possibility ofsubsidising the price of bread in order to hold it at the present level.    This would however be extremely expensive and would be unwelcome to many Government supporters, and it had been concluded that a subsidy would not be practicable and that price increases must accordingly be accepted.    It would thus be all themore necessary to stress the importance of the cost of livingsafeguard provided by the proposed threshold arrangements in the pay Code.
Attention had also been given to the serious problem of the prices charged by the construction industry.    At present, except for road construction, tender prices were some 40 per cent higher than ayear earlier, and it was proving increasingly difficult to get public building programmes carried out.    There was a strong case forsome rephasing of these programmes in order to adjust them tothe capacity of the constructicn industry.    While the consequences for some programmes such as schools and hospitals might be criticised^ such action should be generally supported provided thatit was made clear that this was only a rephasing in view of thepresent overheating in the industry.    Housing, including married quarters for the armed forcesj would be excluded from the scopeof this proposalsBoth the TUC and CBI had pressed hard for some action to helppensioners.    Under the present administrative arrangements, itwas not possible to make an increase in the current rate of pensionbetween the annual upratings, and inquiries had been put in hand to see whether some other system could be adopted^ such as that now in use in Canada, under which increases in the level of pensionscould be made more frequently and at shorter notice.    In themeantime, however, the only early action that could be taken toassist pensioners was a repetition of the  10 lump sum paymentat Christmas which had been first made in 1972*    Against this itmight be argued that a repetition of the Christmas payment wouldmade it more difficult to refuse it in future, but the force of this argument must turn on decisions on pension policy which had notyet been taken..    The general feeling among the Ministers who hadbeen consulted was that the payment of a  10 lump sum to pensioners would be helpful in securing public acceptance of stage 3 of the counter-inflation programme.    If this measure wasadopted, however, the Cabinet would need to consider how it shouldbe financed.    It was proposed that the lump sum payment should be matched by an increase in the employers national insurance contribution.    Both the lump sum payment and the milk subsidy would however increase demand, and in order to maintainconfidence it would be necessary to show that this had beeneffectively dealt with.    The increased demand would be partly offset by the proposed rephasing of public constructionprogrammes, which was justifiable on its own merits.    discussions had been held with Ministers in charge of spending Departments tosee whether any further reductions in demand could be achievedwithin the public sector.    It would be necessary to impress on overseas opinion that the future health of the economy was dependent not only on effective demand management^ but also ongetting Stage 3 off to a satisfactory start, without serious industrial unrest which could severely damage our economic expansion,exports and the balance of payments.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the presentheavy current deficit in the balance of payments had adversely affected our reserves, and a more substantial fall had only been averted by the high level of public sector borrowing abroad.    Whilethe Sterling Agreements had been extended for 6 months, theproblem of the current deficit would continue.    In thesecircumstances, international confidence would be affected by the prospective level of public expenditure and the borrowing requirement.    The public expenditure savings secured earlier inthe year had been eroded by subsequent increases in debt interestand in local government expenditure, particularly in the field ofmortgage lending;  and many serious commentators felt that demand was already unduly high.    While the situation was stillmanageable, it would therefore need very careful handling.    he himself was unimpressed by l.c z case for including a lump sum payment to pensioners in the Stage 3 proposals, particularly as itwould need to be tax free and was therefore a regressive measure.But if it was to be done, it would be necessary to offset theincreased demand, which would be of the order of  90 million,including that created by the continuing subsidy on milk.    recent discussions between the Lord President and Ministers in charge ofthe main spending Departments had yielded savings with a demandeffect of only about  50 million, made up of  30 million onconstruction programmes (excluding roads),  15 million onmiscellaneous local authority projects,  3 million from theProperty Services Agency,  4 million from the Post Office, and ljj million from those nationalised industries for which theDepartment of Trade and Industry was responsible.    No calculationhad been made of the demand effect of the savings offered by theMinistry of Defence,    These figures did not add up to the  90 millionrequired, and if the Cabinet wished to authorise the lump sum payment, a further reduction in demand was therefore necessary.As a further reinforcement to international confidence, he wouldalso like to be able to make a public statement that the totals ofpublic expenditure for 1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77, in the public expenditure White Paper to be published later in the year, would beno higher in real terms than those published in the 1972 white paper (Cmnd 5178).In discussion it was argued that the lump sum payment paid to pensioners in 1972 had not been universally welcomed, partly because it was tax-free and therefore favoured the rich, and also because some deserving categories such as the disabled were notable to qualify for it,    A further such payment in 1973 might be welcomed by the TUC but would not materially affect trade unionbargaining attitudes.    On the other hand, the payment was widelyexpected, and there would be great disappointment if it was not forthcoming.    As regards the financial problem, there was a strong case in principle for financing pension increases by an increase in4
employees  contributions, since this would underline the fact thatpensions were essentially a transfer from the working to the non-working population.    In the present instance, however, any suchincrease in contributions would be seen as an erosion of the pay limit permitted under the Pay Code, and could therefore becounter-productive in securing acceptance of Stage 3.    With regardto the possibility of public expenditure savingss the Ministry ofDefence could offer  15 million in cash terms, but it had not beenpossible in the time available to calculate the demand effect,    Itwas urged that while action to sephase building programmes couldbe justified by the overheating in that part of the construction industry, this argument could not be used to justify reductions inother programmes, and if the Government were seen to find itnecessary to put together a considerable number of other smallsavings in order to meet the r-^t of the lump sum payment to pensioners, this could have ad yjxse rather than beneficial effects on confidence.    If further revenue was required, it might be better to raise taxation on luxury items such as cars, tobacco and betting.These would however tend to raise the retail price index, in somecases substantially, and this would eventually add to demand byadvancing the date when the threshold agreements would become operative.It was further argued that international confidence would be affectedless by precise calculations of the demand effect of the variousmeasares that might be taken, than by the overall effect on theExchequer,    The lump sum payment would be offset in due courseby the increased contributions, and the cash savings on publicconstruction programmes would be about double the figure quotedas the demand effect.    Attention could also be drawn to the shortfallwhich had already taken place in some programmes, including those of the nationalised industries, and to the saving on interestpaid on the banks&apos; special deposits.    In this way, the additional expenditure might be presented as more than fully offset.    On theother hand, the shortfall in Departmental programmes had alreadybeen fully taken into account in the economic judgment that thedemand effect of the lump sum payment ought to be fully offset byreal reductions in demand, and this point would be appreciated byserious commentators in the Pre^s and elsewhere.    Moreover, ifcredit were taken for items which reduced the government borrowing requirement irrespective of their effect on demand,account ought also to be taken of other changes,, such as the increasein local authority lending for house purchase, which increased the borrowing requirement.    On balance, the borrowing requirementhad not been effectively reduced since the Budget,5
In further discussion the following points were made -a. In discussion with the Minister of Agriculture, the millers had indicated willingness to consider increasingthe proportion of soft wheat in bread flour, and technical discussions were now continuing.    The reduction thatmight be achieved by this means in the price of a standardloaf was however unlikely to exceed \p.    The possibilitywas also being examined of arranging for increases in theprice of bread tc be less frequent, although of largeramount: the manufacturers would probably be preparedto co-operate in this if it could be found compatible withthe Price Code.b. If the construction programmes for education andthe social services were held back, there might becriticism if roads did not receive similar treatment.On the other hand, minor roads would be covered by theproposed reduction in miscellaneous local governmentprojects; and a reduction in the major roads programmed could not be justified by arguments about overheating inthe industry.    Prices for road projects had actually risenless fagt-than other costs.    Moreover, a revised road programme had only just been announced following theexpenditure reductions earlier in the year.    If further savings were required in the environmental field, it wouldbe preferable to seek to increase the savings from theProperty Services Agency.c. If Stage 3 was to win general acceptance, it would need to be seen to be fair.    In this connection, the lack ofany proposals to deal with land profits would be regardedas a serious gap.    It had however proved impracticable to devise measures for announcement at the same time asthe publication of the Consultative Document.d. Apart from the gain in revenue, a temporary increase in the car tax might be valuable both in reducingimports and in enabling our car manufacturers to takeadvantage of the present favourable conditions in export market.e. While a statement on the lines suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer would be desirable in orderto support international confidence in our economicmanagement, and would be a correct reflection of the objective of the present public expenditure discussions,the attainment of this objective might require substantial
savings in some programmes to offset increases in others.It would be preferable therefore not to make a public statement on these lines until the implications for individual programmes had been more clearly assessed,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet seemed agreed that on the publication of the consultative document on the Stage 3 Code he should announce the additional measures which he had outlined, including the proposed lump sum payment of  10 to pensioners.    The Chancellor of the exchequer should discuss further with the Lord President and Ministers incharge of the spending Departments the way in which the cost ofthis could best be met.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for the Environment.,should also keep a close v/atch on central and local government expenditure with a view to ensuring that no further increases tookplace over existing authorised programmes during the remainder of the financial year.    The Cabinet would consider further the advisability of a public statement on the lines proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer when they were able to consider areport on the current discussions on public expenditure betweenthe Treasury and spending Departments.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,2,        Agreed that a lump sum payment of  10should be made to pensioners in 1973, and thatthis ehould be announced on the occasion of thepublication of the Consultative Document on the stage 3 Code.3.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Lord President and other ministers concerned, to examine further theproblem of financing the proposed lump sum payment, as indicated by the Prime Minister inhis summing up.Cabinet Office8 October 1973
