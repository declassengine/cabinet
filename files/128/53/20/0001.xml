1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that in the course of the debate he wished to announce a number of measures connected with the admission into this country of United Kingdom Passport Holders(UKPH) from Kenya and Tanzania0    On 25 January he had toldParliament that we would not accept a further influx of UKPHarising from a mass expulsion as had recently happened in Uganda,He had also said that we accepted our responsibility to the UKPH andwould discharge this responsibility by admitting them in a controlled and orderly fashion, through the scheme of special vouchers whichwould be of the existing order of magnitude.    He and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had been concerned about the lengtheningqueue of UKPH in Kenya and Tanzania who had lost their employment as a result of the policy of Africanisation being followed by theGovernments of those two countries,,    The two Governments were themselves pressing for an increase in the number of special vouchergranted, and the UKPH were becoming increasingly restive at the growing de&amp;ay in obtaining vouchers for admission to this country.Unless these pressures were relieved the situation might get out of hand, and with the agreement of their colleagues most closely concerned, he and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarytherefore proposed to increase the number of vouchers,.    Atthe time of the Uganda crisis the global figure for quotas forUKPH was 3a 500 a year.    After the UKPH from Uganda hadbeen admitted, the allocation to Uganda was no longer necessary and the total figure of vouchers had therefore fallen to 2^250,    Itwas now proposed to raise it to 3,250,    In return for this theGovernment of Kenya and, he hoped, Tanzania would agree thatwe could say that we had reached an acceptable understanding withthem which would enable us to operate in an orderly way the policyof admitting UKPH under the special voucher scheme.    He wouldalso be able to say that the immigration figures for the first nine months of this year showed a significant decrease on the figuresfor the preceding years.    He also proposed to announce that wewere reconsidering the conditions under which students were accepted from abroad.    A number of students abused our hospitalityby contriving in one way or another to extend their stay.    Thenumbers should not be exaggerated,, and in percentage terms theywere relatively small, but the abuse should be stopped.    Further,he would announce his intention of asking the Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State at the Home Office to visit the Indiansub-continent to examine at first hand the problem of dependantsseeking to come here, and in particular to study the problem ofillegal immigration.    Finally, he would propose to announce that
additional financial assistance^ of the order of  6 million over thenext three years, would be provided to those areas in the country where a heavy concentration of immigrants had placed a specialburden on local resources.    He hoped that this money could befound from the funds available for overseas aid and that he wouldbe able to say so, since this would be a useful point with parliamentary opinioncTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion,said that although the extra numbers of UKPH involved inthe propcsals were relatively small9 this was a matter onwhich opinion in Parliament and the country was sensitive.The problem facing Ministers had been to combine proposalswhich were necessary if we were to avoid the danger of a furthermass exodus from East Africa, with proposals which would make that decision acceptable to opinion here.    The package proposedby the Home Secretary offered a solution which should be acceptable.The proposals regarding students would have to be presentedcarefully if they were not to provoke controversy.    It shouldbe pointed out that the abuse of the arrangements by students who were less concerned to pursue their studies than to extend their stay here was harmful to the interests of serious studentsfrom abroad^ and our own students.    The possible sources of funds to help areas of special difficulty were being examined urgently by officials.    Subject to these points the proposals were acceptable tothe Cabinet,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2, THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that because of the attitudeof the Israeli representatives on the question of disengagement,the ceasefire talks had broken down and there had been sporadicoutbursts of firing.    Unless the situation improved it might notbe possible for the peace negotiations to open on 18 December as planned.    The American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, was to visit Cairo again on 13 December, and he would then go on to Jedda,Amman, Beirut and Tel Aviv.
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs said that the new regime in Greece had issued a statement which made it clear that there was to be no early resumption of democratic government.    The regime was coming under criticismin the North Atlantic Alliance but it was essential to retain Greeceas a member, and instructions had now been sent to our ambassador to take action which would, in practice, amount to recognition of the regime.    It was not necessary to make a formal declaration of recognition^The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Minister of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the course of a briefvisit to Brussels the previous day he had discussed with the BelgianPrime Minister and Foreign Minister, and with the Prime Ministerof Luxembourg, the forthcoming Summit meeting to be held inCopenhagen on 14 and 15 December,    He had also met the Presidentof the Commission, M Ortoli,The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister,4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that a preparatory conference todiscus b the formation of a Council of Ireland would be held withrepresentatives of the Irish Government and the Executive-Designateon 6 and 7 December.    He hoped to be present for most of the time,and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland would also be there.    He had not accepted a suggestion of the Irish Government that the conference should be under the chairmanship of someone from the Commonwealth or theEuropean Community, and he would take the chair himself.The Cabinet -

He would, however, take the opportunity of themeeting of the National Economic Development Council next day to invite the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)for a preliminary talk.    He would emphasise to Mr Murray theconsequences of a continued ban on overtime in the coalmines forthe economy as a whole, and for the level of unemployment inparticular.    The Executive of the NUM was next due to meeton 13 December; both the militant element and the moderateshad been assessing their prospects of success if a ballot of miners were held on the issue of strike action.    Neither could be confidentof the outcome; faced with this situation, the Government shouldcontinue Its current line of publicity but should not exert any overtpressure in favour of a ballot.The overtime ban by the Electrical Power Engineers association was continuing.    The Pay Board had not yet reached a decision onthe application of the Pay Code to out-of-hours workings but had sought additional information.    Further delay was thereforeinevitable,A national delegate conference of the unions representing ambulancedrivers had met on 29 November and had called for an official work-to-rule and overtime ban, although emergency services would bemaintained^    The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and firemen (ASLEF) had rejected British RaiFs proposals for a newwage structure and had decided on 3 December to impose a ban onovertime, Sunday and rest day working, to take effect from thefollowing week.He proposed to hold the next day a meeting with the ministers principally concerned to discuss the problems presented by theaction of the ambulance drivers and railwaymen.In discussion it was pointed out that Mr Buckton, General Secretaryof ASLEF, had made a plausible case publicly, and that efforts should be made to answer it.    It might be opportune to involvethe TUC at this stage, since the other unions concerned had beenprepared in principle to accept the British Rail offer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Secretary of State for Employment should seek to bring homeinformally to the TUC the impact of the continuing disputes in thecoal and electricity supply industries.    He should also consider urgently with the Ministers principally concerned what action mightbe taken over the ambulance drivers and railwaymen, and report theconclusions to the Cabinet at their next meeting.

9FUEL 6. The Cabinet considered notes by the Secretary of State forRESTRICTIONS        Trade and Industry on oil supplies to the Central electricity generating Board (CEGB) power stations (CP(73) 133), theYamani/Abdesselam talks on oil supplies (CP(73) 134) and fuel and electricity supplies (CP(73) 136), together with amemorandum by the Lord President of the Council (CP(73) 135)on conservation of fuel supplies.OilSuppliesPreviousReference:CM(73) 58thConclusions,Minute 2THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat the oil companies were still finding difficulty in predicting the oil supply position with any confidence, and the reports varied from day to day.    The forecast from the Oil Industry Emergency Committee on 30 November showed a shortfall in landings of crude oil for December of 16 per cent and for January of just over 20 per cent.    If it proved possible to persuade Saudi Arabiato increase our allocation further to take account of our additional requirements^, or if we could ensure that other Arab oil producing countries delivered on the same basis as Sheikh Yamani had already promised for Saudi Arabia, the situation would be to that extentimproved.    It was particularly for consideration whether anydiplomatic action should be taken in the case of Kuwait^ whoseOil Minister was said to be hostile towards the United Kingdom.On the latest forecasts^ and on the basis of present restrictions,oil stocks generally would run down to 56 days by the end ofDecember and 52 days by the end of January, with the risk of fuel oil in particular reaching the critical 30 days level in March.A 20 per cent cut in exports to virtually all countries outside theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) had already been introduced and there was pressure on the oil companies to make such reductions in exports to e.c. countries as were practicable.    Any attempt tocontrol exports to e.c. countries would be in breach of our treaty obligations, although it might be possible to plead the coal crisis asan extenuating circumstance.The oil companies considered that they could continue on the present basis of allocation of supplies for the remainder of the month, andthat petrol rationing was not at present necessary.    The difficultieswhich had arisen in South East England were due partly to thegreater increase in consumption in that area and to the differentapproach there towards the Governments campaign for voluntarysavings in petrol.    The oil companies thought that the situation would soon improve.    In any consideration of the need for rationing,full weight should be given to the hardship and sense of unfairnessthat would inevitably result, which would be blamed on theGovernment.    It was important now, with two increases duethat week, to decide the Governments policy on oil prices^ taking into account the effect on the balance of payments and on the counter-
inflation policy.    Proposals would need to be put forward jointly byhis Department, the Treasury and the Department of Employment.It was also for consideration whether the time was now opportune for an approach to the Arab oil producing countries to secure long-term contracts on the volume and price of oil supplies in return fora stake in longer-term developments in this country.In discussion it was noted that the attitude of the Arab countries attheir recent summit meeting had been favourable towards the UnitedKingdom, and that a meeting of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs andthe Oil Ministers would now take place to discuss their futuretactics,    It was desirable that in the meantime diplomatic approachesshould be made to all the countries concerned to seek to ensure thatour favoured position was maintained.    On the other hand, Abu Dhabihad already promised to make up the difference between our imports in September and our requirements for the winter months but the oil companies were not prepared to deliver this extra oil to the UnitedKingdom,    It was therefore desirable to ask Abu Dhabi to direct the oil companies to do this,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should be asked toconsider immediately on his return from Russia the desirabilityof further diplomatic approaches to the Arab oil countries.    In themeantime, he would arrange to consider with the Ministers most closely concerned the question of the attitude of the oil companies to the delivery to the United Kingdom of oil supplies from Abu Dhabiand elsewhere.The Cabinet -1, Invited the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs to discuss urgently with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary thedesirability of further approaches to the Araboil producing countries.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said thatit was necessary to decide the extent to which oil supplies to power stations should be reduced as part of the cuts in oil allocation.    TheCEGB had arranged a cut-back in fuel oil consumption of about 30 percent of the 1972 levels.    On this basis coal stocks at power stations would fall to the point at which electricity disconnections becameinevitable by the end of January, if the miners1 overtime ban resultedin a 40 per cent shortfall in production, or mid-February, if therewas a 20 per cent shortfall.    The need for disconnections could be delayed by one week if the reduction in the CEGB&apos;s oil supplies were limited to 13 per cent.    With other consumers1 supplies also reduced
by 13 per cent oil stocks would also be reduced by early february to the minimum level at which orderly distribution was practicable.It was unlikely that there would be any further deterioration in the forecasts of oil supplies during December, since these were already being shipped, but there was a real risk that coal production coulddeteriorate sharply over the Christmas holiday if the miners1 over-time ban continued.    To avoid the risk of a serious rundown in coalstocks, with the consequent critical effect on electricity production,he recommended immediate action to reduce the cut in oil supplies to power stations to 13 per cent0    The allocation could be reviewedweekly in the light of developments.In discussion it was suggested that, even if there was no reductionin oil consumption compared with last winters levels, this would put back the requirement for electricity disconnections by only two weeks, and that this might be insufficient advantage to recompensefor the disruption of industry through the loss of oil supplies to compensate for oil burning by the CEGB.    Moreover, public opinion was at present more concerned over the shortage of oil than of coal.On the other hand, there was no doubt that the main threat to the economy came from the potential shortage of coal, particularly at power stations.    The miners&apos; objective must inevitably be to run down coal stocks as quickly as possible.    It was therefore essential that the maximum time should be provided to enable asettlement of the miners&apos; dispute to be reached before coal stocksreached a critical level,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the prime objective must be to conservecoal stocks to the maximum practicable extent, and that action should be taken at once to ensure the CEGB&apos;s oil supplies werenot reduced by more than 13 per cent.The Cabinet -2, Invited the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry to arrange that the reduction in oil supplies to power stations should not exceed 13 per cent.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the annexesto his memorandum CP(73) 135 set out further measures which mightbe taken to economise in the use of fuel.    These measuresconcentrated on the control of demand rather than the controlof supplies, and the first issue for consideration was whethermotor fuel rationing needed to be introduced before the New Year.If it was desired to introduce rationing the earliest date on whichthis could now start was 20 December,    To enable people to decide whether they needed to apply for business and/or supplementary
coupons the decision would have to be announced at least a weekahead,, together with details of the size of the rations,    A decision was needed before 13 December,    Whether or not rationing was introduced there was a strong case, at least on psychologicalgrounds, for adopting other measures to restrict consumptionof the various fuels.    Some of the measures proposed in Annex Ato CP(73) 135 could be the subject of Government control, othersmust depend on an appeal for voluntary co-operation.    he recommonded that the necessary steps should be taken to introduce the measures set out in Annex A8 and that at the same time afurther campaign for voluntary savings in all fields should be launched.In discussion it was argued that the introduction of petrol rationingshould be delayed as long as possible, since it would inevitably leadto hardship and jealousies over inequality of treatment, as well asblack markets and the need for a large bureaucracy to administer the scheme.    The contemplated level of basic rations was low,although it was not clear why this need be so if the forecast shortagewas only 15 per cent: and this would inevitably cause public shockand resentment.    The problems which had arisen at garages in SouthEast England, although admittedly widespread, were confined to that area and had been caused in part by the consumption of about five days&apos; supplies by motorists filling up their tanks.    On the otherhand, ?t was argued that the present situation was causing considerable hardship, and those who were suffering were those who had sought to avoid hoarding stocks of petrol:  andit was arguable that the situation demanded firm and positive action to bring home the seriousness of the situation.    If, therefore,there was to be no rationing in the near future it would be all themore important to act on the measures in Annex A to CP(73) 135,Whatever steps were taken, it was however essential to give a stronglead to public opinion.    This would require more information to bemade available on virtually a daily basis,In further discussion it was suggested that further considerationneeded to be given to the effect on demand of the increases in oilprices which were now inevitable.    High oil prices would affectnot only the balance of payments, but also the Governments policieson public expenditure,, counter-inflation, public transport and domestic energy, including the development of North Sea oil;the future of the motor and civil aviation industries would alsobe involved.    Once the implications of the likely price increases on these policies had been assessed it would be possible to considerthe role of such increases in combating the oil shortage.    On theother hand, it was argued that all these matters were already underreview, and that they would inevitably take time to consider whereasaction to conserve fuel stocks was required urgently.
In a brief discussion of the measures listed in the Annexes to cp(73) 135 it was urged that action should be taken to curb privateflying, to reduce street lighting and to consider further the possiblereduction of octane ratings of petrol.    Consideration should also begiven to the desirability of suspending the licensing restrictions onminibus operations and of running down the airlines&apos; stocks of fuel.It would be possible to prohibit airline package tours at Christmas,but this could lead to bankruptcies amongst the charter operators andit might be preferable to reduce the level of package tours next summer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that it was not necessary to take a decision about theintroduction of petrol rationing before 13 December.    It would,however, be desirable to introduce immediately measures along the lines of those set out in Annex A to CP(73) 135,    The lord president should, in the light of the discussion, consider further with the Ministers most closely concerned the action which might now be taken, with a view to an early announcement.    The guiding principle should be the need to prevent the disruption of industry.The Lord Privy Seal should arrange urgently for the mounting of afurther publicity campaign for the conservation of fuel; particularconsideration should be given to countering the counter-productiveeffect of news of petrol shortages in South East England,    TheSecretary of State for Employment should consider, in consultationwith the Home Secretary, the Lord President and the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry, whether the situation in the coal and electricity industries would require a renewal of the emergency powers, v/hich were due to expire on 12 December.The Cabinet -3.        Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4,        Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry, the Secretary of State for the environment and the Lord Privy Seal, to consider further the introduction of measures to conservefuel along the lines indicated in the summing up;and to arrange for the urgent implementation ofthose selected.
5. Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for afurther campaign for voluntary savings in all fuels,and for publicity along the lines indicated in the summing up.6. Invited the Secretary of State for Employment,in consultation with the Home Secretary, the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry, to consider further the need to renew the present State of Emergency,Cabinet Office4 December 1973U
