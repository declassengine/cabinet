THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theExecutive of the National Union of Mineworkers, after a lengthymeeting, had agreed by 16 votes to 10 to hold a ballot of their members on a national strike; the ballot paper would say that the executive had rejected the National Coal Boards (NCB) offer and wererecommending a national strike.    The motives of those whovoted both for or against the ballot had not yet been analysed,but it should be emphasised in making any comment that the decision was by no means unanimous, although the militants were alreadyseeking ways of explaining this away.    It was expected that the ballotwould be held on 31 January and 1 February, and that the results wouldbe known on 5-6 February,    If a majority favoured a strike, it wouldbe likely to start on 11 February.    An early ballot was, on the whole,advantageous since it minimised the opportunities for the militantsto organise support for a strike.In discussion, there was general agreement that because of the shorter time interval between the decision to call a ballot and the start of a strike, the restriction to a three-day working week must now be maintained.    But it could be modified ito exclude Saturdayworking by allowing the three-day rota to overlap,on Wednesdays.Although minor relaxations might be possible for specific industries,such as chemicals and textiles, the effect on electricity consumptionof allowing these had still to be evaluated.    No specific undertakingscould therefore be given until this had been done.In further discussion, it was argued that the Government must seekurgent means to bring to the attention of the public in general, and ofthe miners in particular, the consequences of a.vote in favour of strike action.    There must be an immediate study of the strategy to beadopted should a strike take place.    In discussion, the following main points were made -a.        There was no certainty that the details of the payoffer were known to every miner, and Ministers shouldcontinue to take every opportunity to publicise the truefacts.    The NCB had to ensure that every miner knew the exact terms of the offer.   The concentration of themining community in a limited number of areas allowed&apos;each community to be visited at least once by a minister before the ballot took place.    The local Press and radiohad much influence on mining communities and should beused to the full.
b. Emphasis should be placed on the benefits for thecountry of the Government&apos;s whole counter-inflationarypolicy rather than on Phase 3 alone, although it could be pointed out that over four million workers had now acceptedsettlements under it, including nurses whose pay claims oftengained public sympathy.c. Withdrawal&apos; of supplementary benefits from the families of men on strike could be a powerful weapon butthe wisdom of taking such a measure in the midst of thepresent situation was extremely dubious.!iTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister for Energy should make a statement in the House ofCommons on the following morning: the statement should saythat the three-day working week would remain, but would be modified to exclude Saturday working.   An undertaking shouldalso be given that the Government would consider greater relaxationfor specific industries, but it should be made clear that exemptionswould not readily be granted.    The Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, should give further consideration to these.    The Lord Privy Seal should prepare and circulate guidance to Ministers on the lline to be takenin public comment on the miners&apos; dispute: emphasis should be laid on the facts of the pay offer made to the miners and the consequences for the country of its rejection.    The Lord Privy Seal should alsoarrange for visits by Ministers to the main mining areas.    cabinet ministers should draw the attention of all junior Ministers to theneed to avoid provocative statements about the miners1 action.The Cabinet should consider further at a later meeting the strategyto be adopted if the ballot led to a miners&apos; strike;The Cabinet *1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion, 42.        Invited the Minister for Energy to makea statement in the House of Commons on thefollowing morning about the electricity restrictions,on the lines of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.
3,        Invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, to give further consideration to relaxationsof the electricity restrictions for specific industries and processes.4.        Invited the Lord Privy Seal to prepare and circulate to Ministers guidance on the attitude tobe adopted and points which might be made inspeaking about the miners&quot; dispute, and to arrangefor Ministerial visits to the mining areas.Cabinet Office25 January 1974
