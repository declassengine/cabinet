THEPROGRAMMEFORCONTROLLINGINFLATIONStage 31, The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP(73) 95) to which was attached a draft of a White paper on Stage 3 of the programme for controlling inflation, incorporatinga Consultative Document on a revised Pay and Price Code.    they also had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Environment (CP(73) 96) on the proposed land hoarding chargeannounced in April 1973.THE PRIME MINISTER said that since the draft White Paper hadbeen circulated, the Ministerial Group which was preparing proposalsfor Stage 3 of the counter-inflation programme had continued to meet.A number of amendments had been agreed to improve the revised pay and Price Code, and these would be included in the consultative document.    The Ministerial Group was however still considering a number of other associated matters and hoped shortly to be in aposition to make proposals to the Cabinet.    In these circumstances,it was proposed to publish the Consultative Document on the Code, butto leave the other associated matters to be dealt with in a statement atthe time when the Consultative Document was published.In discussion the following points were made -a. The Council of the Building Societies association would be meeting later in the day to consider the proposed arrangement for stabilising the flow of mortgage funds.Because of the risk of leakage it seemed desirable toauthorise than to make a statement after their meetingabout the arrangements which had been agreed.    A formof words for this purpose was being discussed by theDepartments concerned.    It would be helpful if any statement made at the time of the publication of the consultative document could indicate the broad lines of the measuresto be taken to assist first-time house purchasers.b. It had not yet been possible to reach agreement onthe base year to be adopted for the provision in the PriceCode under which nationalised industries in deficit were allowed to increase prices in order to prevent an increasein their current deficit.c. It would not be necessary, at the time of publicationof the Consultative Document, to issue a statement on the landhoarding charge as proposed in CP(73) 96.    The Cabinet would however wish to consider on another occasion the suggestionthat the land hoarding charge should be abandoned.d. In revising the Price Code, an important objective hadbeen to ensure that productive investment would not berestrained by the operation of the Code.
THE PRIME MINISTER., summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a Consultative Document on the Pay and PriceCode for Stage 3 should now be published as a Command Paper.This should include the further amendments which had been agreedsince the circulation of the draft attached to CP(73) 95.    The lord president should discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the ether Ministers concerned the question of the base date to beinserted in the provision regarding the deficits of nationa?,isedindustries, and should arrange for the Consultative Documentto be amended accordingly.    The Cabinet would be invited toconsider, at a meeting on the following day, the conclusions reached by the Ministerial group on the other measures thatmight be announced at the same time as the publication of the consultative Document.    The Cabinet would also wish to consider in due course the proposals of the Secretary of State for the environment in CP(73) 96.The Cabinet -Agreed that a Consultative Document on the revisedPay and Price Code for Stage 3 should be published as a Command Paper, as indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up.
miPARLIAMENTARY 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in-IfFA RS^ the House of Commons during the period between the reassemblyArFAlRo parliament on 16 October and Prorogation on 25 October.REPORT OF 3. The Cabinet were informed that it was expected that theCOMMISSION Report of the Commission on the Constitution would be submitted on THE very shortly.    It was likely to be published towards the end of theCONSTITUTION first week in November,    There would be a minority reportwritten by two members of the Commission who were in fundamentaldisagreement with their colleagues;  and even the majority report would chow substantial differences of opinion about the detailedfunctions and structure of the proposed new constitutional machineryfor Scotland, Wales and the English regions.    The report wouldnot make recommendations about constitutional arrangements inNorthern Ireland, although it would express the view that theProvince at present appeared to be under-represented in the westminster Parliament.    It was intended that when the report was published the Prime Minister should make a formal statement in the House of Commons, welcoming it as a contribution to publicthinking and discussion, and indicating that the Government did not intend to give their own views until there had been ample opportunity for public reactions to the report to crystallise.    TheCabinet noted that the length of time which the Commission hadtaken to prepare their report might give rise to some embarrasment, having regard to the earlier commitment by theGovernment to put forward constitutional proposals in relation to scotland during the lifetime of the present Parliament.    It might help to allay possible suspicion that the Government had deliberately encouraged delay in the preparation of the report ifthe Chairman of the Commission could take a suitable opportunityof making clear that the Commission^ timetable had been settledentirely by them.The Cabinet -Took note.3
[&quot;HE MAP LINPROJECTPreviousReferences:CM(73) 22ndConclusions,Minute 10 and cm(73) 38thConclusions,Minute 14. The Cabinet considered the further handling of the Maplinproject.    They had before them memoranda by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(73) 89 and 94), and a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Defence (CP(73) 90) about therelocation of Defence facilities from Shoeburyness.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatit had now been announced that 1982 was the earliest feasible date for opening Maplin Airport.    This had the advantage of spreadingmore evenly the public expenditure and resource costs involved inthe construction of Maplin and the Channel Tunnel, and would belikely to ease the passage through Parliament of the MaplinDevelopment Bill.    But the achievement of an opening date in 1982in turn depended on the Government taking a prompt decision aboutthe relocation of the Defence facilities from Shoeburyness;  and toallow the programme to slip further at this stage would cast doubt on the credibility of the whole project.    Although the use of the range at Eskmeals for some of the facilities had not goneunchallenged, he proposed, with this in mind, to approve theMinistry of DefenceJs proposals without recourse to a public inquiry.    He hoped that a similar decision could now be reached on the remaining facilities.In discussion it was suggested that any further delay in thedevelopment of Maplin would be a source of great concern to asubstantial body of opinion, which was opposed to the further development of the existing London airports and was alreadyexercised by the higher priority which appeared to have been givento the construction of the Channel Tunnell.    Even if the Maplinproject had not been undertaken, it would have proved necessaryeventually to move the Defence facilities from Shoeburyness;  andprotracted enquiry and discussion had shown that the only availablesite for the remaining facilities was at Tain.    Nor need thispresent insuperable difficulties;  it was noteworthy for examplethat the facilities removed to Spadeadam had proved welcome tolocal opinion.    On the other hand, it was urged that theannouncement now of a decision to remove the remaining defence facilities from Shoeburyness to Tain, in the face of localopposition, would be ill received by many of the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament who were uneasy about the Maplin project,and whose misgivings might prove not to have been wholly allayedby the Governments undertaking to hold further consultations andreport to Parliament before the work of reclamation began.    Itwould moreover give rise to widespread hostility in Scotland, andstrain the resources of the construction industry, which in thispart of Scotland were already fully extended to deal with the demandsof development associated with North Sea oil.    This decision wouldin any circumstances present the Government with unwelcome
consequences; but although there were arguments for takingi advantage of the recommendation in favour of Tain which had beenmade in the report of the Nugent Committee on Defence Lands, itwould be prudent to defer any announcement at least untilproceedings on the Maplin Development Bill had been completed and the current views of Government supporters were more fullyknown;  and the possibility should not be overlooked of improvingto some extent on the present estimate of five to six years for theremoval of the facilities in question,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the balance of advantage lay in deferring afinal decision on the re siting of the remaining Defence facilitiesfrom Shoeburyness until proceedings on the Maplin DevelopmentBill had been completed.    The Cabinet would accordingly resume their consideration of the matter at that stage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.SECRETARY OFTHE CABINETPreviousReference:CM(73) 42ndConclusions,Minute 55.
