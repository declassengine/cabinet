PARLIAMENTARY       1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were informed that no public indication had so far been given of the likely date of the House of Commons returnafter the Christmas Recess.    22 January had originally been intended, but this would now be inappropriate having regard tothe serious economic situation and to the likely need for parliament to be called upon to approve Regulations madeunder the Emergency Powers Act 1920 following a renewal of the present state of emergency, which would otherwise lapseon 11 January 1974.    It was therefore proposed to announce that the Motion for the adjournment would provide for thereturn of the House on 15 January, but with the proviso thatarrangements would be made for earHer recall shouldcircumstances warrant it.The Cabinet agreed that it would be inappropriate and wouldin present circumstances be misunderstood by the public andby many Government supporters in Parliament if the debate on the conduct of the Lord Chancellor took place on17 December, as proposed by the Opposition.The week&apos;s business should if possible be rearranged so as toenable the Opposition Motion to be debated on 20 December,subsequent to the debate on the economic and energy situationand to any statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.But it was undesirable that such a rearrangement should resultin more time being available for the debate on the Prayer toannul the Import Duties (General) (No. 8) Order, which might then develop into a general attack on our membership of theEuropean Economic Community.t
OREIGNAFFAIRSNorth atlantic treaty-Organisation2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that the meeting of the North Atlantic Council on 10th and11th December had ended well.    The meetings opened against a background of European discontent with the failure of the UnitedStates Government to engage in proper consultation on matters affecting European interests, and of American dislike at the way in which the European Community conducted its relations withthe United States.    The American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger,had expressed American concern but had gone on to reaffirm theimportance which the United States attached to the Alliance and to repeat President Nixon&apos;s pledges of continuing support for it.There had been sharp exchanges between Dr Kissinger and theFrench Foreign Minister, M Jobert, but they had agreed to sinktheir differences and the meetings ended on a note of harmony.Middle east previous reference:CM(73) 59thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in private discussion with him, Dr Kissinger had expressedconfidence that the Middle East peace conference would open on18 December and that it would be attended by Egypt, Jordan, Syria,and Israel, together with the United States and the Soviet union and the Secretary General of the United Nations, Dr Waldheim.Israel would find it difficult to sit at the conference table withSyria because the Government of Israel were convinced that anumber of Israeli prisoners of war had been killed by the Syrians.Dr Kissinger thought however that Israel would agree meetings inplenary session, although it might not be possible to hold separatemeetings of small negotiating groups until after the Israeli electionsat the end of December.    Dr.Kissinger hoped that Dr Waldheimwould preside over the meetings and believed that this could bearranged, although the Russians were still pressing for the;chairmanship to be held jointly by themselves and the Americans.Dr Kissinger had said that he was convinced that Israel wouldhave to withdraw from the occupied territories.   It would be hard to persuade them to accept this and his discussions with the PrimeMinister of Israel, Mrs Meir, had been extremely difficult; buthe was sure that they would have to come to it in the end.    Therewould also have to be provision for demilitarised zones and inter-national policing.    His first objective, however, would be tosecure the disengagement of the opposing armies.    A return tothe lines on which the armies stood at the time of the cease-fire on 22 October was not relevant and would not be sufficient.    Whatwas needed was a clear and substantial disengagement whichwould enable the United Nations troops to establish themselvesbetween the opposing forces.    Dr Kissinger thought that if this could be achieved the Arabs might take it as the occasion for liftingtheir oil embargo.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarydoubted whether this would be so.
jo ;:,o;.;&quot;In a speech which Dr Kissinger had made the previous evening he had proposed that the European countries, the United Statesand Japan should establish an action group to develop a programmeof collaboration to solve the energy problem.    The oil producing countries should be invited to take part in this work.    The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary thought that if it was decided at theCommunity Summit, to be held on 14 and 15 December, that theCommunity should take an initiative with the Arab countries, theway should be left open for the United States and Japan to join in,and the Community should invite them to do so.Mr Hawks worth        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that wehad learnt that Mr Gerald Hawksworth, a British subjectemployed by the Rhodesian Government, who had been captured by members of the Zimbabwe African National Union in January,was being held in a Tanzanian prison.    He had arranged for thePresident of Tanzania, Dr Nyerere, to be approached in confidence with a view to Mr Hawksworth&apos;s release.    Dr Nyererehad said that he had known nothing of this matter and had ordered the immediate release of Mr Hawksworth, who was now back inthis country.The Cabinet -1.      Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 59thConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat although the agreement reached at the tripartite meetingsheld at Sunningdale from 6-9 December had been criticised byextremists in Northern Ireland, extremist reaction had beenrelatively subdued.    He intended in the course of the next week to make a number of speeches in various parts of NorthernIreland, in which he would explain the agreements and commendthem to the public.    The general situation was relatively calmand in accordance with the indications he had already given, hewould be releasing a number of selected detainees before christmas.The cabinet. Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.
3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat important meetings of the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) and the Council of Ministers (Finance) would take place on17-18 December.    The most important issue for the United kingdom would be the decision on a Regional Development Fund (RDF) and itwas expected that this would also be discussed at the EuropeanSummit Meeting in Copenhagen on 14-15 December,    The french minister responsible for Regional Development, M Guichardi had visited London and a formula had been agreed which appeared tooffer reasonable prospects for a satisfactory outcome.The meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on10-11 December had considered further proposals for a review ofthe Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).    The meeting of theBudget Council on 10 December had considered proposals for improved financial control in Community expenditure and this work was progressing satisfactorily.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.4
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENTsaid that the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkerswas meeting that day; they were likely to vote in favour of a continuation of the overtime ban and against a ballot.    Theindustrial action taken by the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had produced the expectedresults: commuter services into London were seriously affectedbut so far there was no great disruption of services else wherein the country.    Militant members of ASLEF were known to beexamining means for disrupting the transport of oil and fuel supplies but as yet with no significant success.    There were still difficulties with ambulance drivers, though a number of agreements had been concluded with individual local authorities.On the brighter side, the National Union of Public Employeeshad accepted an offer for National Health Service employeeswithin the terms of Stage 3 and there was a good chance that theother unions concerned would do likewise.    The Transport andGeneral Workers1 Union had accepted, subject to endorsementby their members, a Stage 3 offer to London busmen.    The banon out-of-hours working by the Electrical Power Engineers&apos;Association (EPEA) continued.    A slightly better offer mightbe forthcoming from the Pay Board&apos;s examination of the EPEAcase.    He would be seeing the Electricity Council that afternoon to tell them about the Pay Board decision and to ask them tomake a fresh offer to the EPEA.    He would then see Mr Lyonsof the EPEA the following day and urge him to settle for this new offer.    The most serious new problem for the immediatefuture was likely to arise from the pay claim being put forward by the Amalgamated Union of Engineering and Foundry Workers.The national problems arising from the energy crisis appearedso far to have had very little influence on the attitude of thetrade union movement as a whole but there were signs that individual unions were beginning to get worried about the prospectof a rise in unemployment,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat although the industrial situation remained extremely difficult,the fact that so far about 350 settlements had been registeredwithin the terms of Stage 3 gave some encouragement for theprospect that in time even the most difficult trade unions mightbe brought to see the good sense in the Governments pay and prices policy.
III!Eligibility for THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidUnemployment that he had examined the rides covering the payment ofBenefit unemployment benefit in the light of the prospect that industry would shortly be obliged to restrict production to a 3-dayworking week.    Apart from those workpeople covered by a guaranteed pay agreement, employees could, after a waitingperiod of 3 days, claim the basic rate of unemployment benefit for any two days suspension in a working week.    Moreover,these days could be accumulated.    These arrangements could be changed by Order but, in his view, it would be highly provocativeto do this at the present time.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat although there could be no question of changing the rulesrelating to unemployment benefit immediately, the matterrequired further examination.    In the meantime, the Secretaryof State for Social Services should provide a list of answers toany supplementary questions that might arise from the statement to Parliament that day.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.6
$egretFUELRESTRICTIONSPreviousReference:CM(73) 59thConclusions,Minute 6Domestic SpaceHeating5.        The Cabinet resumed their discussion of restrictions to conserve fuel supplies.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that in order to reduce the demandfor electricty it had been proposed to prohibit by Order the useof electricity for space heating in the home except in one room.This would however be harsh, and in practice unenforceable.Neither the police nor the staff of the electricity boards wouldbe satisfactory agents for its enforcement.    A number of people would seek deliberately to  Lout the regulation.    It would seembetter to start on a voluntary basis, using a massive advertisingcampaign warning people that if the results of the voluntaryrestrictions were not satisfactory, they would face much more severe and much less palatable cuts.In discussion, it was pointed out that the saving in domesticheating represented almost 50 per cent of the total saving thatwas being sought.    Experience with the voluntary 50 mile perhour limit suggested that although a number of people would republic spirited enough to observe the restriction, many would not.This would not only mean failure to achieve the required20 per cent saving, it would also give rise to irritation amongstthose members of the public who had co-operated.    Moreover,there were a number of other regulations in existence that couldnot be enforced, such as, for example, the regulations restricting the storage of petrol in homes.    On the other hand, it was argued that it was undesirable in principle to make laws that could not be enforced, since this brought other laws into disrepute.In further discussion it was pointed out that should the voluntaryscheme fail to work, and if the ban on out-of-hours working bythe Electrical Power Engineers Association were lifted, then it would be possible to apply a we 11-controlled system of rotacuts which would be preferable to the present proposal for anOrder on domestic heating.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that for the time being we should rely upon a voluntarycampaign for restriction of domestic heating.    The Lord privy seal should make immediate arrangements for television announce-ments to emphasise the need for voluntary restriction and therisk of more severe cuts if it were unsuccessful.
Places of THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that action wasEntertainment being taken to ban the use of generators for supplying electricityfor floodlights at football grounds except by special licence. Adecision was however required on whether any new restrictionson the use of electricity should apply to places of entertainment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the restrictions should not generally be applied to places ofentertainment, but that the exemption of swimming pools !should be re-examined.Petrol and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY,Diesel Fuel reporting on the supplies of petroleum spirit and diesel fuelsaid that, for the first time during December, there had been anincrease in stocks of petrol.    The present stock was 63 days forpetrol and 70 days for diesel fuel.    Major road haulage   ,contractors were now using their own stocks of diesel fuel and this should help to reduce the difficulties that had arisenduring the past week at filling stations.    He and the Secretaryof State for the Environment were examining the whole questionof the supply of diesel fuel.    He considered that with the advent of a 3 day working week, there should be little problem in maintaining adequate supplies.    He was proposing to set in handsoon the application scheme for a supplementary petrol ration.In discussion, it was argued that Parliament, having heard thePrime Minister^ statement on electricity restrictions, would find it difficult to understand why petrol rationing should not beintroduced immediately.    Against this, it could be argued that stocks had been maintained as a result of the cuts imposed so farand the co-operation of the motoring public; and that, provided this state of affairs continued, there was no need to contemplatepetrol rationing at the present time.    There was a risk that any announcement seeking applications for supplementary petrolrations would give rise to fears that rationing was imminent and hence to local shortages.    However, the risk could be minimised bytreating the whole process in a discreet and gradual manner.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatarrangements could proceed for inviting applications for supplementary petrol and diesel oil allocations.    The announcementsshould however be carefully worded so as not to give rise tomisapprehensions that rationing was imminent.
TelevisionProgrammeHoursTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that arrangements were nowbeing made with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)and the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) for television broadcasting to cease at 10. 30 pm except on Saturdays when the close down would be at 11. 00 pm.    It was however possible thatthe Saturday programmes could also end at 10. 30 pm if certaincontractual difficulties could be overcome.    There would alsobe restrictions on morning programmes.    Special arrangements would be made for the Christmas holiday and New Year*s Eve.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the BBC and the IBA should be asked to close down theirtelevision transmissions at 10. 30 pm on all days, includingSaturdays, except over the Christmas holiday and New Year&apos;sEve.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.THE ECONOMIC 6. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the economicSITUATION situation.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.previous reference:CM(73) 60thConclusions,Cabinet Office13 December 19739
THIS DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HER  BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited,it is issued for the personal use of...................................................TOP SECRET copy No.........cabinet confidential annex cm(73) 61st Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 13 December 1973 at 10.30 amECONOMICSITUATIONPreviousReference:CM(73) 60thConclusionsThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(73) 139) about measures to be taken with regardto public expenditure and energy prices in the light of the changedeconomic situation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had outlined the proposals in CP(73) 139 to the Cabinet at their meeting the previous day.    He proposed that, with the exceptionof investment in the energy industries and in housing, thereshould be reductions in 1974-75 of 20 per cent on capital programmes and 10 per cent on procurement.    In the light of thediscussion the previous day, he had asked Treasury officials toget in touch with Departments about the implications of these reductions for individual programmes.    As it might not bepossible to arrange a further collective discussion by the cabinet before an announcement was made, he hoped that the cabinet would give him discretion to settle any points of difficulty, inconsultation with the Prime Minister as necessary, on the basis that reductions of at least  1, 000 million must be found.    Withinthe reductions for each Department, Ministers would have as muchflexibility as possible to determine their own priorities, althoughas a general principle he hoped that priority would be given to the saving of energy and to the freeing. of resources for export.    Itwas also for consideration whether certain large projectsshould suffer some reduction.    A limitation in the production of concorde required prior consultation with the French Government,which could not be done in time for an early announcement, but itwas for consideration whether Maplin airport should be furtherdeferred.    He also proposed that certain energy prices should beincreased to the maximum permitted under the Pay and Price Code.This might be associated with some offsetting increase insupplementary benefit.1
At the Cabinet discussion the previous day, the feeling had been expressed that his proposal for a total reduction in demand of 1, 500 million was insufficient.    He would continue to examine,in the light of the views expressed by the Cabinet, what other measures might be associated with the public expenditurereductions in order to produce a balanced package.    But in viewof the present uncertainties about the economic prospects he didnot favour attempting to take more demand out of the economy now than the  1, 500 million suggested in CP(73) 139.In discussion, it was argued that there might still be advantage in seeking a larger reduction in demand at this stage, and thusminimising the risk of needing to take further major measureslater on.    The measures taken must be sufficient to prevent afurther fall in the value of the potmd, and it might be desirable toobtain some room for manoeuvre in case it proved necessary,for example, to subsidise food.    The present moment was themost favourable time for gaining public acceptance of drastic measures.    On the other hand, there were big uncertainties aboutthe reduction in oil supplies, which might be less severe than atpresent anticipated.    Even if the supply position improved, theeffect of the increase in oil prices would still remain, but thisaffected all industrialised countries;  and if all such countries were to deal with the problem by restrictive measures there was a risk of a general recession.    In our own case, the deficit due tothe increased oil prices came on top of a large underlying deficit,and corrective measures were clearly needed.    But if thereduction in demand was so drastic as to undermine confidence of British industry, this could also undermine eonfideace in sterling.    There would be advantage in including some other measures in the package for presentational reasons, even if theydid not make a large reduction in demand.    But it seemedpreferable at this stage not to reduce demand further than theChancellor of the Exchequer was proposing.In further discussion, it was argued that the proposed reductionin capital expenditure by the nationalised industries would beharmful to future expansion.    In spite of the importance of energy, investment in the steel industry might be more important than in the gas industry.    Rather than cut such essentialinvestment, it might be preferable to increase indirect taxation,or to increase energy prices faster than the Code would at presentallow.    On the other hand, some reduction in capital commit-ments was a reasonable reaction to an emergency situation.    the investment programme in the steel industry was aimed at cuttingcosts more than at increasing capacity.    The measures that were taken must be compatible with the maintenance of Stage 3, sinceif Stage 3 failed the economic and industrial prospects would become very much worse.    There was a good case, in present2
circumstances, for increasing energy prices to the extentpermitted by the Code, provided that additional payments weremade as proposed to recipients of supplementary benefit.    Butit was not realistic to expect that Stage 3 could be held if the Codewere amended to permit a still faster increase, or if theGovernment were to add increases in indirect taxation or indirect taxes on the lower incomes.    Some increase in taxation on higher incomes might however be desirable.In discussion of the proposed reductions in public expenditure, itwas suggested that while reductions of the order proposed appearednecessary, some modifications might need to be discussed betweenthe Ministers concerned and the Treasury in order to deal withpoints of particular difficulty.   Some exceptions might have to bemade, for example, to avoid a reduction in the purchase of food and medicines for hospitals, and to enable the infrastructureprogramme for Ncrth Sea Oil to continue.    It was important,however, that such modifications should only be marginal if the reductions in other programmes were to be defensible.    It wouldalso seem undesirable to incur additional expenditure on compensation for breach of contract, or to stop work on half-completed capital projects.    Any such cases would need to beconsidered individually.    It should generally be possible, however,to find the necessary savings by a combination of deferring new contracts and the shortfall due to shortages to steel and other materials.    The effect on individual programmes would be very severe, and if the economic prospects improved, consideration should be given to restoring some of the reductions.In further discussion the following points were made -a. It would be necessary to discuss the reductions in local government expenditure with the local authority associations.    The associations might seek some concessions, for example on the personal social services,and it would be helpful to have some room for manoeuvre.However, no cuts were proposed in staff numbers, and allbut  100 million of the reductions falling on localauthorities were enforceable by central government.    Itwould be essential in any annoucement about the expenditurereductions to give firm figures if the announcement was tohave the required effect on confidence.b. The bulk of the United Kingdoms exports were achieved by relatively few firms.    There would be advantage in arranging discussions with them and the agencies responsible for the main public sector programme,to ensure that where an export order might otherwise be frustrated, public sector orders would be deferred in orderto allow it to have priority.3
c. The proposed reductions in defence procurementcould not be achieved without reducing orders placed in development areas, eg for ships.d. Questions would be asked about the effect of the reductions on certain major projects.    The ChannelTunnel had now been settled, and a limitation of the concorde programme could not be imposed without prior consulation with the French.    On Maplin airport, areport had already been promised, and there would be advantage in saying that the situation would be reviewedwhen the report was produced.    There was some scope for administrative delay in implementing the project,and in the associated move of the Proof and ExperimentalEstablishment from Shoeburyness.e. Empty office blocks remained a serious irritant ofpublic opinion.    The Government had already announcedproposals for dealing with the problem, but nothing hadbeen done.    A new proposal was now under consideration which would enable such offices to be compulsorilypurchased, with the purchase money calculated on a costplus basis, if they had remained empty for at least 2 years.This would be a stronger measure than the originalsuggestion of compulsory management, but there was some doubt about how quickly the necessary legislation could be passed.    It was essential that, in one way or another,action should be taken urgently to deal with the matter.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should announce,on 17 December,  measures to reduce public expenditure and increaseenergy prices on the lines proposed in CP(73) 139.    Ministers withparticular points of difficulty on the proposed expenditure reductions should discuss these with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as soonas possible.    The Cabinet agreed that the Chancellor of theExchequer should have discretion to settle these points providedthat reductions of not less than  1, 000 million were secured.    Anycases which would involve compensation for breach of contract orstoppage of work already in progress should be consideredindividuaUy by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should consider in the light of the cabinet discussion at this and the previous meeting what other measureshe should announce on 17 December to deal with the economicsituation.    The Secretary of State for the Environment should discuss urgently with the Chancellor of the Exchequer his new proposal for deaHng with empty office blocks, with a view to taking effective action as soon as possible.    Members of the cabinet should continue to bear in mind the need for complete discretionabout the matters which had been discussed.
2.      Subject to the points mentioned in the PrimeMinister,]s summing up, invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to announce measures on the lines proposed in CP(73) 139 on 17 December.3.      Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer,, to press forward action to dealwith the problem of empty office blocks.Cabinet Office14 December 197351.
