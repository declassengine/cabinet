STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1974Page1377789ii
1, THE PRIME MINISTER said that at their last discussion theCabinet had agreed that the initiative of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) provided no solution to the miners1 dispute and had left it tothe group of Ministers principally involved to decide whether to holda further meeting with the TUC or to meet the National Union of mineworkers (NUM).    The Ministers concerned had decided tomeet the TUC, partly to avoid giving the impression of unfinishedbusiness, and partly because it was necessary to maintain a continuing relationship with the TUC.    At the meeting heldon 21 January, the agenda had been broadened to cover theeconomic situation and the&apos; possible relaxation of the three-day week as well as the miners&apos; dispute.    There had been a long and serious discussion of the TUC initiative which ended in friendlydisagreement.    The subsequent speeches by Mr Murray, theGeneral Secretary, had been unpleasant and unnecessary.   Althoughthe disengagement from the TUC discussions had been brought aboutin a reasonable spirit, there was still the problem of convincing thepublic that the money for repeated wage increases would not beavailable and that if the NUM claim were conceded it would becomedifficult to hold the line against similar claims from other groupssuch as the electricians and later the railwaymen.The group of Ministers had concluded that it would be better not tomeet the NUM before meeting the TUC on 21 January.    After themeeting they had decided that an invitation to the NUM would seemto open up once again the possibility of a settlement in excess of stage 3, and that a better alternative would be to send the NUMExecutive a full statement of the Government position.  When it became known that the three officers of tite NUM had decided to proposea strike ballot the decision was reviewed, but they had still thoughtit right to send the letter.    As soon as he received the letter,Mr Gormley, the President of the NUM, had given extracts tothe Press, and the Government had now decided to publish the textin full.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatMr Gormley? for reasons that were difficult to understand, had decided to recommend a strike ballot and Mr Daly, the general secretary, and Mr McGahey, the Vice-President, had naturallyagreed.    No doubt the militants in the NUM Executive would takethe same line and the moderates would not oppose them; the moderatesmight indeed take the view that the more extreme the proposition onthe ballot sheet the better the chance of its rejection.    Thus [the likely outcome of the meeting cf the NUM Executive would be a unanimous decision for a strike ballot, probably supported by a recommendation from the Executive Committee in favour of a strike.The outcome of the ballot would depend greatly upon the wording ofthe recommendation.    A neutral form of words might not achieve the 55 per cent majority needed for a. strike; a positiverecommendation probably would achieve it, though opinions
differed and the National Coal Board (NCB) considered that even a positive recommendation might fail.    The ballot would take two weeks to organise, and if the votes gave the necessary majorityfor a strike it could take effect about a week later.    This gaveMonday 18 February as the most likely starting date for a strike.The requirement for a month&apos;s notice of a strike had been waivedin the past, and a complicated ruling by the National industrial relations Court appeared.to make it unnecessary.    The government must, without being seen publicly to do so, deploy every effort to try to influence the ballot,    At;the same time it would be prudent to go ahead with contingency plans for a strike,In discussion it was argued that the Government had taken the rightline in its treatment of the TUC initiative;  some public support hadbeen lost because the public did not realise that the TUC were unable,by their own admission, to stop unions taking strike actionagainst the Pay Code.   In spite of the Government^ full-pageadvertisements, the public were also ignorant of the amount ofthe offer that had been made to the miners.    Nor were they aware that the industrial action by the NUM had begun three-and-a-halfmonths before their next pay increase was due.    Ministersappearing on television must concentrate on repeating the twoor three salient facts until they were understood.    If the factswere disputed, as Mr Gormley had disputed the facts about theoffer to the miners, Ministers should insist on exercising their right of reply.    It was argued that if the miners decided in favourof a strike ballot, the Government and the NCB should give moreprecision to the proposals for improvements on health and pensions which the NUM had declined to discuss.   Although these proposals could be represented as a new expedient for bypassing the Pay Codeand might thus encourage other militant demands, the effects of along miners&apos; strike would be so damaging that the Government musttry to present the proposals as a new offer and to give an appearance of flexibility.    How the task of presentation should be shared betweenthe Government and the NCB was a matter for consultation with theNCB.    The Board were in the best position to influence the miners in the coalfields, though their communications were not always goodenough; they should also play their part in putting across their proposals to the public, and might gain some public sympathy fromthe fact that the industry was publicly owned; but the Governmentand the Board would have to share the same allocation of televisiontime.    It was suggested that the Government should consider whether there were any means of influencing the television commentators; the regional Independent Television companies were important and mightbe more amenable than the rest.    It might also be possible to someextent to influence the advice that the TUC and the moderate wing ofthe Labour Party would give to the miners on the exercise of theirvote.secret
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that if there were a strike ballot it would be ofthe utmost importance for the Government to exercise whateverinfluence it could over the outcome.    For this purpose the Secretaryof State for Employment, the Secretary of State for Energy and theLord Privy Seal should meet to work out the Government strategytogether and to co-ordinate it with the strategy of the NCB.The Cabinet -1. Took note^ with approval, of the summing upof this part of their discussion by the Prime Minister.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that, during thepast week, coal stocks at power stations had fallen by only100, 000 tons.    Stocks stood at 13.6 million tons at power stations,and 1.8 million tons elsewhere, and if circumstances remained unchanged could be expected to increase slightly over the next two weeks.   Against this background some relaxation of the existingelectricity restrictions could be allowed.    The most effective patternwould be to let productive industry work a five-day week, restrictingelectricity consumption to 80 per cent of normal.    Commerce couldbe restricted to a three-day electricity week, excluding Saturday;and shops to morning or afternoon use with a full day on Saturday.Such a relaxation would increase coal consumption by about200, 000 tons a week, which could be tolerated if all the favourablefactors - mild weather and no fresh industrial disputes - were maintained.    It was also essential that domestic savings shouldcontinue at the present level,    A relaxation of this kind posedproblems of policing, but most people were expected to conform.However, the likelihood that the Executive of the NUM would decide to hold a ballot of their members on the issue of strike action was a factor which could have a major influence on the nature and timing ofthe relaxations.    The choice lay between going ahead1 with the planned relaxation but making it clear that a strike would leadto even more severe restrictions being imposed, or making minorchanges to the incidence of the present restrictions to conserve fuelstocks in the face of the strike threat.    It was estimated that, if atotal strike occurred, the continuance of the present restrictions would enable stocks1 to last six to seven weeks.    The relaxationswould reduce endurance by three or four days if a strike occurredwithin the next three weeks.    Endurance might be prolonged slightlyby increasing the use of oil at power stations, or increasing theimport of coal, but even the most stringent restrictions could not prevent the breakdown of electricity supplies within seven to eight!weeks of the onset of a total strike.
In discussion, it was argued that any relaxation which led to increased electricity consumption would represent a major changeof policy.    Hitherto the aim had been to restrict consumption to prolong endurance.    The miners had always sought to deplete stocksby action short of a strike, and then impose a total strike when the economy was least able to resist it.    Relaxation now, would beseen as a sign of weakness on the part of the Government: theminers would be encouraged in their resolve, since a relaxationwould be taken as firm evidence that the economy could not stand athree-day week and that the Government, rather than impose evenharsher measures, would quickly settle with them.    Public opinion would almost certainly see relaxation in face of the risk of a strikeas an act of great imprudence.On the other hand, it was strongly argued that the restriction ofthe working week to three days could not be endured much longer.There were signs that many companies ies, large and small, would soon be in difficulties, and this could have wide repercussions throughoutthe economy.    The trade figures would inevitably get worse ifshort-time work continued.    The ability of the economy to withstandrestrictions was a much more critical factor for the endurance of thecountry than were the fuel stocks.    Moreover to maintain the present restrictions would be seen as a tacit admission that the Governmentexpected the majority of miners to vote for a strikej    Such a poHcywould be interpreted as an intensified form of Government confronta-tion with the unions and it would provide a continuing excuse for the tuc to maintain their protests.In further discussion, it was argued that a third course might beto modify the three-day week to avoid the need to work on Saturdayand to grant exemption from electricity restrictions for specificindustries.    The products of the chemical industry, for example,were essential for many others, including the motor car industry.Exempting chemicals from the restrictions would increase electricityconsumption by almost one per cent.    Similar relief to the steelstockholders and scrap processors would add less than 0.1 per cent to electricity demand.//&apos; &apos;   v - &apos;1 vTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were at that stage clearly unable to reach a decision on whether or not to relax the electricity restrictions.    It would be prudent to delay taking a final decision until the outcome of the num Executive meeting was known and had been studied.    As soonas this had been done he would consider the matter further with hiscolleagues.    In the meantime, no statement should be made that day,but the Minister for Energy should inform the Opposition that it was hoped that a statement would be made in Parliament on thefollowing day.
wIf52.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.3.      Invited the Minister for Energy to arrangefor the Opposition to be informed that it was hoped that a statement on the electricity restrictions would be made in Parliament on the following day.
2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to betaken in the House of Commons during the following week.It was not now proposed that a debate on nuclear reactorsshould take place on&apos;/28 January as had earlier been envisaged.The previous expectation had been that the forthcoming     wreport by the Select Committee,on Science and Technologywould not be published until the end of February at earliest;but the latest information now was that it was likely to beavailable within ten to fourteen days.    On this timetable, toarrange a debate in advance of the appearance of uWreportwould be regarded as an act of discourtesy to the SelectCommittee;  and the relatively short deferment of the debatewhich would be involved should not lead to any serious delay in the reaching of Government decisions.f6
FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(74) 3rdConclusions,Minute 23. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the disengagement of the Israeli and Egyptian forces had begun.    It would probably take several weeks to complete themovement which would result in the Egyptians in relatively small numbers occupying the east bank of the Suez Canal with a gap ofabout 12 kilometres occupied by United Nations forces separatingthem fiom the Israeli forces.Commonwealth THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatSugar Jamaica and Guyana and possibly some other CommonwealthAgreement Caribbean sugar producers, whose economies were sufferinggravely from the increase in the price of oil, were in dangerof defaulting on their supplies of sugar to us under theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA) in order to sell in theUnited States where they would receive much higher prices.    Ifthis were to happen it would oblige us to make good the shortfallby buying sugar at higher prices from Europe and it would affect our negotiations within the European Community, where we were seeking agreement to maintaining the arrangements by which weimported 1.4 million tons&apos; of sugar a year under the CSA.Grenada THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere were serious strikes and disturbances in Grenada wherethe opponents of the Prime Minister, Mr Gairy, were seeking tobring about his downfall before the country became independenton 7 February.    It was in our interest that the transfer of independence should take place as planned, but it was possible thatthe collapse of law and order would prevent this.    If theGovernment of Grenada found that it could not handle the situationwe might receive an appeal for help and as a precaution somevessels of the Royal Navy were being moved into the area.    In viewof these developments Their Royal Highnesses Prince and,Princess Richard of Gloucester, who were to have attended theindependence celebrations, had been advised not to go.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.7
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that on the previous day there had been a welcomerelaxation in the hard line which the German Government had hitherto taken on the proposals for the establishment of the regional Development Fund, m It would be necessary to follow upthe proposals for the size and distribution of the Fund which theGermans had now made but we were now once again in a situationin which negotiation could proceed.    The implications for theCommunity of the decision of the French Government on19 January to float the franc were still not clear.    This actionrepresented a remarkable reversal of previous French policy,and it brought French policy closer to the view which we had consistently held that economic and monetary union within theCommunity depended more on measures towards economic integration than on purely monetary arrangements.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.8
