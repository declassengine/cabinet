THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE ANDINDUSTRY said that there had not yet been time for the overtime ban by the coal miners to have any significant effect,but the National Coal Board (NCB) expected that the loss ofproduction would very quickly reach 20 per cent and wouldprobably amotint to 40 per cent towards the end of the following week.    The steps taken by Ministers before the weekend had resulted in a favourable presentation of the governments position in all the national Press, and every opportunity wasbeing taken also to secure further publicity on the radio and television.    The NCB were launching a major publicity campaign, in co-ordination with the Government, and wereinstructing pit managers to seek to persuade the men of thefairness of the Boards pay offer.    It was, however, clearthat militant elements were seeking an escalation of the disputedirected against the Governments pay policy generally ratherthan the offer made by the NCB.    These elements believed that,if the dispute were extended and a ballot deferred as long aspossible, the chances of obtaining a majority for strike action would be enhanced.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, taking account also of the situations in the electricity and oil industries,there appeared to be two main courses of action open to theGovernment.    The first was forthwith to seek a State ofEmergency^   which would provide the Government with the powersneeded to deal with the anticipated fuel crisis, except the powerto control fuel prices.    There was a Privy Council later that morning and the Emergency Regulations could be laid that afternoon and come into force at midnight.    Orders could thenbe made to restrict the use of electricity for floodlighting,display lighting and commercial space heating and subsequentlythe oil companies could be given directions on the allocation of oil supplies.    The second alternative would be to secure the quickpassage through Parliament of the Fuel and Electricity (Control)Bill.    The Bill contained powers enabling the Government toimpose restrictions on the consumption of electricity, but thepowers were not so wide as under the Emergency Regulations.It would be possible to begin petrol rationing under the emergency regulations, but since the Emergency Powers would have to be
renewed every month it would be desirable subsequently topass the Bill.    If the oil companies were told to allocatesupplies, petrol rationing would become necessary, and itwas for consideration whether petrol coupons should now beissued to the public.    In any event all Departments and other public sector bodies should take immediate steps to conservefuel and a further appeal to the public to conserve fuel was desirable.In discussion, there was general agreement that the economicand industrial situation warranted immediate action by theGovernment both to conserve fuel supplies and to reassurepublic opinion.    Whilst there were arguments for delayingaction until it was possible to see more clearly the effects of the miners1 overtime ban, there was public pressure for early action and the immediate declaration of a State ofEmergency might convince the miners that the Governmentwould remain firm in the face of industrial action.    The NCBwould welcome any step which helped to conserve coal stocks.If however emergency powers were to be taken it wauld bedesirable to resolve quickly - but within the terms of the pay code - the dispute involving the Electrical Power EngineersAssociation (EPEA) since while the EPEA ban on standby dutieswas in force it was not possible to introduce the rota system ofelectricity cuts.    If the power engineers would not control the cuts the restrictions v/ould have to be of a much cruder nature,leading to widespread and indiscriminate disruption ofsupplies.On the other hand it was argued that, although there wereincreasing signs of shortages of oil, and Esso had been instructed by their parent company to introduce an allocationscheme that week, it would be prudent to clarify the oil supply situation further before deciding to introduce either rationing of motor fuel or an industrial allocation scheme for fuel oil.Although petrol rationing would require a minimum of between3 and 4 weeks to introduce, no other country had yet adopted it,and the effect upon the Arab oil producing countries of doing so would need tc be taken into account.    The Government would,moreover, be liable to severe criticism if they announced thata rationing scheme would be introduced without being able to say at the same time when this would be done, the sise of the rationand other details.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the proclamation of a State of emergency should be sought that day with a view to conserving fuel stocks and to protect industry, in particular exports.    The Secretaryof State for Trade and Industry should on the following day make
orders to restrict display lighting and floodlighting and the space heating of commercial premises.    Guidance on fuel economy should be issued forthwith to Government departments and all public sector bodies and the Secretary of State should consider making an appeal for public co-operation in the conservation of fuel during his speech during the debate underStanding Order 9 that afternoon.    The Secretary of State for employment should inform the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) that a State ofEmergency was being proclaimed.    The Minister for industry should seek, at his meeting with the EPEA that evening, tofind a basis for a settlement of their dispute within the termsof the Pay Code.    The Ministerial Committee on economic strategy would consider further on the following day the position on oil supplies, in order to enable a decision to be taken aboutthe introduction of petrol rationing and oil allocation.    TheCommittee would also consider whether it would now be desirableto issue ration books to the public.The Cabinet -1.

The realdeficit would be even greater than this because some importsthrough Heathrow Airport during the month would not be includedin the published figure.   Although it could be explained that a numberof special factors had contributed to the bad result for October, theeffect on confidence would undoubtedly be adverse.    Somecommentators would press for drastic action, for example in thefield of public expenditure or taxation, in order to switch demandinto exports.    If the trade deficit were to continue at the levelprevailing over the last few months, the possibility of action of thiskind could not be ruled out, but that would require further considera-tion.    Action to increase taxation would involve considerable difficulties, since changes in direct taxation could not be made effective quickly, whereas increases in indirect taxation, on thescale required to deal decisively with the situation, would raisethe retail price index by up to 2 per cent and would thus prejudice the success of Stage 3 of the counter-inflation programme.    Inorder to deal with the immediate problem of confidence, the Bank ofEngland would announce that day an increase of 2 per cent in thelevel of special deposits, to be called up in four instalments over theperiod to January 1974.    The Bank of England&apos;s minimum lendingrate would be increased from lljj per cent to 13 per cent.    The Bankof England were also discussing the situation with the clearing banks, who might decide to increase their base lending rate also toaround 13 per cent.    Action on these lines might be criticised asputting the whole strain of dealing with the problem on monetary policy, and there might be some fall in the sterling exchange rate;but it was hoped that the action now proposed would be sufficient tomaintain confidence and deal with the immediate situation.1
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat during the second half of October the computer used to calculatethe value of imports through Heathrow Airport had been immobilised by a strike.    The value of imports during that month which had notyet been counted could be in the range  60- 100 million.    As therewas a wide measure of uncertainty, he had decided that it would bebetter to omit this element altogether, rather than to put in an estimated figure which could not be soundly based.    The Octobertrade figures had been affected by a number of other special factors.The Middle East war and the stoppage of consignments of diamondsto Israel had resulted in higher imports of diamonds from Russia and lower exports to Israel.    Higher imports of oil, and the acceptance of delivery of tankers during the month, had also added substantially tothe deficit.    The combined effect of these special factors had been to add about  150 million to the normal level of deficit.    Apart fromthis, the value of imports was anyway running considerably higherthan a year ago, but this largely reflected higher imports of industrial materials and machinery.    The value of imports would now also be permanently increased by the higher price of Middle East oil.Although exports in October were some  60 million down, partly because of the stoppage of diamond shipments, they were still37 per cent higher than in 1972, and for the first year since theSecond World War they were rising faster than world trade.    Thelatest surveys by the Confederation^of British Industry also showed that prospects for exports were at^record level.    The problem atpresent was not so much one of obtaining export orders as of achieving deliveries.    If an improvement could be achieved indeliveries of, fcr example, motor cars, this would at the same timeavoid drawing in foreign products and release home production forexport.In discussion, concern was expressed about the effect which theproposed action might have on the cost of mortgages for house purchase.In the recent discussions with the building societies, it had been hopedthat the present 11 per cent rate could be held for some time.    If theBank of England&apos;s minimum lending rate was now raised to 13 per cent,there would be widespread dismay among those with substantialmortgage liabilities, who would fear that the mortgage rate would soonrise to a similar figure.    This would be an inescapable commitment ontheir family budget, and the Government would be criticised for allowing the cost of essentials such as food and housing to rise, ascompared with non-essential goods such as cigarettes and spirits onwhich consumers could choose their level of expenditure.    Would it have been preferable therefore to contemplate the immediate use ofthe tax regulator in order to increase the tax on these non-essentialitems?   Alternatively, the use of import deposits might be considered;or might the call for special deposits have to be coupled with a promise of further measures to be introduced shortly?   On the other hand, itwas argued that because of the risk of forestalling it was not practicable
to foreshadow further measures without specifying what these wouldbe.    Import deposits would be contrary to our obligations in theEuropean Economic Community.    Increases in direct taxationcould not be implemented quickly and would have no immediate effect on demand.    Increases in indirect taxes would need to be large enough to deal with the problem without the need for further action later on.    This could not be done by touching only non-essential items:  it would involve a large general increase in prices which would reduce standards of living and put at risk the successof Stage 3 of the counter-inflation programme, and any consequentindustrial trouble would itself tend to frustrate the objective ofmaintaining confidence.    Moreover, a large increase in taxationwould disturb those Government supporters who had hitherto beenreassured by the Governments commitment to economic expansion.In the short term, therefore, there seemed no escape from the useof monetary measures, which were more flexible and could, ifnecessary, be quickly adjusted in the light of subsequent develop-ments.    To be convincing, such measures must include some immediate action on interest rateb.    If no statement were made about the minimum lending rate, there would be considerableconfusion and it might even rise above 13 per cent as a result of the automatic adjustment of the lending rate in the light of the TreasuryBill tender.    It seemed preferable therefore to announce at once the proposed increase to 13 per cent.    While it was not expectedthat, aj a result,mortgage interest rates would rise before January,no guarantee could be given about their future level.    It would however be desirable to make a statement which would do something to allay the anxieties of householders with existing mortgagecommitments.In further discussion it was suggested that the need for further action in the future would depend on the underlying trend of the -balance of trade, which could only be assessed from subsequentmonthly trade figures.    The prospect would however beworsened by the higher Middle East oil prices, and the breathing space provided by the present measures should be used to consider urgently the other possible measures that might be necessary to redress the balance of payments.    The call for special depositsshould be backed by selective action on credit, aimed at restrictingexcessive domestic consumption.    The Government would be underpressure to make further cuts in public expenditure, but after the reductions that had already been agreed these would be very hard to find, and the higher level of interest rates would tend toincrease public expenditure, particularly in the local governmentsector.     Some increase in taxation might therefore prove necessary.In view of the recent increase in the price of Middle East oil andthe difficulties of obtaining supplies, there seemed anyway a strong case for some fiscal action to encourage economy in the use of oil,and it should not be too difficult to secure public acceptance of this
in. present circumstances.    More effective taxation on capital gainsfrom property development also seemed to be of high priority.Consideration might also be given to the possibility of an increasein the betting tax, although this would not have much effect on demand, and in the rate of tax on non-essential goods.    other possibilities which might be considered were an increase in national insurance contributions, which had the advantage of not affectingthe retail price index, and a generous index-linked savings schemeto draw in funds not attracted by the existing savings media.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that inview of the paramoia&amp;t need to ensure the success of Stage 3 of the counter-inflation programme, the Cabinet agreed that theGovernments immediate reaction to the October trade figures should take the form of monetary measures rather than increases in taxation.    The Cabinet accordingly endorsed the measures nowproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    These should be supported by selective measures of credit control.    Concern hadbeen expressed about the possible impact of the higher interest rates on the cost of house mortgages, and while no guarantee couldbe given about the future movement of mortgage rates, theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for the Environment, should consider what could be said to allay the anxieties of householders with mortgage commitments.The breathing space provided by the present measures should beused to examine the longer-term measures that might prove necessary if the trade deficit continued at its present level.    this consideration should include the various fiscal and other measureswhich had been mentioned in discussion, and particular attention should be given to measures designed to restrain the consumptionof oil.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office14 November 19734
