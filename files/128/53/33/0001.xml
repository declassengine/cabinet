HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO        gCABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(74) 9th ConclusionsFriday 1 March 1974 at 5.45 pmTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the result of the General Electionwas disappointing for the Government and also confusing to interpret.    Although a number of results were still outstandingit was clear that no one Party would be able to command an overallmajority.    The Labour Party could not get more than 301 seats andthe Conservatives might obtain as many as 299:  and it was difficult to forecast where the Liberals and other small parties would stand in such a situation.    Indeed the position was one withoutprecedent in recent times.    The Government seemed to have three courses open to it.    The first would be for him to advise The Queenthat she should send for Mr Wilson as the probable leader of thelargest single Party even though he would be able to form only a minority Government: and the Labour Party had indeed issued astatement indicating its readiness to attempt this task.    The second course was for the Government to exercise its constitutional rightto face Parliament and see whether it could command support forits programme.    The third course was to try and arrange support from the smaller Parties for a programme designed to deal with thenation&apos;s immediate difficulties.    So far as this last course was concerned, support from the Ulster Unionists must be regarded asunreliable, although they might decide to support the government without trying to insist on any deal, which would be unacceptable,over the Northern Ireland Assembly or Executive.   An alternativebasis of support would be to consult the Liberal Party as to their willingness either to enter a coalition or to support the Governmentin the lobbies on an agreed programme.    He would welcome theviews of his colleagues on these three alternatives.    In particular it was necessary to consider carefully whether in a situation wherethe two main Parties were so close, where the Conservative party had obtained the majority of the total votes cast and where nearly6 million votes had also been cast for the Liberal Party, the nationwould expect him to attempt the formation of a right-centre coalitionbefore handing over power to the Labour Party.    He had spoken by1HE SITUATION0LLOWINGHE GENERALLECTION
telephone to the Secretary of State fOr Employment who was ill:  andthe latter favoured an approach to the Liberals.    This would however involve taking the latter into full confidence about theeconomic situation.   A further complication was that the government did not yet know what the Pay Board would recommend for theminers or whether the latter would accept it and agree to return towork under a Conservative-Liberal coalition:   the likelihood was however that the recommendations would be generous and would beaccepted irrespective of the Government in power.In discussion it was argued that, although the Government had not obtained the strong mandate which it had sought, there was a largeanti-Socialist majority which supported both an incomes policy andBritain1 s continued membership of the European Community.    Thismajority could form the basis of a Conservative-Liberal coalitionwhich would unite the moderates in the country.    It was alsoarguable that the public opinion polls had encouraged manytraditional Conservative voters to feel that they could safely voteLiberal because of doubts about some aspects of the government&apos;s policy but still see the return of a Conservative Government.    the response of the Liberals was difficult to predict.    They might welldemand too high a price in terms of electoral reform:  on the otherhand they would be unlikely to want to face another General Electionat an early date and might therefore be inclined to reach an accommodation.    From the Conservative Party&apos;s own point of view there were also arguments both for seeking an accommodation andfor accepting without delay the consequences of not having obtainedan overall majority.    If they went needlessly out of office, a labour government would attribute the economic situation to Conservativemistakes and, with the later benefit of North Sea oil, might remainin power for a very long period.    On the other hand if a coalitionwas formed with the Liberals, those traditional Conservativesupporters who had voted Liberal on this occasion might neverreturn to their former allegiance.In further discussion there was much support for the view that the liberals held the key to the situation and that they should be forcedto show whether they wished to keep in power a Conservative or a labour Government.    It would clearly be wrong for the conservative party to hang on to power at the expense of its principles: but the chances of reaching an acceptable accommodation with the Liberalscould only be assessed as a result of consultation with them.    Thiswould force them to move one way or the other: and if they refusedan accommodation the traditional Conservative voters who had voted for them would be likely to return to their former allegiance at thenext Election.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that he should consult the leader of the Liberal Party about the chances of a coalition or anarrangement whereby the Liberals would support an agreed programme to deal with the immediate situation.    The object wouldnot be to do the best possible deal with the Liberals but to forcethem to show their hand and to discover the sort of programme which they would support.    In the present situation where no party would command an overall majority the Government had either to be rejected by the House of Commons or by the liberal Party andthere was every reason to canvass the possibility of an anti-Socialist coalition.    His approach to Mr Thorpe would however be without commitment, and members of the Cabinet should remain inLondon over the weekend so that he could consult them further asthe situation developed.    In the meantime no indication should begiven to the Press of the Governments intentions.    He would behaving an Audience of The Queen immediately after their meeting and a Press statement would say simply that he was going to reportto her on the situation.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office4 March 19743
