PARLIAMENTARY  10 The Cabinet were informal of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.It was noted that further impetus was urgently needed for the public presentation of the Governments European policies and that It was intended that material for this purpose should emerge from the speeches to be made by the Government spokesmen during the debate on European Community affairs which would be taking place on27 November.The Cabinet were informed that there was considerable concern,,which was shared by many Government supporters, on the questionof teachers&apos; pensions, which was the subject of an Opposition Motiondue to be discussed on 28 November,    The Secretary of State for education and Science was considering what steps could be taken and announced in the debate to allay this concern;  and it would be helpful if in advance of the debate she could have informal discussions with Government supporters in the House of Commons,1
2, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the recent disturbances in Greece, in which the Army had been used and there had been a number of deaths, represented a serioussetback to the attempts that v/ere being made to restore a greater measure of democracy,,    There would no doubt be renewedcriticism of the Greek regime on the part of some membersof the Alliance,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Foreign Ministers of the Nine had held useful discussions inCopenhagen on 20 November in preparation for the meeting of the heads of State and Government which was to be held there on14 and 15 December,    It had been agreed that in the main the meetings would not be attended by the Foreign Ministers whowould, however, be present in Copenhagen and would take partas necessary,    A provisional agenda had been agreed.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had held eight hours of usefuldiscussion with the President of France when M Pompidou visitedhim at Chequers on 16 and 17 November,    The discussions hadranged over a wide field and the President had made a moreinteresting contribution than at their last meeting in Paris inMay,    They agreed about the way in which the forthcoming Summitof the Nine should be held.    As regards Community affairs thePresident wished to make progress towards the second stage ofthe Economic and Monetary Union and did not make this conditional upon a return to the snake; he had undertaken to do his utmost to be helpful over the Regional Development Fund, although he was not atthis stage prepared to commit himself to a figure; as regardsProtocol 22 he did not insist that acceptance of reverse preferencesshould be a condition of association, and would be satisfied if indi-vidual countries were allowed freedom to choose whether to acceptreverse preferences.    President Pompidou agreed that improvementswere necessary in the financial control of Community expenditure.He agreed that there should be a Community Audit Board but he didnot agree that responsibility for financial control should be placedin the hands of a single Commissioner.    The Prime Minister had explained the difficulties we were encountering in our relations with spain as a result of our differences over Gibraltar and, in particular,
SECRE &apos;the indications that the SpaMsh Government intended to discriminate against British trade and Investment.    We had asked for assurances that there would be no such discrimination and this question had a bearing on the negotiations which were taking place between spain and the Community.    He had expressed the hope that Frenchinfluence would be used to persuade the Spaniards to undertake not to discriminate against us.    He had also told President Pompidouthat our sole desire within the framework of the Common agricultural policy was to ensure that as much as possible was done to helpGovernments attack inflation; this meant action on the prices front and the refusal to allow the accumulation of unnecessary surpluses.The Prime Minister said that he and President Pompidou had discussed defence questions at some length.    The French were evidently engaged in reviewing their policy; but they had not reachedany firm conclusions about the extent to which it might be necessaryto change lt0    There had been a useful discussion on the situation inthe Middle East and the problem of oil supplies, in which they found themselves very largely in agreement.    He had referred to the differences which existed between us and the French on the divisionof the Continental Shelf in the Western Approaches and the Channel.President Pompidou had said that he was not familiar with the detailsof the official discussion but would inform himself on his return to paris.The Cabinet -2, Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.3, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat the decisions on the support of hill farming taken at the meetingof the Agricultural Ministers on 20 November were on balancefavourable to xt&amp;*The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that he had reached agreement the previous day with theUnionist Party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SBLP),and the Alliance Party on the basis for the formation of an Executive.He would be making a report to Parliament in the course of the debatelater that day.    The central problem had proved to be the composition of the Executive.    It was essential that Mr Faulkner and Mssupporters should have an absolute majority on the Executiveitself, for without this they would not have participated and theExecutive could not have been formed.    But Mr Faulkner&apos;s strength in the Assembly was scarcely greater than that of the SDLP and inorder to meet the claims of the SDLP and the Alliance Passty it hadbeen necessary to provide additional posts within an administration which included the Executive members and some others.    On theExecutive itself the Unionists would have six places, the SDLP four,and the Alliance Party one place.    Mr Faulkner would be the chief executive j Mr Fitt the SDLP leader^ would be the Deputy ChiefExecuMve;  and Mr Napiers leader of the Alliance Party, would bethe Legal Member and in charge of an Office for Law Reform.    Theadditional appointment of one Unionist., two SDLP members and oneAlliance Party member to non-Executive posts resulted in an administration consisting of seven Unionists, six SDLP and twoAlliance members.    In addition a member of the Alliance party was to be appointed Deputy Chief Whip, outside the Administration.Under the Constitution Act provision was made for 12 posts.    Itwould therefore be necessary to make an amendment to the Actand he would propose that this should provide for 11 posts on theExecutive and up to four posts outside the Executive, but carryingmembership of the Administration.    The agreement on the composition of the Executive was subject to the outcome of a meeting, to be heldearly in December, between those who would be members of theExecutive, representatives of the Irish Government and represen-tatives of Her MajestyS Government,    This conference would discussthe proposal for a Council of Ireland,    The Parties in the NorthernIreland Assembly who had refused to participate in the Executivewould not be represented at the conference, but their leaders wouldbe invited to discuss their views with him so that these would be knownat the time of the conference.    If the conference came to a satisfactory conclusion Parliament would be asked to approve the Order for the devolution of powers to the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly.In the meantime the group who would then become the Executive wouldbe known as the Executive Designate.    Once powers had beendevolved arrangements would be made to hold a formal conference between Her MajestyS Government, the Government of the republic and the Northern Ireland Executive on the formation of a Council ofIreland.    His discussions with the three Parties had produced a firmunderstanding that the Royal Ulster Constabulary would continue toprovide the police service for Northern Ireland,    In order to reachsecret
agreement he had found it necessary to make some limited concessions in the matter of detention,,    He had stated his intention, if the security situation permitted, to bring into use his statutory powers of selectiverelease and to release a number of detainees before Christmas,,    Itwould be important to do something in this direction, but it would be unwise to assume that the agreements he had now reached would leadto an early reduction of violenca.    The immediate result might bethat extremists on both sides would seek to increase violence8 andthere might also be industrial action by some sections of extremeProtestant opinion.    He would in particular be concerned to protectthose who would be members of the new Northern Ireland Administra-tion, a number of whom had already been subjected to threats.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the agreement that had been reachedwas the outcome of a long period of difficult negotiation.    The cabinet would wish to congratulate the Secretary of State for Northern ireland on a remarkable achievement.    It was important that the extent ofthis achievement and its significance for Northern Ireland and theUnited Kingdom should be understood in Parliament and the country.We should not, however, give the impression that this was the end ofthe problems an^ in particular^ we should avoid any suggestion thatviolence was likely to come to a very early end.    The agreement didnot affect the assessment that the Provisional Wing of the irish republican Army might attempt further campaigns of violence inthis country, and his colleagues should ensure that there was norelaxation of the precautions that were taken against thic.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statements by thePrime Minister and the Secretary of State for northern Ireland,
5.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thathe had circulated on the previous evening notes about the state o  theindustrial disputes in the coal and electricity supply industries.    TheExecutive of the National Union of Mineworkers had met the previous day and had decided to reject the improved offer put to them by theNational Coal Board.    Although the moderate elements in theExecutive had hoped for a decision in favour of a ballot they hadbeen overridden.    He considered that the only plausible courseof action between now and the next meeting of the Executive on13 December was to maintain efforts to influence opinion amongstthe miners and the public in favour of the offer.    One bright spotwas the situation in Hull docks where the dock workers had now accepted an offer of an 8 per cent increase compared with their original claim for 20 per cent: this was likely to be the first majorpay award to be settled within the terms of Stage 3.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to discuss the matter again at their next meeting.In the meantime, the Secretary of State for Employment, inconsultation with the Lord President, should arrange for the courses of action on the disputes in both the coal industry and electrical supply industry to be further examined, and for revisedguidance on publicity to be circulated to Ministers,The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up by the Prime Minister of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for Employment,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,to arrange for further examination of the courses ofaction as outlined in the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister, and to circulate a paper for the Cabinet to discuss at their next meeting.
OILSUPPLIES6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Trade and Industry (CP(73) 128) about oil supplies.previous reference:CM(73) 56thConclusions,Minute 7THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat total stocks of motor spirit at 18 November amounted to 65 days1supply, a drop of five days since the end of October.    If this rate offall continued, the 45-day stock level, when distribution difficulties would start to become acute, would be reached by the end ofJanuary.    The oil companies estimated that motor spirit supplies would fall short of demand from now on by about 25 per cent, if notmore.    Although the oil companies had already been told to cutsupplies to dealers by 10 per cent, the estimated reduction in the intake of oil into the country in December, coupled with the continuing uncertainty over future supplies of oil from the middle east, indicated that it would not be possible to avoid the introductionof petrol rationings    If a situation arose in which rationing wasnecessary at short notice there would be valid criticism of theGovernment if it then emerged that it would take between three and five weeks to introduce rationing.    He did not consider thatthe present cuts in deliveries could be sustained for more than three weeks without causing abuse of the arrangements anddiscontent amongstthe public.    It was important that the Governmentshould be in a position to introduce rationing quickly, should thisprove necessary, by starting the issue of ration books as soon aspossible.    He sought authority to announce, in the debate on theSecond Reading of the Fuel and Electricity (Control) Bill on thefollowing Monday, that the issue of ration books would now start,in order that the Government might have the ability to introducerationing quickly, should it become necessary to do so.In discussion it was argued that it was difficult to reconcile theestimates of the shortfall in oil supplies with the assurances whichhad been given by the Arab oil producing countries - repeated againonly the day before - that they were willing to meet our requirements in full.    If the Government now announced the issue of ration books,public opinion at home and abroad would conclude that this was being done because we foresaw the necessity for rationing.    No other country in Europe had taken such an extreme step; and the Araboil producing countries would conclude that this was necessary only because we were re-exporting oil to other countries, and thusconspiring to frustrate their policies.    With a Summit meetingof these countries due to be held at the weekend the impact of anannouncement that day would be particularly adverse.    Instead ofbeing at the top of the list of countries regarded as friendly to theArab States, we might find our supplies substantially reduced.More information on the oil supply situation should be madeavailable before a decision of this magnitude was taken.
On the other hand, it was argued that although precise information about future oil supplies was difficult to obtain, there was likely tobe a shortfall in deliveries of oil of 16 or 17 per cent in December,despite the assurances given by the Arab oil producing countries.Saudi Arabia was still basing deliveries on the average of theprevious nine months, rather than the monthly amount required during the coming winter j   and many of the smaller oil companies,especially those whose parent companies were in the United States,were supplying less than their share of our needs.    These facts,combined with the known stock position, provided strong evidencethat the Government must take early steps to conserve our stocks and such supplies as we received.    We had already taken moreruthless steps than other countries to reduce our exports of oil,but our imports of motor spirit from refiners in Europe had beenvery severely cut.    It had always been envisaged that it would notbe possible to operate an allocation scheme based on a 10 per centcut by the oil companies for more than two or three weeks beforesevere inequities rose and public criticism resulted.    Account must also be taken of the effect on our coal, and so our total fuel, stocksof the miners1 overtime ban.The difficulty of explaining why there was a shortage of oil when wehad secured promises of favourable treatment from the arab countries arose because of the refusal by the oil companies to guarantee to deliver all the promised supplies to this country.It was essential, in the present state of our fuel supplies, thatwe should receive the full amounts which the Arab countries intendedus to receive, and that we should bring pressure to bear on the oil companies accordingly, even if this upset other countries.    Therewas no point in negotiating with the Arab countries to secure enoughoil to meet our full requirements if it was then diverted elsewhereby the oil companies.    On the other hand the problem of exercisingcontrol over the oil companies was considerable.    Even though itmight be possible for the Government to give directions to BP, this could not be done to companies owned in other countries.    strong representations had already been made.    Further pressure might lead to retaliatory action by other countries and a price war, inwhich we should be the losers on the balance of payments.    Alreadythere were reports that Nigeria had been offered very inflated prices by the United States.    No agreed action had proved possible withinthe European Economic Community or the Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development,    Consideration might,however, be given to asking the Arab oil producing countries tobring home to the oil companies that they must deliver Arab oil to the countries and in the quantities which the producers intended.
In further discussion it was emphasised that, irrespective of why our oil stocks were diminishing, it would be most unwise not to be readyto introduce rationing, if necessary, at short notice.    Unless this were done, criticism of the Government was liable to be much more severe than the criticism of the decision to issue ration books.Indeed it was arguable that people would prefer rationing to theunfairness of distribution which would inevitably increase underthe allocation scheme as time went on.    The introduction of measuressuch as prohibiting driving on Sundays would save only a compara-tively small amount of petrol and would be unlikely to be acceptablein this country on social grounds.    The period required to issue the basic and business ration books had already been cut to three weeks,which was at least a week less than was desirable, and any delay would cause the issue to stretch into the Christmas period.     Therewould then be delays at Post Office counters and in postal services which would, with the closure of Post Offices at Christmas, increasethe time needed for issuing books to five weeks.    Allowing time foradvertising the start of the issue, it was desirable that anannouncement should be made that day.    It was also necessaryto advertise for staff for the regional petroleum offices, so thatthey would be ready to issue supplementary rations if and whenrationing started.    On the other hand, it was argued that if it was essential to start issuing ration books it would be better to await the debate on the following Monday to announce this, so that theArab Summit Conference would be over and the publicity forrationing would not detract from the announcement of the settingup of the Executive in Northern Ireland.    This would also give timeto consider how the matter should be presented to the Arab countries.Moreover, the publicity campaign for voluntary savings in fuel hadnot completed its first week and it would be undesirable to causeconfusion and criticism of the Government by too early and toohurried an announcement of the issue of ration books.    In this context it could be pointed out that an effective campaign for voluntary savings would decrease the risk of having to introducerationing.    Information would be needed on how effective the campaign had been so far,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would new be prudent, in the light ofthe forecast deterioration in our oil stocks in the next few months,to take the steps necessary to enable petrol rationing to beintroduced at short notice, if need be.    The Secretary of Statefor Trade and Industry should announce in the debate on the fuel and Electricity (Control) Bill on the following Monday that petrol and derv ration books would now be issued.    The terms of theannouncement, and all related publicity, should be carefully wordedto avoid any impression that a decision had been taken to introducerationings or that it was inevitable.    It would also be important to seek to avoid giving the Arab oil producing countries any cause for
believing that we were taking this action because we were re-exporting,or were proposing to re-export, the oil which they sent us as afavoured nation to other countries not so favoured.    Nor shouldthe need to issue the ration books be linked directly with the industrial action by the miners.    The announcement should make it clear thatthe need for voluntary savings in fuel oil and petrol was not in anyway lessened by the decision to issue the ration books;, bothmeasures arising from the essential requirement to conserveour energy supplies.    The Secretary of State should consult theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Home Secretary, theLord President, and the Secretary of State for Employment aboutthe terms of his announcement and the associated publicity, as appropriate^The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.28        Invited the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry, following consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, the HomeSecretary, the Lord President of the Council, andthe Secretary of State for Employment, to announce the decision to issue petrol and derv ration books tothe public on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.
RATESUPPORTpRANTPreviousReference:CM(73) 54thConclusions.Minute 21 o The Cabinet resumed their consideration of rate support grant.    They had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(73) 127).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that officials had just had a meeting with representatives of the localauthorities and that he would have to negotiate the final statutorysettlement with the authorities on 27 November.    At the meeting with officials, the local authorities had pressed hard for some reduction in the proposed cut of  81 million in total relevant expenditure for 1974-75; but officials had stood firm.    The basisof the West Midlands factor in the needs element had been questioned,but it had been argued that allowance should be made for the special problems of other areas, in particular Wales.    There did indeedappear to be a case for introducing a sparsity factor into the calculation of the needs element.    In relation to the total amountof grant, the local authorities had argued that the governments proposals should allow for a 13 per cent inflation of local authoritycosts during the year - the original proposals had assumed 9 percent - and had also been concerned about the cost of the likely pay settlement with their manual workers, which would probably resultin additional expenditure during the year of some  30 million.Taking account of these considerations and of the fact that it now seemed likely that the variable domestic element would cost some 30 million more than had been previously estimated, he consideredthat he would need to be allowed some latitude in conducting thenegotiations, in relation both to the distribution and the amountof grant.    On the latter, it would clearly be unreasonable to proposea rate exceeding 61 per cent which, assuming inflation at 13 per cent,would enable the increase in the domestic rate burden to be kept to7 per cent and in the non-domestic rate burden to 20 per cent; butthe precise proposal put to the local authorities, which he would keepas low as possible and would of course agree with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, could only be settled finally in the context of theactual negotiations.In discussion it was argued that it would be right for the settlement to reflect the likely cost of any pay settlement with the manual workers.    But it would be quite unacceptable to assume a rateof inflation in excess of the 9 per cent which the Cabinet had agreedearlier; and on that basis it would be possible to limit the increasein the domestic rate burden to 7 per cent if the non-domestic rate burden increased by 22 per cent rather than by 20. 3 per cent as originally envisaged.    If local authority expenditure increasedmore rapidly than this - and it must be borne in mind that eventhe cuts of  81 million did not fully restore total expenditure tothe level originally agreed for 1974-75 - it might be necessaryto impose absolute cash limits on their spending.    To increasethe rate of grant would increase the public borrowing requirement,and this must be avoided in present circumstances.
THE PRIME MINISTER^ summing up ths discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the settlement must not assume a rate of Inflationof local authorities1 costs of more than 9 per cent.    It was right toallow for additional costs imposed by the likely pay settlement withthe local authorities&apos; manual workers; but total relevant expenditure by local authorities must not be allowed to exceed the agreed level,and it was equally important to restrain the public borrowing requirement.    As regards the distribution of grant, the cabinet agreed that some flexibility might be desirable and in particularthat there might be a case for introducing a sparsity factor intothe calculation of the needs element.    The Secretary of State forthe Environment should conduct the statutory negotiations with thelocal authorities on the basis of these general principles, but should secure the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the detailof any departures which it was proposed to make from thearrangements which the Cabinet had approved at their meetingon 8 November.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval^, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office22 November 1973
