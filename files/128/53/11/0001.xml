THEUSE OFGOVERNMENTCARS BYMINISTERS1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in the light of the recentappeal for economy in the use of oil, it was important that urgentmeasures should be taken and be seen to be taken to secure themaximum economy in the use of Government cars by Ministers.The Secretary of State for the Environment in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Defence and the Secretary of State for trade and Industry, should consider what steps could be taken and how they could most appropriately be publicised.    In the meantimemembers of the Government should keep the need for economy clearly in mind.The cabinet took note, with approval,, of the Prime Minister1 sstatement.PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSChannelTunnelPreviousReference:CM(73) 39thConclusions,Minute 72. The Cabinet were informed that serious difficulties were expected in the debate which was to take place in the House ofCommons that day on the White Paper about the Channel tunnel project.    It was expected that the amendment put down by theOpposition would be defeated; but present indications were thatthe Governments Motion seekiag Parliaments approval to the white paper would also be defeated.    A substantial number of government supporters was likely to abstain or vote against the Motion,    Ofthese some were opposed to the Governments European poHcies;others were uneasy about the implications for public expenditure;and yet others opposed the project on environmental grounds.    much would depend on the number of pro-European Opposition members who abstained from voting.    If the Government were defeated, aserious situation would arise; and a Ministerial statement as tothe Governments future intentions would be necessary.    matters were complicated by the fact that on present plans the prorogation of Parliament was to take place immediately after the division.In discussion it was argued that a defeat in the House of commons on this issue would be a major blow to the Governments authority;and, given the need to make very early progress with the Money Billassociated with the Channel Tunnel project, it was essential that theposition should be re-established urgently.    This could best be doneby means of an early debate on a Motion of confidence; and, havingregard additionally to the immediate damage which would otherwise be done to our standing in the eyes of our European partners and ofthe French authorities in particular, it was for consideration whether Prorogation should be deferred for 24 hours so as toenable such a debate to take place on the following day.    On theother hand, it was argued that the Channel Tunnel was not an issue
which was regarded in the country at large as so important as tojustify such drastic action, which indeed might easily be misinter-preted0    A preferable course would be to arrange for the confidenceissue to be raised in the course of the debate on The Queenss opening speech,    The Governments intentions would have to be statedimmediately after the division;  and the arrival of Black Rod to summon Members of the House of Commons to the Prorogationceremony would have to be carefully timed so as to ensure thatany exchanges arising from that statement had been concluded,THE PRIME MINISTER^ summing up the discussion,, said that theCabinet agreed that if the Government were defeated on the ChannelTunnel issue a means would have to be urgently considered forre-establishing their authority; otherwise their ability to giveeffect to major aspects of their policies, and in particular theirEuropean policies^ would be called into question, and our standing in the eyes of our European partners would be seriously damaged.The right course in the event of a defeat might be to arrange for aconfidence Motion to be tabled and discussed in the House of commons during the debate on The queen s Opening Speech, which would containspecific commitments in relation to European policies and to legislation on the Channel Tunnel,    In any event, a statementof the Govei*nment&apos;s intentions would have to be made immediatelyafter the division^ and the Lord President of the Council, inconsultation with the Chief Whip and the other Ministers concerned,should consider the terms of such a statement and by whom it could most conveniently be made, and should inform him urgently of theconclusions reached.    In consultation with the Lord Chancellor, heshould also make arrangements to ensure the suitable timing of the arrival of Black Rod,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister !summing up of their discussion.
3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe ceasefire appeared to be operating effectively that morning.    Butit remained precarious.    The Israelis had made the mistake of notleaving open lines of retreat for the Egyptian forces and there werepockets of Egyptians which, being cut off from supplies, were in ap&amp;slous situation.    The previous day President Sadat of Egypt had called for the introduction of peace-keeping forces from the soviet union and the United States,    The Americans had reacted negatively,but the Russians had indicated that they might feel obliged to intervene with forces, even if they had to do so unilaterally^claiming that the behaviour of the Israelis was in violation ofthe ceasefire.    Unilateral Soviet intervention would create a grave situation and he was considering calling in the soviet ambassador,    Indeed, the present disposition of the Israeliand Egyptian forces made it impracticable to interpose an armedpeace-keeping force of any kind between them,    Before a peaces-keeping force could be usefully introduced it was necessary to make room for it by separating the opposing forces.    This must be part ofa task to be carried out by the United Nations Truce Supervisorymachinery, which would need to be augmented.    There had beena move in this direction in the Security Council the previous evening,but the Council had adjourned without reaching a decision,.    He had asked our Ambassador in Washington to tell the American Secretaryof State$ Dr Kissinger, that in our view it was urgently necessarythat there should be far more United Nations observers on the ground,acting under the auspices of the Secretary General, Dr Waldheim,Their immediate task would be to supervise the ceasefire.    Theywould need to make arrangements to alleviate the supply problemfacing the encircled Egyptian forces and they should seek to simplify the lines separating the belligerents,    Progress might be made undera package arrangement consisting of three elements.    The Egyptiansmight be persuaded to lift the blockade of Bab el Mandab which wasdenying Israeli shipping access to the Red Sea,    Secondly 8 theexchange of prisoners, to which Israel attached particular importance,might begin.    Thirdly, the disentanglement of the Israeli and egyptian forces would meet the Egyptian interest.    If progress could be made in this way it might be possible to arrange for the israeli forces to move to positions a few miles to the east of the suez Canal.    There would then be room for peace-keeping forces to take up positions between the Israelis and Egyptians,    It was too soon to say whether the peace-keeping forces would be contributed by the United States and the Soviet Union alone, or whether othercontingents would be included.    We had told Dr Waldheim that wewould be willing to participate if that were thought to be helpful.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
Oil SuppliesPreviousReference;CM(73) 48thConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the saudi Arabian Ambassador had informed him that the United kingdom was among Saudi Arabia&apos;s preferred customers for oil, and that king Faisal intended to ensure that our supplies should not suffer.In discussion it was noted that both Kuwait and Abu Dhabi hadsimilarly intimated that our supplies would not be cut.    On theother hand the oil companies were now suggesting that by Decembertheir imports would be more seriously affected than they had earliex&apos;supposed.    The true position was obscure; and clarification^ whetherthrough diplomatic channels or by other means, was urgently needed.Moreover, it might be difficult for the producing states to ensure thattheir friendly professions could be carried into effect: it was commonpractice for ships&apos; destinations to be switched on the high seas8 andthere could be no guarantee that cai*goes manifested for the UnitedKingdom would actually arrive here.    The position might also be complicated by the need for us to conform with international sharingarrangexnents made by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and developments the PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas an urgent need to establish the facts of the present position andensure that the friendly intentions of the producing states were notfrustrated.    The Task Force on Oil Supplies should report, urgently,to the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on the stepsneeded.The Cabinet -2, Invited the Secretary of State for Defence toarrange for the Task Force on Oil Supplies to reporturgently to the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy -i. The best assessment of current and prospective supplies,ii. The action needed to ensure that the intentions of producing states to maintainsupplies to the United Kingdom were fulfilled.
SpainPreviousReference:CM(73) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a recent conversation he had held with the Spanish Ambassador hadbeen moderately reassuring since the Ambassador had emphasised the desire to develop relations and had seemed to reflect a morerelaxed attitude on the part of his Government in regard to gibraltar,The Cabinet -3, Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,IcelandPreviousReference?CM(73) 46thConclusions,Minute 2THE PRIME MINISTER said that we might succeed in reaching an agreement with the Icelandic Government in the fairly nearfuture on terms which would offer a reasonable prospect of anannual catch in the region of 130,000 tons.The Cabinet -4,        Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister,northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 43rdConclusions,Minute 24, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that progress continued to be made in his talks with the unionist party s the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the alliance Party on the formation of an Executive,    Personal relationsbetween the leader of the Unionist Party^ Mr Faulkner, and the SDLPleadership had shown a marked improvement! Mr Faulkner had beenplaying a useful role in the talks9 and it now seemed to be accepted that he should fill the office of Chief Executive,    When the talkscontinued the following week they would have to deal with the difficult problem of the large number of persons held in detention,,    despite the difficulties, it was possible that the talks would lead to theformation of an Executive within the next month or so.    The security situation in Belfast was relatively good; it was a little more difficult in Londonderry; and there were continuing problems in the Borderareas.The Harland and Wolff shipyard had again run into financial difficulty and Government assistance, of the order of  10 million, was necessary if the company was to be able to continue trading within the law.   Heand his colleagues most closely concerned had decided in principlethat assistance should be provided,, subject to stringent safeguards.
The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State or Northern Ireland.
1EUROPEAN 5, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidCOMMUNITY that the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 22-23AFFAIRS October had taken no important decisions.    The main subject a tissue had been the dx-aft directive on Mountainous and Other LessFavoured Areas and a decision on this had been deferred to the next meeting.    The Commission had announced that their proposals on the review of the Common Agricultural Policy would not become available for mid-November and this delay would add to the pressure ofbusiness towards the end of the year,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval^ of the r&amp;aiement bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,7
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSFiremeninGlasgowPreviousReference:CM(73) 49thConclusions,Minute 46. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the mass meetings of firemen in Glasgow on the previous day had decidedalmost unanimously to take strike action from 8, 00 am on 26 October,It was, however, possible that some of the men might neverthelessreport for work.    The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for home Affairs and Agriculture had met national officers of the fire brigades Union in Glasgow, who had urged that the Governmentshould have no direct dealings with the strikers.    The parliamentary secretary was also discussing the situation with the glasgow corporation in order to establish the facts of the dispute;  therewas no question of the Governments attempting to conciliate^particularly since it now appeared that the allowance already offered to the men by the Corporation might not comply with the pay Code,    The firemen&apos;s leaders had said that access by their officers to the fire appliances would not be impeded, despite picketing,nor would other local fire brigades.    The Corporation were hoping that it might be possible to obtain some assistance from brigades atGlasgow Airport and at the Hillington Industrial Estate,    TheServicemen who would provide an emergency service, if necessary,were now at Edinburgh and undertaking familiarisation training; theywould be ready if and when needed.    He proposed to make astatement in the House of Commons that afternoon regrettingthe proposed strike action, appealing to the men to reconsider their decision and indicating that the Government were takingimmediate measures to be ready to help safeguard life and property in Glasgow, if necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Scotland ohouldmake a statement that afternoon as proposed, emphasising that thiswas an unofficial strike which had been denounced by the fire brigades Union,The Cabinet -Took note, with approvals of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theSecretary of State for Scotland to be guided accordingly.
THEPROGRAMMEFORCONTROLLINGINFLATIONStage 37, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(73) 112), to which was attached a note summarising the amendments which it was proposed to make to the draft Pxiceand Pay Code for Stage 3 in the light of consultations with interested parties.    They also had before them a further memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(73) 114), to which was attached a revised text of the Stage 3 Code incorporating these amendments.previous reference?CM(73) 45thConclusionsTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that since thepublication, on 8 October, of the Consultative Document on thedraft Price and Pay Code for Stage 3 (Cmnd 5444) consultationshad been held with a wide range of interested organisations^ aswell as with the Pay Board and the Price Commission.    in considering what amendments should be accepted, the ministers concerned had had in mind the representations made by industry that, on pay, the Code was biased in favour of the public sectoras employer; and that, on prices, it should be designed to promoteefficiency and investment, and there should be improvements in theadministration of the control.    Developments since the publicationof the draft Code had underlined the need to avoid further substantialrelaxations on either pay or prices.    On pay, the amendments proposed were mainly technical,, including a new limit on payments under pre-standstill profit-sharing schemes.    It had been concluded that amendments to widen the action on pay anomalies, for exampleby extension to the Armed Forces8 could not safely be made.    Theposition of the Armed Forces could be considered at the time of the irreview in April 1974.    On prices, a number of changes had been madein the interests of efficiency or investment.    Amendments had alsobeen made to the paragraph limiting the reduction of profits underthe Code; and the period for consideration of applications by thePrice Commission had been reduced.    Paragraph 53, which was intended to restrict subdivision of an enterprise for&apos;the purpose&apos;of the code, had not struck a wholly satisfactory balance betweenpreventing artificial subdivision and permitting it when it wasgenuine; and the drafting of this paragraph had been furtherimproved since the circulation of CP(73) 1140    Subject to theapproval of the Cabinet, the Order embodying the Code wouldbe made at the end of the week and published on 30 October, totake effect for prices on 1 November and for pay on 7 November,The amendments would be explained in a Press notice, and full information would be issued by the Pay Board and the price commission.In discussion the following points were made -a. There was a case for exempting car parking charges from the Code, at least as regards charges levied by localauthorities. Increases in parking charges were a centralfeature of transport policy, and had been relied on to achieve
public expenditure savings.    While the extra cost would fallon consumers, they also had an interest in avoiding traffic congestion.    On the other hand, exemption from the Codewould leave decisions about charges wholly in the hands ofthe local authorities, and the prospect of completelyuncontrolled parking charges, at a time when petrolcharges were also rising sharply, would causes considerable public dismay.    It would be preferabletherefore to leave the matter for reconsideration in thelight of the outcome of the current review of transport policy^b, The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had set outs in his minute dated 24 October to the Prime Minister,the case for amending the Code to allow additional payments to be made to the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC),    the size and effectiveness of the RUC was crucial to the achievement of the Governments political objectives in Northern Ireland, including the restoration of lawand order and the withdrawal of the Armed Forces,A small payment^ on the lines of that conceded to theLondon police, would not satisfy their full claim, but would be some recognition of the quite exceptional natureof the duties which the RUC were required to undertake.It would also be helpful if the RUC could be exempted fromestate duty if killed as a result of terrorist activity, as was already the case for the Army,    On the other hand, whilethe RUC could claim to be exceptional in that they were under orders to go in and deal with very difficult and dangeroussituations, members of other public services in NorthernIreland, such as Post Office workers, were also in practicesubject to the same dangers, and had so far fully co-operated in providing supporting services for the RUC.    The RUCshould also gain more than other police forces from the&quot;unsocial hours&quot; concession in the Pay Code, although there was some uncertainty whether the negotiations inthe Police Council would actually produce this result,c, The Pay Board had refused to approve national agreements allowing payments to be made to administratorsin the National Health Service (NHS)P who had been involvedin additional work and responsibility connected with the NHSreorganisation.    Similar payments had been made to localauthority officers in connection with the reorganisation oflocal government, but there was no other outstanding casesimilar to that of the NHS officers, who were only claimingan agreed recompense for extra work which had already beendone.    If the Code were not amended to allow the payments tobe made retrospectively, this would be fiercely resented by
the NHS staff concerned, and they would withdraw their co-operation in bringing about the NHS reorganisation,with consequent damage to Government policy objectives in this field.    On the other hand, retrospective paymentshad been denied to other groups, and it would appear indefen-sible to allow backdating for one small group of relatively high-paid staffs when it was not being granted to, forexample^ low-paid civil servants.    Moreover, a concession on the lines suggested would provide further occasion for thegeneral criticism already voiced by industry that the Codewas biased in favour of the public sector, and did not take account of equally difficult situations which arose in theprivate sector,d. There was an outstanding issue relating to the remuneration of NHS opticians, which was still underdiscussion,e, The provision in the Code permitting new schemesfor efficiency payments had been severely criticised by the confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress,and the National Union of Mineworkers, on the grounds thatthey would not provide sufficient incentive to introduce new schemes, and that the detailed arrangements proposed werenot practical,    Thfj mineworkers had suggested that the limit on additional payments under the scheme would introduce an element of uncertainty, since the individual worker would not know when the limit had been reached.    It had also beensuggested that it was unreasonable to expect workers to wait for three months before they could be sure whetherthey would obtain any benefit under the scheme.    Thearrangements would in any case need to be approved bythe Pay Board in advance, and in those cases whereinformation about the results of the scheme could beprovided more quickly j there might be advantage in giving the Pay Board discretion to allow payments after a shorter delay.    There might also be advantage in consultingan industrialist with experience of these matters, to verifythat the arrangements now incorporated in the Code wouldbe workable in practice.    On the other hand, it seemed unlikely that the point raised by the mineworkers wouldbe a serious problem, since the efficiency scheme in thecoal industry was a national agreement whose benefits were distributed throughout the entire work force.    The provisionsnow incorporated in the Code had been the outcome ofconsiderable discussion with the Pay Board.    They were intended to encourage the introduction of new schemes thatwould produce genuine results, while discouraging the schemes which would not.    There was already a considerable body of
opinion that the Pay Code erred on the side of generosity, andany further relaxation on efficiency payments might be seen ascreating a loophole which would further increase the overallrise in earnings during Stage 3. 0 The new limit on payments under pre-standstillprofit-sharing schemes would not prevent paymentscontinuing to be made under such schemes.    It would however restrict to a maximum of  350 the increase insuch payments during Stage 30In further discuosicn, the Cabinet were informed that the price commission had agreed to a further increase of Jrp in the priceof a standard loaf of bread,   Although it had been agreed that theCommission should cease to announce individual price increasesduring Stage 3, they had felt that it would be imprudenfto begin by refusing to announce an increase of this importance^ and theywere therefore proposing to announce it on 29 October,    It wassuggested in discussion that the fact that this new increase hadbeen approved, and yet another increase had already been applied for, added urgency to the need to devise a system under whichincreases in the price of bread would be made at less frequent intervals, even if they were then larger in amount,    This shouldbe possible under the Code, if both the industry and the price commission were prepared to co-ogerate together.    Moreover,given that the price of bread was bound to increase substantiallyover the next few months, it had already been agreed that therewould be advantage in making this cslear in advance rather thanhaving to explain each successive price increase.    This pointhad indeed already been made in Ministerial speeches, althoughwithout quantifying the total increase now expected,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Code should not be amended to exempt carparking charges, although this point might be reconsidered in thelight of the outcome of^transport policy review.    The Cabinetsympathised with the case for a special payment to the RUC, butrecognised the difficulties that this might present in dealing withother public services in Northern Ireland,    It was possible thatthe problem might be solved by use of the provision in the Codeconcerning &quot;unsocial hours&quot;.    The Secretary of State for NorthernIreland should discuss further with the Secretary of State forEmployaaojat whether it would be possible to find a form of wordsto meet the case of the RUC in a way which would not be open torepercussions in other public services; but if this could not bedone it would be necessary to leave the matter as it stood.    TheSecretary of State for Northern Ireland should also discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer his proposal concerning estateduty exemption.    The Cabinet considered that, on balance,
no provision should be made for retrospective payments toadministrators in the NHS,    They noted that discussions were still continuing on the remuneration of opticians.    On the provisionspermitting new schemes for efficiency payments, the Secretary ofState for Employment should discuss further with the Pay Boardwhether it would be possible to relax the condition precludingpayment during the first three months of the scheme withouteffectively weakening the safeguards against abuse.    TheSecretary of State should also, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, 3eek to enlist the advice of an independent and experienced industrialist to verify whether these provisions wouldbe practical to operate in their present form.    Subject to resolution of these points the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange forthe Order embodying the Code to be made, as proposed in CP(73) 112.The Lord President should discuss urgently with the Minister ofAgriculture whether the increase in the price of bread to be announced on 29 October could be deferred by arranging for increases to be made less frequently s even if of greater amount;and whether a clearer warning could be given in Ministerial speechesof the likely increases which would need to be made during the nextfew months0The Cabinet -1. Took note^, with approval, of the sumrmng upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2, Subject to any amendments necessary in thelight of further discussion of the outstanding points noted by the Prime Minister in his summing up,invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor the Price and Pay Code for Stage 3 to be made and published as proposed in CP(73) 112,3,&quot;       Invited the Lord President to discuss withthe Minister of Agriculture the action to be takenregarding increases in the psice of breads asindicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
8c        The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(73) 108) about the programme for public expenditure to 1977-78.    They also had before them memoranda by the Secretary of State for Defence (CP(73) 113) about defence budgettargets, by the Secretary of State for the Environment (CP(73) 111)about local authority expenditure in England and Wales in 1974-75,and a collective brief by the Central Policy Review Staff (CP(73) 109).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the programme for public expenditure in the years to 1978 which was due to bepublished in December would be of crucial importance to theGovernment.    If their political, social and economic policieswere to bear fruit, they must maintain a reasonable level ofexpanslon9 and reduce the rate of inflation.    To this end substantialproductive investment must continue, and every effort must be madeto redress the current deficit in the balance of payments, which even before the recent increase in oil prices was running at about 1, 000 million.    Since the previous White Paper had been published,the increases in world prices of commodities, food and oil had implieda serious loss oi real income for the United Kingdom, and a reducedcapacity to meet all demands.    If the balance of payments were notto be restored, international confidence in sterling would be put at risk, and at a critical moment for the success of their policies theGovernment might be faced with the need to impose stringentmeasures of deflation.    At the same time, room must be madefor some improvement in the rate of personal consumption: ifan annual rate of something like 3-f- per cent in real terms eouldnot be achieved there would be serious consequences both for theGovernments policy on incomes and more widely.    these considerations together meant that the rate of growth in public expenditure must be restrained.    Indeed-, the general tenor ofcomment by qualified observers was that public expenditure oughtto be cut back.    He believed this to be true; but he recognised thatsuch a course would involve very great difficulties for Ms colleagues.It was however essential that the totals of public expenditure programmes in the forthcoming White Paper should not exceedin real terms those published the previous December, and thatthe projections for 1977-78 should be consistent with that rate of growth.    As the Central Policy Rwdfew Staff had pointed out a thispolicy did not, for most programmes, imply more than a slowing down in the rate of expansion: there would still be room for increases in real terms from year to year; but the rate of increase would romain steady.The Cabinet, following their discussions in July, had invited him andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, to hold bilateral discussions with theMinisters in charge of spending programmes.    These had now beencompleted.    Although the Cabinet had earlier accepted the necessityof reconstituting a true contingency reserve, he had found it
necessary, in order to accommodate the current programmes, toreduce the contingency reserve to the barest minimum, as well asto make the most optimistic assumptions about future levels ofassistance to the nationalised industries, the disappearance ofthe regional employment premium, an increase in the price of milk in October 1974, and the size of shortfalls in actual expenditure.One of the most disturbing features of the review was the large increase in the current expenditure of local authorities, over whichthe Government had little control.    The level of expenditure for1974-75 which had been reduced by some  81 million to meet the economies which the Government had announced in May now seemed likely to be exceeded by  140 million.    The Cabinet would wish topay close attention to th:,s problem when they came to discviss thelevel of rate support grant for that year.    Apart from this, he hadbeer- able to reach broad agreement with his colleagues over theirspending programmes, subject to the adjustment of details, exceptin the fields cf the social services, environment and defence.    he did not however propose that the Cabinet should on this occasionseek to determine the individual expenditure programmes; but he asked them to agree that the yearly totals in the forthcoming white paper should not exceed^ in real terms, the corresponding totalsin the White Paper for 1972 (Cmnd 5178);  and that this decision couldif necessary be reflected in public statements about the economy.In discussion it was suggested that even the measure of restraintproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer might not allow theGovernment sufficient room to accommodate desirable expenditurein the coming year.    It was noteworthy that the economies achieved in May had already been swallowed up by increased expenditure, oftenon programmes unrelated to those where cuts had been made.    Itmight indeed be for consideration whether priority should continueto be given in subsequent years to the objective of keeping downprices by subsidies to the nationalised industries;  and the convention of publishing expenditure programmes five years ahead undesirablyrestricted the Governments freedom of action and made no allowance for the changed circumstances in later years thatmight be expected from the success of the Governments economic strategy.    Nonetheless, although there were strong arguments oneconomic grounds for achieving the overall degree of restraint whichthe Chancellor proposed, it might be inadvisable for the Governmentto commit itself to a given total of public expenditure beforeagreement had bean reached on individual programmes, and their mutual relationship had been assessed.In discussion of individual programmes the following points weremade.
^&quot;&quot;^defence There was still a large difference in the later years of the^-^ programme between the proposals put forward by the Chancellorof the     chequer and those acceptable to the Secretary of State for* Defence,,    But our defence capability was a major factor in our international standing; and if the cuts proposed in the defence budgetwere likely to pose a choice between the maintenance ofconventional forces and the nuclear deterrent, it mightbe necessary to consider savings even beyond present levelson other programmes, such as overseas aid.Environment The estimates of local authority expenditure for 1974-75 indicatedlikely rate increases of the order of 8 or 9 per cent;  and the cabinet had already discussed the possibility of shifting more of the rate burden from the domestic ratepayers on to Industry and commerce.A reduction in public expenditure on housing would be more acceptable if funds raised privately for housing associationswere not included as public expenditure.    Other savings v/oulddepend largely on decisions to be taken in the field of transport policy.Social The Secretary of State for Social Services was prepared to meetServices the total of savings proposed^ but the choice would depend upon a difficult assessment of the political consequences,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were disposed to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer^objectives in principle.
