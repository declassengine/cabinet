PUBLICEXPENDITUREThe Cabinet resumed their discussion on public expenditure to1977-78,previous references:CM(73) 38thConclusions,Minute 7, and cm(73) 39thConclusions,Minute 6THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that at their meeting on 26 July the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for furtherinformation to b e provided by way of background for their consideration of public expenditure programmes.    The central policy Review Staff (CPRS) would make a presentation accordingly.The issues now before the Cabinet were crucial not only for thesuccess of the Governments policies during their term of officebut for the whole future prosperity of the country.    We stood now on the verge of an economic breakthrough which had eluded us (though not other nations) since 1945.    Although the Governments efforts hadbeen handicapped by the high levels of unemployment two years ago,which it had been their first priority to reduce, the signs of trueeconomic growth were now at last established.    But expansion hadinevitably been accompanied by increased imports, and the value of sterling had floated down to about 19 per cent below its level in 1971.This trend must now be arrested if the rate of increase-inprices was to be held to a level which would enable the Governmentto secure public acquiescence in Stage 3 of the counter-inflationpolicy.    Moreover, if international confidence was to be effectivelysustained, it would be necessary to demonstrate that the country&apos;resources were not being overstretched and that sufficient room hadbeen left for the restoration of a satisfactory balance of payments.There was at present little scope for applying restraint by monetarypolicies without damaging investment, or through taxation withoutadding to inflationary pressures; and it was therefore of prime importance to keep public expenditure within bounds.    At their discussion on 19 July he had proposed to the Cabinet that public expenditure for the .years 1975-76 to 1977-78 should be- limited, to the published in the annual White Paper in December 1972 (Cmnd 5178);and to achieve this would involve reductions in the programmes forthese years of  450 million,  700 million and  800 million respectively, without taking account of additional bids sincethe report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee hadbeen received.    This now appeared to be the absolute minimumaction that was required, although it should be noted that even these measures would still only allow for a true contingency reserve of 100 million in each year.The In a presentation by the CPRS it was suggested that over the periodCompetition between 1973 and 1978 the Governments economic strategy would be&amp;)r Resources based on the fundamental objectives of higher investment, growth in*B the standard of living, a sustainable balance of payments, a reductionin the rate of inflation, no increase in the real burden of personal
taxation, and fairness in progress against poverty.    All theseinterconnected objectives were threatened by the projected growth of public expenditure.    Our national resources, at present worthabout  55,000 million a year, were predicted to grow by an annual average of about  2, 000 million (at constant 1972-73 prices).Present projections suggested that of this amount  350 million would go on private investment,  200 million for the balance ofpayments, and   700 million each for private consumption and public expenditure (based on current policies assuming no cuts, changes oradditional bids); these figures implied an annual average rate of increase of only 2.4 per cent for private consumption compared with . 9 per cent for public expenditure.    Private consumers howeverwere unlikely to accept a residuary role which would condemn themto a slower increase in living standards than they had experiencedover the last 20 years, and much below the prospects outlined in cmnd 5178.    Higher investment would however be essential to returnto levels of the past decade or to catch up with the economic growthrates of our main competitors; and the current deficit on the balanceof payments must be moderated if the downward drift of ourcurrency, and the consequent pressure on import prices, was tobe arrested.    If enough was not allowed for rising living standards,the nation at large would seek them by reducing savings, thusincreasing the de facto allocation of resources to private consumption at the expense of investment and the balance of payments, and by insisting on uneconomically high wages, which would be an addedstimulus to inflation.    And the maintenance of existing tax rates would lead to an increase in the direct tax burden.    This led to thegeneral conclusion that in the interests of achieving the Governmentsstrategic objectives, the growth of public expenditure must berestrained.    To keep the real tax burden constant and public expenditure growth in line with the Governments published estimateswould require restrain t at least to the extent of  1, 200 million in1977:   800 million, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had already pointed out, was the barest tolerable minimum.In discussion some criticism was expressed of the assumptions onwhich the rate of increase in gross domestic product (GDP) over theperiod had been projected.    There was reason to hope that theexpansion of industrial investment now under way would produce a significant increase in GDP by 1978,    But given that there mustbe some measure of uncertainty about projections so far ahead, &apos;twas better to take a cautious view of likely growth;  since, ifprogrammes had to be adjusted, it was always easier to advancethan to defer them.   The amount available for private consumptionhad been calculated as the residue when account had been taken ofthe minimal needs of private investment, of the amount necessaryto redress the balance of payments, and of existing public expenditure programmes.    But it was questioned whether there was not some element of double counting as between
the allocation of public and private expenditure, in that a large partof public expenditure consisted of salaries and wages, which in turnwere translated into private expenditure.    It was further suggestedthat too much emphasis should not be placed on the advantages ofprivate consumption to the detriment of public expenditure, sincemuch public expenditure was directly applied to the improvementof living standards, for instance in the fields of education, the environment, and the social services.    In order to obtain the benefitof improved public services, people might be prepared to toleratesome of the increase in the real burden of taxation which would arise if tax rates were left unaltered.    Nonetheless, the commonlyaccepted measure of the standard of living was related to personaldisposable income rather than to any concept of a social wage,,    Ifpersonal disposable income was too stringently limited, experience had shown that the outcome could be a renewed wage explosion.Moreover, the Government were committed to a progressive reduction in the burden of taxation;  and if personal tax allowances were not increased in an inflationary situation, very serious burdenswould be placed on the less well-off wage-earner.TheCompetitionbetweenProgrammesIn the second part of the presentation by the CPRS it was stated that over the period to 1978 Departments would need an extra 11 per cent,to fulfil idieir present programmes, or 12 per cent if the additionalbids were accepted.    The first part of the presentation had indicated,however, that an increase of 9 per cent was the most that the economycould accommodate; and this in turn suggested that the projectedincrease in public expenditure programmes over the period would need to be restrained by about a quarter, implying a reduction ofsome  800 million in the total at present forecast for 1977-78,The growth of some programmes might reflect natural changesoutside the Governments control; and cuts imposed across theboard would ignore differing priorities between programmes.Little could be expected from the example of other countries,whose priorities in comparable sectors (except defence) andthe service of the national debt generally accorded very muchwith ours; nor could the elimination of waste, a perennial objective^be expected to yield savings of the order required.    The restraint of  800 million must therefore be sought from individual programmes.    By way of illustrating the scale of considerations involved, the CPRS had made the following broad assessment.In the field of expenditure on industry, restraint in the employment and training services, the programmes of industrial and regionalassistance, or the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries would be highly damaging to the strategic objectives relating to growth and the balance of payments; but  10- 30 million in 1977 might be saved on agriculture.
Social security, health and education together accounted for over40 per cent of total public expenditure.    The strategic objectives of rising living standards and fairness left little scope for restraint in the projected social security programme; but the hospital and personal social services programmes, whose projected annual rateof increase was 3j per cent and 82 per cent respectively, might beslowed down to save  50- 100 million in 1977-78.    Deferment ofsome capital expenditure on replacing existing schools ar.d expandingnursery and higher education might save  70*. 140 million.Housing and road programmes of importance to industrial growthshould be protected, but other road programmes could be pressedahead more slowly to save  100- 200 million in 1977-78;  someexpenditure connected with Maplin and the Channel Tunnel mightbe briefly deferred, to save about  90 million;  and the rate ofimprovement in local services might be reduced, to save 50- 100 million.An important general point was that the non-capital expenditureof local authorities seemed likely to rise more than twice as fast as public expenditure as a whole.    There would be need to controlthis by explicit directives as well as through pressure from the rate support Grant.Measures of this nature might save about  600 million in 1977-78,The balance of  200 million would need to be sought from programmesrelating either to defence or industry.    International comparisonsshowed that although the United kingdom s defence burden, as a percentage of gross national product, had been falling since the mid-1950s and was still due to decline, it yet remained substantially higher than the average of our European allies.    If the percentagewere to fall by 1977-78 to the present European average level, 700 million would be saved, which would almost remove the needfor restraint in other public expenditure programmes, By contrast,if the Ministry of Defence*s extra bid of  300 million for that year were admitted, the minimum target for public expenditure savings would rise to  1, 100 million.    To the extent that the remainingsavings required could not be found from defence, they would haveto be found from industrial programmes which underlay our economic growth.    The Cabinetls decision would need to turn on theirassessment of the relative importance of the economic and militarydangers which confronted the country.In discussion it was suggested that any consideration of possible measures of restraint in the three latter years of the period to 1978must take account of the economies already achieved in the earlier years, to which the road programme in particular had made a notablecontribution.    Moreover, in the field of the social services, urgent
pressures must be expected to provide more help for certain groups of the population which would command widespread public sympathy;and from this point of view it would be desirable to make more room for manoeuvre in the programmes as at present projected.    Therewere evident political difficulties at this juncture in announcingreductions in public expenditure programmes, even if, in most cases, these would not be absolute cuts but adjustments in the rateof growth.    Nonetheless, the Cabinet had already accepted theprinciple that the total of public expenditure programmes shownin the 1973 White Paper should not be out of line with those shownin Crand 5178,    In this connection it was already a cause for concern that, when the 1973 White Paper came to be published, the savings of 500 million over the first two years of the period, which theGovernment had secured earlier that year, would be seen to be offset by increases of some  350 million, or more if additional expenditure was authorised for counter-inflationary purposes.On the other hand, it was suggested that there were ways of increasingthe effective burden of taxation, which might prove more acceptablethan cuts in particular services.    If rates of personal taxation werenot reduced, the yield would increase; and though this might bethought to bear heavily on the lower-paid, it could to some extent be offset by improvements to the pay of the lower-paid workers, onwhich the Governments counter-inflationary policies laid emphasis.Howevev, the proposed reduction of  800 million did in fact alreadyassume some increase in the burden of real taxes; and the problemremained that any public expenditure programme published now whichexceeded, in real terms, the totals proposed in the 1972 White paper would be damaging to international confidence in the economic prospects.In further discussion the following points were made -a. A reduction in the defence budget might well commandconsiderable public sympathy.    Reductions in the defence budget would, however, have major implications for foreignpolicy and might particularly affect the situation in NorthernIreland,  The Secretary of State for Defence did not accept that thefigure of   300 million, which had been left unresolved in the 1972programme, should be treated as an additional bid for 1973;and it was urged that before further consideration was givento a reduction in the defence budget there would be advantage in the Cabinet being given a detailed account of the full implications.b. Consideration should be given to improving the presentation of future public expenditure surveys, so thatit would be easier to treat separately items like productive
industrial investment, and transfer payments which were largely financed through national insurance contributions and which represented disposable income in the hands ofthe recipients.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had had a useful preliminary exchange of views on some major issues which would be coming forward.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should now continue his discussions with theMinisters in charge of expenditure programmes with a view to ensuring that the total of public expenditure for the years to 1977-78was kept in line with that projected in Cmnd 5178, and taking accountof the points made in discussion including the presentational aspects.The Cabinet would wish to resume their collective consideration ofpublic expenditure the following month, when decisions could betaken on the total of the programme and on any further measures necessary to achieve it.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer tocontinue his discussions with the Ministers concerned on public expenditure programmes to 1977-78.3.        Agreed to resume their discussion in the courseof the following month.Cabinet Office17 September 1973
