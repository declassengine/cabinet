parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(73) 53rdConclusions,Minute 22. THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that representatives of israel and Egypt had signed the six point agreement.    Thecheckpoints on the road between Cairo and Suez were beinghanded over by the Israeli Army to the United Nations EmergencyForce and the exchange of prisoners of war was beginning.    no agreement had been reached on arrangements for the withdrawalof the Israeli forces to the lines on which they stood at the timeof the 22 October ceasefire.    There was no sign of a move towards the opening of peace negotiations; it was important that there should be a move in that direction before the summit meeting of Arab leaders on 28 November.The cabinet took note o  the statement by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
previous reference:CM(73) 53rdConclusions,Minute 33. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland (CP(73) 125) on political developments there.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat in his judgment the time had come to confront the unionist party, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the alliance Party with firm proposals for the setting up of an executive.    In his memorandum he had outlined a package of proposals in which he sought to balance the interests of thevarious Parties.    Since his memorandum was written he had held further meetings, both with the three Parties collectivelyand with their three leaders separately.    A basic issue was the composition of the Executive.    It was clear that unlessMr Faulkner, the leader of the Unionist Party, had an absolutemajority on the Executive, he would be rejected by his ownParty, and it would then be impossible to form an Executive.It was also equitable, having regard not only to the composition of the Assembly, but also to the attitude of the electorate, thatMr Faulkner should have a majority,    He had told Mr Faulkner,however, that the Unionists for thci^ part would have to make some concessions to the SDLP on the formation and nature of a Councilof Ireland, and possibly on other matters.    Mr Faulknerrecognised this fact.    Mr Fitt, the SDLP leader, recognised thatunlf ss Mr Faulkner was given a majority of places the Executivecould not be formed, but he could not at this stage answer for theattitude of his colleagues.    Further private talks were being held with Mr Fitt that day and on the following day there would be ameeting with the SDLP representatives.    The leader of the alliance Party, Mr Napier, had said that they had decided thatthey would not take part in an Executive if the Unionists enjoyedan absolute majority on it, since they believed that their participation in such circumstances would lose them support in thecountry.    He had told Mr Napier that he thought the AllianceParty were mistaken in this view, and it had been arranged thathe would meet Mr Napier and his colleagues privately later in theweek to discuss the matter further.    If the Alliance Party were willing to serve, his proposal would be that the Unionists shouldhave 6 places on the Executive, the SDLP 4 places and the alliance Party one place; and in addition a fifth member of theSDLP would receive an appointed post, outside the Executive.Subject to the agreement of his colleagues he would put hispackage of proposals to the 3 Parties on 19 November, making itclear that the essential elements were not a matter for bargaining.He hoped however that his colleagues would give him somediscretion in the matter of detail.    It would, for example, benecessary to offer the SDLP something in regard to our detentionpolicy.    In present circumstances we could not afford an early
release of large numbers of detainees, but he might need tomake a declaration of intent to end detention as soon as thesecurity situation permitted this; and he might find it advisable to offer other measures such as the granting of compassionateparole.    He had not yet mentioned to the Parties the possibilityof holding preliminary consultations about a tripartite conference,in which Westminster and Dublin would be involved, and to whichthe leaders of all Parties represented in the Assembly would beinvited.    He sought discretion to put forward this idea if necessary.He thought there was some chance that he would reach agreementwith the Parties on 19 November, in which case he wouldprobably m ake an announcement in Parliament the following day.It was more likely, however, that the SDLP would be unwilling toreach a decision then, and in that case, or if disagreement was clear, he would tell the Parties that he intended to announce his proposals in the course of the debate on Northern Ireland whichwas to be held in Parliament on 22 November.The Cabinet -1.     Approved the proposals put forward by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland.The WinchesterTrialPreviousReference:CM(73) 54thConclusions,Minute 4THE HOME SECRETARY said that the verdicts had been giventhe previous day in the trial of the persons from Northern Irelandwho had been responsible for the bomb outrages in London inMarch.    Only one of the accused had been found not guilty.Sentences were expected to be passed that day and the ProvisionalWing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) might well attempt to retaliate with further violence in this country.    Measures toimprove the screening of passengers and vehicles on the routes between both parts of Ireland and Great Britain had been strengthened since the events of March and would now be furtherreinforced.    Police forces and customs officials were responsible in British ports;  the Army and the Royal ulster constabulary were co-operating in Northern Ireland; and therewas also co-operation with the Gardai in the Republic.    in anticipation of the verdicts the Civil Service Department had on6 November reminded Government Departments and installations,the authorities at the Palace of Westminster, public utilities andthe Law Courts of the need for special vigilance.    This warningwas being repeated.    Special precautions were being taken at anumber of car parks, including Horse Guards.    He had givenconsideration to the desirability of a Government statementwarning the public to be on their guard.    On balance, however,he did not favour a formal statement, which could have the effectof encouraging hoaxes.    But he would see advantage in letting it
be known, through background briefing of the Press, that theGovernment had taken steps to bring to the attention of departments and public bodies the importance of vigilance, andthat the police were also fully aware of the need for this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the possibility of action by their  must be taken seriously and his colleagues should ensurethat all necessary care was taken.    The Cabinet agreed that a formal public statement by the Government was not desirable atpresent, but that the Press should be guided in the senseindicated by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet -2.    Took note with approval of the statements by the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary.4
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the Council of Ministers (Finance) had met on9 November.    In a constructive discussion on the economicsituation there had been general agreement on the need forfurther determined action throughout the Community against inflation, and it had been accepted that it was unrealistic tothink of applying identical measures in all member states.The Community should aim to produce a programme of measuresconcentrating on problems of inflation over the next few monthswhich member states could adopt selectively according to their particular circumstances.    On the second stage of Economicand Monetary Union the French had withdrawn their previousrefusal to participate in substantive discussions and there would now be an urgent examination of proposals made by theCommission with a view to the Council of Ministers making further progress on 3/4 December.The Council of Ministers (Agriculture) meeting on 19/20 Novemberwould be making a preliminary examination of proposals by theCommission for the review of the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP).    There was a presentational problem for the UnitedKingdom in that the Commission had made unduly extravagantclaims for financial savings arising from their proposals;clearly we could not directly challenge these claims but we musttry to ensure that they did not become firmly established in public expectations.The Council of Ministers (Transport) meeting on 22/23 Novemberwould examine Commission proposals about a future CommunityTransport Policy.    Our main objective was to avoid anyconfrontation over the delicate issues of the Community road transport quota and the maximum axle weight for goods  vehicles.There was no prospect of any move in the deadlock on this latter is sue.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.5.        THE PRIME MINISTER read to the Cabinet a letter whichhe had received from HRH Princess Anne expressing her thanksand those of Captain Phillips for the present which the cabinet had given them on the occasion of their wedding.5
1DUS TRIALAFFAIRSThe CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(?3) 55thConclusions,Minute 26, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat the miners ban on overtime was continuing with a consequentserious lack of production,,    The National Coal Board (NCB) were considering whether they should only pay for hours worked,although there was some legal doubt about their right to do this.There was to be a further meeting between the NCB and theNational Union of Mineworkers (NUM) that morning but there was at present no prospect of an early ballot.    Press comment had so far been favourable to the NCBJs offer but it was important totake every possible step to emphasise the generosity of the offer made to the NUM.In discussion it was argued that a clear strategy should now be developed for bringing the dispute to an eventual end.    It was important to define precisely what more, if anything, could bemade available within the terms of the Pay Code and CounterInflation Policy and then to decide the stage at which this shouldbe offered.    On the one hand it might be wise to hold bade some further inducement as a basis for the eventual settlement.    Butthis might then look like a surrender if the NUM&apos;s actions were clearly politically motivated and there was a case for making anylast offer at an earlier stage so that the Government could make itclear that everything permissible within the terms of Stage 3 hadbeen offered and that any further industrial action would bedirectad against a Code approved by Parliament.    The position was however changing from day to day and it was for example not clear whether the Trades Union Congress, given the fact that theOpposition had now committed themselves to support of the miners1action, would be ready to exercise a constructive influence eventhough they admitted privately that the offer was generous.    It waspossible therefore that the Government would face a situation of confrontation rather than negotiation in which the battle for publicopinion would be crucial.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas important to sustain public opinion in its view that the offer tothe miners was fair and in conformity with Stage 3 and the lord president should circulate a note, on which Ministers could drawin their speeches, giving information about the NCBTs offer and therelativities of miners1 pay to that of other workers.    He was prepared to meet the NUM in the following week but it would benecessary first to decide, in consultation with the NCB, the tacticsand the timing of any final offer to the NUM.    It would help theCabinet to reach a view on this if the Secretary of State for employment were to circulate a paper with proposals for the strategic handling of the dispute.    There should be sound legalbacking for any refusal by the NCB to pay for more than timeworked.
THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that he had seen the electrical Power Engineers1 Association (EPEA) and theElectricity Council earlier that week, primarily to discuss safety and security of supply.    The Association^ main complaint wasthat the differential in pay between the supervisory staff and the manual workers had been narrowed.    A small payment for unsocialhours could be made under Stage 3, but the EPEA wanted some assurance that the present anomaly in differentials would be corrected before they would call off their ban on standby duties.The settlement of the EPEA dispute was of vital importance in viewof the overtime ban by the miners and the situation on oil supplies.It would therefore be desirable to consider whether the Pay board should not consider their case in its study of relativities.In discussion it was agreed that, although no guarantees had beengiven to the EPEA, their loyalty to the Council during previousindustrial action in the industry and the subsequent unfortunatehistory of their standby agreement warranted some special consideration of their case.    On the other hand, it was argued that the EPEA would not be satisfied with a reference to the pay board, that no guarantees in relation to anomalies ought to be given and that payment for standby duties was already generous.Although the EPEA were in a strong position, to make further concessions would prejudice the credibility of the Stage 3 pay policy,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be difficult to persuade public opinion that the EPEA, whoseco-operation in imposing any necessary power cuts on an orderlybasis would be of great importance, did not have a genuine grievance.The Lord President, in conjunction with the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister for Industry, should consider the options open to the Government, within the terms of the Pay Code,as a matter of urgency.71, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Secretary of State for employment, in consultation with the Ministerfor Industry, to circulate a paper on the strategy to be adopted in the handling of thedispute,3,        Invited the Lord President of the Councilto circulate a paper on the offer which had beenmade and on pay relativities.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatsporadic local strike action continued amongst ambulance drivers.An emergency service in these areas was being maintained with the help of volunteers,    A national conference of the unions concerned,to be held on 29 November, could well lead to a national strike ofambulance crews, although an emergency service might still bemaintained.    It would be desirable for every effort to be made to supplement this wherever necessary with volunteers, rather than to resort to the use of Servicemen, which would tend to exacerbatethe situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theWaterloo Branch of the Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had called a one-day strike on 19 Novemberwhich would lead to disruption on the Southern Region,    There wasalso a prospect of partial support for this strike amongstUnderground drivers, but the position was still unclear.The Cabinet -6. Took note of the statements by theSecretary of State for Employment.84. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.5.        Invited the Lord President of theCouncil to arrange for the possibility of settling the power engineers1 dispute to be reviewed urgently.
7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP(73) 126) about oil allocation.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that, in the light of the latestassessments of the availability of oil supplies, the ministerial committee on Economic Strategy had on the previous eveningreached the provisional conclusion that arrangements should bemade to reduce the consumption of both industrial fuel oil and motor spirit by 10 per cent.    The imposition of these cuts would be accompanied by a publicity campaign to encourage economy in theuse of all forms of fuel.    Cuts of this order should interfere verylittle with industrial production and could be carried out by the oil companies on the basis of their estimates of consumption during thecoming winter following directions under the emergency regulations.    These would enable the oil companies to institutearrangements to alleviate local shortages and to help out those companies whose supplies had been most severely cut.    Cuts inmotor spirit would be achieved by a restriction of supplies todealers, who would be left to share out the limited supplies asfairly as possible taking account of the needs of essential users.But unless consumption by motorists could be reduced such cutscould not be sustained for more than about three weeks beforeshortages became acute.*  other measures, including a sustainedpublicity campaign to encourage economy in the use of all forms of fuel should therefore be considered.    If these measures were takenit should not at this stage be necessary to take steps to introducepetrol rationing.    But while steps to allocate oil supplies could betaken under the Emergency Regulations, the justification for theemergency powers might lapse;  and in any case the regulations would need to be renewed after a month.    It would therefore be prudent to secure the passage of the Fuel and Electricity (Control)Bill before 12 December.    Information had been received that morning that the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) hadalready, in consultation with the oil companies, agreed to reduce their requirements of oil by well over 10 per cent.    This might have considerable implications for coal stocks at power stations, at atime when coal output had already been cut by over 20 per cent as aresult of the miners1 overtime ban, and could lead to the necessity to introduce a crude form of electricity rationing if the industrial action by the power engineers precluded the adoption of a system ofrcta cuts.    This would need further consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the measures proposed in CP(73) 126 shouldbe announced in the debate due to take place on 19 November.    Inthe meantime the Lord President and the Secretary of State for trade and Industry should consider further whether the decision ofthe CEGB to cut oil supplies by 10 per cent, which was no doubt9
intended to conform to the Governments request to reduceconsumption of all fuels by 10 per cent, would be in the national interest, having regard to the effect on electricity generation at atime when there was industrial action in both the coal and electricity supply industries.    The Lord President and theSecretary of State should also consider, in conjunction with theSecretary of State for Education and Science, what steps needed to be taken to prevent the closure of schools as a result of theprohibition of space heating by electricity under the Electricity(Heating) (Restriction) Order 1973.    It would be desirable that theLord President should hold a meeting of the Ministers concernedwith the implementation of the measures described in CP(73) 126.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by thePrime Minister.2.        Invited the Lord President of the Counciland the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry -i. to consider further whether oil supplies for power stations should bereduced;ii. in conjunction with the Secretaryof State for Education and Science, the modifications which were required to theorder banning space heating by electricity,3.        Invited the Lord President of the Councilto discuss the implementation of the measures in cp(73) 126 with the Ministers concerned.Cabinet Office15 November 197310
