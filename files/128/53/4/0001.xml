1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat on his recent visit to the United States to attend the general assembly of the United Nations, he had found the morale and stateof mind of the United States Administration very disturbing.Preoccupation with the consequences of the Watergate affairand the charges being levelled against the Vice-President,Mr Agnew, were preventing the Administration, with the exceptionof the Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger^ from taking a grip on affairs.Nevertheless,, some progress was being made on the definition of the relationship between Europe and the United States, after a slow startand some misunderstandings.    The meeting of the Foreign ministers of the Nine, held in Copenhagen on 10 and 11 September^ had made good progress in the preparation of a document on the Europeanidentity and of a draft declaration on the joint purposes of the Nineand the United States.    Dr Kissinger had shown some irritation atthe decision of the Nine to prepare, jointly, a draft declaration to put to the Americans for discussion, but he now understood the reason why they had to proceed in this way,,    The French Government had shown themselves more co-operative than had at one time seemed likely and with their agreement discussion with the Americans wasbeing carried forward by the Political Directors of the Nine,    Therewas a reasonable prospect that a satisfactory statement on defence would be produced in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)foruseif and when the President of the United States, Mr Nixon^ visitedEurope.    The timing of the Presidents visit was, however, stilluncertain,,    There was little doubt that he would like to make an earlyvisit but it seemed doubtful whether the political situation in theUnited States would allow him to come to Europe before the endof the year.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theUnited States Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, had expressed to himhis anxiety about the future of the American base at Keflavik6although no suggestion had been made to us that we should changeour stance in the fishing dispute.    Nevertheless the dispute was b^ingexploited by some elements to put pressure on the icelandic government to terminate the agreement on the base.    Concernon this issue was also felt in NATO where a recent review had emphasised the importance of the base to the defence of the atlantic area.    On 25 September the Prime Minister had suggested in a message to the Prime Minister of Iceland, Mr Johannes son, that
we should try to reach a modus vivendi under which we would withdrawnaval protection and restrict voluntarily the size of our fishing effort,,and Iceland would stop interfering with our trawlers.    Mr Johannes sonhad indicated that he would like to have a modus vivendi; but he had said that it was politically impossible for him to give a public under-takmg to stop interfering with the trawlers, although he would do his best to ensure that if naval protection was withdrawn, such interferencewould cease.    It had therefore been decided to send a further message to the effect that in an effort to find a way of breaking out of the presentimpasse we had decided that the Royal Navy would be withdrawn fromthe disputed area at 1500 hours on 3 October; that the withdrawal would be made on the assumption that the Icelandic authorities wouldnot take any measures against British trawlers fishing, or which hadfished, in the disputed area; and that the Navy and the tugs would return if that assumption proved to be wrong.    The message also stated that an important objective was to establish conditions whichwould enable Mr Johannes son to visit London for talks with the PrimeMinister directed towards achieving a modus vivendi.    Before the message was sent the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had held a meeting with representatives of the industry who had accepted thereasons for sending it and who had been given an assurance that naval protection would be restored if the trawlers were subjected toharassment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had spoken by telephone withMr Johannes son who welcomed the message and agreed to come toLondon for talks on 15 October.    He had emphasised toMr Johannes son the extreme importance of avoiding incidents in the disputed area.    The Secretary General of NATO, Dr Luns,who had discussed the matter with the Prime Minister on 30 September,had given us an assurance that if, after we had withdrawn naval protection, our trawlers should be harassed and we were thereforeobliged to restore protection, he would support us.    It would now benecessary to work out in detail what limitation of our fishing effort wewould be prepared to accept as part of a modus vivendi.The Cabinet -2.        Took note, with approval, of the statements by the Prime Minister and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that although the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Lopez Rodo, hadtaken a predictably hard line on Gibraltar in his speech to theUnited Nations General Assembly, they had held a private conversationin which Senor Rodo had refrained from any threats to interfere withour trade and other relations and had, on the contrary, expressed a desire to develop our relations so far as possible.    They had agreedthat there would be no point, at this stage, in continuing the meetings on Gibraltar which he had had with Senor Rodo*s predecessors but hehad undertaken to send a paper to Senor Rodo which would offersuggestions on ways in which Spain might improve her relationswith Gibraltar.The Cabinet -3. Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.GibraltarPrevious-Reference:CM(73) 26thConclusions,Minute 3Visitof theJapanesePrimeMinisterTHE PRIME MINISTER said that his talks with the Japanese PrimeMinister, Mr Tanaka, who was here on an official visit, were goingwell.    An interesting proposal put forward by Mr Tanaka was that japan should be allowed to invest in the exploitation of North Sea oil;that Japan would not have a right to acquire any of the oil thusproduced, but that there would be offset arrangements with british petroleum or Shell, under which Japan would obtain oil producedelsewhere; and that as part of the package Japan would also investin development areas in Britain.    This proposal was being examined.We were also trying to persuade Mr Tanaka to acquire fissile material from the Anglo-German-Dutch centrifuge, and we wereurging him to retain an interest in the Concorde,The cabinet. Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.Austria THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theundertaking recently given by the Austrian Government to Arabterrorists, that in return for the release of hostages they wouldclose the camp used for the reception of Soviet Jews emigratingfrom the Soviet Union, had come under severe criticism and created a dangerous precedent.    He was himself visiting Austria on16 October, and was instructing our Ambassador to inform theAustrian Government now of our concern at the problems created by the undertaking.    The Leader of the Opposition had suggested
that facilities should be provided in camps in this country to receiveJewish immigrants on their way from the Soviet Union to Israel.This proposal would raise practical difficulties; the numbers involved were large;  and we would be creating a target for Arab terrorism inthis country.    Consideration would have to be given to the line to take if Mr Wilson&apos;s proposal attracted support; but in the meantime therewas a possibility that the Austrians might find ways of continuing tohelp the immigrants on their way to Israel,The Cabinet -5.        Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,2.        THE PRIME MINISTER said that the European Commissionon Human Rights was starting its hearings on the Irish complaint thatthere had been grave infringements of human rights in NorthernIreland.    When he had visited the Prime Minister of Ireland,Mr Cosgrave, on 17 September, they had reached agreement that the case should be set aside on the basis of a friendly settlement.Mr Cosgrave had said that for his own political reasons he must notappear to be acting in collusion with us and we had therefore agreedthat we would take the initiative in asking the Commission to pursue the possibility of arranging a friendly settlement, on the understandingthat the Irish Government would respond favourably.    Subsequently,however, Mr Cosgrave had informed him that this procedure wouldnot be acceptable: the present stage of the hearings, which consisted of the Irish presentation of their case and our response^ must go ahead, but the Irish Government would accept a move towards a friendly settlement after the conclusion of the present stage and before the next stage, at which individual witnesses would offerevidence in support of the Irish complaint.    Although this changein the Irish position was regrettable, it was the next stage of thehearings which it was particularly important to avoid, since the witnesses would include extremists whose evidence would createpublicity prejudicial to the fulfilment of our constitutional policies in Northern Ireland.    There remained the possibility that in presenting his case at the present stage the Irish Attorney General,Mr Costello, would fail to observe proper restraint.    The attorney general had warned Mr Costello that the tone of our reply would depend upon the tone of his statement.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
Formationof anExecutivePrevious&quot;Preference:CM(73) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3THE PRIME MINISTER said that on 5 October the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland would hold his first joint meeting withrepresentatives of the Unionist Party, the Social Democraticand Labour Party and the Alliance Party to discuss the formationof an Executive,The Cabinet -2,        Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister,5
3, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that themeeting of the International Monetary Fund in Nairobi hadg asexpected, failed to make any substantial progress on the subjectof monetary reform.    The Committee of Twenty were to meet again in January 1974,    There had however been useful meetings of small groups on the side.    The meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers had led to a useful discussion, conducted in a friendlyspirit.    There had been some muted complaints about our allegedfailure to consult fully on the sterling arrangements, but we had not come under serious pressure,The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSThe motor industry-previous reference:CM(73) 42ndConclusions,Minute 44. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat, although the decision of the electricians at Chryslers1Linwood factory to remain at work had enabled production to bemaintained and the start of the dismissals to be postponed, inter -union discussions at Coventry on the previous day had failed to lead to a settlement of the dispute about the electricians&apos; payincrement.    There were to be further negotiations betweenChryslers and representatives of the Electrical, Electronic,Telecommunications and Plumbing Union later that day.The British Leyland Motor Company had now told their workers at their Longbridge factory that they had decided to challengein the High Court the Pay Board&apos;s interpretation of the Pay Codein refusing to allow the whole of the agreed pay increase of 4, 00 a week to be back-dated to July.    Although the unions had accepted this course there were still some doubts about thelegality of such a challenge.    It was, however, hoped that these could be overcome with the co-operation of the Pay Board,This should allow further industrial action to be avoided.Agreement had been reached that the sacking of the workerconcerned in the dispute at Fords should be referred to arbitration,and this had enabled production at Dagenham to be resumed.The Electricity The Electrical Power Engineers Association (EPEA) wereIndustry disgruntled over the industry&apos;s inability under the Pay Code to implement an agreement for increased allowances for standbyduties reached during the previous December, and were alsoseeking to restore a 25 per cent lead in pay over the manual workers in the industry.    Although it would be possible to go someway towards meeting their demands under the Stage 3 Pay Code,this could not be done until their next pay settlement was due in thefollowing February; and in the meantime the EPEA werethreatening to ban out-of-hours working from 1 November.    Thiswould be likely to lead to some interruption of supply, althoughmaintenance work on safety grounds would be undertaken.Consideration might be given to the possibility that the Pay board might take some account of the engineers&apos; grievances during their study of relativities.The Railways He and the Minister for Transport Industries would be meetingthe Chairman of the British Railways Board (BRB) that afternoon to discuss the negotiations on the restructuring of drivers&apos; pay.The BRB had already offered the drivers increases of up to  6. 20a week, in addition to any annual pay increase which might becomedue on 1 May 1974, to be paid in 3 annual instalments starting on
1 January 1974.    The Associated Society of Locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had rejected both the amount and the stagingof the proposed increase, which appeared to be in breach of the pay Code.    Some branches of ASLEF were already demanding that industrial action be taken, and unofficial action before the end ofthe month appeared possible.    Official action might be delayedeither by a reference of the case to arbitration, or by a decision by ASLEF to await the outcome of the Special Congress of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) which was to consider the TUCattitude to the Stage 3 policy.    A full-scale national strike didnot, however, seem likely.There was to be a meeting between the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) on 10 October aboutthe mineworkers1 pay claim.    Although there was pressure for industrial action from militant branches of the NUM there washope that the provision for shift allowances made in the Stage pay Code would persuade the NUM Executive not to take industrial action.    They would in any case need to conduct a ballot oftheir members on whatever offer was made.He considered that the scope for taking action to treat particularpay problems as special cases had now been exhausted, since the stage 3 Code had already been weighted significantly in favour ofworkers in the public sector.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had recently met the 3 chairmen of the Pay Review Bodies and they had agreed that, before submitting their proposals to the Government, they would assurethemselves, by consulting the Pay Board, that their recommenda-tions were in conformity with the Pay Code.    He had also met theNational Staff Side about the pay of civil servants under Stage 3;they had adopted a reasonable attitude, in which the Governmentsundertaking to take steps to protect the pension position of those whose salary on retirement had been affected by the pay policy had played a part.He had also had further discussions with the representatives of the tuc and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on the Stage pay and Prices Code, but had not disclosed the Governmentsthinking about the level of the pay limit.    The TUC, capably ar Ieffectively led by their new General Secretary, were expectingfreer, rather than wholly free, collective bargaining to be intro-duced in Stage 3.    There was a genuine anxiety on the part of the cbi about the impact of the Price Code on investment, at a timewhen the Stage 2 Code was beginning to take effect.    The CBI had also been concerned about the effect on profitability of any increasein the productivity offset.    Whereas the TUC wanted flexibility on
pay and rigid control of prices, the CBI could envisage only very limited relaxation of the pay limits and, ideally, would haveliked the Price Commission to be disbanded and for theGovernment to have relied upon competition to achieve thenecessary restraint on prices.    They were, however, right to stress the importance of profits in securing greater investment.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Employment.MORTGAGE ANDMORTGAGELENDINGPreviousReference:CM(73) 40thConclusions,Minute 55. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Environment about mortgages andmortgage lending (CP(73) 93).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thathis memorandum recommended that, subject to a satisfactory response from the building societies, the Government shouldendorse the Memorandum of Agreement on Stabilisation which hadbeen prepared following discussion with the Council of theBuilding Societies Association (BSA); and that the preparation oflegislation giving appropriate reserve back-up powers should beput in hand.    As regards more immediate action, there did not seem to be grounds for shielding the generality of existing owner-occupiers from present interest rates.    There was, however, astrong case for selective assistance to first -time purchasers,and a possible scheme was described in Appendix D of his paper.Such a scheme could be based either on grants or loans.    Hispreference was for the latter.   It had until recently been envisaged that the cost would have to be met by the Government; but therewere now indications that the building societies might prefer toorganise and finance such a scheme themselves.    If so, thiswould be the preferable solution; no public expenditure would be involved;  legislation would not be necessary; and the arrange-ments could be brought into effect much more quickly.    Thebuilding societies would no doubt require an Exchequer guarantee;but this would cost little and should be provided.   As a thirdmeasure he proposed that no steps should be taken to restrictlending by local authorities to owner-occupiers, even though itwould shortly exceed the total sum for which provision had beenmade in 1973-74.    If no restrictions were imposed the excesslending during the year was likely to amount to about   13 0 million.Finally, the time seemed to have come for a radical review of some important longer-term issues, including the organisation of thebuilding societies themselves and the methods used for conductingtheir financial affairs, neither of which might now be suitable formodern needs.    A study should therefore be set on foot at once,with a view to an early report being made to the Cabinet.
In discussion it was argued that the proposed scheme for helpingfirst-time purchasers was unlikely to make a major impact.    the indications were that the number of houses started in 1974 might, if no action were taken, fall to about 150, 000, compared with some215, 000 this year.    The scheme might well fail to produce anysubstantial increase in this very low figure for 1974, and in that event the Governments reputation might be damaged by accusationsthat the action taken had been ineffective and half-hearted.    Asagainst this, it was argued that the scheme was on balance likelyto make a significant impact on the number of starts since, althoughit could not of itself remedy the present shortage of housing finance -in which no immediate improvement seemed likely in view of the unfavourable September investment figures - it would channel theavailable finance where it was most needed.    It would bring intothe market for houses a substantial number of first-time purchaserswho would otherwise have been excluded and thus foster confidenceamongst builders and moderate the decline in the number of housesstarted.    Such a scheme would moreover be a valuable element inthe package of proposals which the Government would be putting forward for Stage 3 of their counter-inflationary policies.    TheGovernment should if necessary be prepared to provide finaneefor the scheme, which should De based on loans rather -than on grants.    It would however be much preferable for thebuilding societies themselves to finance and run the scheme.It would then be possible to avoid the need for legislation, andthis was highly desirable, bearing in mind the political embarrassmentwhich would be caused by the amendments which would no doubt be moved to widen the scope of the scheme.    Moreoverj, it was important that the scheme should become effective quickly, and this would not bepossible if legislation were a prerequisite.In further discussion, it was argued that if the building societiesdeclined to finance the scheme even with an Exchequer guaranteeand it consequently became necessary for the Government themselvesto finance it, it might be preferable to provide in the legislation forthe scheme to come to an end after a fixed period - perhaps two orthree years - unless it were renewed by affirmative resolution.Changes might well become necessary in the light of changing circumstances, but it would be more difficult to make them ifthe legislation provided for the scheme to continue unchangedindefinitely unless specific action were taken to alter or discontinueit.    It was noted that a scheme on these lines would require significantpublic expenditure, and that offsetting savings would have to be sought.In subsequent discussion, there was general agreement that it wouldnot be practicable to restrict lending to house purchasers by localauthorities.    It was noted that early action might be needed toauthorise continued lending by the Greater London Council, whichhad already made leans up to the limit authorised by the Department
of the Environment for the year 1973-74.    Increased lending by localauthorities would significantly offset the shortage of private housing finance and, since it was restricted to priority categories, would bedirected where the need was greatest.    As regards the longer term,there was general agreement that a radical review of the organisationand financial methods of the building societies should be undertaken.The societies were highly conservative in their outlook and had so farset their faces against changes in methods which had been found desirable in foreign countries.    It was doubtful whether, as atpresent constituted, they were capable of meeting contemporaryneeds, and it was important that in the course of discussion aboutshort-term measures no assurances would be given which would preclude the Government from seeking radical changes in the longer term,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in the light of the present shortage of housing finance, the danger of a serious decline in house building and thepolitical difficulties caused by the increase in the mortgage rates to 11 per cent, measures must be taken on the lines proposed by theSecretary of State for the Environment,    The Memorandum ofAgreement on Stabilisation should be put into effect as soon aspossible, and the preparation of legislation conferring back-upreserve powers should be pressed forward.    The provision of help foi first-time purchasers was a matter of urgency.    It shouldtake the form of interest-reducing loans, and the arrangements should if possible be financed and run by the building societies themselves.An Exchequer guarantee should be made available to the building societies if they sought one.    If in the end the building societiesproved unwilling or unable to finance a loans scheme themselves,Government moneys should be made available.    The government&apos;s decision on stabilisation and on help for first-time purchasersshould be announced in the forthcoming White Paper on Stage 3of counter-inflationary policies, a draft of which was due to beconsidered by the Cabinet on the following Thursday.    before then, there should be urgent consultations with the BSA in orderto discover how far their leaders were prepared to go in undertaking to recommend to their members an interest-reducing scheme for first-time purchasers financed and run by the building societiesthemselves.    The precise terms of the passage in the White paper would depend on the outcome of these consultations.    The cabinet also agreed that restrictions should not be imposed on lending toowner-occupiers by local authorities and noted that the public expenditure provision made for 1973-74 was likely to be exceededby  130 million.    It would be presentation ally desirable to lay stress on the extent to which public expenditure was thus being used to make good the current shortage of housing finance in the private sector.As regards the longer term, a study should be arranged on the
general lines which had been proposed.    It should cover all aspectsof private sector housing finance and should not shrink from makingradical proposals involving, for example, major changes in the structure of the building societies and in their financial methods.Its findings should be reported to the Cabinet at an early date.The Cabinet -l. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2,        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer:-a. In the light of early consultations withthe building societies on the lines indicated inthe summing up to prepare a suitable passagefor inclusion in the draft &quot;White Paper on Stage 3of counter-inflationary policies.b. Subject to the response of the building societies Association to the Memorandum ofAgreement on Stabilisation, to arrange forthe preparation of the necessary back-uplegislation.cfl To arrange for a radical study of the longer-term problems of private sector housing finance and to report the conclusions to the Cabinet by the end of the year.Cabinet Office2 October 1973
