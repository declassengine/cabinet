1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat in the Israeli General Election the Labour Party had lost some ground to the right wing Likud Party, and although it remained thelargest Party and would be able to form a coalition, the outcome of the Election was likely to increase the difficulty of reaching a peace settlement between Israel and her neighbours.    But reportsof the negotiations taking place in Geneva suggested that there were good prospects of achieving a measure of disengagement between theEgyptian and Israeli armies.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.THE HOME SECRETARY informed the Cabinet of the detention of anumber of Palestinian Arabs, a young American woman, a Moroccanand a Pakistani.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion is recorded separately;^
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr Thomas Niedermayer,the German Manager of the Grundig factory in Belfast who was alsothe Honorary German Consul, had been abducted from his home on28 December.      The reasons for the abduction were not clear.There were certain complications in Mr Niedermayer&apos;s privatelife and there could have been personal reasons for his abduction;his policy of employing both Catholics and Protestants in hisfactory had led to some resentment and this might have been the explanation; or he might have been taken as a hostage by theProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).    It was thelast possibility to which he and a number of his colleagues had addressed themselves soon after the abduction had taken place,and they had decided that they would not agree to meet any demandsthat might be put forward by the IRA as a condition ofMr Niedermayer&apos;s safety.    On 30 December he had been approached by an intermediary, used by the IRA, with the demand that the terrorists sentenced at the Winchester trial should be allowed totransfer to prisons in Northern Ireland if they wished to do so.In return for this Mr Niedermayer would be released; if thedemand was rejected he would be shot.    The intermediary was informed that the proposal was not acceptable.    The last contactthrough the intermediary had been on 31 December, since when there had been no further information about Mr Niedermayer.These contacts had not been made public and should be treated asstrictly confidential.    He had received several communications from the Federal German Government, including a personal message from the Chancellor, Herr Brandt.    The position of theWest German Government was that the safety of an abducted personmust be the overriding consideration, and that such concessionsas weare necessary to ensure Mr Niedermayer&apos;s safety should bemade.    We had not accepted this.    We had said that we would raise no objection if the Germans wished to make a public pleafor the release of Mr Niedermayer, but that we would see objectionto the payment of ransom, which would almost certainly be illegalin the United Kingdom, and would provide the IRA with the meansof acquiring arms with which to pursue their policy of violence.The Prime Minister recognised that this abduction must increasethe anxiety felt by the members of the Northern Ireland executive and other prominent persons, about the dangers of kidnapping orassassination.    He felt it was essential, however, to refuse tomake concessions to kidnappers:  to do so would expose prominentfigures to even greater danger.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the Northern Ireland Executive had entered into office on1 January.    They had made a good start and so far they were working well together.    There was to be a further meeting ofthe Unionist Council on 4 January when Mr Faulkner&apos;s leadership of the Unionist Party would again come under challenge.    the vote was expected to be close.    If he was defeated in the Council,Mr Faulkner intended to call a meeting of the Unionist StandingCommittee, which had formal responsibility for appointing the leader of the Party, and/in which he considered that his chances of success would be greater.    If he was defeated in the StandingCommittee, it was his present intention to form his own Party,and he believed that in those circumstances he would attract alarge measure of public support.    The previous day the Gardahad detained a number of suspected members of the IrishProvisional Army in the border area.    Their intention to do sohad been public knowledge in Northern Ireland for the past two days and it was assumed that the timing of this action was designedto strengthen Mr Faulkner&apos;s position at his meeting with theUnionist Council.    A similar purpose might be served by themeeting which was taking place that day in Belfast between theChief Constable and the Head of the Garda.There were indications that some members of the NorthernIreland Executive were thinking of making direct approaches to ministers in Whitehall, without going through the Northern IrelandOffice.    This practice could lead to difficulties if it becamegeneral and he hoped that his colleagues would let him know if they received direct approaches.    He recognised, however, that itmight be difficult, and was possibly undesirable, to take the line that members of the Executive responsible for transferred matters should have no direct dealings with Whitehall Departments, and hewould circulate to his colleagues a paper with suggestions on theprocedure to be followed.The Cabinet -2.      Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.
3. ;       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that the Minister responsible for Community Affairs in theFederal German Government (Herr Apel) was visiting London that day.He intended to explore with Herr Apel the possibilities forresolving the differences which had arisen Over the establishmentof a Regional Development Fund (RDF).    It was desirable to seek a reasonably early solution to this problem though it seemed unlikely that a decision could be reached at the special meetingof the Council of Ministers proposed for 7 January and it mightbe desirable to postpone the meeting.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat since the Cabinet&apos;s last meeting the Electrical PowerEngineers&apos; Association had settled their dispute within the Pay-Code.    This was a welcome achievement; and although theAssociation would wish their members&apos; position to be considered/,in the light of the Pay Board&apos;s forthcoming report on-relativitiesno commitment about this had been implied in reaching the settle -ment.    Other groups of workers in the public and private sectors of industry were reaching settlements within the terms of Stage 3,perhaps spurred by speculation that developments in the general economic situation might cause the Government to review the criteria on which Stage 3 had been based.    Settlements werebeing accepted by representatives of the London busmen, theLondon enclosed-dock workers, following the London riversideand Hull dockers; the National Health Service ancillary and thelocal-authority manual workers. In the water industry the unions had accepted an offer within the terms of Stage 3; the   Pay board had still to rule on their anomaly settlement.The industrial action by the Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) had no support from the LabourParty or the Trades Union Congress (TUC), and with the exceptionof certain commuter services in the South East, did not seem to command the wholehearted support of the men.    But although there was to be a further meeting that day with the british railways Board (BRB), there was no immediate sign of a settlement in sight, and the new President of the Association, who was adeclared Communist, must be expected to try to protract thedispute in support of the action by the mineworkers.The overtime ban by the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)was still the most critical and intractable dispute; the signs were that it would be a long haul.    The suggestion that the inclusion of&quot;waiting time&quot; within the working week might provide a means of accommodation had proved an untimely initiative on the part of the pay Board, and would not in any case produce enough extra moneyto induce the NUM to settle;  it would be objectionable to concedethis principle, and he hoped that the Pay Board would now ruleagainst it.    The NUM Executive was due to meet on 10 January.There was small chance that they would agree to ballot their members about strike action, still less that the outline of any settlement would have emerged by then:  members of the executive had been reported as demanding increases of between  3 and  5on the present offer, which would raise their total pay by 30 per centit had been suggested that they might privately be prepared toconsider an extra  2. 50, but even this was an inordinate increase.By February there might be more pressure on the Executive toreach a settlement, since the expiry of the present agreement atthe end of that month would mean that their members would other-wise be deprived of the extra money that they had already been5SECRET
offered.    No early end to the dispute could therefore be foreseen.This prospect raised considerable problems of tactical handlingand public presentation.    Although the issues in the disputewere emphasised by Ministers on all possible occasions, and appeared to command wide public support, pressure wouldnone the less develop for the Government to take the initiative in further talks, and apparent inactivity on their part would be criticised;  yet every such occasion renewed public expectationsof a settlement and increased disappointment when nothingemerged.    None the less he considered, subject to his Colleague&apos;views, that it would be right on balance for him to see theExecutive of the NUM before their meeting the following week.It must be expected that this would be&apos;unproductive, but this consideration should not deflect the Government from their duty to remind the Executive of the issues involved in the dispute and ofthe generous terms already proposed for a settlement.    It wouldalso enable him to resist the suggestion of the Chairman of theNational Coal Board (NCB) that the full Board should meet the NUMExecutive; in present circumstances this would be a dangerousinitiative, and the Chairman&apos;s known desire to seek every meansof accommodation with the union might weaken the Board&apos;position in the dispute.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat the initiaJ response of industry to the imposition of the three-day working week had been encouraging: firms had shown themselves anxious to comply with the emergency requirements,and their efforts to make the most of their allowance ofelectricity might well have a beneficial effect on productivity.But there would be some very difficult areas, in particular theshortage of steel, which might be aggravated if there were to be afurther drop in the production of coking coal.    An extendedperiod of short-time working would lead to wider economic difficulties: internationally, our world trading position could be seriously affected, particularly in competition with the UnitedStates, which was now beginning a strong export campaign; athome the difficulties suffered by individual firms, and the risk ofbusiness failures which would be indiscriminately ascribed to theeffect of the three-day week, might in the longer term have an adverse effect on public opinion.In discussion, it was noted that in a wider context a greater threat to national prosperity was posed by the recent increases in worldoil prices.    In announcing his economies in public expenditure,the Chancellor of the Exchequer had drawn attention to thepossibility that further measures might be necessary to meet this threat; but there was      need for caution in discussing the possible effect of oil prices on the balance of payments.    Even so theUnited Kingdom, which relied for only about half its energy
requirements on imported oil, would suffer less than several other major industrial nations; and in the longer term our reserves of North Sea oil would prove an asset of corresponding value.    Aqto the immediate crisis, it was suggested that more public emphasismight be placed on the shortage of steel and its implications for industry as a whole.    At the meeting of the National economic development Council on 21 December, the Trade union representatives had been surprised and concerned to learn thatthe British Steel Corporation were receiving only enough coal toallow output at 50 per cent of normal levels, and even less thanthat in the North East.    The public disclosure of these facts by theChairman of the British Steel Corporation might have a salutary effect on opinion.    In certain areas there was indeed a risk of serious unemployment; and the whole operation of the three-day week raised the question whether specific action should be taken tomeet the liabilities of firms and individuals; it was noted that theBuilding Societies had already announced that they were preparedto deal sympathetically with mortgage interest and repayments.In this connection there would be advantage in bringing home tothe public the comparatively limited extent to which the mine-workers and train drivers themselves were suffering as the resultof their industrial action.    The BRB had reported a loss ofrevenue amounting to  11.5 million in the last two weeks;passenger traffic was down by a third and freight by a quarter.It was not immediately apparent how the strict application of therUlebook could have the effect of stopping all services on particularlines; and it was much to be regretted that the BRB had never taken the opportunity to bring its rulebook up to date.    consideration might need to be given to the possibility of disciplining driverswho were unco-operative.In further discussion it was suggested that if the existing offer tothe mineworkers could not be substantially improved within theterms of the Pay Code, the key to a settlement must lie in thefuture restructuring of the industry.    The mineworkers1 leaders were well aware of this; and it was possible that in time a settle -ment could be made on this basis, though in present circumstances the NUM were not willing to contemplate it.    But even in thiscourse there were dangers: if a new structure were a condition ofa settlement, its negotiation would have to start immediately thesettlement was reached; and if expectations were raised too highat the outset, they would bring further difficulties in their train.The Government would therefore need to consi der carefully themain lines of a strategy for the industry before any negotiationsbegan.But the prospect of a protracted dispute must give rise to concern about the likely effect on public opinion, which was now braced tomeet the rigours of short-time working and reduced consumption of fuel, but which before long would look with increasing urgency to
the Government to achieve a settlement.    On these grounds theGovernment might seek to bring matters to a head, the more sosince the NUM and ASLEF were dominated by people whoseavowed intention was to disrupt the pay policy and destroy theGovernment, and who were unlikely to be diverted from their political aims unless they were convinced beyond all question that nthe Government&apos;s policies commanded public support.    Even nowit was not widely realised that the mineworkers&apos;.dispute could be ;settled without a ballot, and that the present pay agreement had still two months to run.    Although the Communist sympathies ofa number of the union leaders were widely known, the full extentof their ambitions was not generally understood.    Some of themore extreme leaders might with advantage be induced to appear on television; but apart from that it was suggested that theGovernment had a duty to warn the nation of the true nature of the threat, and there were strong grounds for an early and authbrita-tive statement to this effect.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatat the present time little more could be done about the negotiationswith ASLEF and the NUM.    The proposals about waiting time     ,were originally raised with the NCB by the President of the NUMand had been taken up subsequently by the Leader of the Opposition.The Pay Board on enquiry had at first advised that such proposals would be outside the provisions of the Pay Code, but&apos;had apparentlywavered since then.    This was unfortunate, since until the NUMknew that there was no more money to be found, they would lackthe inducement to resume normal working.    It was noticeable thatin both disputes criticism had not on the whole been directed againstthe Government;  and Mr &quot;Wedgwood Benn&apos;s recent attempts to do sohad only vindicated the prudence of the Government&apos;s actions.    Butthe closest possible watch should be kept on the situation, and hehad invited the Lord Privy Seal to keep a particularly close check on radio and television programmes.    No effort should be sparedto answer every charge and no opportunity should be lost to remind the public of the questions at issue.    Similarly, every effort mustbe made to keep in touch with other Trade Union leaders.    the implications of the dispute on the economic activity of the country,together with the effect of the increased oil prices, would require a major reassessment of many aspects of national life.    Therewere many detailed and difficult issues which the Governmentwould need to consider in the coming months.. ,     ,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.8
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Environment about the proposed landhoarding charge (CP(73) 96).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the Government had announced their intention to introduce a land hoarding charge in the White Paper on Housing Policy(Cmnd 5280) which had been issued in April 1973.    Since then,conditions had changed radically.    The steps which the Governmenthad taken to increase the supply of land for development had had asubstantial degree of success; land prices were stabilising andthere was no longer advantage in hoarding land with planning permission.    Moreover, decisions had now been reached on measures for dealing with excessive profits earned on land and property transactions: in particular, the Chancellor of theExchequer had announced in December 1973 his intention tointroduce legislation providing for gains in development value to be made liable to income tax and corporation tax and for firstlettings to be treated as disposals for the purposes of the capital gains tax.    He himself had announced the measures which were tobe taken for dealing with the problem of empty office blocks.Moreover, consultations with local authorities and other interested parties had shown that the land hoarding charge would involvecomplicated and burdensome administrative machinery, largely because of the need to provide for appeals and for a wide range of grounds calling for extension of the period after which failure to complete development would attract the charge.    Even then itwas doubtful how effective the arrangements would be.    In all thecircumstances he had concluded that the proposed land hoardingcharge should be abandoned and that no provision for it should beincluded in the Housing and Planning Bill, which was to be publishedshortly after Parliament reassembled.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that, in view of the changes in circum-stances which had occurred since the White Paper on housing policy was issued in April 1973, it would not now be desirable toproceed with the proposed land hoarding charge.    The minimum ofpublic attention should be drawn to this decision; but the reasons for it should be explained if necessary, and in that event emphasis should be laid on the range of measures which the Government hadtaken to increase the availability of land for development and tocontrol the earning of excessive profits on land and property trans -actions.    It could also be indicated that compulsory purchase^1powers were available for dealing with any suspected cases of landhoarding.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office3 January 1974 9
THE HOME SECRETARY said that in the last few days a number ofPalestinian Arabs, a young American woman, a Moroccan and aPakistani who were clearly involved in preparations for terroristactivity had been caught by the police and immigration authorities at London Airport.    Since there had been virtually no advanceintelligence this was an encouraging indication of the security measures in force at the airport.    Serious consideration hadbeen given to the advisability of bringing charges against theAmerican, in whose baggage had been found a number of pistolsand ammunition.    The outcome of a charge was, however, farfrom certain.    In the view of the police it might be difficult to prove that she knew that she was carrying the weapons.    The right course therefore would probably be to return her to the United States.In discussion it was pointed out that the Press were suggesting thatcharges were not being made because we feared reprisals from Arabterrorists: but this was a marginal factor which had weight only because the woman was no more than a minor figure.    On the otherhand it was argued that the proper processes should be seen to befollowed and that a charge should be made if the evidence justifiedthis,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Home Secretary in consideringthe question of deportation would wish to bear in mind the points made in discussion. iiThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 sstatement.Cabinet OfficeFOREIGNAFFAIRSArabTerrorism7 January 1974COPY NO j/4CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(74) 1st Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 3 January 1974 at 11. 00 am j,
