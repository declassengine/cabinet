parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.PUBLICPRESENTATIONOF GOVERNMENTPOLICIESPublic services in London2. The Cabinet were informed that considerable attention was being attracted by the problems being encountered in providing public services in London - transport and educationwere particularly in the public eye - owing to staffingdifficulties.    There was little prospect that the situation would improve in the near future.    Pay was not the only source of trouble - housing appeared to be equally important - but it wasdisturbing that the Pay Board S report on London allowanceswas not expected to be ready until June 1974.    It would bedifficult for the Government to defend so long a delay in the face of a continuing deterioration in the public services in London;THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat he had recently received a report on the London situationbased on a study he had commissioned: and he would arrangefor the Ministers concerned to meet to consider this.    no immediate solution however was in prospect.    The cabinet agreed that it would not be appropriate to seek to amend thePrice and Pay Code, which was to be debated in the House ofCommons on the following Wednesday, so as to enable Londonallowances to be increased by greater amounts than werepermissible under present arrangements.    Moreover, it wouldbe undesirable, owing to the danger of repercussions elsewhere,to depart from the principle that the sole ground justifyinghigher levels of pay in London was the higher cost involved in living there.    The Secretary of State for Employment should,however, at once arrange to see the Chairman of the Pay board in order to urge on him the need for the speediest possiblecompletion of the Board&apos;s report on London allowances, whichshould, if possible be in the Governments hands at a much earlier date than was at present envisaged.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.
Higher The Cabinet were informed that it had become clear that even underSalaries the provisions of the new Price and Pay Code it would in certaincircumstances be possible for individuals, in particular thosesubject to profit-sharing arrangements, to secure kicsrsseses in annual earnings which would exceed the previous year&apos;s earningsby substantially more than the normal maximum of  350.    Ithowever would be undesirable and unjust to ban profit-sharingarrangements, which applied, for example, to many trawlerskippers and crew.    If individual instances of large increases came to public notice, it was important that a clear explanation should begiven of the safeguards which were now provided in the Code andof the overall fairness of the new provisions.The Cabinet -2.     Took note.
&quot;OREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(73) 50thConclusions,Minute 33. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the ceasefire in the Middle East was being maintained.    Butthe situation remained precarious.    Some supplies of food and water were being got through to the encircled Egyptian Third Army,with the help of the United Nationsl Emergency Force; but the Israelies were limiting the scale of relief and President Sadat ofEgypt, who was under considerable pressure at home, had threatened to renew the fighting unless the situation improved and unless the Israelies returned to the positions they had occupied when the cease-fire was declared on 22 October.    It was doubtful whetherPresident Sadat would fulfil this threat;  since if he did so hewould probably suffer defeat at the hands of the IsraeH forces,but the fact that he had made it was a measure of his difficulties.The Governments of the Soviet Union and the United Statesappeared to favour our suggestion that the next step should be an exchange of prisoners of war, the removal of the Egyptian blockade of Bab el Mandab and the lifting of restrictions on the passage ofsupplies to the Egyptian Third Army, but it remained uncertain whether they would be able to persuade Egypt and Israel to take this step.Relations between Europe and the United States, and between ourselves and the Americans, were going through a difficult period.The United States Administration were showing signs of badlyfrayed nerves, and they had been hitting out at their allies.    Theyhad complained publicly that we had rejected, on 12 October, asuggestion that we should sponsor a resolution in the Security Councilcalling for a ceasefire, although the American Secretary of State,Dr. Kissinger, had subsequently acknowledged that we had been right in saying that such a resolution would have failed since, at thattime, the Egyptians would not have agreed to it.    The American secretary of Defense, Mr Schlesinger, had made a particularlystrong criticism of the European allies, and the Secretary of Statefor Defence could reasonably take a fairly blunt i&amp;sss withMr Schlesinger whom he would be meeting in the course of the nextfew days.    The decision by the Americans to put their armed forces on alert on 25 October was understandable, on the evidence of possible Russian intentions available to us: but the Americans shouldhave given us better notice.    The French Government were particularly critical of American behaviour and President Pompidouhad now proposed an early summit meeting of the members of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.).    This move was notnecessarily helpful in the Middle East context.In discussion it was suggested that the decision of a number of oilproducing countries, not including Saudi Arabia, to withholdsupplies of oil to the Netherlands in retaliation for the Dutchattitude towards the Middle East conflict would present theCommunity with difficult problems.    Although the machinery forsharing available supplies of oil was established under the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, theDutch were claiming that there was a moral obligation on theirpartners in the e.c. to come to their help in the Community-context.    The Germans might well support them in this claim.We and France were the countries most vulnerable to demands for help, but if we were to send supplies to the Ditch some of the oil producing countries might well cut back their supplies to us.It was further noted that despite the remarks which the PrimeMinister had made on the first day of the Debate on the Address,public criticism continued to be confused about the oil supply position and to be critical of the Governments allegedreluctance to take measures to conserve oil supplies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that our main objective with the Americans was to persuade them to exertpressure on Israel to agree to measures which would lower the temperature in the Middle East and move towards the fulfilment of the United Nations Resolutions.    Unless the Arabs sawprogress in that direction the threat to European o5.1 supplies would become critical.    The problem of oil supplier including theproblem posed by the position of the Netherlands, would bediscussed further when the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy met the following day.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 50thConclusions,Minute 44. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the previous day three of the leading members of theProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army had escaped byhelicopter from the Mount joy Prison in Dublin.    This was unfortunate.    Arrangements at the Maze Prison in Belfast, andthe presence of Army units, should be sufficient to frustrate any similar attempt there, but instructions would be givento ensure that all possible precautions should be taken.Talks with representatives of the Unionist Party, the SocialDemocratic and Labour Party (SDLP) and the Alliance Party,directed towards the formation of an Executive, had run into some difficulty the previous day when the SDLP and the Unionistrepresentatives had taken up entrenched and opposing positions on the question whether there should bc^tripartite conference inadvance of the formation of an Executive.    It seemed possiblethat the Irish Government were exercising an unhelpful influence on the SDLP.    The Irish Minister of External Affairs,Dr Fitzgerald, had once again visited Northern Ireland without prior consultation with us, and had taken part in a broadcastprogramme and held talks with SDLP backbenchers.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that ourCharge d&apos;Affaires in Dublin had, on instructions, expressed serious concern at Dr Fitzgerald1 s practice of making such &quot;isits without giving us due warning of his intentions and had asked for writtenconfirmation that in the interests of security and as a matter ofcourtesy, Dr Fitzgerald would in future let us know in good timewhen he wished to pay a visit to Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note of the statemem^by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland^the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.5ft
EUROPEAN 5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERCOMMUNITY said the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 5 - 6 NovemberAFFAIRS would discuss development questions and other important issues.    The Council of Ministers (Finance) would meet on9 November to consider the Community&apos;s conjunctural programme and work on the move to the second stage of Economic and monetary Union,M. Cheysson, the Commissioner responsible for Budgets andFinancial Control and for Development Policy had visited london on 29 October for talks with Ministers.    M Cheysson was an able and constructive Commissioner and was well disposed towardsthe United Kingdom.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster6
6. THE PARLIAMENTARY UNDER-SECRETARY OF STATEFOR HOME AFFAIRS AND AGRICULTURE, SCOTTISH OFFICE,said that the Servicemen who had replaced the firemen in Glasgowwere providing a good service although there had been sometechnical problems.    Morale among the servicemen remainedhigh.    There had, however, unfortunately been some reductionin the number of fire officers reporting for duty, which was increasing the difficulties.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland were due to meet representatives of the Fire BrigadesUnion (FBU) on 5 November to resume the national negotiations onfiremen&apos;s pay, against the background of the risk of the action in glasgow spreading to London and elsewhere.    Efforts were beingmade to persuade the National Joint Council not to implement the pay agreement under the Stage 2 Pay Code already approved, butto negotiate a new agreement to have effect from the start of stage ?, which would be more favourable.    A further difficulty was that the Cunningham report on firemen&apos;s pay and conditionsof service had recommended that the firemen&apos;s hours should bereduced from 56 hours to 48; this would appear to the public areasonable reduction in long hours, but there was no presentprospect of implementing tne recommendation, even under the stage 3 Pay Code.    Consideration was being given to the extentto which it could be met within the terms of the Code; the leadersof the FBU, who were very anxious to reach a settlement of thedispute, attached considerable importance to this aspect.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat it would be important to construct an offer to the firemenwhich would be as generous as possible, consistent with the pay code; but it would also be necessary to ensure that the impression was not crea-ted publicly that the Government had acquiesced in any breach of the Code under pressure from the strikers.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discuseioa, by the Prime Minister.2.    Invited the Home Secretary, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Secretary of State for employment to be guided accordingly.7INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSFire service in GlasgowPreviousReference:CM(73) 50thConclusions,Minute 6
The CoalJlndusfc ryPreviousReference:CM(73) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that thePresident of the National Union of Mine-workers (NUM) appearedto have mishandled the miners&apos; pay negotiations and there was now no longer the prospect of an early ballot, which would havebeen unlikely to have given the necessary majority for industrial action.    A national overtime ban was now proposed, from a date to be settled by the National Executive of the NUM, unless theNational Coal Board (NCB) offered an improvement in the basicweekly rate, over and above the increase permitted under the stage 3 Pay Code.   The proposed ban, which would cover safety and maintenance workers, and would be likely to have nearly assevere effects as a full strike, might start as early as   theweek commencing 12 November.    The NCB&apos;s tactics would be tokeep the union negotiating as long as possible in the hope that a ballot would be held nearer the date when the negotiations were due to be completed, or in any event after the December meetingof the Executive.In discussion general concern was expressed about the risk thatthe negotiations would lead to a confrontation between theGovernment and the miners, which the General Secretary of the num appeared to be seeking.    It was suggested that in thesecircumstances it was essential that all possible steps should betaken both to persuade the miners that the increases available tothem under Stage 3 were substantial ones which did much to restore the;.r previous pay levels, and to point out to them the gravity of thecourse they were following.    The Governments policy on this occasion would be backed by legislation and the NCB would not havethe flexibility to increase their offer beyond the limits in the pay code.    Nor could the Government acquiesce in a breach in the, Code.The need to avoid a confrontation was particularly important inview of the likelihood that there would be a shortage of oil duringthe coming winter, which would limit the alternative measureswhich the Government might on this occasion take in the event of aminers&apos; strike.    Although it would not be easy to influence opinionamongst the miners, who constituted a closed community, someimpact might be made through television, the popular Press, andin particular, &quot;Coal News&quot;.    Speeches by Ministers in the regionsconcerned could also help.    The importance of such steps was emphasised by the recent unfavourable reaction of the popular iPress towards the difficulties created for the Government by the oil crisis.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theHome Secretary and the Lord President of the Council shouldinitiate a publicity campaign, with particular reference totelevision, the Dally Mirror, the Sun, and Coal News.    Thisshould seek to demonstrate the value of the offer made to theminers but avoid any comparison with the Wilberforce award inFebruary 1972; and should emphasise that the Pay Code wouldnot permit any increase in the offer. He himself would meet theeditors of both the Daily Mirror and the Sun.

Invited the Home Secretary and the Lord Presidentof the Council to initiate a publicity campaignaccordingly.TIso ElecteicitySupply IndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that members of the Electrical Power Engineers Association (EPEA)had that morning begun their threatened ban on standby dutiesover the Electricity Councils inability under the Pay Code to payin full the amount provided for in the 1972 standby agreement.The effects of the ban were difficult to assess in advance, since they would depend upon individual decisions made by the men asto the work which should still be done outside normal hours.They had undertaken to deal with cases where safety of life orequipment was involved but there was a risk that areas served by equipment which broke down could be without power for up to awhole tposfeead.   There were some signs that the EPEA were anxious to find a way out of the situation and consideration wasbeing given to whether the provisions under the Pay Codedealing with unsocial hours could provide any help.    The time didnot, however, seem appropriate for an intervention by Ministers.In discussion concern was expressed that the EPEA might have a genuine cause for resentment against the Government, since theyhad behaved very responsibly during the strike by the manual workers in the electricity industry two years previously, and had then received an assurance that their own claims would beconsidered sympathetically.    On the other hand, the EPEA hadto some extent only themselves to blame in that they had refusedthe offer of a partial settlement immediately before the intro-duction of the pay standstill.    If an early settlement of the disputedid not prove possible, consideration should perhaps be given tothe use of the legal provision which made breaches of contract a criminal offence in circumstances where there was a danger tolife.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that every effort should be made to reach a settlement of the disputeon the basis of an offer which was as generows as possible,consistent with the terms of the Pay Code.
Engineering THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that industry branches of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering &quot;Workers(A.UEW) proposed to hold a one-day protest strike on 5 Novemberagainst the fine imposed on the Union by the National industrial relations Court.    It was expected that about half a million men would be on strike.    One result might be that there would be nonational newspapers on that day.    It did not appear that the AUEWwas taking the opportunity to broaden the strike into an attack onthe Governments pay and industrial relations policies.The Cabinet -7.    Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Employment.105. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6.    Invited the Secretary of State for Tradeand Industry and the Secretary of State for employment to be guided accordingly.
7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the distribution of rate support grant.    They had before them memoranda by theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP(73) 106, 117 and 118),the Minister for Local Government and Development (CP(73) 120)and the Central Policy Review Staff (CP(73) 121).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe essential issue before the Cabinet was to weigh the need togive more support to urban areas against imposing undue burdens on ratepayers in areas traditionally favourable to the Government.He had considerably modified his proposals to meet the views expressed by his colleagues, and he reminded the Cabinet that he now proposed to set the resources element of grant at 27^- per centinstead of 25 per cent; to introduce a weighting factor for the SouthEast, which in the case of London would take the form of a5 per cent differential; and to raise the present domestic element of grant from 6p to lOp, with a variable element for areas whererates would otherwise go up because of loss of grant or the effects of the reorganisation of water and sewerage.    The interests of theGovernments counter-inflationary policies demanded that thetotal amount of grant be held down; and under this constraintsome ratepayers were bound to lose grant if others were to gain.But the measures he now proposed would much reduce the disparityin rate burden between different areas, and together with his proposals for extending rate rebates would provide a large measure of protection to domestic ratepayers.In discussion it was noted that the reorganisation of localgovernment made inevitable some change in the distribution of grant if damaging anomalies were not to occur.   But for this there might well have been advantage in leaving the existing arrangements to run for a further year, despite the Governmentscommitment to increased support for urban areas.    But althoughthe formula now proposed altered the balance in favour of theSouth East, it seemed to do so largely at the expense of areasin the West Midlands which were of no less concern to theGovernment.    Moreover, considerable uncertainty must remainabout the real effect of the Secretary of StateS proposals, since it appeared that between many of the existing and the new localgovernment areas there was no clear basis of comparison.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet found difficulty in weighing the merits of the differentproposals made on this complicated question.    He would considerTsfcether they could best be further examined in detail by a smaller group which could v&amp;poxt  their conclusions to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet office    November 1973 11RATE SUPPORTGRANTPreviousReference:CM(73) 51stConclusions,Minute 2
