parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.Industrial andEconomicSituationThe proposal to devote two days to a debate on the industrial and economic situation was in response to strong pressure fromthe Opposition, who would be providing one of the days fromtheir quota of Supply/Days.    They would be deciding towardsthe beginning of the week whether to put down a Motion, whichcould amount to a Motion of Censure.    It would be open to theGovernment, at the cost of provoking strong protests from theOpposition, to decline to provide a second day fOr the debate;but on balance this course seemed undesirable, bearing in mind that the Government did not wish to give1 the impression of seeking to avoid full discussion, that the Opposition might wellfind themselves in a difficult tactical situation at the time ofthe debate and that it might not be easy to find other business of comparable importance to occupy the second day.Housing and planning BillIt was noted that the Opposition were concerned about the implications for Wales of the Housing and Planning Bill, theSecond Reading of which was to be taken on Tuesday, and thatMr George Thomas would be winding up the debate for them.It was at present intended that the speakers for the Governmentshould be the Minister for Housing and Construction and theSecretary of State for the Environment; and consideration wouldbe given to the best method of catering for Welsh interests.It did not seem appropriate for the Secretary of State for wales to wind up the debate for the Government;    but other possibilities could be examined, including the offer of a fairlyearly day for a debate on Welsh local government affairs.1
2. THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said tliat there had been considerableviolence in Grenada, but the present situation was somewhatcalmer.    Some efforts Were being made locally to mediate ./between the Prime Minister, Mr Gairy, and the opposition.The Government of Grenada had no funds with which to pay thepolice and other public servants and since their failure to do so would be likely to increase tension and diminish their ability tomaintain law and order, we were considering the possibility ofproviding funds to enable them to. meet their immediateobligations.    It was our intention that Grenada should become independent on 7 February, as planned.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.1!2
3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) meeting on30 January had again discussed the proposed regional development Fund (RDF) but there had been no agreement, eventhough the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had signifiedthat the United Kingdom would now be willing to participate in preparing Community measures on energy.    The commission had, however, agreed to work out a compromise proposal andthis would be considered at a Council Meeting on 18 February.The Cabinet -1.      Took note of the statement by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said he thought it important that a Minister, from the Department of Energy should attend the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 4 and 5 Februaryfor discussions on energy matters and he would arrange tMswith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Ministerof State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office. MThe Cabinet -2,      Took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Energy.i.&quot; 1 &apos; ..... .v a-1 &quot; y -   .THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that there was a serious risk that Jamaica and other west indies sugar producers would decide to divert suppliescontracted to this country under the Commonwealth sugar agreement (CSA) to other markets to take advantage of thereigning high prices.    This could lead to a substantial short-fallin our supplies.    He was considering In consultation with other ministers concerned what action might be taken in the light ofthe requests from West Indies Governments for increased pricesunder the CSA.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussiqn, saidthat the developing Commonwealth countries had gainedsubstantial benefits over the years from this country through Jthe operation of the CSA and it was hard to justify a change iritheAgreement simply because the price relationships had changed.However, these countries were now suffering severe economic3
difficulties, largely as a result of increased oil prices.    It wasnecessary to consider our further response to the suggestions made by West Indies Governments taking account of the needs ofUnited Kingdom consumers and refiners and of the importantEEC implications.    The subject should be urgently examined inan appropriate Ministerial, Group. //The Cabinet - )j//   k   .   \&apos; :&quot;;Vr &apos;&apos;&apos;     - -/ 3.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up by the Prime Minister.
4.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatto judge from comments in the newspapers, the letters to the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry(CBI), discussed at their previous meeting, had clearly regained theinitiative for the Government.    The eventual outcome must dependon the TUC response.    Meanwhile the polling at the coalfields had begun.   In view of public anxiety about the voting procedures, hehad been in touch with the Headquarters of the National Union of mineworkers (NUM) and had received an absolute assurance thatthe procedures were fair and that the votes for and against strike action were put into the same box.    There had so far been nodifficulty about admitting television crews and newspaper reportersto the balloting, and no irregularities had been observed.   although some intimidation was inevitable, the militants probably had no intention of any systematic rigging of the results: they thought thatthey could win without it.    If a miners&apos; strike were called, the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF)would be unlikely to continue to deliver fuel to power stations andlorry drivers belonging to the Transport and General Workers union would probably take the same action; this would occur even if theminers did not picket the power stations,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said thata strike by the miners would be likely to reduce steel production toabout 30 per cent of its normal level in 7 weeks,! and that it would subsequently take many weeks to restore production.   Insolvenciesamong firms were likely to start increasing by the last two weeks of February, after which the number could rise rapidly.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the secretaries of State for Employment and for trade and Industry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the settlements reached in the last 10 days, which included importantagreements for gas and electricity workers, brought the total numberof workers that had settled within Stage 3 up to about 5 million.This figure could be quoted by Ministers to show that there was noconfrontation with the trades unions in general on Stage 3.  1 Manyengineering employees were how settling, and there could be moresettlements in some big firms such as Fords,   Apart from theminers this would leave the railwaymen as the only major groupthat had not achieved a settlement under Stage 3.    The position   Jamong the railway unions was as confused as ever.    Some members
of the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen(ASLEF) wanted to join the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR),which had not yet decided whether to admit their applications; thiswould be likely to exacerbate the bitterness between the unions.An attempted intervention by Mr Murray, the General Secretary ofthe TUC, had been unsuccessful and Sir Sidney Greene, the Secretaryof the NUR, had advised him that the TUC could do nothing further to help,    ASLEF had now called one-day strikes at weekly intervalsregion by region.    There seemed no prospect of reaching agreement at present through any meeting between the three tradeunions and the British Railways Board.    The ASLEF strike was notrelated to any pay claim or to the incomes policy.    The Governmentwas not involved in any way.    Ministers could justifiably draw attention in their public speeches to the absurdity of ASLEF&apos;position and to the economic damage that it was inflicting.    Theunion enjoyed little support among the public and its behaviour was an embarrassment to the Opposition.In discussion it was argued that the Governments powers under theIndustrial Relations Act to order a cooling-off period could not be invoked unless the National Industrial Relations Court could be shown that there was a chance of conciliation during the period;but it might be possible to use the Commission on industrial relations to recommend changes in the traditional negotiatingprocedures on the railways.    However, the Commission was notrecognised by the unions; and since the disruption on the railwayswas still confined to about 4, 000 militant members of ASLEF andmost fuel supplies to power stations were still going through withouthindrance, the Government must be careful not to risk losing these benefits by any action that might induce the other unions to join withASLEF against the Government,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that, although Ministers had so far refrained from makingpublic statements about the dispute, the time had come to speak outabout the damage that it was doing both to the country and to thefuture of the railways.    The possibility of making use of theCommission on Industrial Relations should be further examined.The Cabinet -2,        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.6
THE HOME SECRETARY said that he was about to send the PrimeMinister and certain other colleagues a note about picketing..   Hewas in continuous touch with the Chief Constables about contingency planning.    Two decisions had to be taken on which he would like tohave the Cabinefs opinion.   In the first place, should the attorney general make a public statement on the law about picketing?   Itmight be thought provocative to make such a statement during the miners ballot, but there could be advantage in making it later if astrike appeared certain.    Secondly, a draft pamphlet had beenprepared, setting out the law in detail to inform those who might be tempted to break it and those who had to enforce it.    Publicationhad been delayed to take account of a case that had gone to the Houseof Lords.    The question was whether the pamphlet should be issued at once, with the risk of losing some of its effect because of the impact of later events, or whether to keep it up-to-date and ready for publication at a more suitable time.It might turn out that the main trouble in 1974 would not be illegalpicketing or intimidation but the difficulty of persuading membersof other unions to cross lawful picket lines.    This would depend onthe extent of agreement reached between the NUM and other unions.The case then moved into the realm of civil law.    Many employershad been over-cautious in dealing with such practices during the1972 strike, though some firms had issued legal injunctionssuccessfully.    The Industrial Relations Act had introduced newcivil remedies against unregistered trade unions and against somekinds of sympathetic action by registered unions.    It was important that employers should be fully informed about the civil remedies that were now available to them.In discussion it was argued that the period for which the country could endure a miners&apos; strike would depend greatly upon the effectiveness of picketing by the unions.    There was still a dangerof mass picketing and intimidation at power stations.    The issue ofa pamphlet might expose the Government to a charge^f attempting to dictate to the courts; but there would be no such objection to a speech by the Attorney General explaining the law.    As regards theuse of civil remedies the Government had a duty to inform all employers and particularly the nationalised industries of the remedies available to them.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the draft pamphlet on the law of picketing shouldbe kept up-to-date for possible issue at a more suitable time, butthat its contents should be used as a basis for a speech by the attorney General which could then be published.    The Secretaries ofState for Energy, the Home Department and Trade and Industry and
the Attorney General should consider urgently how best to informthe nationalised industries and other employers of the civil remedieavailable to them against unfair industrial practices that were notcriminal offences.The Cabinet - /3.        Took note, with approval, of the summing up of this part of their discussion by the PrimeMinister. / /4.        Invited the Secretaries of State for Energy,the Home Department and Trade and Industry andthe Attorney General to consider urgently how toinform employers of the civil remedies available,to them.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services about amendment of the law relating to payment of supplementary benefit for strikers1 families (CP(74) 7).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that, inview of recent developments in the industrial situation, it wasnecessary to decide whether early action should be taken to amend the law relating to payment of supplementary benefit for strikers&apos;families.    Three Bills had been prepared on a contingency basis.One, which provided for supplementary benefit to be assessed on thebasis of deeming strike pay to be available at the rate of  5 a week,would at once reduce the flow of cash-to strikers&apos; households.    Theother two provided for some or all of the supplementary benefit paidduring a strike to be treated as a loan which would have to be repaidsubsequently,   A further course of action was, however, open.    Inthe event of very widespread unemployment caused by an industrial dispute it might be necessary to make emergency arrangements forthe payment of social security benefits on a simplified basis; and aBill had been prepared on a contingency basis (though the alternativepossibility of using the Emergency Powers Act 1920 for the purpose was now being examined).   A clause might be included in such aBill - which would be brought into effect only in emergencyconditions - to discontinue the payment of supplementary benefit forstrikers1 families in whole or in part.    Of the three Bills described in CP(74) 7, only the first, which would produce an immediatereduction in the flow of cash into strikers&apos; households, was in his view worth considering as an immediate possibility.    It was,however, doubtful how effective it would be in shortening any strikeby the miners.    It would give rise to great bitterness and thus might serve only to prolong the dispute.    The principles underlying itmight be difficult to present persuasively; and it was uncertain whether it would achieve its basic objective of limiting the flow of cash, bearing in mind that substantial resources were thought to beheld by many of the local lodges of the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM) and to be available for relief of hardship, and t^iat statutory powers to relieve hardship were available to local authorities andmight well be used by some of them.In discussion, it was argued that two separate questions had to besettled.    First, was it desirable in principle to amend the law so asto move some of the burden of supporting strikers&apos; families away from the State and on to the trade -onions?   Secondly, if it were,would immediate legislation help or hinder a solution of the present industrial difficulties?   As regards the second question, it was argued that legislation at the moment was likely on balance to beharmful.    It would embitter the situation, anger the trade union movement as a whole and make the miners less rather than more  i[willing to end their industrial action. . The NUM probably held9
considerable local resources which could be used to relievehardship in the event of a prolonged strike.; and further help would if needed almost certainly be forthcoming from the trade union movement as a whole.    For these reasons, there were very strong arguments against all the possible courses described in CP(74) 7.However, if the situation were irieached where emergency arrangements had to be made for the payment of all social security benefits, there might be a case for having power to withhold benefit from strikers1 families; but this would primarily be to ensure thatpriority   was given to the sick, the old and those who had been thrown out of work through no fault of their own.   In this connectionthere was a good argument against setting up special centres fordealing with claims from strikers&apos; dependants.    This mightunintentionally result in priority being given to them rather than tothe more deserving categories. u-As regards the question of principle, it was argued that there were strong grounds for altering the present balance of power by seeking to ensure that the trade unions played their proper part, throughthe provision of strike pay, in relieving hardship suffered bystrikers and their families.    Such action should in the long runmake strikes more unattractive.    For this purpose, the second and third of the Bills described in CP(74) 7 also seemed worth considering, perhaps modified so as to provide for, the money to be recovered from the trade unions concerned rather than fromindividuals,    But it had to be accepted that recovery would presentconsiderable difficulties, which might indeed prove insuperable.    If,in operating such machinery, it became necessary to find a methodof distinguishing between justified and unjustified strikes, the answer might prove to lie in the provisions of the Industrial relations act,    Opinion amongst Government supporters in Parliamentstrongly favoured action to redress the balance on these general lines; but it was fairly widely accepted that legislation wasinadvisable in relation to the present dispute, and indeed that itshould probably not be undertaken until the Government had a specific mandate for it.    This would involve deferring action until after a General Election.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that legislation on the lines described in CP(74) 7would tend to hinder rather than to help a solution of the immediateindustrial difficulties and should therefore not be contemplated atpresent.    If, however, it subsequently became necessary to seeknew powers to make emergency arrangements for the payment of social   security benefits, whether by way of legislation or by way of regulations under the Emergency Powers Act 1920, it might be appropriate to include a provision enabling benefit to be withheld fromstrikers1 families.    This would be on the basis that it might not10
otherwise be possible to ensure the payment of benefit to the categories deserving higher priority.    The Secretary of State for social Services should arrange for a provision on these lines to be drafted.    It was desirable in principle that there should at an appropriate time be legislation ensuring that the trade unions boretheir proper share of the financial burden of relieving hardship    jjsuffered by strikers and their families; but the form of such legislation needed further consideration, and it was in any case    ypreferable that it should not be introduced until the Government had secured a mandate to do so/from the electorate.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the Prime 1Ministers summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Secretary of State for social services -i. to arrange for the drafting of aprovision on the withholding of benefit    //&apos;from strikers1 families on the lines indicated in the summing up;ii. to consult them further beforeintroducing any Ball or regulationsdealing with emergency arrangementsfor benefit payments.U      1111
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Environment about Home ownership and Housebuilding (CP(74) 6).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the current position in the private housing market was extremely alarming.    In order to finance an output of 200, 000,,new houses a year the building societies needed a net inflow of funds amounting to about  160 million a month.    At the moment the net inflow was virtually nil and the number of housescompleted in 1974 might well be only about 100, 000.    He had now had a further meeting with the &quot;Governor of the Bank ofEngland, who had advised mat there was in the immediate futureno prospect of attracting funds from the banks or other institutionsat rates which would be acceptable to the building societies.    Itthus seemed inevitable that acute mortgage rationing would continue for the next few months or so.    In the rather longer term, there were a number of possibilities, as indicated in thememorandum before the Cabinet; but the most promising one was the establishment of a Mortgage Corporation which wouldlend to the building societies, on the collateral of mortgages,funds raised from institutional investors.    The Governor wasexploring this possibility with the building societies, whose initialreactions, though cautious, had been encouraging.    But it wouldprobably take some months to get such a Corporation established and functioning;  and therefore no early improvement in thesituation was in prospect. 1  A contribution might perhaps be madeby the Housing Corporation, and he had had discussions with theChairman, Lord Goodman; but it was bound at best to be relatively small, and there might be a case for contemplatingGovernment help in providing finance for private housing, in theform of a loan or subsidy.    He would consider&quot;whether to pursue this further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet shared the Secretary of State&apos;s disquiet about a situation in which a severely reduced output of private housingmight later in the year be accompanied by unemployment in thebuilding industry.    The problem was one of a shortage of finance and all possible remedies should be explored energetically,including further help from the Housing Corporation and theprovision by occupational pensions funds of financial assistancewith house purchase for their existing or prospective pensioners.But the establishment of a Mortgage Corporation seemed the mosthopeful possibility, and the Secretary of State, in consultationwith the Paymaster General, should consider what could be done/to ensure that the most rapid possible progress was made.12
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the paymaster General, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office31 January 19744    ismmmmm13
