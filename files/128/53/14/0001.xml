PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.FOSUSJGN 2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the latestAFFAIRS developments in the Middle East.    Their discussion and theconclusions reached are recorded separately.Middle east previous reference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3IcelandPreviousReference:CM(73) 50thConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe prospects of reaching an agreement which would end the fisheries dispute were favourable.    One problem remained,namely to reach agreement on our right to amend the list oftrawlers which would fish off Iceland, so that replacementsmight be inserted for trawlers which for one reason or anotherhad to be removed from the list.    This matter might have to be covered in a separate and probably unpublished exchange of notes.    The attitude of the Communist members of the icelandic government, and of their Party, should become known that day.If they decided to oppose the agreement this might have implications-tions for the Icelandic Governments survival in its present form.The cabinet took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the most recent talks which he had held with therepresentatives of the Unionist Party, the Social Democratic andLabour Party (SDLP) and the Alliance Party, had gone reasonably well.    The three Parties had agreed in principle that thereshould be a Council of Ireland and there was a measure of agree-ment on how the Council should work.    Each Party had put forward a number of proposals in connection with the proposed Council,and they were now examining these proposals.    It might prove necessary to persuade Mr Faulkner and his supporters in theUnionist Party that there should be a Consultative Assemblyassociated with the Council.    The Unionist Party and the SDLPwere still in disagreement on the question whether a tripartiteconference, including the Irish Government, should precede orfollow the formation of an Executive, and he was giving furtherconsideration to the possibility of breaking this deadlock by arranging an informal exchange of views in which the IrishGovernment would participate.    He expected difficulties when the talks were resumed in the following week since they would then have to discuss the number of places on the Executive to be filled by each of the three Parties.    Later in the day he woulct bemeeting the Irish Minister for External Affairs, Dr FitspssrakLand he would try to make Dr FifcjGarfeM. wsd&amp;rgt&amp;jad ShatMr   FauLkner had little room for making further concessions tothe demands of the SDLP.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.2
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that although the meetings of the Council of ministers on 5 and 6 November had been dominated by the Middle Eastquestion the Council had been able to consider other normalbusiness.    The Development Co-operation Ministers meetingon 5 November had discussed Community policy towardsdevelopment aid but had failed to reach agreement.    TheCouncil of Foreign Ministers meeting on 6 November had discussthe generalised system of preferences (GSP) for the community to apply in 1974.    Agreement had been reached on a package of items which was broadly satisfactory to us subject to further discussion at official level of the detailed arrangements on foodstuffs.    There was also discussion of a Community offer of concessions for negotiations under Article XXIV(6) of the GATT.Although there was not final agreement on the content of theoffer a position was reached which was tenable in terms of theCommunity&apos;s relations with the USA.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.3
5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the ministerial Committee on Counter-Inflationary Measures had that morning considered the new national agreement on the pay and hours of firemen reached at a meeting of the National joint council (NJC) for Local Authorities&apos; Fire Brigades on 2 November.There were two main aspects of the agreement.    The first was animmediate pay increase which would give firemen up to anadditional &amp;8 a week, or about 18 per cent.    It would be for the pay Board to decide whether the proposed increase was within theterms of the Stage 3 Pay Code.    The second involved a reductionin the working week of firemen from 56 hours to 48 hours from11 November 1974, without loss of earnings, but In return for agreement by the men to make more effective use of their working hours.    This could be worth an additional 14 to 17 per cent,excluding the possible savings from greater efficiency and productivity.    Although the effective date of the reduction of hourswas more than 12 months hence, this part of the agreement was almost certainly outwith the Stage 3 Pay Code.    If theGovernment refused to endorse it there would almost certainly bea national strike of firemen;  on the other hand counter-inflationpolicy as a whole might be undermined if the Government appearedto give way, in the firpt major dispute under Stage 3, to militantpressure.    The Committee had been unable to reach agreement on the attitude which the Home Secretary should adopt on this point when he and the Secretary of State for Scotland met the NJC on thefollowing day.In discussion it was argued that firemente hours of work had long been a matter of contention, and they attached considerable importance to the implementation of the Cunningham report recommendation that hours should be reduced from 56 to 48 tocoincide with the local government re-organisation on 1 April 1974.The NJC had already agreed that the concession should be deferredby 7 months, which would take it outside the foreseen period of stage 3; but for the agreement to come into effect in November1974 the preparations, taking the form of additional training, there-manning of some services and the closure of some fire stations,which would require Home Office approval, would need to beginvery shortly.    It was therefore important that the Governmentshould be able, as a minimum, to announce that, withoutanticipating the provisions of any legislation on pay that might been forced in November 1974, they would work with the fireauthorities to ensure that urgent consideration was given to thepractical steps required to enable fire brigades in Great britain to work a 48 hour week from that date.    A statement along theselines might not be sufficient to satisfy the firemen, but, if it didnot, the Government would then be in a better position to counterpublic criticism.    If it was not possible to go this far in thestatement the men would have no assurance of when the recommended4
reduction in hours might take effect, and it was almost certainthat the leaders of the Fire Brigades Union, who had adopted a responsible attitude during the strike in Glasgow, would be unable to dissuade their members from a national strike.    Ifthis occurred the Union would be likely to have public sympathyon their side and the experience in Glasgow had shown that,although the Servicemen had provided a good service, theMinistry of Defence would be quite unable to provide enough mento replace the fire services in all the major eiti.es.    In thesecircumstances there seemed no point in the Governmentsprovoking a confrontation with the firemen which it could not hope to win.On the other hand, it was argued that the firemen were not in factseeking a reduction in hours but to be paid at a higher rate for thesame number of hours actual work, receiving for 48 hours thesame pay as they at present received  or 56, the other 8 hoursthen being paid for at higher overtime rates.    The commitment toa reduction in hours was in conflict with paragraph 175 of the pay Code, and it in any case seemed very unlikely that the paypolicy in force in November 1974 would make provision for sucha reduction, other than by counting the cost as part of the nextpay settlement.    And the argument that special consideration should be given to the fire services because of shortages of staff was one which could well be used by many other employees tobreach the code.    Thus, whilst it was right that the Governmentshould express sympathy with the objective of a reduction of hours in accordance with the Cunningham Report recommendation, thereshould be no commitment to implementing it in November 1974.Whatever the precise wording used to convey such a commitment,it would be interpreted by public opinion as a surrender to themilitancy shown by the Glasgow and London firemen and would therefore be regarded as a test case by the miners, the electrical Power Engineers Association and the Post office workers in support of their own efforts to improve their pay andconditions of service beyond the Pay Code.    Indeed, in the debate in the House of Commons on the previous day the NJC agreement was being hailed as a victory for the Glasgow firemen, who wereexpecting, in addition to the increases under the national agree-ment and the reduction in hours, to retain the  2. 48 offered tothem by the Glasgow Corporation.    The Government-*ssupporters were already expressing concern about the dangers to the pay and prices policy.    One possible compromise mightbe to refer to the objective of making progress towards theworking of a 48 hour week by November 1974.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, slimming up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their consideration of the firemen1 s pay-agreement later that day.    The Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Employment should, in the meantime,consider the matter further in the light of the discussion, andshould endeavour to put before the Cabinet an agreed statementof the Government&apos;s position.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Employment to prepare an agreed statement of the Governments position on firemenJspay for consideration later that day.Public services in LondonPreviousReference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hehad now met the Chairman of the Pay Board to urge on him theneed for early completion of the Board&apos;s report on Londonallowances.    The Chairman had agreed tc produce the report as quickly as he could, but it was clear that the Board would take some time over the study;  and they were unwilling to forecast the outcome.    Although it could be argued that improvements in London allowances should be concentrated on workers in thepublic services rather than making them generally availablethus adding to the economic pressures in the metropolis, thiswould be difficult to arrange particularly since many of theworkers in these services lived outside the areas where thestaff shortages existed.The CoalIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that,at the meeting between the National Coal Board (NCB) and theNational Union of Mineworkers (MUM) earlier that week, the NCBhad offered minimal increases in the basic rates, and improve-rnents in holiday pay and the proposed productivity arrangements.The President of the NUM was seeking to arrange furthermeetings with the NCB after the NUM Executive Committee had met that day.    The hope was that the moderate elements wouldprevail and that the Executive would conclude that they would beable to extract a more favourable settlement under the threat ofan overtime ban than by actually imposing such a ban.    The6c^MCmCMTIAI
iquestion of a commitment to a third week-&apos;s holiday, when the pay Code permitted, had also been raised again.    If the Executivedecided to impose the overtime ban this would increase themilitancy within the NUM and lessen the chances of a decisionagainst strike action in a national ballot.ElectricalSupplyIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the selective ban on standby duties by the Electrical Power EngineersAssociaticn was continuing;  and there seemed little prospectof a settlement of the dispute before the meeting of the joint negotiating Board on 20 November, when the annual pay claim bythe engineers was due to be discussed.    The Electricity Councilhoped that this would provide an opportunity for a compromisesettlement of the dispute.The MotorIndustryPreviousReference:CM(73) 43rdConclusions,Minute 4THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theelectricians&apos; dispute at Chryslers had been ended on the termsreconmtmended by the independent enquiry, the Pay Board havingagreed that the recommendation that the electricians be givenstaff status should be implemented in full.    Although there wasa risk that this might create difficulty in other groups of skilledcar workers the company did not expect this to happen.Production at Vauxhall Motors, Ellesmere Port plant, wherethe mass meeting of strikers had been postponed until Saturday,was still at a standstill.The Cabinet -3.

COPY NO   A&apos;ACABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cm(73) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 8 November 1973 at 10. 00 amFOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatpr*Emio&amp;ry reports on the discussions which had taken placein Cairo the previous day between President Sadat of Egypt andthe American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, indicated thatthey had agreed to seek an arrangement under which the road tothe Egyptian Third Army would be opened       under the super-vision of United Nations observers; an exchange of prisonerswould take place; and within 10 to 15 days a peace conference would begin.    Dr KissingerJs adviser, Mr Sisco, had taken theproposals to Israel.    Dr Kissinger appeared to think that thePrime Minister of Israel, Mrs Meir, would accept them, despite the fact that during her recent visit to Washington she had beenobdurate and no progress had been made with her.    It was intended that the peace conference should be attended by theSecretary General of the United Nations, Dr Waldheim, thecontestants, and the United States and the Soviet Union.    We hadlearnt from the Egyptians that they would prefer a somewhatlarger conference since they did not wish to have the Soviet Unionas their only adviser.    It would not be advisable, however, for us and the French to attempt at present to take part in the conference,although this possibility might arise at a later stage.    Americansupplies of war material to the Israelis, and Russian supplies tothe Egyptians, had fallen to a relatively low level.    By this timethe equipment lost by both sides had probably been replaced.Neither side was asking us to resume supplies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said thatthe meeting of the Council of Ministers of the European economic community (e.c.) which had been held in Brussels earlier in theweek had been dominated by consideration of the Arab/Israeldispute and its repercussions onEurope&apos;s supplies of oil.    Thestatement by the Foreign Ministers of the Nine, despite itscritical and indeed perverse reception by the media, represented a considerable achievement in Community solidarity as well as ahelpful contribution to the search for a settlement in the middle east.  The United Kingdom and France now had a firm Community
position on which to base their efforts to perstia.de the Arab states to moderate their embargo on oil supplies to Holland.    Although no signs had yet appeared of serious shortages of oil developing inEurope, the position was extremely uncertain.    Of the supply of oil normally reaching Holland, half was destined for re-export to west Germany and Belgium; and the Governments of these twocountries were much concerned at the possibility that if the interruption to Holland&apos;s supplies persisted, public opinion mightcompel the Dutch Government to ban exports.    But it appeared that the point of crisis might not be reached for about 10 days;and the Council of Ministers had agreed to take no decision thisweek on any proposal to share supplies.In discussion it was suggested that although renewed consideration should perhaps now be given to the sharing arrangements underthe Organisation for Economic    Co-operation and Development, theDutch Government had conceded privately that any attempt by theirEEC partners to divert supplies of crude oil to Rotterdam in defiance of the Arab embargo would be very dangerous; but for thetime being it would be advisable not to try and stop the normal flow of oil products between members of the Community.    Theopportunity should not however be lost of turning the Community1 ssolidarity on this issue to advantage by remonstrating with theArab states about the political use of the oil weapon against Europe.It had been reported that the producer states had been surprisedand gratified by the lack of any concerted response from consumergovernments to the recent price increases, and they should not beleft to assum3 that their action would go unchallenged.    On theother hand, it was remarked that both the Iranian and the saudi arabian Governments had made it clear in reply to our ownrepresentations that they saw these developments against a historyof exploitation of their resources by the Western nations.    Althoughthe position now reached by the e.c. provided a sound basis onwhich to develop a common approach to the oil producers, theprocess must take time.    Nor should it be forgotten that at least until the early 1980&apos;s, when supplies of oil from the North Seamight make us largely self sufficient, we like the rest of europe would continue to depend overwhelmingly on the Middle East; the capacity of practically every major producer was fully stretchedto meet current demands;  and the Arab states were in a positionnot merely to inconvenience us by compelling us to ration petrol and allocate supplies, but to paralyse industry, cause widespreaddamage to aur economy and massive unemployment.Against this background it was recognised that the extent of oue independence on supplies of oil from the Arab nations raiseddifficult questions for the public presentation of the governments policies.    Widespread credence was being given to a version ofevents which suggested that the Government had succumbed to
blackmail from the Arab oil producers to adopt an ignoble attitudewith regard to the Arab/Israel dispute, taking little account ofpublic sympathy for right^ael and concern for her survival.    Themedia, which appeared to be excessively open to Israeli influence,put only one side of the case and ignored the Governmentsconsistent endeavours, first expressed in the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s speech at Harrogate in October 1970,to persuade the Government of Israel that there could be nolasting settlement in the Middle East while they sought to protect their own frontiers by holding Arab territories through force ofarms.   But the Government had never advocated Israelsunconditional withdrawal from these territories without anyguarantee of Israels security.    It was suggested that theGovernments attitude to this question was not fully appreciatedeither by the Jewish community in this country or by public opinionat large; no effort should be spared to make it understood; and forthis purpose it would be valuable for members of the Cabinet to be fully bviefed on the issues, the facts and the considerations underlying the Governments policy.    It was further represented that althoughthe essential interests of Israels security must be supported, and her position as the victim of unrelenting Arab hostility and repeatedattacks since her foundation must comrtsaaaa e degree of sympathy,to support on that account every act of Israeli aggrandisement, oraccept uncritically their view of the situation, wotild do little goodto therr essential interests or our own.    It was much in their interests that there should be Western nations which could bringinfluence to bear on the Arabs.    There was however a large and active lobby at. work in this country to further the Israeli cause;and it was difficult for a balanced viewpoint to get a hearing.    Itwas important that the Jewish community and others shouldappreciate that public sympathy for Israel would evaporate rapidlyif intransigence on her part towards a peace settlement were tobring, through disruption of our oil supplies, serious damage to ourown economy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the latest developments in the Middle East,as well as the outcome of the meeting of the Council of ministers of the e.c..    Close watch was being maintained on our oil supplies, and the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategywould be reviewing the position later that day.    The intentions of the Arab producers were being ascertained, and there was close contact with the oil companies.    Contingency preparations to restrict consumption of oil in this country were almost complete:petrol rationing could be introduced     three weeks&apos; notice ifnecessary, and allocation could be made within a few days.    Onthe wider issues raised in the CabinetS discussion, concernhad been expressed that the Governments position, which hadbeen maintained consistently since 1970, was widely misunderstood,and misrepresented.    His colleagues would wish to use ovary
opportunity available to promote wider public appreciation of theGovernments policy and the considerations which underlay it.To this end it would be helpful if the Foreign and commonwealth secretary would circulate a note setting out the facts in detail and indicating for his colleagues the line that might be taken in public discussion.    The note should also give guidance on our own policy on arms supplies and on criticism that we had deniedfacilities to the United States in pursuance of their support forIsrael.    The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry shouldalso circulate a note on the position with regard to oil supplies,bringing out the extent of our dependence on Arab oil, the assurances we had received, and the precautionary measures inhand both in thi3 country and among other consumer countries.The Cabinet -I.      Took s&amp;1940, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.      Invited -jt.      the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs to circulate for their information a note of the Governments policy towards the Arab/Israel dispute;ii.       the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry to circulate a note about the positionof oil supplies, as indicated in the summing up.Cabinet Office8 November 19734
