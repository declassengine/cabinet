parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were informed that there might be difficulties inconnection with Thursday&apos;s debate on a Motion to take note of theSecond Report from the Select Committee on European SecondaryLegislation.    The Report had been unanimous and it would not be easy to secure Parliamentary agreement to any significantdeparture from its proposals.    One of the recommendations wasthat six days should be provided in each Session for debates on community matters.    It had been informally suggested to theOpposition that this should be accepted on the basis that three ofthe days should be provided by the Opposition from their Supplydays.    This suggestion would however only prove acceptable ifthe Government accepted in full all the other recommendations inthe Report.    This presented considerable difficulty because not all the proposals were in fact acceptable.    In particular, itwould be important not to provide anti-Marketeers withunnecessary opportunities for making difficulties, as, for example,would happen if a weekly slot were provided at Question Time toallow all Questions on Community matters - and not merely those now answered by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster - to betaken together as a block.    Further informal discussion wouldtake place with the Opposition and another report would be madeto the Cabinet if necessary.It had not yet been finally settled whether 28th January shouldbe a Supply day or whether it should be used for a debate on nuclear reactors on a Motion for the Adjournment. \\ On balance the latter seemed preferable.    If a debate on nuclear reactorswere deferred, it would be increasingly difficult to resist pressure to postpone it until after publication of the forthcoming report by the Select Committee on Science and Technology;   andthis in turn would delay the Government in reaching urgently needed decisions.1
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat we had accepted the invitation of the President of the UnitedStates, Mr Nixon, to attend a meeting of oil consuming countries to be held in Washington on 11 February.    All the member countries of the European Community would take part, and the Communityitself would be represented by the Federal German Minister,Herr Scheel, who was the current Chairman of the Council ofMinisters (Foreign Affairs), and the President of the Commission,M Ortoli.    It would be important that the meeting should addressitself as a matter of urgency to the acute difficulties facing manyof the developing countries such as Jamaica and other Caribbeanislands, who depended entirely on imported oil for fuel, and whoseeconomies were already under severe strain.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theAmerican Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger, who was in the middle east, had evidently encountered difficulty in his efforts to obtainEgyptian and Israeli agreement on a formula which would lead tothe separation of their armies.    It now seemed, however, that agreement might be reached in the fairly near future.    If so, thiswould be the right moment to lift our arms embargo and to permit the delivery of arms for which contracts had already been concluded.In the matter of new contracts, we would revert to the position which existed before the outbreak of the October war, and any proposals would have to be considered on their merits and in the light of theexisting situation.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,
3.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat at the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) Meeting on14/15 January there had been a further full discussion of theproposed Regional Development Fund (RDF) but no agreement onthe central question of the size of the Fund.    The Commission had proposed formulae under which the beneficiary countries includingthe United Kingdom would get the same net receipts from a smallFund as from a large one.    But this was not acceptable to someother countries whose rebeipts would be reduced;  and the majorityview was that a solution must be found on the lines of the originalCommission proposal.    The question was therefore whether theGerman Government would be able to accept a substantially largerFund than it had so far indicated; the issue was closely involved with internal German politics.In discussion it was argued that the Council Meeting had shown a clear acceptance by all member States that any compromise solution must accord to the beneficiary States the same netbenefits as the original Commission proposals.    It had been agreedthat there should be a further meeting of the Council on 30 Januarywhich might be preceded by a preparatory meeting at ministerial level; it was not yet clear whether the German Government wouldbe able by then to shift its ground sufficiently to make agreementpossible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theestablishment of an RDF on satisfactory terms remained a primeobjective.    We should continue to pursue this vigorously within theCommunity and for the time being maintain the link with thedevelopment of an internal Community Energy Policy.    TheCabinet noted that some other countries were maintaining similarlinks between progress on the RDF and areas of Community workof particular interest to them.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.&apos;  3
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that in his campaign to win Protestant support, Mr Faulknerhad reason to be pleased with the events of the past week.    He had held a successful meeting in Dublin with the Prime Minister of theIrish Republic, Mr Cos grave.    The Irish politician, Mr Kevin Boland,had been unsuccessful in his court action in Dublin where he had sought to prove that the Sunningdale agreement was in conflict withthe constitution of the Republic, and in particular that theSunningdale declaration that the Irish Government accepted that theconstitutional position of Northern Ireland could not be changedwithout the consent of the people of Northern Ireland was unconstitu-tional.The political struggle in Northern Ireland continued, and on theprevious day some of Mr Faulkner&apos;s leading1!opponents, includingDr Paisley and Mr Craig, had succeeded in mounting a formidablepublic demonstration including the manning of 50 road blocks and alarge meeting in Belfast.    They had declared their intention of holding a further mass demonstration on 22 January, in order toprevent members of the Assembly from entering Stormont to attendits next meeting.    Measures were being taken to frustrate this attempt.    A meeting of the Standing Committee of the unionist party was to be held the following week to choose a Leader of theParty in succession to Mr Faulkner.    The new Leader would presumably make an immediate attack on Mr Faulkner and hispolicies, and this might well force Mr Faulkner to resign from theParty and to form a new one;The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.
5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the levels of fuel stocks for power stations were now higher than hadbeen expected.    Because of warm weather and because of the satisfactory public response to Ministerial appeals for savings in domestic consumption, the coal stocks at power stations had declined in the previous week by only 200, 000 tons instead of500, 000 tons as expected.    It now seemed possible that the coalstocks by the end of March would still amount to 11 million tons.If it became necessary to; cut down on oil consumption, that figuremight be reduced to 10 million, and bad weather could cause a further reduction to 9 million tons, 8 million, of which would be held by theCentral Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) and 1 million by theNational Coal Board.    Though the figures so far were satisfactory,a number of uncertainties remained.    The industrial action by the associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF),which had not yet affected the transport of coal to power stations,could be intensified; so could the action by the National Union of mineworkers (NUM); and there was the possibility of industrial action by gas workers.    The weather would continue to be a majoruncertainty.    The stocks of fuel oil, which for four Weeks had remained steady at 49 days&apos; supply, were likely to begin to declinetowards the critical figure of 45 days.    Nevertheless there was room for cautious relaxation of the three-day week.    He recommended that,as an immediate step, more electricity should be made available forthe manufacture of steel.    At the same time he should consult the confederation of British Industry (CBI) about the possibility of further relaxation to be introduced in the following week.    The CEGB believedthat it would be possible to introduce four consecutive days ofelectricity consumption a week, and that this would give a betterspread of consumption during the week than the CBI proposal foroverlapping the two periods of three-day electricity use to avoidSaturday working.    The presentation of the easing of the restrictionsmight be difficult.    It would be necessary to rebut accusations of a sudden change in policy and to continue to appeal for domestic savings,which on 15 January had risen to 23 per cent.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that in theoryit would be possible for ASLEF to interrupt the transport of coal and oil by rail.    In practice ASLEF activities had produced no significant effort on the transport of oil and coal so far; their members had proved less militant than they had expected; and they might find itdifficult.Jo resume industrial action.    As regards the gas workers,the Pay Board was about to rule on their claim for anomaly treatment,and there was a good chance of a settlement that would be accepted.In discussion it was argued that the CBI believed whether rightly dxwrongly that its members were at present managing better than expected under the three-day week.    Any relaxation of therestrictions should take account of the dangers of further industrial
action, colder weather and further cuts in oil supplies.    one possible strategy for the NUM would be to wait until stocks had declined to the minimum and then call an all-out strike.    On theother hand it was argued that a four-day week would produce great benefit to the economy and should help to maintain overseasconfidence in the pound; the latest figures released by the Bankof England were alarming and there were daunting estimates of ,the balance of payments deficit for 1974.    The introduction of a four-day week might not be, however, the most effective relaxation.It would be possible to introduce greater flexibility into the system by concentrating on the needs of particular industries and makingexceptions in favour of those that were judged most essential.    Itwould be possible to extend the scheme already being applied tocontinuous-process industries and allow firms to consume a fixedpercentage of their normal supplies of electricity, starting with say65 per cent and increasing to 80 per cent;  such a system was said tobe difficult to enforce, but it had worked successfully in NorthernIreland,    Whatever arrangements were made should allow for thepossibility of Saturday working by those who were willing to do so.It would also be necessary to take account of the effects that different kinds of relaxation might have on the payment of social security benefits.   All these possibilities should be carefully discussed with the CBI.has regards presentation, it was argued that the change could be attributed to the unexpected good weather and the high level of domestic savings, which had made it possible for the CEGB to revise its advice to the Government.    The Government wouldhave to make its statement as soon as the fuel stocks were announced;it would not be possible to wait for the next stage in the ASLEF dispute.It would be better at first to avoid any mention of the possibility of a four-day week, since this would immediately receive headlinepublicity; they could say that the four-day week was an optionthat might be possible but could not be adopted on the strengthof one week&apos;s figures.    In order to avoid unnecessary controversy,it would be better not to make the announcement in Parliament,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Energy should make the announcement as soonas the fuel stocks were published.    Rather than refer to a &quot;relaxation&quot;which could give a false impression, he should say that the advice ofthe CEGB indicated that more supplies could be made available to industry.    This would make more electricity available for steelmaking; other possibilities were to be discussed with the CBI.If the Government were accused of a change of front, the answer was that common prudence had required them to plan for the wors4and it was possible to increase supplies when the worst did not occur.Relaxations in the three-day week should be discussed with the CBI assoon as possible and then explained to the Trades Union Congress.
One possibility would be to change from three-day working to four-day workingi others would be to introduce greater flexibility; to exempt some firms; or to allow firms to administer percentagecuts.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6.        The Cabinet considered the industrial dispute in the miningindustry.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Cabinet Office17 January 1974
CONFIDENTIAL annex cm(74) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 17 January 1974 at 10. 30 am the PRIME MINISTER said that after the last meeting of theCabinet he had invited the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to meet him.    They had talked about the meaning of the assurance that the tuc had offered.    He had suggested to them that their undertakingnot to quote any exceptional settlement with the National Union of mineworkers (NUM) in support of other settlements would not prevent other unions from seeking exceptional treatment on other grounds.    They admitted that this was so but said that they had no power to prevent it.    They were not asking the Government to allowStage 3 to be broken, and they hoped that the Government would not ask them to undertake that Stage 3 would be observed.    When hemet them again on Monday they had gone further and had undertakenthat the TUC itself would not press the Government to make special arrangements to meet any other claims.    When asked, however, toundertake that nc union would press for exceptional treatment theycould only say that in practice the present economic situation would keep wage awards below the Stage 3 levels.    He had then had aprivate talk with Sir Sidney Greene and Mr Murray about thepossibility of an approach by the TUC to the NUM, but afterconsultation with other members of their delegation they declined to make such an approach unless the Government could promise thatif they came back with a proposal for a settlement beyond Stage 3the Government would consider it.    They had used great ingenuityin trying to persuade the Government to agree that in some circumstances the NUM might be allowed a settlement beyond the stage 3 limits.    They agreed that it would be wrong to give carteblanche &quot;to the NUM.    They said they would support only a &quot;reason-able settlement&quot; but could not define what would be reasonable.The meeting ended without agreement: and on the assumption thatthe TUC representatives would meet the Government again if theresults of their conference on Wednesday suggested that such ameeting would be worthwhile.1INDUSTRIALAFFAIRSThe Miners1DisputePreviousReference:CM(74) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6COPY NO       V .\CABINET /t
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that atthe special conference of the TUC held the previous day,Mr Murray had gone on record with a number of statements that hehad previously made in private to Ministers.    He had asked theconference to agree that the miners were a unique case; that theydeserved exceptional treatment this year only; and that the TUCshould not support any other claims for exceptional treatment.Unfortunately, in seeking agreement to these helpful propositionshe had found it necessary to offer the support of the TUC for theminers&apos; case, and this part of his speech had received the mostpublicity.    Few spoke against him and the upshot was that the assurance given by the TUC to the Government was supported bythe conference with only 3 votes against.    A resolution that hadbeen proposed in favour of protests and demonstrations againstthe 3-day week was left undiscussed.    The readiness of the unions to support the TUC formula could be seen either as an advance or as a demonstration of its lack of content.    The Government must now decide whether to meet the TUC again.    The most that the TUCcould conceivably be persuaded to offer would be an undertakingalong the following lines:i.     They accepted the miners as a distinctive andexceptional case this year for whom some reasonable and limited addition to the current offer would be justified:the addition would be confined to those working underground.ii.     The TUC would require all other member unions to refrain from seeking, or using industrial power to press for, special treatment during the current pay round.iii.    If any member union sought to do so, the TUC woulddissociate themselves from the action by the unionconcerned.If the TUC gave an undertaking on these lines, isolating the case ofthe miners, it must be recognised that the consequence would be asettlement for the miners beyond the Stage 3 limits.    Alternativelythe Government could deliberately put an end to the TUC initiative -for example by asking them to undertake to denounce any otherII -union which took industrial action, or to give some undertaking torecognise Stage 3.    The proposal that had recently been produced by Mr Roy Mason was only a variant of the earlier proposal to take account of waiting time, and he did not think that it would help.The time might come when offers of increased pensions or special provision for health could be helpful; and other offers might bepossible which were not technically in breach of Stage 3, though thepublic might think so.    In the long run it was to be hoped that the talks on the future of the industry would produce a more permanentarrangement by which the pay for the underground workers wouldbe fixed separately at a higher level than for other National GoalBoard employees.
The Pay Board report on relativities would be available by the endof the week, and ought to be published at the latest by Wednesday23 January. It would deal in general terms with the principles and procedures by which Pay Codes might in future be amended totake account of special cases. Although the Press would seize on it as offering a way out for the miners, it would not in practice bepossible or timely to try to take decisions on the future of Stage by that date.In discussion it was noted that with the exception of certain craftsmenfew of the miners were losing much pay as a result of their overtimeban, and only the maintenance workers were in breach of any agreement.    It was difficult to bring pressure on the miners, althoughit was possible that when the approved offer within Stage 3 became available on 1 March some miners might become more willing tosettle.   Another possible course would be for the Government to change the situation by introducing a quick move from Stage 3 to anew and more severe Stage 4, which would still provide for someexceptional treatment for the miners.    In order to avoid creatingfurther anomalies it would however have to be provided that allgroups would be allowed to reach Stage 3 settlements by a given date,such as 1 March, but that any group that failed to do so should besubject to the more stringent provisions of Stage 4.    This would however take time to work out.In further discussion it was argued that the undertaking mentioned by the Secretary of State for Employment as the most that the TUCcould be persuaded to give would not be enough to justify theGovernment in permitting an exception to the Stage 3 Pay Code.The TUC could not in practice keep such an undertaking and the supporters of the Government would find any exception to Stage 3very difficult to accept.    In June 1969 the then Government had accepted undertakings at least as specific from the TUC as a reasonfor withdrawing legislation and in so doing it had lost the reality of power.   Similarly acceptance of TUC undertakings now mighttransfer the reality of power to the NUM.   Admittedly the public might expect the Government to meet the TUC once more to discussthe outcome of the TUC conference, but the Government could use the meeting as an opportunity to break off discussions on terms that could be explained publicly.    On the other hand it was argued thatthe aim of the TUC would be to avoid a break, and that if thediscussions dragged on inconclusively the public would begin to losepatience.    The talks had already reached a natural conclusion atwhich a clean break would be better.    Indeed rather than meet the tuc again, it was arguable that the time had come to make one moreeffort with the NUM.    They should be told that all other unions weresettling within Stage 3.    If they were to turn down the settlement theywould be seen to be the only union that was not behaving reasonablyin the public interest.   Such an appeal could only be made by thePrime Minister.
THE PRIME MINISTER, slimming up the discussion, said thatthose who had been engaged in the talks with the TUC and the NUMneeded a period of concentrated thought to work out all the stages of further discussions.    It would be wrong, therefore, to hold any-meeting in the current week with the TUC or the NUM.    If anappeal were made to the NUM it would have to take account of the;whole situation, including the talks with the TUC and the provisionsof the report on relativities that was about to be published.    Thediscussion could become extremely complicated.    He would like to devote the afternoon and the next day to further study of thearguments for meetings with the NUM or TUC and of the possibilitiesthat might be raised in discussion so that the Ministerial team couldnot be taken unawares.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office18 January 1974II&quot;4
