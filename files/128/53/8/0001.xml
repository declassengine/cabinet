::;v;RETTHEQUEEN!SSPEECHON THEPROROGATIONOFPARLIAMENT1, The Cabinet had before them notes by the Lord President ofthe Council (CP(73) 100 and 101) to which we/?e unm^. a draft ofThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament;,The Cabinet considered the draft Speech paragraph by paragraph,THE PRIME MINISTER^, summing up the discussionr said that theCabinet approved the drafts subject to certain amendments which hadbeen suggested.    It might, however^ be necessary to reconsiderparagraph 7 when more was known about the reaction of the icelandic government to the discussions on fisheries which had just taken placein London and to add a paragraph about the fighting in the middle east.    The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland would also need to review the paragraphs on Northern Ireland in the light of thelatest developments.The Cabinet -Took note,, with approval, of the Prime Minister sssumming up of their discussion.OIL 2 THE PRIME MINISTER informed- .the.. Cabinet, that the OrganisafSUPPLIES t&apos;o  Petroleum: Sxporting&quot;&apos;Countries-(OPEC)- had met in Vienna the :previous week^and^presentecftne^ail companies with a demand to double the posted price of oil from $3 to $6 a barrel^ requestinga reply within a few days.    The oil companies were not prepared toaccept an increase of this size, but they believed that any counteroffer which they would consider realistic might lead to a breakdown of the negotiations;  in these circumstances they had represented that they needed to consult their Governments about the OPECproposals.    The conference had accordingly been adjourned for two weeks.    If price increases of this order were conceded, itwould increase the cost of oil supplies to the European economic community by about $10, 000 million a year.    The Ministers most closely concerned had been consulted by the oil companies about the tactics they should follow; messages had been sent to theGovernments of the major oil consuming powers; and an attemptwould also be made to gam the support of the Shah of Iran formoderating the demands of OPEC.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the war between the Arab States and Israel was already interrupting suppliesof oil to Western Europe,, though the effect so far on the UnitedKingdom was small. The Arab members of OPEC were howeverdue to meet in Kuwait the following day to discuss use of the oilweapon as a means of bringing pressure on the United States tom drop her support of Israel, possibly by preventing the sale of oil
to United States oil companies.    They well recognised that such a move could incidentally be very damaging to European supplies, and indeed had warned us on this account to use our influence with theUnited States,    Action was already in hand to bring into force the oil sharing arrangements of the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development,    Against this background theTask Force on Oil Supplies had reviewed the state of contingency planning in the United Kingdom and considered the measures thatneeded to be taken immediately.    Stocks of oil stood at some 75 days1forward consumption, with about 30 days&apos; supply in transit by sea atany time.    But distribution difficulties would arise when stocks fellbelow the level of 30 days&apos; consumption.    An interruption in thesupply of Arab oil would cut our imports by nearly half, and immediate action would be needed to conserve stocks.    legislation would be required to provide powers to introduce motor fuelrationing and to enforce the allocation of supplies to industry,as well as to protect the oil companies against being sued for breach of contract by their customers; and a Bill could be ready for introduction at the beginning of the new Session of Parlia.ment;if a crisis occurred before then it might be necessary to rely on emergency powers,,    Preparations for the rationing of motor fuelcould be completed in three to four weeks; hitherto these had beenhampered by the need for security, but in present circumstancespublic opinion was likely to accept the need for precautionary measures, and action need not be inhibited by the risk of theGovernment^ plans becomingknownn    It would        be necessaryto prepare the recruitment of some 2S 000 staff to administer the rationing scheme.    The Cabinet might consider it advisable forthe Civil Contingencies Unit now to take over the direction of thesepreparations.    Consideration would also need to be given to the way in which cuts in the consumption of oil by industry should be imposed,and to the possibility of increasing the use of coal at power stations.The latter measure could save up to 6 million tons of oil over aperiod of six months; but account must also be taken of the risk to coal supplies in case of industrial action,    The Task Force wouldbe putting proposals on these questions to the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy,In discussion there was general recognition of the urgent need forprecautionary measures.    Consideration would need to be given tothe possibility of importing coal; though this could have an adverse effect on industrial relations in the coalmining industry.    Motorfuel rationing would not of itself save a large proportion of thecountry&apos;s oil supplies - perhaps some 3 million tons a year;  andfurther study would need to be given to its implications for public transport.    Plans were in hand for the administration of the scheme from seven regional centres.    This complex administrative system and the relatively small benefit suggested that petrol rationingshould be very much a last resort; nonetheless, it would havea marked effect on public opinion, and would underline the gravity
of the crisis with which the country might be faced.    This might also argue in favour of declaring a state of emergency at an appropriate moment: though it would be important to emphasise the limits of emergency powers.    It was further accepted thatextensive preparations of this kind must come to public notice;but public opinion would expect the Government to take vigorousmeasures to safeguard suppliess    A well-directed publicity campaign could secure significant economies, and it would be important to take every advantage of the climate of opinion to secure acceptance for the Governments measures,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion? said that theCabinet agreed that contingency planning against an interruption toour oil supplies should be carried forward with the utmost vigour.If a serious crisis arose, public opinion would expect the Governmentto be ready with appropriate measures;  and there would be wide-spread criticism if they failed to match the pressure of events.Both the Task Force on Oil Supplies and the Civil ContingenciesUnit would have a role to play and there would need to be close co-ordination between them.    In general however the Task Force?in addition to any matters concerning oil policy generally, shouldconcern itself with the maintenance of our oil supplies to the maximum extent; whereas the Civil Contingencies Unit would be responsible forall matters affecting our ability to endure in a situation where oilsupplie3 had been reduced.    In particular the Civil Contingencies Unitshould urgently examine the proposals for legislation, the possible use of the Emergency Powers Act, the preparations for motor fuel;rationing, and the measures that should be adopted for allocating cutsin industrial use of oily as well as any other steps that might be takento minimise the effect of an interruption including a suitablepublicity campaign.    Action on a contingency basis should be pressed ahead as rapidly as possible under the general supervision of the Civil Contingencies Unit,    Collective Ministerial approvalwould of course be necessary before any steps were taken by us toreduce consumption:  and it would also be necessary for theEconomic Strategy Committee to consider at an early date the priorities for the allocation of oil to industry and other vital sectorsafter these had been examined by the Civil Contingencies Unit,The Cabinet -1. Agreed that contingency preparations against any interruption in the United Kingdom&apos;s supplies of oil should be completed as a matter of urgency.

Their discussion and the--- conclusions reached are recorded separately,,MiddleEastPreviousReference:CM(73) 46thConclusions,Minute cabinet Office17 October 1973i. The Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry, in consultation with the lord president of the Council, to arrange for legislation controlling the supply of liquidfuels to be prepared0ii. The Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Secretary of State for trade and Industry s to arrange for the CivilContingencies Unit to examine all the preparations for reducing domestic oilconsumption in this country as indicatedin the Prime Minister &apos;s summing up.Hi.       The Secretary of State for defence to arrange for the Task Force on Oil supplies to continue to examine all possible ways of ensuring the maintenance of oil supplies tothis country to the maximum extent possible.
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported thatwhen he had made his statement on the Middle East fighting that afternoon, the mood of the House of Commons seemed to be rathercalmer than might have been expected.    He had stressed the even-handed nature of cur embargo on arms supplies and the distinctionbetween supplies sought by the direct combatants and those intended for the defence of the Persian Gulf,    He hoped also that he haddisposed of the concern regarding the training being given to Egyptianhelicopter pilots and the supply of tanks to Dubai.In a short discussion it was noted that the reception given to asimilar statement in the House of Lords had been markedly morecritical; and it was argued that the distinction which the Governmenthad drawn in connection with the continued supply of arms to the GulfStates was likely to come under increasing criticism.    In particularthere would be opposition to supplies going to Saudi Arabia.    It wasalso clear that in many quarters there was unease about theGovernment^ refusal to state publicly that the Arabs were responsiblefor breaking the ceasefire even if this stopped short of condemnation.On the other hand no convincing arguments had been put forward toshow that the Governments present policy was wrong, and theCabinet were informed that the Irish Foreign Minister was anxious that the Community countries should make a joint demarche to theUnited States and the Soviet Union about the arms shipments theywere making.    On the other hand it was argued that if the Organisationof Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting resulted anyhow in thereduction of supplies of oil to us we should have greater freedomof manoeuvre to assist Israel.    Events were moving fast and theCabinet would need to continue to ke-op them under close review.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet OfficeCOPY no cabinet confidential annex cm(73) 47th Conclusions, Minute 3Tuesday 16 October 1973 at 5. 30 pm17 October 1973
