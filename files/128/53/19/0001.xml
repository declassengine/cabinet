4PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.It was noted that some Opposition speakers were likely to seek to import criticism of Sir John Donaldson, President of theNational Industrial Relations Court, into the debate about theconsequences of the Industrial Relations Act which was to takeplace on 4 December.    It was argued that, to be within therules of order, criticism of a judgess conduct could be made only in the context of a substantive motion calling for hisremoval from office; and the Lord President should confirminformally with the Speaker whether he intended        the debate on 4 December to be conducted on this basis.    If so, it mightbe useful to seek an occasion - possibly during the questionsfollowing the business statement to be made later in. the day -to clarify the position to Members.The Cabinet were informed that the Ministers principally concerned would shortly be considering the line to be adoptedby the Government spokesmen in the debate on immigrationwhich was to take place on 5 December on the basis of a motion for the adjournment;  and that the conclusions reached would be reported to the Cabinet at their next meeting.    It was agreedthat arrangements should be made for the scope of the debateto be extended so as to enable race relations to be covered also.1
slice. ;y&apos;foreignAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(73) 56thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the outcome of the Arab Summit recently held in Algiershad been reasonably satisfactory.    The delegates had avoidedinflamatory statements and it was of particular importance thatthey had not sought to tie the hands of President Sadat of Egypt inthe forthcoming negotiations with Israel.    On the negative side,however, they had recognised the Palestine LiberationOrganisation as the sole representative of the Palestinian people,this decision would be unacceptable to King Hussein of jordan and might make it difficult for him to attend the peace negotiations.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth SecretaryOil SuppliesPreviousReference:CM(73) 57thConclusions,Minute 6THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that theprevious evening he had had a private conversation withSheikh Yamani, the Saudi Arabian Minister of Petroleum.Sheikh Yamani had professed to have sought an opportunity withoutthe presence of his &quot;hard-line11 Algerian colleague to assure theGovernment of Saudi Arabia&apos;s friendly intentions towards theUnited Kingdom and the European Economic Community (e.c.) ingeneral; though his Government considered that the Dutch wouldhave to give further proof of amendment before the embargo on oil supplies to Holland could be lifted.    Sheikh Yamani had saidthat his Government had no wish to see the United Kingdom suffer from lack of oil supplies; their quota would be punctually fulfilledand his Government would ensure that the oil allotted to the UnitedKingdom was not diverted elsewhere.    There could however be noquestion of total production being increased until there was some progress towards a settlement with Israel; and if the UnitedKingdom sought to increase their quota of Saudi Arabian oil, itcould only be at the expense of other European customers.Sheikh Yamani had indicated that his Government might be disposed to treat the e.c. as a special case if the Community were to takeeconomic action against Israel.    On being informed that such anarrangement was tantamount to blackmail and was most unlikely to prove acceptable to the governments concerned, he had gone on tosuggest that the e.c. might seek ways to help the Arab nations,though he appeared to have no specific project in mind.    from what Sheikh Yamani had said it seemed clear that he would not be willing to go as far as this in his conversations with members ofthe Government in the presence of his Algerian colleague; andthere might be advantage in exploring the question further with the saudi Arabian Ambassador.The Cabinet -2.      Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Defence.
EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRS3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER saidthat important meetings of the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) and the Council of Ministers (Finance) would take placein Brussels on 3/4 December 1973.The Council of Foreign Ministers would consider proposals for theestablishment of a Regional Development Fund.    We should seek to make as much progress as possible on the key issues of the size of the Fund and the distribution of shares amongst xnemberstates; but it was unlikely that the meeting would reach final agreement.    It might be necessary for the Copenhagen summit meeting on 14/15 December to lay down general guidelines.    TheCouncil would also be discussing the Commission mandate for trade negotiations with Spain and Israel.    We wanted to get better terms in certain sectors where there were implications for thecost of food in the United Kingdom,    We would also be seeking the Councils agreement to maintaining our current tariffarrangements with the Mediterranean countries if, as now seemedinevitable, new agreements could not be in force by then.    TheCouncil of Finance Ministers would be discussing proposals fox*a second stage of Economic and Monetary Union and for Communityaction against inflation, where we would be pressing for action inthe tariff field aimed in particular at easing   the pressure on theprice of food.    But it was unlikely that tariff action could have more than a marginal real effect on food prices generally.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the statement by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 57thConclusions,Minute 44. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the political trend was on the whole favourable.    Thefact that the Executive Designate had been formed was attractingincreasing support for the efforts of the moderate politicians toco-operate.    But in response to the alliance of the moderateforces, the extremists on both sides were, intent on causingtrouble.    The extensive hi-jacking of vehicles by the ProvisionalWing of the Irish Republican Army during the past week was essentially a propaganda exercise and the casualties had been few.The reaction of Protestant extremists was demonstrated by theway in which they had disrupted the most recent meeting of theAssembly.     The tripartite talks with representatives of theIrish Government and members of the Executive Designate wouldbe held the following week.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland.04
50 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Home Department (CP(73) 129) about the status of theproposed Health and Safety Commission (HSC).THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Home and Social AffairsCommittee had concluded that the question whether the HSC, whichwas to be set up under legislation giving effect to the recommenda-tions of the Robens Report, should or should not have Crown status and be staffed by civil servants raised issues of sufficient importanceto warrant consideration by the Cabinet.    In principle the Committeehad on balance favoured Crown status, which seemed more appropriate for a body with important enforcement functions.There were however some very difficult staffing problems.Many of the staff serving the HSC would come from the Departmentof Employment, which had recently also been affected by theestablishment of the Manpower Services Commission (MSG).This was a non-Crown body and the consequential change in statushad caused much disquiet amongst the staff affected.    The new contracts of service had not yet been signed and, if another body which the staff would regard as closely comparable ware set up andaccorded Crown status, there was some fear that they might not be signed at all.    The result would be that it would not be possible to achieve the objective of establishing the MSC by 1 January 1974.    Onthe other hand, the National Staff Side, while prepared to acquiesce in the establishment of the MSC as a non-Crown body, had representedvery strongly that the HSC had different functions and should haveCrown status;  and they and the staff from other Departments whowere liable to be transferred to the HSC would greatly resent adecision denying the Commission this status merely in order toappease those who were due to be transferred to the MSC.In discussion, it was argued that, bearing in mind that the HSCwould use its powers of enforcement only as a last resort, it wasin principle preferable that it should not be a Csown body.    It was an underlying principle that the HSC should be an independentexecutive body, in the running of which a major part would be played by the two sides of industry.    This approach seemedincompatible with Crown status, which would in practice resultin the Commission becoming little more than an advisory body.This would be a serious blow to the objective of tripartite co-operation.As regards staffing, the position was that three-quarters of the2, 500 staff required by the HSC would come from the Departmentof Employment, which was also the source of the 14, 000 staff needed by the MSC.    A very serious situation would arise if this latternumerous group of staff declined to sign the new contracts.Moreover, it was doubtful whether the National Staff Side wouldin the last resort resist the denial of Crown status to the HSC.Their main anxiety was that it might set a precedent for the further
hiving off of civil servants; but in fact there seemed to be no furtherimmediate scope for action on these lines and therefore it should bepossible to allay their anxiety.    Furthermore, most of the professional staff due to be transferred to the HSC favoured a Commission organised on a two-tier basis;  and the Homeand Social Affairs Committee had agreed that this would notbe compatible with Crown status.On the other hand, it was argued that on the point of principleit was desirable that a body with important enforcement functions -which would include the power to prosecute - should be publiclyanswerable in the way that could most appropriately be secured by Crown status.    The National Staff Side were prepared, thoughreluctantly, to accept that the decision not to give the MSG Crownstatus could not be reversed now that the relevant legislation wason the Statute Book; but they felt very strongly that different considerations applied to the HSC,    In the interest of good long-term staff relations, it was desirable to give heed to their view.In further discussion it was suggested that no major issue of principle was in fact involved, and that the determining factor should be staffrelations.    On the latter, it seemed reasonable to expect theNational Staff Side to persuade the Departmental interests concerned to accept the conclusions reached at national level.    It was,however, pointed out that the Conservative Party had for longaccepted in principle the desirability of reducing the range of functions performed centrally in the interest of self-regulationat the periphery;  and although it was not clear why an HSC which did not have Crown status would in practice be unable to carry outexecutive work, it would be desirable to consider the point further and perhaps to consult the Confederation of British Industry andTrades Union Congress,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe discussion had thrown up a number of important issues onwhich further work was needed before a decision could be reached.The staffing problems in particular needed careful thought:  therecent difficulties in the Governments relationship with staff were showing signs of easing and it would be unfortunate to do anything which would imperil this improvement.    The Cabinet agreed  hatit would be undesirable for the HSC to decline into no more than an advisory body; but it was not clear why this must follow fromits being given Crown status.    On this matter also further thoughtwas needed.    The Ministers concerned, together with sir William Armstrong, the Head of the Home Civil Service,should accordingly examine these matters further and reportthe outcome to him.
6, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(73) 130) about Members1 pay and allowances.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he and the lord privy Seal had been under considerable pressure from Members ofboth Houses for some increase to be made in the current levels ofMembers1 pay and allowances and in the Peers5 daily expensesallowance.    It seemed to be generally accepted in the House ofCommons that Members1 basic salaries could not be increased in advance of a further report by the Review Bodyc which would normally conduct only one enquiry during any Parliament of normallength; but the pressure for increases in the allowances, which inthe case of the House of Lords expense allowance was related toactual expenses incurred, was more substantial.    He did not thinkit would be acceptable to make any increase in the peers allowance in isolation.    The alternatives seemed to be either to take no actionor to increase the peers expense allowance and the Members&apos;secretarial allowance.    There were obvious problems of timing and presentation involved in the latter course.    He had thought itnecessary to alert his colleagues to these difficulties and, subjectto their views, suggested that the next step should be for a small group of the Ministers concerned to consider the matter further inall its aspects.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Lord Presidents proposals should beconsidered in detail by the Ministerial Committee on Counter-Inflationary Measures, with particular reference to their relationsMpto Phase 3; to the possible danger involved in making any changeswithout reference to the Review Body;  and to timing, bearing in mind the obvious objections to agreeing any increases until the currentmajor industrial pay claims had been settled.1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Employment, theLord Privy Seal and the other Ministers concerned and with Sir William Armstrong, the Head of the home civil Services, to consider further the issues referredto in the Prime Ministers summing up and to report their conclusions to Mm.
81. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2, Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal, to arrangefor his proposals to be considered by the ministerial Committee on Counter-inflationary measures,
?a The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Employment (CP(73) 131) on the handling of the coalminers8and power engineers8 disputes,THE PRIME MINISTER reported  hat on the previous day he and other colleagues had met the Executive of the National Union of mineworkers (NUM),    There had been a tiseful and restraineddiscussion in a relatively good atmosphere.    He and his colleagues had given the Executive a broad survey of world and national economic problems.    They had stressed that the future of the coal mining industry in this country was assured, but had made clear that there could be no question of the Government departing from the provisionsof Stage 3 of the -counter-inflationary policy.    They had also pointedout that the offer which the National Coal Board (NCB) had made tothe miners, within the provisions of the Pay and Prices Code, wasvery favourable; and had quoted figures to show that its acceptancewould place the miners in a more advantageous position comparedwith other industrial workers than they had been under previoussettlements.    The rate of wastage from the industry owed as muchto discontent with industrial unrest as to other factors.    It wasdisappointing that the Executive had subsequently, by a substantial majority, decided against an immediate ballot of their members onthe NCB offer; but there were signs that the arguments advanced byhim and his colleagues had made a genuine impact on at least themore moderate members of the Executive, and that this might bearfruit in due course,    In the meantime, the most pressing need wasto convince the miners that the Government was not prepared to go beyond the provisions of Stage 3.    He proposed to make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon on the outcome of the talks.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT, reporting on the electrical power engineers1 dispute, said that the Pay Board was making an urgent re-examination of the application of the Pay Codeto out-of-hours working.    He had therefore decided against meetingthe Electrical Power Engineers Association for the time being.    Inthe meantime the Electricity Council should be urged to take a more active part in negotiations than they had done hitherto.In discussion it was agreed that the arguments used by Ministers inthe talks with the NUM should continue to be propagated continuouslyand vigorously: informal briefing of newspaper editors had been particularly effective,    A briefing note summarising these arguments should be prepared giving special emphasis to a comparison of the present wage offer with the situation beforeand after the Wilberforce Inquiry.
During further discussion it was stated that although the loss ofcoal production had been less than at first feared, coal and oil stocks continued to fall and the critical level for maintaininguninterrupted supplies of electricity might be reached in February.It was essential therefore to consider what further measures mightbe adopted to prolong the endurance of primary fuel stocks, includingthe definition of an optimum balance between the use of coal and oilfor electricity generation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that publicopinion must be sustained in its view that the offer to the coalminerswas final.    The Secretary of State for Employment should circulate a briefing note to Ministers based on the arguments used in theprevious day&apos;s discussion with the NUM.    The Lord Presidentof the Council should circulate a paper for the Cabinet to discussat their next meeting on further measures which might be taken to economise in the use of fuel.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion,2.        Invited the Secretary of State for employment to circulate a briefing note to Ministers on miners1pay.3. Invited the Lord President of the Council to circulate a paper on what further measures mightbe taken to economise in the use of fuel.
