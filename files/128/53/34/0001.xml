COPY NO       &quot;cabinet confidential annex cm(74) 10th ConclusionsMonday 4 March 1974 at 10. 00 am the PRIME MINISTER said that he had kept in close touch with most of his colleagues over a weekend of intense consultation butit was right for the Cabinet as a whole now to take stock of theposition reached.    It had been argued by some that the support ofthe Ulster Unionists would provide a sufficient majority to continue in office but this would be both difficult and unreliable.   as envisaged at their last discussion he had therefore seen the leader of the Liberal Party at 4. 00 pm on Saturday 2 March.    Mr Thorpehad agreed that the Liberal attitude on incomes policy and on europe was similar to that of the Government and that it was constitutionallyproper for the latter to explore the possibility of Liberal co-operation on a general programme of measures to be included in The Queen&apos;sSpeech or indeed Liberal participation in the Government itself.Mr Thorpe had not been authorised by his colleagues to accept any arrangement but he had asked a number of questions.   The firstconcerned Northern Ireland, and he had been assured that theGovernment would not contemplate any deal with the Ulster Unionistsbut would continue to support the Svxningdale agreement.    He had then asked about electoral reform, making it clear that he was notwedded to any particular solution although he had mentioned thepossibility of proportional representation for the boroughs and thealternative vote system for the rural areas: on this the PrimeMinister had said that he could give him no indication of theGovernments view without further consultation with his colleagues.He had also mentioned the Kilbrandon Report on which he had been told that the Government had undertaken some preliminary workwhich could be discussed with him later.   He had not raised any foreign policy or economic issues, but had said that his ParliamentaryParty would not be meeting until 4 March although he could consultsome of his senior colleagues on the following day.   After doing this he had telephoned the Prime Minister at 5.30 pm on Sunday saying;that things were moving in a helpful direction.    There were however two problems.    The first concerned the leadership of the1
Conservative Party if Liberal support was to be provided: but onthis he felt he could handle his Party.    The second was electoral reform on which the Liberals would expect specific and urgentaction.    If this was promised the Liberals would consider support for the Government and did not rule out the possibility of enteringa coalition at a later stage.The Prime Minister had been in touch with many of his colleaguesboth following his initial talk with Mr Thorpe and the later telephoneconversation.    They had increasingly come to the view that anarrangement for Liberal support Would be insufficient given themeasures which would have to be taken to restore the economy.A coalition seemed the only possibility, but on electoral reformthey had not felt able either to commit themselves on what theywould recommend or still less to what a Speaker&apos;s conference might decide.    They were not therefore in a position to deliver onthe matter which was most important to Liberal thinking.    Themost that might be contemplated was to acknowledge the strengthof Liberal views, to offer the setting up of a Speaker&apos;s conference as a matter of urgency and to say that they would thereafter ask parliament on a free vote to decide upon the Conference^recommendations.    He had therefore seen Mr Thorpe a second time at 10. 30 pm on Sunday evening.    He had explained the positionto him and had said that he would try to let him have the Cabinet&apos;view before the Liberals1 own Parliamentary Party meeting at11. 00 am that morning.    He had said that he personally felt thatcoalition was essential and that the most that could be offered on electoral reform was a Speaker&apos;s Conference.    Indeed he had stressed that he could not honourably undertake to deliver morethan this.    Mr Thorpe had repeated that he could not enter a coalition at this stage although many in his Party wanted anarrangement with the Conservatives.    The offer of a Speaker&apos;conference would however be insufficient to secure this and as aminimum the Liberals would expect a statement by the Governmentthat they regarded some change in the electoral arrangements as necessary.    Mr Thorpe had also said that Mr Wilson! I also wishedto see him but that he would take the same line with him overelectoral reform.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had BeenLord Byers who felt strongly that a coalition would be the end of theLiberal Party,    He favoured an arrangement with the Governmentwith proportional representation as the price, but felt that the A\Liberal Party might not be prepared to go as far even as this.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the pay Board report on miners1 relativities had now been received   ])although he had not yet read it personally.    It offered big increases in miners&apos; pay which the Liberals would certainly support: but it2
was now questionable whether the miners would accept it from a minority Government with Liberal support only.    This was afurther factor to be taken into account in considering the alternativesof Liberal support or coalition.   Indeed the latter might in any case be necessary to bind the Liberals to a settlement not in excess ofthat proposed by the Pay Board.In discussion there was general agreement that the matter now iineeded to be brought to a head urgently both from the national and party   points of view.    There had been widespread support withinthe Conservative Party for the approach to the Liberals but theGovernment&apos;s backbench supporters were increasingly worried bytalk of a deal with the Liberals over proportional representation andwere unlikely to support any action leading towards that end.    Anarrangement with the Liberals would in any case be insufficientlystable, and Mr Thorpe seemed to be asking too much and offeringtoo little.    There was no possibility of an arrangement with the ulster Unionists who would seek to undermine the Sunningdaleagreement, or with the Scottish nationalists who were left-wing andopposed to the Governments European policies:  and a decision to face Parliament without guaranteed support to provide an overallmajority would seem to many to be a discreditable attempt to holdon to power and would exacerbate relations with the trades unions.At some stage the political and economic situation of the country might dictate a Grand Coalition between the Labour and ConservativeParties but talk of this was premature.    It had been right to make an approach to the Leader of the Liberal Party but it was now clearthat an offer of general support by that Party would not provide the stability necessary for the Government to remain in office.    Unlesstherefore the Liberal Party was prepared to enter a coalition withouta commitment to legislation on electoral reform in the new parliament - and this seemed very unlikely in the light ofLord Byers&apos; remarks - there seemed no alternative to the PrimeMinister tendering his resignation to The Queen and advising her to ask the Leader of the Labour Party to form an Administration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that only a firm coalition with the Liberal Partycould ensure their continuance in office, and also that it would be inadvisable to offer more to the Liberals than a Speaker&apos;conference on electoral reform in order to obtain such a coalition.The chance of this proving acceptable now seemed remote but it if&apos;]would be necessary to await a formal reply from the Leader of theLiberal Party before tendering his resignation.    It was therefore necessary to send Mr Thorpe a letter forthwith confirming the offer of a coalition with a Speaker&apos;s Conference on electoral reform, butmaking it clear that the Conservative Party could accept no commitment to legislation on electoral reform in the new parliament since .the electorate should have an opportunity to3
express their views on the changes proposed.    He had prepared adraft for this purpose, the final text of which he would settle inconsultation with a few of his senior colleagues.    On the assumptionthat Mr Thorpe rejected this proposal outright this might be the last meeting of the present Cabinet and he wished to thank his colleagues for their loyal support during their years in office.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the members of the cabinet would for their part want to thank the Prime Minister for the leadership which he had gijVen to them.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and warmlyendorsed the remarks of the Lord Chancellor.Cabinet office March 1974
