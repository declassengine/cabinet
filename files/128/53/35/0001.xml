COPY no cabinet confidential annex cm(74) 11th ConclusionsMonday 4 March 1974 at 4.45 pmIE SITUATIONALLOWINGIE GENERALLECTIONTHE PRIME MINISTER said that a reply had now been receivedfrom the Leader of the Liberal Party to the letter which had been dispatched to Mr Thorpe following the meeting of the Cabinetearlier that day.    In it Mr Thorpe, as expected, had rejected theproposal for a Liberal presence in the Government: but hadinstead suggested the calling of a conference between all the party leaders with a view to the formation of a National Government.Although in his view this suggestion was not a practicable one, hehad judged it advisable to reconvene the Cabinet.   At their earliermeeting the view had been expressed that at some stage the politicaland economic situation of the country might require the formation ofa National Government, but there had been agreement that the timefor it was not ripe.    He did not see that Mr Thorpe&apos;s proposalcalled this judgment in question.    There was too great a differencebetween the policies of the Conservative and Labour Parties, andthe Leader of the Labour Party would almost certainly rebuff an approach at a time when the economy might be thought to be about to recover from the three-day week rather than enter a new periodof crisis.    He saw no reason therefore to alter his decision to tender his resignation to The Queen although in. his reply toMr Thorpe he would make the point that if a Labour Administrationwere formed and pursued Mr Thorpe&apos;s idea he would consider very carefully an invitation to a meeting of Party Leaders.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet office March 1974
