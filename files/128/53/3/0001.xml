10 THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that on 26 September our ambassador in Reykjavik conveyed a message from the PrimeMinister to the Prime Minister of Iceland-, Mr Johannes son 0The message proposed that the two Governments should agree a modus vivendi under which we would withdraw naval protection and limit our fishing effort, while the Icelandic Government would agree publicly to stop harassing our trawlers.    Mr Johannes sonsaid that it was politically impossible for him to give a publicassurance that harassment would cease, but that if naval protectionwere withdrawn he would do all he could to ensure that there wasno harassment.    The Prime. Ministers proposal had been referredto the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Icelandic Parliament whichwas meeting that day to consider whether Iceland should break offdiplomatic relations with us, but the result of their discussion wasnot yet known.    The Icelandic Cabinet was at present in session and it had been announced that there would be a Press Conferencein Reykjavik later in the day.    Although Mr Johannes son was reported to have been attracted by the suggestion that we mightlimit our fishing effort, and to be contemplating the possibility of coming to London himself for discussion with the Prime minister if he were invited to do so, it seemed on balance unlikely that thesuggestion of a modus vivendi would be accepted, and diplomatic relations would probably be broken.    In that case we would presumably wish to give publicity to the Prime Minister&apos;s offer,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion,, said thathis offer had not indicated the ways in which we might limit ourfishing effort.    This would be a matter for discussion with theindustry.    Whether or not the Icelandic Government respondedfavourably to his suggestion the fact that we had made an offer should be helpful to us internationally, and particularly in theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    If the offer was rejected andrelations were broken the offer should be given immediate publicity.Further consideration could be given to the desirability of issuinga White Paper recording the various offers which we had made toIceland in our efforts to resolve the problem.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister!s summing up of their discussion.
THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had accepted an invitation from the Soviet Foreign Minister,Mr Gromyko, to pay a visit to Moscow,The Cabinet -2. Took note of the statement by theMinister of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs.2
EUROPEAN Z0 THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODCOMMUNITY said that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) onAFFAIRS 23-24 September there had been discussion of the Community&apos;future sugar arrangements including the provision to be made for commonwealth imports.    The Commission proposal provided for1.4 million tons to be imported from the developing commonwealth countries and this had been generally endorsed.    The french representative had argued that this tonnage figure went beyond theprovisions of Protocol 22 to the Act of Accession, but he had not specifically opposed the figure and there were good prospects forits ultimate recognition in the Community arrangements.The Council had failed to reach agreement on^a Directive concerningsupport for agriculture in mountainous areas^had deferred thesubject to the next meeting.He had secured the agreement of the Council to a Communityexamination of arrangements for the welfare of animals in transport and in slaughter houses.In discussion it was pointed out that the inability of the community to agree a mandate to participate in the Conference for a new international Sugar Agreement would be badly received by the developing Commonwealth countries.    There had been somesensational and unfavourable Press treatment of the discussions on sugar in the Council of Ministers.    While avoiding unhelpfulpublicity we should attempt to ensure that the Governments efforts on behalf of the developing Commonwealth countries were fullyappreciatedcTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said weshould continue to press for the full implementation of our pledges to the developing Commonwealth sugar producing countries.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up bythe Prime Minister.3
northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 39thConclusions.Minute 43, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the level of violence continued to be relatively low.    TheProvisional Wing of the Irish Republican Army was finding itdifficult to attract recruits, and the inaccuracy of the shootings inwhich they engaged indicated that the guns were now largely in thehands of ill-trained young people0    The Security Forces haddiscovered a Protestant factory for making mortars,, more than200 of which had been seized,,    The shortage of prison officers was a continuing cause for concern;  and the recent escape fromthe Maze Prison of six prisoners, all of whom had been recaptured,could be attributed to inadequate staff.    He hoped to hold a meeting with representatives of the Unionist Party, the Social Democraticand Labour Party (SDLP) and the Alliance Party on 8 October todiscuss the formation of the Executive of the Assembly.    the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr Brian Faulkner, was taking ahelpful position; he realised that his own political future depended on success in forming an Executive.    The SDLP were provingdifficult, and continued to make demands which could not be met,in regard to the police, the release of detainees and the Constitution,He believed, however, that an Executive would ultimately be formed,after hard and possibly protracted negotiation.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.t4
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thata small strike at Dagenham in sympathy with a worker who hadbeen dismissed had been used by the unions to press Fords to guarantee earnings during lay-offs.    In consequence the strike had spread and all production had been halted.    Attempts werebeing made to find a basis upon which the dismissal might bereferred to arbitration and, if these were  successful, work mightbe resumed after a meeting of the National Joint negotiating committee on the following day.The 8 weeks&apos; old strike of electricians at Chryslers&apos; factories atRyton and Stoke, which had involved the company in losses sufficientto cause them to threaten the dismissal of 8, 000 workers if thestrike did not end by the coming weekend, resulted from the determination of the electricians to restore their pay relativity withother skilled workers.    The other unions involved in the disputehad been impressed by the company&apos;s presentation of the effects of the strike upon profitability, and there was some prospect that production at the company&apos;s Linwood plant might be continued,with maintenance being carried out by supervisory staff on the same basis as at Ryton.    This would enable Chryslers to cover theiroperating costs and to allow production to continue.    the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions had called ameeting, to take place that day, of shop stewards of all the unionsinvolved in the dispute, but there seemed little prorpect of an early settlement, which could come only if the electricians were willingto compromise, and no immediate prospect that an intervention byhim would be of assistance.    He proposed to meet the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress in order to urge that allpossible steps be taken to ensure that at least the Linwood factorykept operating.The month-old strike at Adwest Engineering of Reading, which hadbeen disrupting parts of the motor industry at home and abroad, had now been settled after prolonged negotiations under an independent chairman.    It was not clear that the settlement would be acceptable to the Pay Board, but it seemed unlikely that, even if they were to reject it, strike action would be resumed.There was now a risk of further industrial action by the 8, 000production workers at the British Leyland Motor Company&apos;sfactory at Longbridge.    The Pay Board had over-ruled a settlen 3ntinvolving a pay increase of  4 a week which the company had reached,deciding that  1. 59 of the increase could not be paid until November.The unions were now threatening further industrial action unlessthe agreement was implemented in full;  and Lord Stokes appearedready to comply with the unions&apos; demands.    He had sought to persuade Lord Stokes that to give way to their pressure would jeopardise both the pay policy end the company&apos;s ability to withstandsubsequent pressure from the unions;  but he would not know until5
the following day whether he had been successful.   There was alsothe risk that the Pay Board would decide to give the company14 days&apos; notice of an Order requiring them to comply with theBoard&apos;s restriction of the increase, and that, if the strike thencontinued, the strikers would risk prosecution under Section 17(2)oi the Counter-Inflation Act.The dispute at Longbridge was the only one of those at presentaffecting the motor industry which could be said to arise directly from action taken by the Pay Board, and it was a matter for concern that industrial relations in the industry remained sotroubled.    The Motor Industry Council was being reactivated toconsider the present troubles, but he was considering whether thetime was not approaching when it might be desirable to refer theindustry to the Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR).In discussion there was general support for the suggestion that theCIR might be asked to report on the situation in the motor industry,even though the unions might be unlikely to co-operate in the inquiry.    If the industrial relations machinery available to theGovernment was not used, the Government&apos;s opponents wouldclaim that it was ineffective as was alleged in the case of theIndustrial Relations Act.    On the other hand, the unions had ingeneral complied with the requirements of the Act as regards :.industrial disputes, and it was the employers who had been unwilling to use the facilities provided by the Industrial Court.It was also argued that it would be desirable to bring home more clearly to public opinion both the grave consequences upon thebalance of payments of the continued stoppages of a major naturein the motor industry, and the fact that the industry!s troubles couldnot be laid at the Government&apos;s door.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Employment should continue to keep thesituation in the motor industry under close review, including thedesirability of a reference to the CIR.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.6
