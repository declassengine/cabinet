PARLIAMENTARY       1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the week following the christmas Recess.    If time were needed for a debate on emergency Regulations, 16 January was likely to be the mostsuitable date.Members&apos;SalariesPreviousReference:CM(73) 58thConclusions,Minute 6The Cabinet were informed that the Lord President of theCouncil would be announcing in the course of the debate onthe Motion for the Adjournment for the Christmas Recesslater that day that the Government did not intend to take any steps at present to increase the salaries or secretarialallowances payable to Members of Parliament.Parliamentary THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that inHours the interests of electricity saving, and in order to ease thetraveHing problems of Members and of Parliamentary staff,it was desirable to consider proposing some temporary changesin Parliamentary hours.    He had in mind that the House ofCommons might meet at 11. 00 am and take Questions untilNoon.    The main business would run from Noon until 6. 30 pmand the Motion for the Adjournment would be debated from 6. 30pmtill 7.00 pm; but when additional time was needed for debatingPrayers or for hastening progress on Bills there could be aEXTENSION    0  Up to two hours.    Parliament would not sit onFridays; but Private Members1 business might be taken forthe first three hours on Mondays.    Standing committees would have to meet while the House was sitting and might perhaps start at 2. 30 pm.    The Opposition, in conformitywith their general policy of playing down the seriousness of thepresent situation, would prefer that these proposals should notbe considered until towards the end of the Recess and that no announcement should be made until the House had resumed.He himself, however, considered that, if only for presentationalreasons, the right course would be to announce during the debate on the Motion for the Adjournment for the Christmas Recessthat proposals on the general lines he had outlined were beingconsidered.In discussion it was argued that it would be important to make clear that the proposed new arrangements were seen as temporary only.    On that basis they were likely to be accept-able to Government supporters.    Once they had been adoptedmany Members might be reluctant to see them abandoned;but a permanent change of this kind should be contemplated only
after very careful consideration, in particular because itwould make it virtually impossible for any Member ofParliament to engage actively in professional or other outsidework.    Moreover, the proposals would have certain practicaldisadvantages - in particular, there would be difficulty in finding convenient times for meetings of the Cabinet and of ministerial Committees.    It was however of overriding importance that Parliament should be seen to be conformingto the restrictions which were having to be accepted by the restof the community;  and psychologically it was essential to do everything possible to convince the public that the Governmentwere determined not to compromise over their Stage 3 policiesor the necessity for a three-day week.    From these points ofview an early announcement that the proposals described bythe Lord President were being considered was highly desirable.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Lord President should announce inthe debate on the Motion for the Adjournment for the christmas recess that the Government were considering proposing changesin Parliamentary hours on the lines which had been described.A final decision whether to proceed with these proposals, with or without modifications, was not necessary at this stage;  andthe Lord President should circulate final proposals to theCabinet after the holiday period.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Lord President of the Councilto proceed accordingly.Holiday The Cabinet were reminded of the importance in the present arrangements emergency of avoiding giving any impression that ministers were being inactive during the Christmas and New YearhoHday period.    It would also be helpful if Ministers whowould be in or near London would hold themselves ready toattend meetings should the state of business so require.2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Heads of State or government of the member countries of the European Communitieshad met in Copenhagen on 14 and 15 December,    When the meeting was originally proposed the intention had been to have an informal discussion concentrating on the energy situation and its political implications and covering other problems currently concerningthe Community including the progress on the work programme set by the Paris Summit of October 1972,    The arrangements had, however, been complicated by the decision that foreign ministers of the Community countries would meet in Copenhagenat the same time, and by the arrival in Copenhagen of a group ofForeign Ministers representing Arab oil exporting countries.Consequently the time available for constructive informal discussion had been rather limited but the Heads of State or Government hadbeen able to discuss the energy situation and had agreed on guide-lines for Community action.    The meeting had also made progress towards the development of political co-operation in the Community.Discussions on the internal development of the Community had beenunsatisfactory in view of the German Governments unwillingness toagree to a Regional Development Fund (RDF) on the scale which we thought necessary.    It had been agreed that the Heads of State or government should meet more frequently and the intention was thatmeetings would take place twice every year.    For the future it wouldbe important to ensure that these meetings were organised in aproductive manner.The Cabinet -1, Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisterJs statement,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatfollowing the meeting of Heads of State or Government in Copenhagenthere had been meetings of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs)and the Council of Ministers (Finance) on 17 and 18 December,    Thediscussions had been dominated by the energy situation and thedisagreement over the size of the RDF which was due to be setup by 1 January 1974.    The discussions on the RDF had not beenmade easier by the brash tactics adopted by the Germanrepresentative (State Secretary Apel).    His approach hadaccentuated the difference of view between the United Kingdomand Germany and would make it harder ultimately to find a solution.Although it was clear that all the member States except germany would be willing to settle for an RDF based on the Commissionproposal of 2,250 units of account (mua) for the first three years(and it was recognised that the United Kingdom would be preparedto move towards this figure) the Germans had not been prepared to
move from the much smaller figure which they had proposed.    Inthese circumstances there had been no alternative to our adoptingtough negotiating tactics.    He had therefore refused formally toagree to a resolution setting up a Community Energy Committee.Although this would not in practice delay the Community^preparatory work on energy the move was seen in the community as being a significant one since it implied unwillingness toco-operate in joint Community action.    The Council would meet again early in January to consider further the proposalsfor an RDF and it was to be hoped that there might by then havebeen some relaxation in the German position; if not, the situation would be very difficult.In discussion it was argued that the German Government had recently adopted aggressive tactics in other areas of Communitywork.    This appeared to reflect some concern domestically thatthe German Government had been too willing to give ground in thepast in the interests of Community solidarity; and the FederalFinance Minister (Herr Schmidt), who was influential in the formulation of German policy was strongly opposed to any extensionof Community finance which imposed an increased burden on Germany.Although our refusal to agree to Community action on energy mightbe argued to be out of proportion to the problem of establishing theRDF it should be remembered that it was Herr Schmidt in the firstplace who had made a link between progress on energy and the move to the second stage of Economic and Monetary Union,    It was right for us to make a strong response to the German attitude.    success in Community negotiations depended on being prepared to press withdetermination for national objectives;  unless we did so we would never play an effective and decisive part in Community affairs orachieve benefits for the United Kingdom,    The tactical situation on the RDF was not unfavourable to us since there was general support for the Commission^ proposal; but we must recognise thatthe Germans have to shift their position very considerably if wewere to reach agreement,.   We should not publicly move downtowards the Commission figure until it became apparent that theGermans for their part were also prepared to move.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet was agreed that the establishment of an RDF of a satisfactorysize on reasonable terms was our prime immediate objective withinthe Community and we must be prepared to press this objective withthe greatest determination.The Cabinet -2, Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisterfs summing up of the discussion.
3.        THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that in accordance with the undertaking to consider thepossibility of releasing a number of persons held under detentionbefore Christmas, 65 persons were being released on his authority.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland.
secret. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT, outlininghis strategy towards current industrial problems, said that theGovernment must not appear to be working for a major confrontationwith the unions on the issue of the Stage 3 Pay Code,    It was possiblethat the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) wantedsuch a confrontation or that their actions would produce it.   he believed that it was important for the Government to do all thatthey could to avoid a confrontation.    They must be seen to be atonce firm and reasonable.    They should seek to treat and settleeach dispute separately.    The fact that many large groups, includingthe local authority manual workers, had already accepted pay settlements within the Stage 3 Code and that others such as theNational Health Service ancillaries were about to do so should help to encourage others to follow.    Three major disputes wereoutstanding.    The Electrical Power Engineers Association had agreed to take part in a joint working party to consider a reportby the Pay Board that offered a possibility of a settlement withinthe Pay Code.    The working party was to report to the executive of the Association during the following week.    There were signs that the Executive were anxious to achieve a settlement and there seemed a reasonable chance of ending the dispute within about a fortnight.    The industrial action by the Associated Society of locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) was still disruptingcommuter services but freight services were running better than expected,, possibly because of the drivers&apos; wish to maintain their earnings before Christmas.    ASLEF had no support from the LabourParty or the Trades Union Congress (TUC).    Their dispute was notwith the Government and did not arise out of the pay policy.    He didnot propose to see the members of ASLEF at this stage but intendedto treat the dispute as one between ASLEF and the British railways board.    It was important that the Chairman of British Rail shouldanswer the case put forward publicly by ASLEF; rather than stickto the old principle of not negotiating under duress he would do better to base his response on the difficulty of negotiating with one union thatwas taking industrial action while the other unions were workingnormally.    Although there was some public feeling that the ASLEFdrivers should not be paid for work that they did not do, he would recommend that the Chairman of British Rail be left with completediscretion to decide whether to discipline the drivers.    There wasno need for the Government to make any public statement at thisstage.    It was best to leave it to the TUC and the Labour Party toexercise pressure behind the scenes.    The dispute with the NUMwas the most difficult.    He would see three members of their executive that afternoon and would advise them to take advantageof their preferential position under the Stage 3 Pay Code,    But he did not expect any response.    After the meeting he would make it plain through the Press and television that no offer could be madebeyond that available within the Pay Code.    He would try to persuade
smmrthe NUM to bring forward the next meeting of their Executive from10 January to 2 January or perhaps 27 December.    If they asked tosee him on 27 December he would agree, but as any unproductivemeeting might be seen by the public as a failure he would try to persuade them to postpone their meeting with him until the NewYear.    In the longer run, if only the moderates in the Executivewould rally their forces, it might be possible to produce someformula within the terms of Stage 3 on which a settlement couldbe based; but it was essential to choose exactly the right moment for an offer.    The report of the Pay Board on relativities mightbe helpful when it appeared in January.    At present the reportseemed likely to be expressed in general terms, showing howquestions of relativities ought to be considered; but the Chairmanof the Pay Board was considering whether the report could take account in any way of the particular problems of the energy crisis.The difficulty was that if any overt exception was made for the energyindustries3 others would see an opportunity to press for similar concessions.    Meanwhile the Government must go ahead with thearrangements to introduce the three-day working week.    On this the trades union leaders and the Labour Party had moved closer together, Mr Jack Jones being the link, and were representingthat the resulting hardships were wholly the fault of the Government.The Government must make it clear that the measures were whollythe result of the industrial action by the NUM and ASLEF, and thatif that action were brought to an end the oil shortage would persistbut the three-day working week would no longer be necessary.    Itwas important that Ministers should co-ordinate their actions andtheir speeches closely in handling the current crisis, and he hopedthat his colleagues would comment freely on the strategy that he had proposed.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Scottishambulancemen were holding a meeting the following Monday at whichit seemed likely that they would follow the local authority manual workers in accepting a settlement within the Pay Code.In discussion it was argued that the Government should not appearto use the three-day week as a threat to the unions.    The facts mustbe presented in a low key emphasising the overriding need to meet the fuel shortage.    It might help to encourage public participation if morefacts and figures could be made available.    It would be unwise to
:RETdisclose the amounts of fuel stocks or the current estimates of theperiod of possible endurance but the public might be encouraged to learn of the savings achieved by power economies, though the figuresso far (which increased from 5 per cent on 14 December to 12 per centon 18 December) were not taken from a typical period.    It was also suggested that it could be helpful to involve the voluntary organisations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet fully supported the handling of the disputes on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment.    ministers should follow this line closely in all their public statements.    Asregards publicity for fuel economies, it would be best to wait untilthe immediate effects of Christmas were over before considering whether to publish periodical figures of the economies achieved butif this were practicable it could prove an incentive to the public forfurther economies.The Cabinet -1, Took note with approval of the  PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.FuelRe strictionsPreviousReference:CM(73) 61stConclusions,Minute 5OilSupplie s1*THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saidthat he had completed negotiations with Esso by which they had agreedto maintain the effects of favoured treatment as directed by theGovernments of producing countries, so that any additional oil madeavailable to the United Kingdom by Saudi Arabia, for example, wouldnot be included in the sharing of available oil between consumingcountries.    The actual shortfall in supplies during December was now estimated at 10 per cent instead of 15 per cent as previously,and for January the current estimate was 18 per cent instead of20 per cent.    There were shortages of paraffin, for which he had increased allocations;  and stocks of fuel oil were low because of diversion to electricity generation.    On the other hand savings would arise from the operation of the three-day week.    It would be possibleto use these savings either for power generation or for industry; andhe would consider this question further when he knew the amountsavailable.    Stocks of petrol were higher at present than at the sametime in 1972; and the stocks in hand by the end of February would beless than those a year earlier by only four or five days1 supply.Similarly the supplies of diesel oil at the end of February wouldbe less than those of a year earlier by only three days&apos; supply.This showed that the present allocation system was effectivelyreducing consumption.
THE MINISTER FOR INDUSTRY said that the system by which somefirms would receive power on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday andothers on Thursday, Friday and Saturday would create difficulties for those firms that were required to work on Saturdays,    It wouldbe more convenient for industry if the arrangement were to alternateat intervals so that Saturday working was equally shared.    Alternationwould however present difficulties,    The necessary switching ofsupplies would impose an administrative strain on the electricity boards.    A further difficulty was that if it also became necessaryto impose rota cuts, these would be concentrated in the areas whereindustry was not working at the time; but under a system ofalternation some areas would have six non-working days in succession and a series of rota cuts on those days could cumulativelydisrupt essential services such as sewage and water supplies.    Forthese reasons the electricity boards had argued strongly againstalternation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatit would be necessary to make an announcement before the end ofthe current week to explain the operation of the three-day week after christmas.    The announcement should explain the immediatearrangements but should leave open the option for an alternationsystem of cuts in electricity supplies.    In the meantime^ the questionof alternating at fortnightly intervals should be discussed urgentlywith the Central Electricity Generating Board.The Cabinet -2.        Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.
5.        THE HOME SECRETARY said that at a meeting earlier that morning the Home and Social Affairs Committee had considered thequestion of empty office blocks.    It had been proposed to them that power should be sought to enable the Secretary of State for the environment compulsorily to acquire such blocks;  but the Committeehad seen considerable objection to this proposal and had preferred thesolution of amending the Housing and Planning Bill so as to give theSecretary of State for the Environment powers of compulsorymanagement.    When this proposal had been considered previously,it had been argued that it was open to the objection that at the end ofthe day the owner would still retain the building with its greatlyincreased capital value; but a new situation now existed owingto the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer of his proposals on liability of first-time lettings of buildings for capital gains tax.    The Committee had concluded that the Secretary of Statefor the Environment should on the following day make a statement inthe House of Commons announcing the decision to seek powers of compulsory management, together with the decision which theCommittee had reached in principle at an earlier meeting thatamendments should be moved to the Local Government Bill providingfor empty office blocks to be liable to a special rating surcharge,starting at 100 per cent and increasing by 100 per cent for each yearthat the building remained unoccupied.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the conclusions which had been reached by theHome and Social Affairs Committee.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda on home ownership and house building by the Secretary of State for the Environment(CP(73) 132) and the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) (CP(73) 140).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that theimmediate prospects for the house building programme were extremely discouraging.    The building societies needed to attractabout  160 million new net receipts a month in order to supportprivate housing completions of about 200, 000 a year.    But net receipts in October had been only about  90 million and in Novemberabout  80 million, while in December there was likely to be: a netoutflow.    Even at the level of private building in October, private housing starts and completions in 1974 would not exceed 165,000 each,compared with housing starts of 227,000 and about 215,000 in 1972 and
1973 and completions of 196, 000 and about 185, 000.    The Council ofthe Building Societies Association would be meeting on 11 January 1974and at that meeting might decide to increase mortgage rates stillfurther.    This would be politically disastrous; but unless steps were taken to provide more finance for housing there would be a mortgage famine and consequential further decline in the housing programme.    In these circumstances he proposed that there shouldbe urgent studies by officials of possible methods of securingadditional finance for housing from the private sector.    Possiblesources were the banks - though it would be important not to divertbank lending from productive investment - and the insurance companies, which might have scope for increasing or at anyrate stabilising their existing house purchase lending.    TheCPUS had proposed that the banks might be asked graduallyto reduce the level of their advances to property companies,the funds thus freed being lent for housing; and that the possibility should be explored of raising funds for housing in the Euro-markets.These proposals also merited examination.    The studies should beset on foot urgently., if only as a means of demonstrating theGovernments concern and thus reducing the likelihood that attheir forthcoming meeting the building societies would decide on an increase in the mortgage rate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that, in view of the present damaginglyunfavourable prospects for the housing programme, studies shouldbe put in hand urgently on the general lines proposed in the memoranda by the Secretary of State for the Environment andthe CPRS,    The possibility of making greater use of pension fundsas a source of housing finance should not be overlooked; but there might be difficulty in pressing the banks for assistance at a timewhen they were cutting back severely on their non-priority lending.Moreover, it was important not to encourage further inflationary pressure on the money supply.    The Secretary of State for the environment and the Paymaster General should accordingly urgentlyconsider, in the light of the discussion, how studies on the general lines proposed could best be carried out.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the paymaster general, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office20 December 1973
