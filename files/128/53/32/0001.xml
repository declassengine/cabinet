1. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that,following the breakdown of discussions with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the decision of the Executive of theNational Union of Mineworkers (NUM) to call a national coal strike he had decided to seek a Dissolution of Parliament sothat the country might express its views in a General Election.The queen s consent had been obtained by telegram, and an ,announcement would be made at 12. 45 pm that day.Prorogation and Dissolution would both take place on thefollowing day.    Polling would be on 28 February: the firstmeeting of the new Parliament on 6 March: and the StateOpening of Parliament on 12 March.The Prime Minister said that during an election campaign theGovernment retained its responsibility to govern and ministers would of course continue to be fully responsible for the work oftheir Departments.    It was however customary for Ministers to observe reasonable discretion as regards the initiation of any new action of a continuing or long term character and also, forexample, in the making of new appointments to statutory boardsfor which they were answerable.    In discharging Governmentengagements Ministers should seek to avoid creating any impression that they ware using such occasions for party political purposes; and, before undertaking to fulfil inter-national commitments, they should consider carefully whetherthe subject matter was such that they could speak with theauthority proper to a representative of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment.   But clearly Ministerial representation at the energy Action Group in Washington and in meetings of theCouncil of Ministers in Brussels would continue to be necessary as soon as the Dissolution had been publicly announced,Ministers would be advised by the Cabinet Office of certainnecessary arrangements which, by long convention, were made during the period of an election.    Guidance would be circulated on the use of official transport during the campaign and on thearrangements for broadcasting, Press articles and interviewsby Ministers.    An Election Business Committee was being established under the chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor toprovide a forum for the clearance of statements of policy bythe Government; to co-ordinate, as appropriate, commentsfrom Departments on the guidance prepared for the use Of-Government Party candidates in dealing with enquiries put tothem during the election campaign;  and to consider replies by departments to similar enquiries from Opposition Party ^candidates, organisations and members of the public.    the paymaster General, the Minister for Trade and ConsumerAffairs and the Lord Privy Seal would be the other members.The Lord Privy Seal, who would also be taking the dailymeetings of the Conservative Party&apos;s Questions of ProcedureCommittee, would be mainly responsible for day to day liaison between the Election Business Committee and the Central Office
The election was being held at short notice and in ah acutely-difficult industrial situation.    Urgent operational decisionsmight be needed on a day to day basis eg in relation to powerallocations, picketing, etc.    He had therefore decided toestablish a Committee under the chairmanship of theLord President to provide Ministerial supervision for the workof the Civil Contingencies Unit and to take the necessary       )idecisions on ways of maintaining the endurance of the, nationin matters directly connected with the current emergency.The terms of reference and composition of this.Committeewould be promulgated later in the -day.    It might have to meet at short notice and the members should ensure that if they werenot themselves available because of election business theycould be represented by one of their supporting Ministers or,failing that, their Permanent Secretary who should be authoriseto take decisions on their behalf.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.ii2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Leaders of theLabour and Liberal Parties were being informed of theintention to Dissolve Parliament at 11.30 am.    Thereafterarrangements would have to be made through the usual channelsfor the rearrangement of business.    In the new circumstances it was most undesirable that the second day of the emergencydebate should take place and proceedings should be arranged to avoid this.   It was also undesirable that there should be anyunnecessary Ministerial statements after Questions or thiswould increase the pressure on the Government to make astatement about their next move in the miners1 dispute.In discussion it was noted that the House of Commons wouldhave to deal with an Appropriation Bill to allot Vote Supply andwith the Pensions (Increase) Bill.    These would not howevernecessarily take long and it was for consideration whether to try to carry through a Bill to implement recommendationsfrom the Speaker&apos;s Conference on candidates expenses in an election campaign.    This might be opposed by Liberal Partymembers but the Speaker&apos;s recommendations had beenspecifically put forward to meet the contingency of an earlyelection and it would be to the Government&apos;s advantage for thechange to be made.    Otherwise there would be a&apos;greater riskof outright disregard of rules which Ministers would themselves have scrupulously to observe.The Cabinet -Approved the proposal to introduce a Bill to implement recommendations from the Speaker&apos;conference on candidates expenses, and invited the Lord President, in consultation with theParliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, todecide whether this should be taken before or after the Appropriation Bill and the Pensions(Increase) BiU.3. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that he   .proposed writing to Mr   Gormley, the President of the      I j   j!National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), asking the.union to suspindustrial action until after the election so that the country could consider the issues involved in a calmer atmosphere andalso to the Leaders of the Labour and Liberal Parties invitingthem to support his request to Mr. Gormley.In discussion a number of amendments were agreed to thedraft letter to Mr Gormley.   .
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat in an election campaign the supporters of the Governmentwould have to answer questions about their proposals for ending the miners&apos; strike if they were to form the next Government.He suggested that the answer should be that the case was to bereferred to the Pay Board for an examination on the lines of thereport on pay relativities (Cmnd 5535).    The examination should begin at once, and the Pay Board should call on all interested parties including the trade unions to give evidence, though the&apos;&apos;&apos;unions might refuse.    Any award recommended by the Pay board should be backdated to I1 March, and since this was a point ofgreat public interest it should be made clear from the beginning.If the Cabinet agreed that the reference to the Pay Board shouldbe made it should be mentioned in the broadcast that the PrimeMinister was to make that evening.    The wording of the reference would have to be published, and he would propose to consult a small group of other Ministers about the drafting.After Parliament was dissolved, he would consult theChairman of the Pay Board, the Confederation of British Industry(CBI), and the Trades Union Congress (TUC).If the letter to the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) did notpersuade them to call off the strike during the period of theelection campaign, the question would arise of a possible cooling-off period under the Industrial Relations Act,    He had been advised, however, that the Government might fail to obtain an injunction, as it would be necessary to demonstrate that a cooling-off period would be conducive to a settlement of the dispute by negotiation or arbitration.    The NUM would contest an injunctionand would be likely to appeal if one were granted.    If unsuccessfulthey might defy the injunction.    All this could have damagingeffects in an election campaign.    On the other hand if theGovernment did not seek the injunction, they would have toexplain to their supporters why they were not making use of a remedy provided under the Industrial Relations Act.    his recommendation was that, if there were any risk of Ifailure, itwould be better not to apply for an injunction, as it was alwaysdamaging for a Government to lose a case in court.In discussion it was argued that, in referring the case of theminers to the Pay Board, there might be advantage insimultaneously referring the case of the nurses, whose relative position by comparison with industrial workers had greatly[i   Ideteriorated during the last 31 years.    This move would be popular and would demonstrate that the Government took accountof the interests of groups other than those that took industrial action.    But a similar case could be made on behalf of the [Iteachers and numerous other groups such as postmen and firemen.The question of which groups to single out for early reference tothe Pay Board required more thorough consideration.
In discussion of the proposed application for a cooling-off period,it was agreed that it would be unwise for the Government to attemptany action that would risk failure in the courts.    In explaining this,there was no need to enter into any question of legal advice; theSecretary of State for Employment could say that he did not feel able to give an affidavit that a cooling-off period would conduceto a settlement of the dispute&apos;.&apos;   It was suggested that the supporters of the Government might argue that, having gone to thelimit of the possibilities for reasonable negotiation provided    1under the Act, the Government must now seek authority for what-ever further measures might be necessary to deal with the dispute.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the mineworkers&apos; case should be referred tothe Pay Board for an examination on the lines of the relativitiesreport, and he would make this clear in his broadcast that evening.    Since the CBI had said that they did not want the pay board to be the body responsible for carrying out such examinationsand the TUC had reserved their position, it would have to be explained that this was only a temporary arrangement and thatthe question of setting up a separate relativities board would bere-examined after the election.    Although it might not bepossible to reach an immediate decision on any other references to the Board, it should be made clear that theljcaee of the minerswas only one of a number of cases to be dealt with in that way.As regards a cooling-off period, the Cabinet agreed that it wouldbe a mistake to invoke this provision of the Industrial relations act during an election campaign.    The Secretary of State for employment, should prepare a brief, in case the question was raised during the campaign.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.The Cabinet was informed that as a result of the discussion attheir last meeting the Lord Advocate and the Attorney Generalwere ready to make public statements in explanation of the ilavsrabout picketing.    It would however be premature to make suchstatements until it was certain that the miners&apos; strike would takeplace.5 ;   M
ELECTRICITYRESTRICTIONSPreviousReference:CM(74) 5thConclusions5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Energy about the response to a coalminers1 strike (CP(74) 8).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had examined the likely effect of a coal miners&apos; strike on supplies of energy.    It was clear that supplies of electricity were not the limiting factor in determining endurance and a balance had to be struck between conserving fuel supplies and maintaining theindustrial and commercial life of the nation.    He proposed that athree-day working week on the present pattern should be continued;that the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) should beauthorised to purchase fuel oil on the spot market within a pricelimit to be agreed by the Department of Energy, and that an examination should be made of the need to have cuts in domestic and commercial oil use in order to release more oil for the    li11&apos;   nCEGB.    Oil stocks during February were likely to be good and he saw no reason to introduce further cuts before the GeneralElection.    He had put forward proposals for relaxations in theelectricity restrictions during the period up to the General Election.These included a proposal that restrictions on the hours of television broadcasting should be removed during this period.2.      Invited the Home Secretary to decide, inconsultation with the Lord Advocate and the attorney General, whether and if so when, theirstatements should be made.&apos;   . - &apos; i &quot; &apos;irHI Prices THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that theSub-Committee on Prices of the Economic Policy Committee had discussed the retail price of petrol the previous day, and the     mmajority of the Committee had agreed that an increase of 8p a gallon should be authorised, with the Minister for Energysupporting an increase of lOp.    He would now agree to an increaseof 8p, so that there was no need to discuss the point in Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat he might have to raise later the question of a consequentialincrease in the tax rebate for public transport.The Cabinet -Took note.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the Cabinet endorsed the proposals put forward by theSecretary of State for Energy for the maintenance of fuel and electricity supplies during a coal miners&apos; strike, includingthe removal of restrictions on the hours of television broadcasting.The Chancellor of the Exchequer should be kept fully informed as to the state of negotiations by the CEGB for the purchase of fuel oil on the spot market.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime&apos;Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion. \\- n    &apos;:M if/ - SS
6. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF lancaster said that the Ministerial Committee on Europe (equalise) had considered the guaranteed price for milk in the United kingdom to be set under the 1974 Annual Farm Price Review.    Milkproducers faced very large cost increases.    The Farmers&apos;Unions were pressing for an increase in the pool price of milkof at least 5 pence per gallon and there was a reasonableeconomic justification for this figure.    There was doubt as towhether an increase of this size could be paid within theCommunity rules governing agricultural transition.    If theCommission would not accept our proposal we should need to seek a derogation from the Council of Ministers and this woulddelay settlement of the Annual Review and undermine our negotiating position in Council discussions on prices under theCommon Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 1974-75.    It might,however, be possible to get Commission agreement to an award of about 5 pence per gallon made up partly of an increase in theprice for 1974-75, and partly of a retrospective payment for1973-74.    Any lesser award would lead to the strongestcriticism from the farming industry and we should therefore pressour case with the Commission with a view to an early announce-ment.    It would be necessary to decide separately whether thecost of such an award should be passed on to the consumer orborne in total or in part by the Exchequer.In discussion it was argued that although there was a cogentcase for a big increase in the producer price for milk, farmincomes generally had almost doubled in the last 4 years andexcessive profits were being made in some sectors.    TheGovernment was vulnerable to criticism for not attempting tocurb such profits and the situation was particularly delicate in viewof farther increases in the food price index to be announced inFebruary.    An. award of no more than 4. 5 pence per gallonshould suffice to sustain milk production; to press for 5 pence,even though part of it would be retrospective, would undermineour negotiating position on CAP prices.    We should not be ableto resist the proposed increase in the e.c. beef price which would automatically increase consumer prices here.    It would alsobefore the end of the year lead to support buying of beef whichwould be very damaging to the Government.On the other hand it was argued that unless an award was madeequivalent to 5 pence per gallon milk production might by next winter be insufficient to satisfy demand for liquid consumption.At present levels of profitability production was falling and unduenumbers of dairy cows and in-calf heifers were being slaughtered.The Government would be open to, severe criticism if it did not actto avert a threatened shortage of milk.8
It was also argued that a decision to increase the producer price for milk without increasing the consumer price would haveunacceptable consequences for public expenditure.    When wewere drastically reducing public expenditure it would be wrong to allow the Milk Fund to run into a deficit which could total 225 million by the end of 1974-75.    It would be preferable toincrease the consumer price.THE PRIME MINISTER,//summing up the discussion said that theCabinet was agreed that the Minister of Agriculture should press the Commission not to oppose a total award equivalent to about pence per gallon on the pool price for milk.    He should seek to avoid having to ask the Council of Ministers for a derogationfrom Community rules and should give no commitment at thisstage as to whether the Exchequer or the consumer would bear the increased cost.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;sSlimming up of the discussion.if     a2.      Invited the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;summing up in discussing the United Kingdom milkprice with e.c. representatives.9
7. THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that Grenada had become independent that morning.    Political tension continued inGrenada but there had been no violence in recent days and theindependence ceremony had not been marred by any untowardincidents.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS said that Parliament had beeninformed that the Government had agreed in principle to a request from the United States Government for the expansion ofthe facilities at Diego Garcia, including improvements to theanchorage and to the airfield.    Use of the facilities would be amatter of joint decision by the two Governments.    We and the americans had informed the Governments of a number of othercountries, especially those in the Indian Ocean area, and there actions had not been such as to give us cause for concern.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs said that a section of the Jordanian Army had expresseddiscontent and were reported to have called for the replacement of the Jordanian Prime Minister.    Their complaints were against their financial situation;  they did not appear to have any politicalobjective.    Some reports in the Press had given an exaggeratedpicture.    King Hussein,who had been out of Jordan, had now returned and the situation appeared to be fully under control.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs said that we had proposed to the French Governmentthat in view of our failure to agree in bilateral negotiations on the division of the Continental Shelf, we should approach theInternational Court of Justice jointly with a request for a decision.We had not yet received a reply from the French Government.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Minister ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.Cabinet Office&apos;7 February 1974 10
