It seemed unlikely, however, that the TUC would be able to exert muchinfluence over the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) orthe Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen(ASLEF).    The NUM were likely, at their meeting thefollowing day, to reaffirm their present ban on overtime.    TheNational Coal Board were not now inclined to make any further changes in their present offer.    He would have to consider inthe light of events whether to meet the NUM Executive, butthis could only be of presentational value.    There appeared to be rather more hope of a settlement of the dispute with the electrical power engineers.    The Electricity Council were due to meet the electrical Power Engineers Association (EPEA) the following week, and the Pay Board considered that some additional offercould be made.    If the dispute with the EPEA could be ended,this would be of great help if it proved necessary to impose rotacuts.In these circumstances, the best way to bring pressure to bearon the trades unions and the TUC was to shock them by stressingthe risk of reduced employment, while at the same timeincreasing our capacity for endurance to the maximum possible extent.    It would also be necessary to appeal to moderate opinion by seeking to enlist help in the national interest.    On the occasion of previous disputes with the coal miners, the Government had had to yield in February.    Even if it now proved possible to holda ballot, the outcome would probably be in favour of a continuedban on overtime.    It seemed imperative therefore to extend the capacity to endure industrial action to March, when other factors would begin to work in the Governments favour.    Thiswould give the Government the maximum room for manoeuvreand offered a chance of winning through within the limits of stage 3.
The Cabinet -1- Took note of the statement by theSecretary of State for Employment.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY,reviewing the situation on oil supplies, said that the delivery of crude oil in November had been at about the expected level:deliveries in December were likely to be about 14 per centbelow the expected level, in January 18 per cent below and inFebruary 14 per cent below.    There were two areas ofparticular concern: the provision of naphtha for the gas industryand the supply of fuel oil for power stations.    The first of these could be minimised by switching from other products at the refinery.   To help with the second he had already instructed the oil companies to supply more fuel to power stations.    However,the situation at the power stations was now likely to worsenbecause of the effect of the ASLEF overtime ban, the decreasein output from nuclear power stations as a result of industrial action by the electrical power engineers, and the morepessimistic estimate by the National Coal Board of the effect ofthe Christmas holiday on coal production.    The combined effect of these factors would be to bring about enforcedelectricity disconnections in mid-January and, within two orthree weeks, generating capacity would fall to the level reached in the miners&apos; strike in 1972 when some essential services werein difficulty and factories on the point of closing.    If theelectricity supply industry were to get through the winter withoutmajor disruption, immediate action would have to be taken tobring about savings of about 20 per cent in output.    He proposedthat 11 per cent of this saving should come from industry and per cent from the domestic user.    In order to achieve thesesaviogs he proposed that Orders should be made reducing;supplies to industrial, commercial and domestic consumers.   Forthe period from 14 December to 29 December industrial and commercial consumers would have their electricity supplieslimited to 5 days in all.    For the period after 31 December,they would have electricity supplies on only three prescribeddays out of each week.    Large continuous process users wouldbe exempted from these cuts:  they would be limited to 65 percent of their normal electricity consumption each week.    Electricspace heating for domestic consumers would be limited to oneroom where no other heating was available.    The Orders wouldname certain essential businesses which would be exempt fromthese restrictions.    Schools and universities would be exemptand special undertakings such as the construction of oilplatforms for the North Sea could be examined individually.
In discussion doubt was expressed about the adequacy of the cuts.If fuel stocks at the power stations reached crisis levels by theend of March, the coal miners would be sure to know about this and to arrange their industrial action accordingly.    On the otherhand, the magnitude of fuel stocks could be monitored continuouslyand if there were any sign of a deterioration, more severe cutscould be introduced quickly.    Concern was expressed aboutadverse effects on food distribution and about the social effects of having large numbers of people unemployed for three days inthe week.    This was likely to bring about a deterioration in thesituation in Northern Ireland.    There would also have to be someexamination of the rules relating to the payment of unemploymentbenefit;  under the present rules large numbers of workpeopleemployed for only 3 days a week might be eligible for the flat rateof benefit.In further discussion it was pointed out that many people in thecountrywere now in the mood where, above all, they wish to try and make a personal contribution to the solution of the present crisis.    But any attempt to capitalise on this mood was likely tobe counter-productive if it involved taking over activities such asdelivery of coal supplies, which had been affected by industrial action.    On the other hand, voluntary organisations such as the&quot;Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service should be encouraged to continueto expand the work they had started when the fuel crisis began.It was argued that the manner in which these measures were presented needed care if the reasons for them were to be fully understood.    The Government should be completely open withpeople: there should be a clear statement that the Government was determined to see the country through the present industrial andenergy crisis and would take all necessary action howeverunpalatable to achieve this end.    In order to help public under-standing there might be advantage in arranging to producesituation reports every few days.    So far as the industrial disputes were concerned the right course was to keep firmly tothe strategic policy already announced, while retaining the abilityfor rapid tactical response within that strategy as the situationdeveloped.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the measures of the order proposed would have aserious effect on industrial output and on the economy of thecountry as a whole but they were needed if we were to have any chance of surviving until the end of March.    He proposed to makea statement to Parliament on^the- following day and to broadcastimmediately afterwards. In preparation for this statement,the lord president of&quot; the Council should arrange immediately&apos;for&quot; the CivilContingencies Unit (CCU) to examine the Secretary of State for trade and Industry&apos;s proposals in detail.    The Secretary of State3
for Social Services should examine urgently the point which hadbeen raised about the eligibility for unemployment benefit ofworkers in firms affected by the electricity restrictions.Economic THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the countrySituation was now facing the gravest economic crisis since the second world War.    He had concluded that immediate steps must betaken to reduce demand, in order to make some impact on aworsening balance of payments and to restore confidence in sterling.    An economic assessment had been carried out on theassumption of adequate oil supplies and no industrial unrest, butoil prices twice as high as in 1972-73.    On these assumptions,and assuming that sterling remained at the present level of19 per cent below Smithsonian parities, and Stage 3 was fullyobserved, the economy would have grown by about 3 per cent between the second half of 1973 and the second half of 1974.The faster rise in prices would have led to the threshold beingtriggered twice, and personal consumption would have been increasing at a rate of only 1 per cent, compared with the forecast of 3j per cent predicted at the beginning of Stage 3.Unemployment would have remained roughly constant at 450, 000.Even on this basis, the balance of payments would not have beenacceptable.    The current deficit might have been of the order of 3, 000 million in 1974, and during the first half of the year itwould have been running at an annual rate of  4, 000 million.Of this, about  1, 000 million would be due to the increased oilprices, and this might have been acceptable to internationalopinion, since the general feeling among Finance Ministers wasthat the industrial world would need to borrow to meet oil deficitsif it was to avoid a deflationary spiral.    But a balance of paymentsdeficit at an annual rate of  4, 000 million would make it impossibleto sustain confidence in sterling, and it should be noted that anyfurther depreciation in sterling would add considerably to the deficit, as well as having undesirable consequences for prices.This assessment had, however, now anyway been overtaken by events.    Oil supplies were not adequate,  and the best workinghypothesis was that deliveries in 1974 would be 15 per cent down on 1972-73.    It was also expected that oil prices would more thandouble; the increase would probably be around Z\ times.    the shortfall in oil deliveries would produce a fall in industrial production of 10 per cent, and in the second half of 1974 output would be 8 per cent less than it would otherwise have been.This implied that in place of an economic growth rate of 3j per centthere would be a negative growth rate of 4-1 per cent, so that output would be at the same level as at the end of 1972.    Thefall in output would be greater than the fall in consumer demand.The prospects for our exports should however be satisfactory,since although other countries would be affected by the oil shortage,they would not need to take such stringent measures, since theywould be starting from a better balance of payments position.
In order to produce even a marginal improvement in the balanceof payments, it might prove necessary to cut demand by  3, 000million.    Because of the degree of uncertainty in the forecasts,he did not however suggest that such a reduction should be madeat once.    It was however essential to do enough to get throughuntil March, and he therefore proposed a reduction in demand of around  1, 500 million.    He did not advise an increase in either direct or indirect taxation, since increases in direct taxation would hit people who were already being placed on short time, while increased indirect taxation would put up prices.The major burden therefore must fall on reducing the demand ofthe public sector.   In 1970, public expenditure had been 49- 9per cent of national income, compared with 43.7 per cent in1964.    In 1974-75, on the original basis of a growth rate of3j per cent, it would have risen to 50 per cent.    With a nilgrowth rate, the proportion would be 51. 7 per cent;  and with a negative growth rate the proportion would be higher still, unlessaction was taken.    Even if the growth rate was nil, the shortfall in net output would have been  2, 500 million, and with a negativegrowth rate, the shortfall could be  5, 000 million.    He proposedtherefore that public expenditure in 1974-75 should be reduced by 1, 000 million, by means of a 20 per cent reduction in capitalexpenditure and a 10 per cent reduction in expenditure onprocurement.    The energy industries and housing investment would be exempted from these reductions.    A 20 per cent reduction in capital expenditure seemed preferable to an extensionof the existing moratorium, since it left more room for flexibility in adjusting priorities within particular programmes.    Thecapital programmes would anyway have been held back byshortages of materials such as steel and cement.    By limiting the reductions in expenditure to capital programmes and procure-ment, the effect on employment would be minimised.    There wouldbe advantage in restricting the production of Concorde to 16 aircraftbut it would not be possible to reach agreement with the FrenchGovernment on this within the timescale now envisaged.    It was for consideration whether Maplin Airport should be furtherdeferred.He also proposed that there should be a reduction in the presentsubsidies on coal and electricity prices.    These should beincreased to the maximum permitted by the Stage 3 Code.    If itwas considered necessary to protect supplementary benefitrecipients from the consequent increase in their fuel bills, eachsuch household might be given a flat weekly addition of 25p, at a cost of  3 million a month.    He was also discusBing separatelywith the Prime Minister the possibility of some action to dealwith profits from property development; and restrictions on hire purchase were also under consideration.5
In discussion, there was general agreement that public expenditure would need to make a major contribution to thenecessary reduction in demand.    Some doubt was howeverexpressed whether the measures proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer would release enough resources for export,or have a sufficiently vigorous impact on public opinion.    Atthe present moment, people were expecting severe measures and would understand their necessity; but this mood might not last till March or April, and if further measures were likelyto be needed at that time, it might be preferable to strengthen the present package by some increases in taxation.    At a timewhen weekly wage-earners were facing the prospect of short-time working, the better off should be seen to be bearing their share of the burden.    Action to curb profits from propertyspeculation, although necessary, was not enough to me et thispoint.    An increase in the standard rate of income tax would itself hit the wage-earners whose earnings would anyway bereduced; and it would also affect the lower band of salary-earners who had to meet substantial increases in mortgageinterest.    But an increase in the higher rates of tax was not open to the same objections.    Its demand effect would be negligible, and it could not therefore act as a substitute for public expenditure savings; but public opinion would be influencedless by the demand effect than by the extra tax receipts whichmight be as much as  40 million.    The possibility of an increasein some indirect taxes should also not be ruled out, although theeffect on the retail price index was an obvious difficulty.    Anincrease in value-added tax would be inappropriate, but highertaxes on less essential goods such as tobacco or alcohol wouldbe seen as a reasonable response to an emergency situation.An increase in the tax on petrol prices might also be considered.While such measures would raise the cost of living, this had tobe balanced against the fact that if the measures taken were insufficient to maintain confidence in sterling, the consequentfall in the exchange rate would also raise prices, and this wouldhurt the poor more than an increase in, say, the tobacco duty.In subsequent discussion, the following points were made -a.      A large part of the proposed public expenditurereductions would fall on local authorities.    While thecapital expenditure was largely under the control of central government, current expenditure on procurementwas not.    It would be necessary therefore to reopen therate support grant negotiations and indicate to the localauthority associations the reductions which theGovernment expected them to make.    It must be recognisedthat if they did not co-operate fully, any surplusexpenditure would fall on the ratepayers, and this couldcause some hardship as well as increasing the retail price index.   The opportunity might also be taken to stress the importance of holding down local authoritystaff numbers.
b. The prospect of a negative rate of economic growthundermined the whole basis of the Stage 3 Code, and therewas an economic case for cutting back on the provisionsincluded in it.    But this would make it virtually impossible to solve the present industrial troubles;  andthe economic forecasts were anyway subject to greatuncertainty.c. There seemed a good case for allowing energyprices to rise, and there might be a case for extendingthis to the prices of some other services which were large users of energy, such as transport fares.    Ifprices were allowed to rise, the threshold arrangementsassumed critical importance, and the effect on thosereceiving social security benefits would also need to beconsidered if the Government were to retain the supportof public opinion.    The proposed flat rate weekly increasein supplementary benefit should be helpful, and wouldseem preferable to an equivalent lump sum payment.But food prices were more important in the weekly budgetthan electricity or coal prices, and there would beincreasing pressure to subsidise the price of bread.d. Oil prices in the United Kingdom were at presentlow compared with those of other consumer countries,and there was a case for allowing them to rise so as tomaintain the flow of supplies.    An increase in the tax onpetrol would seem more difficult to justify than a reductionin the subsidy on other energy prices, since it wouldappear as a deliberate accentuation of an already difficult situation.    Even if it could be defeaded to public opinionat home, careful consideration would have to be given toits effect on negotiations with the oil producers.    (e. The public expenditure reductions would be a relatively slow-acting economic regulator.    Somerestraint of hire purchase and other consumer creditwould therefore also seem desirable.    The tax exemption of bank interest might also be reconsidered.    Any changein this exemption would however be contrary to theGovernments election manifesto, and would anyway take time to work out.    It was arguable that if the change wasto be made, it would be inappropriate to do it at a timewhen many small firms would be in financial difficultiesdue to disruption of supplies.7
f.       Even with the most severe measures, the impact on the forecast balance of payments deficit would only bemarginal.    It would be necessary to borrow abroad forsome considerable time before a turn round could beachieved.    As other countries would also be faced withbalance of payments problems, there was a risk of downturn in international trade.    The amount of scope for increasing our exports was therefore open to considerable uncertainty.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had had a useful initial exchange of views, and theywould resume their discussion the following day on the basis ofa paper circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    In themeantime it was important that the utmost discretion should bemaintained about the matters which the Cabinet had discussed.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office14 December 19738
