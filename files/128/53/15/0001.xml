L THE HOME SECRETARY said that it had not proved possible,as requested by the Cabinet that morning, to reach agreement on astatement about the firemen&apos;s pay agreement.    For his part heentirely accepted that it would be wrong for the Government to convey any impression that they were anticipating the legislation on pay which would be in force in November 1974,    On the otherhand he did not believe that the firemen would refrain from industrial action if the Government merely noted their objective and thenpointed out that the reduction in working hours could proceed onlyin accordance with the maintenance of fire cover and the provisionsof the counter-inflation policy.    It would as a minimum be necessaryto say that Ministers supported this objective and that, althoughprogress towards it must be governed by counter-inflation policy,the Home Departments would seek to ensure that consideration wasgiven to the practical steps, such as the maintenance of fire cover,training and more effective use of manpower which would make it practicable, but without any commitment, for all fire brigades towork to a 48-hour week from November 1974.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hewould still prefer a shorter statement which would avoid any hostageto the future such as the Government had criticised other employers,particularly the nationalised industries, for giving.    He was increasingly confirmed in his view that it would be dangerous to give way to militancy in this case.    The Government ran therisk of being accused of side-stepping the provisions of their ownPay Code in respect of the public service when it suited them.    Ifexpectations of high pay awards for the year 1974-75 were created,the Government would then find themselves in the position either of having to draft a new Code which took little account of the economicrealities or of maintaining a reaKstic Code which would then leavelittle scope for compensating those who were the victims of genuineanomalies.In discussion it was argued that a statement on the lines proposedby the Home Secretary might still appear to involve a commitment to a reduction in firemen&apos;s hours to 48 by November 1974, which itwould be impossible to achieve and which would in any case be in breach of the Stage 3 policy.    On the other hand, whilst the firemenmight accept some more restricted interpretation by the Pay Boardof the provision for unsocial hours as part of the main pay agreement,they would not be satisfied without an assurance that genuine progress towards the implementation of the Cunningham recommendation onhours of work would be possible by November 1974.    The Governmentwould not be able to held public opinion in the face of a generalfiremen&apos;s strike, particularly in Northern Ireland.    It was thereforeboth right on merits and realistic to allow preparations for a reductionin hours to 48 to be made, so that if the Pay Code in November 1974.
permitted it, a reduction might then be made.    The situation wouldbe different if the Pay Board rejected the agreement and the firementhen went on strike: but the Government should not adopt so inflexiblean approach to unduly long hours that their counter-inflation policy would appear to the public not to be fair and the legislative backingfor it could well then be undermined,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus sion, said that anumber of alternative versions of the draft statement had been proposed in discussion, and the Home Secretary should now prepare a revised draft taking account of the points made, which he would consider further with the Ministers most closely concerned.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing upby the Prime Minister of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary to prepare a revised draft statement accordingly^RATESUPPORTGRANTPreviousReference:CM(73) 52ndConclusions,Minute 72. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of issues relatingto rate support grant.    They had before them memoranda by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland (CP(73) 122), the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(73) 123) and the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(73) 124),Distribution THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thata small group of Ministers which, at the Prime Ministers request,had recently met under his chairmanship, had come to the conclusionthat changes were inevitable in the distribution scheme which appliedat present.    Given that a new foi*mula had to be found, they had concluded that the best arrangements would consist of a domesticelement fixed at 10p, with further additions in areas where rates would otherwise go up because of loss of grant or the effects of there organisation of water and sewerage;  a resources element fixed at 27-1 per cent of total grant;  and a needs element which wouldfeyjtjk contain the special allowance  or the South East already proposedby the Secretary of State for the Environment, though with a weightingfor London itself lower than the proposed 5 per cent, the actual figure
being such as would ensure that the assistance &quot;which Londonreceived would not exceed the present year&apos;s level.    It had beendecided that the needs element should also contain a special weighting,comparable to that of the South East, which would benefit the non-metropolitan local authorities in the West Midlands,    It had subsequently been found that the benefit which would accrue to the West Midlands from the proposed new weighting was verysmall; but it was still probably worth making the change, if only for presentational reasons.    Finally,, he and his colleagues had concluded that, having regard to the danger that the higher resourceselement and the greater protection proposed for domestic ratepayerswould encourage increased expenditure by local authorities^ the spending Departments should issue a joint circular in stringentterms enjoining those local authorities which gained from the newdistribution arrangements not to make corresponding increases intheir spending programmes.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with the proposed arrangements, though it was noted that there were still some areas,particularly Wales, where they would not have a beneficial effect onthe level of the rate burden.    They were however at this st&amp;ge no more than a basis for discussions with the local authorities; and if those discussions revealed that they might have unforeseen adverse effects, the Cabinet could be informed.    It was noted that thearrangements would not apply to Scotland, where the timetable for the settlement of rate support grant ran about two months behindthat for England and Wales; but that the local authorities in scotland would expect no less favourable treatment than had been received by those in England and Wales,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed the proposals for the distribution of the.tesupport grant set out in the memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Northern Ireland.    They would however wish to be informed ofany serious unforeseen anomalies which might come to X*gh  *h thecourse of discussions with the local authorities.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing upof this part of their discussion by the Prime Minister,Total THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that  Grant he was proposing that total relevant expenditure by local authoritiesin 1974-75 should be taken as  5,258 million - ie the forecast levelof expenditure by local authorities in that year less the reduction of
 81 million which the Government had announced in May,    If theacceptable increase in the average domestic rate burden were taken as 7 per cent (which was the threshold figure for Stage 3 of counter-inflationary policies), the total grant required would be  3S657million8 representing 59.8 per cent of relevant expenditure.    Sucha settlement would not be regarded as over-generous by the localauthorities; but the Governments first priority must be to limit the increase in the domestic rate burden.    In the context of counter-inflationary policies, the Government would be able to point to theenhanced domestic element, and also to the agreed increases in thescale of statutory deductions from gross rateable value and the improved scheme of rate rebates.In discussion, general agreement was expressed with these proposals;but it was stressed that in order to restrain expenditure by localauthorities it was important that the proposed circular should bein stringent terms and should be as specific as possible, indicatingto local authorities the kinds of choices between different programmes which they would have to make.    It was argued however that there might be some difficulty in securing the reductions in local authority expenditure which had already been agreed, in particular becauseprogrammes for developing the personal social services seemed likely to be disproportionately hard hit,    So far as the domesticrate burden was concerned, an increase of 7 per cent on averageseemed tolerable; but the effect of the proposed new formula fordistributing rate support grant would be that the corresponding increase in the industrial and commercial sector would be about20 per cent.    This however was to a considerable extent only ajustifiable reversal of the shift in favour of industry and commercewhich had resulted from the recent revaluation.    Moreover, ratepayments were only a small percentage of total industrial costs;and it must be accepted that any measures likely to assist the successof Stage 3 of counter-inflationary policies were in the long-terminterest of industry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the accepted level of relevant expenditure by local authorities in 1974-75 must reflect in full the reductions of  81 million which the Government had announcedearlier in the year.    If there were any difficulties over securingthe necessary reductions, the Ministers concerned should discussthe matter urgently with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    It was undesirable that the average domestic rate burden should increase by more than 7 per cent;  and on that basis rate support grant wouldbe fixed at 59,8 per cent of total relevant expenditure.    TheSecretary of State for the Environment should now undertakeconsultations with the local authorities accordingly.    The Cabinet
noted that Increase Orders were needed for 1972-73 and 1973-74 and agreed that the Secretary of State should make such Orders inconsultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury.The Cabinet -2. Took note,, with approval, of the PrimeMinisterls summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to proceed accordingly.
3. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that news had just been received that the SociaHst International was to hold anemergency meeting in London, at the invitation of the Labour Party,on Sunday 11 November in order to discuss the Middle East situation.The leaders of more than 20 Socialist Parties, including Herr Brandt,were expected to attend.    It also seemed likely, although this was notyet certain, that Mrs Golda Meir would be present.    A meeting ofthis kind would raise awkward political problems in relation to ourposture in the Middle East conflict and some of those attending would present an obvious security target.    An intelligence assessment wasbeing made by the Joint Intelligence Committee and it might benecessary to activate special precautions for dealing with anyincidents over the weekend.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that the trial of the 10 persons accused of being responsible for the carbomb explosions in London in the spring would be coming to anend shortly.    It was not possible to foresee precisely when the judge would finish his summing up or when sentences were likelyto be passed but it could well be towards the end of the following week.    The Irish Republican Army were well able to follow thecourse of the trial and there would be a risk of incidents if sentenceswere passed.    Precautions were being taken, including a specificreminder to Government Departments and other public bodies, and ministers should have the importance of Departmental disciplinewell in mind.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister6 sstatement.Cabinet Office9 November 1973
