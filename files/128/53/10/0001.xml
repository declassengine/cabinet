1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had met the American Secretary of State the previous evening when Dr Kissinger stopped in London on his way backto Washington from his visits to Moscow and Tel Aviv0    It seemed clear from their conversation that in concentrating their efforts onobtaining the ceasefire, the Russians and Americans had givenlittle thought to the need to police it,,    If a ceasefire w^re achievedon the Syrian front there should not be great practical difficulty in maintaining it since the salient held by the Israelis was continuous.On the southern fronts however, the position was very complicated^and the Egyptian forces to the east of the Suez Canal had lost their supply lines from the west.    The ceasefire there must therefore beregarded as extremely fragile and he had urged upon Dr Kissingerthe advisability of arranging with the United Nations secretary general, Dr Waldheim, that the United Nations Truce Supervisorymachinery shouldhe strengthened and used immediately to police the ceasefire and^help to deal with local difficulties.    Dr Kissingerappeared not to favour convening a peace conference;  it seemed thathe and the Russian leaders hoped that the Arabs and Israelis would come together in direct negotiations, with the United States and theSoviet Union intervening as might be necessary to move thenegotiations along.    Dr Kissinger referred to the present moodon both sides, and was plainly aware that the task of launchingnegotiations would be difficult.    Dr Kissinger showed some reticenceon the subject of arms supplies from the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates, but gave the impression that they might have reached an informal understanding to observe restraint, and said that he expected to see a reduction in the flow of Russian arms in thenear future.    On the subject of oil supplies Dr Kissinger saidthat he was not prepared to be blackmailed by Arab pressures.He recognised, however^ that Europe might suffer much more seriously than the United States and he was proposing to send what he described as a conciliatory message to the Arab oil producingStates and to President Sadat of Egypt in which he would say thatit would not help the Arab cause to inflict penalties on the european countries.    He would also point out that without the benevolentengagement of the United States it would be impossible to reach a just solution of the Middle East problem.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwe would need to consider putting further ideas to the American and soviet Governments.    It was essential that Dr Waldheim should be involved in the search for a solution.    The United Nafcic&amp;s TaruceSupervisory machinery might well be the only immediate source of help in trying to preserve the ceasefire.    There had already been some fighting and the dangers of conflict would remain, however much the Egyptians and Israelis might wish to avoid it, unless thetroops could be repositioned.    This in turn might depend upon theopening of negotiations.
2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President ofthe Council (CP(73) 107), to which was annexed a revised draft ofThe Queen!s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The CaKnafc considered the draft Speech paragraph by paragraph,,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft, subject to certain amendments whichhad been suggested in discussion and to further consideration being given to paragraphs 9 and 16.    The former, on the Middle Eastsituation, would need to be reviewed to take account of the latestsituation which had arisen from the recent Security council resolution,    The latter, on housing policy, should be reconsideredby the Lord President in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for the Environment.    TheCabinet were agreed that the wording of this part of the Speech mustnot pre-empt the difficult decisions which would shortly have to betaken in relation to land and housing; but subject to this were anxious that the paragraph should be couched in as positive terms as possible.    The Speech should be kept under review to ensure that account could be taken of any modifications made necessary by subsequent developments.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.the queen&apos;SSPEECHON THEOPENINGOFPARLIAMENTPreviousReference:CM(73) 48thConclusions,Minute 5Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
3, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Environment (CP(73) 106) outlining proposals for thedistribution of the rate support grant to be introduced from 1 April1974.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe level of rates levied in the coming year would be of the greatest importance to the Government, both in the context of their counter -inflationary policy and on wider political grounds.    This wouldlargely turn on the amount of rate support grant, on which he would soon be putting proposals to his colleagues in the light of discussions with the local authority associations.    But it was first necessary todecide how the grant should be distributed on the reorganisation oflocal government, which would come into effect on 1 April 1974.    the ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environment had considered his proposals for changes in two major respects: a newformula for calculating the needs element of grant that would recognise the problems of areas with more than the average number of schoolchildren, sparser population or heavier socialneeds; and a new resources element, at 25 per cent, which would increase the share of London and the new metropolitan areas, largelyat the expense of areas with high resources.    But as the strict application of this formula would mean that domestic ratepayersin some areas might face large increases in their rate bills, he proposed special arrangements (which would be open to review ina yeav&apos;s time, and could if appropriate then be progressively phasedout) for increasing the domestic element of rate support grant in areas which would be particularly affected by the loss of resourceselement.    Domestic ratepayers would also benefit from an increasein the level of statutory deductions and an extension of rate rebatesto cover some three million of the poorest households.    the appendices to his memorandum illustrated the effect of these changes, to which he now sought the Cabinet1 s approval.In discussion a wide measure of concern was expressed aboutthe broad political impact of these proposals.    It was doubtlesscause for regret that no new source of local government revenuehad emerged from the consultation document on local government finance which had been published in 1971;  but if rates must continueto form the basis of local authority income, it was most undesirable for a Conservative Administration to impose gratuitous financialburdens on domestic ratepayers in areas traditionally favourable to them in order to give local authorities elsewhere scope to indulge in an undesirably high level of expenditure.    The dimensions of theproblem were reflected in the loss of resources element that was proposed for many areas of the Midlands and South East; and in wales the independent authorities would suffer, while the only gainerswould be those opposed to the Government,    Rates must in any case be expected to increase; and the present proposals seemed likely in
general to bear hardest on a section of society which had benefitedleast from inflationary wage increases.    Many of the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament and the country at large were alreadycritical of the reorganisation of local government;  and it mightwell be difficult to obtain a majority in Parliament for the proposals in their present form.Moreover, if the total grant settlement were no larger than this year,even those local authorities who would gain under the new distribution would still find difficulty in meeting existing commitments,,    Indeed,the expenditure of local authorities had been mounting at an alarmingrate, with serious consequences for future trends in public expenditure as a whole;  and urgent measures would be needed to bring it under control.    It might therefore be for consideration whether the existing pattern of grant should be left unchanged, and specific payments be made to areas of urban deprivation.    As against this, it was argued that such a step would appear inconsistent withthe Governments approach to giving greater independence to localauthorities, and would in any case reveal still larger anomalies.Against this background it was suggested that the Governments firstconcern must be to protect the domestic ratepayer.    Under the rating revaluation which had taken place earlier in the year, the domestic ratepayers share of the burden had increased against that of industry, and there were now valid arguments for redressingthe balance.    It was also open to question whether domestic rate payers in areas which would stand to benefit from an increasein the resources element of grant should continue to enjoy the same level of domestic derating as at present.    With these considerations in mind it might be possible to achieve a more flexible distribution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatserious concern had been expressed at the impact which the proposals must be expected to have both on ratepayers in areas traditionallyfavourable to the Government and on the levels of local authority expenditure generally.    It might indeed be necessary to construct a completely new scheme.   Asa first step the Secretary of state should as a matter of urgency revise the proposed transitional arrangements in the light of the Cabinets discussion, in orderto provide greater and more flexible protection for domestic rate payers without encouraging excessive expenditure by localauthorities generally and in particular by those - many of themopposed to the Governments policies - which stood to gain fromthe proposed new distribution formula.    The Cabinet would be considering the general question of the level of spending by localauthorities in their forthcoming discussion of public expenditure;and the revised proposals about the distribution of rate support grant should be circulated to the Cabinet as soon as possible,
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister,20        Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury^ to review the proposed transitional arrangements on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up and to circulate revised proposals as soon as possible,,3e        Agreed to resume their consideration of thisquestion at an early meetingo
4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that amass meeting of firemen in Glasgow on 24 October might decide to strike in support of a claim for a special allowance of  5 a week,although the call for strike action, which was against the instructions of the Executive of the Fire Brigades Union, seemed unlikely toreceive full support,    There was a risk that the Firemaster wouldbe unable to maintain even the restricted service that was possible under the present work-to-rule.    The only practicable alternativeappeared to be to use Servicemen to provide basic fire cover in theCity,    In the circumstances prevailing there could be no question of conciliation by the Government, but in view of his statutory respon-sibility for the fire service in Scotland he would be open to criticism if he did not intervene before calling on the Services.    He proposedtherefore to invite representatives of both sides to meet him so thathe could hear the facts of the situation at first hand, advise them tohave the matter considered in the National Joint Council and urge thefiremen aot to put Glasgow at risk.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the CivilContingencies Unit had reviewed the situation.    Although the numberof trained firemen, and the amount of fire-fighting equipment, in theServices was limited, about 300 men could be made available withequipment from Civil Defence sources.    Although the Ministry ofDefence had undertaken preliminary planning, a minimum of 48 hours would be required from the time when the use of Servicemen was authorised befoije they could begin to operate in Glasgow^, and afurther 48 hours before the full 300 would be available.    Thus itwould not be possible to provide a service before 25 October evenif authority were given immediately.    Moreover putting the menconcerned on notice would probably become public knowledge andmight exacerbate the situation before the firemen&apos;s mass meetings.If, however, the decision to alert the Servicemen concerned was not taken until the firemen1 s decision was known the Services would be unable to start operating before 26 October at the earliest.    Therewas thus a risk that inadequate cover might be available for a periodif the strike had full and immediate effect.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that Servicemen should be used to maintain theminimum necessary fire service in Glasgow if this could not beachieved by other means.    The Secretary of State for scotland should however consider whether there were other fire-fightingservices in Scotland, for example at large firms or at airfields,which might be available to provide an emergency service.    TheSecretary of State should also arrange to meet the glasgow corporation and officials of the Fire Brigades Union immediatelyafter a decision to strike, and should emphasise the danger to life and property.    Adequate cover against fire must however beprovided in all circumstances and the Lord President should
therefore give further consideration to the contingency planningarrangements, given the need for Servicemen to be operationalimmediately a strike began.    The Cabinet agreed that if necessary the Servicemen concerned, together with all necessary equipment,should move into the vicinity of Glasgow by the time of the massmeetings on the following day, or as soon as possible thereafter,though secrecy should be preserved to the extent that this provedpracticable.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2,        Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland -i. To endeavour to enlist the assistanceof other civilian fire-i^ghting services, as appropriate,ii. To meet the Glasgow Corporation andthe Fire Brigades Union, as indicated in the summing up.3, Invited the Secretary of State for Defence toarrange for the Servicemen concerned to be deployedimmediately so as to be ready to begin operating assoon as possible after the start of a strike.4, Invited the Lord President of the Council toarrange for the contingency planning arrangements to be kept under close review.Cabinet Office23 October 1973
