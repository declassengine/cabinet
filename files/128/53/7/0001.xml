10 The Cabinet were informed of proposed changes in thebusiness to be taken in the House of Commons during the remainder of the Session0    It was noted that the Minister for Aerospace was likely to be making an early personal statement on the answer hehad given on 12 February to a Parliamentary Question about thetracked hovercraft train.The Cabinet were informed that thejie-Was likely to be a debate on sugar in the House of Commons during the following week^and thatthere was some danger that the Government would be defeated.Tate and Lyle Limited had launched a powerful and well-plannedpublicity campaign attacking the Governments policy on the sugarrefining margin, and suggesting that if the margin were reducednext June it might become financially impossible for them to acceptCommonwealth sugar for refining.    Satisfactory replies wereavailable to all the arguments being advanced by the company; butthe campaign would attract support from Members of all Partieswho were uneasy about the effects of this country Ts participation in the European Communities, and unless energetic counter-measures were taken seemed likely to have a substantial and damaging impact.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussions said thatthe Lord President, in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and other Ministers concerned, should urgentlyconsider how the Governments case, which was a good one, could most effectively be presented to the public and in Parliament so asto secure a satisfactory outcome to the forthcoming debate.confidential
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had ceAJ^Eted his talks with the Prime Minister of Iceland, Mr Johannesson, about thepossibility of reaching an interim agreement on fishing off the icelandic coast.    He had told Mr Johannesson that as a result oftheir discussion we would be prepared to contemplate an agreement to run for two years from the date of signature, under which the        ^British trawler industry would exclude freezers and factory shipSfixttwbgafrom the area between 12 and 50 miles off the Icelandic coast; thetrawler fleet operating in the area would be reduced, comparedwith the fleet operating in 1971, by 15 of the larger trawlers and15 of the smaller; there would be areas outside the 12 mile limit Mould 8i reserved for Icelandic small boat fishing;  the area would be divided into 6 sectors, one of which would be closed at any one timeto British trawlers;  and the procedure for dealing with violations of the agreement would be that an Icelandic patrol boat catching anoffending trawler would call up one of our fishery support vessels to confirm the details of the offence and the matter would then be reported to us and the trawler in question withdrawn from the listof those entitled to fish off Iceland.    The proposals had been worked out on the basis that our trawler fleet must be given the possibilityof catching up to 130, 000 tons a year, but a figure for the catchceiling would not appear in the agreement and our trawlers wouldnot have to stop fishing if they reached that figure.    There was thepossibility of making some adjustments in the extent of the areasreserved for small boats and on the details of the rotating closedareas; this would be the subject of study by experts.Mr Johannesson had not been prepared to state unequivocally thathe would recommend to his Government and to the Foreign AffairsCommittee of the Althing that an agreement in these terms shouldbe accepted; he was willing only to say that he would discuss it with his colleagues.    We must assume that the Communist Ministerof Fisheries, Mr Josefsson, would oppose it, and much would depend on Mr Johannesson&apos;s determination.    The Prime minister had made it clear to him that we regarded the discussions as the substantive negotiations, and that we would not be prepared to enterinto a further round of negotiations in which the Icelanders sought to get us to make further concessions.    It would probably be a week or so before we had the Icelandic answer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.The Cabinet considered latest developments in the Middle East.Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.Cabinet Office16 October 19732SECRET

never concealed this view from the Government of Israel.    While,therefore, there was undoubtedly a breach of the cease fire by theArabs, it would not be right to charge them with aggression.    nor would it be expedient to do so.    We had, with a considerable expenditure of effort, greatly improved our relations with the arab world in recent years and provided we did not throw awav the gOOD WILLwith the Arabs which we had earned,we might&apos;be able to play a usefulpart in obtaining a cease fire if circumstances should so develop asto make this possible.    Finally, a public stance critical of theArabs (and therefore regarded by them as pro-Israeli) would greatly increase the danger to our oil supplies.    The second question was, in his view, a more difficult one.    It arose from our decision to impose an embargo on the shipment of equipment and ammunition to the countries engaged in the battle-field area.The countries at present affected by the embargo were Syria, Iraq,Egypt, Jordans Libya (because she might transfer supplies to other arab countries) and Israel.    The present exclusion of Saudi Arabiawas possibly open to question, but the Saudi Arabian commitment tosend troops to fight in Syria was probably only a gesture and it was unlikely that she would transfer to Egypt any of the equipment orspare parts she might obtain from us.    On the other hand our military exports to Saudi Arabia were part of a long-term programme for an air defence system and we stood to lose ordersamounting to some  250 million if we interfered with theprogramme;  and our relations with King Faisal were of greatimportance not only because of the oil but also because he was arestraining influence in the Arab world.    There was a clear case for continuing to supply the States in the Gulf where there weredefence requirements distinct from the Arab/Israel conflict whichit was greatly to our interest to support.    The embargo thus extendedto warlike goods covered by contracts, and in some cases already paid for.    We were already holding back from Israel ammunition,about which the Israel Government had made representations to us,and spare parts for Centurion tanks, about which we had not yet received representations.    The embargo was denying gun sightsto the Egyptians.    What we were withholding from these twocountries represented, in his view, a fairly even balance.    other western European countries were following a similar policy.    Ifwe abandoned our present course, the Arab countries would regardus as favouring Israel, even if the embargo were lifted from bothsides.    Our ability to play a constructive part in bringing thefighting to an end, either by our own efforts or in co-operationwith other Western European countries, would be correspondingly reduced.2
In discussion it was urged that we should at least fulfil existing contracts,, without discrimination between one country and another.In support of this it was argued that the supply of ammunition was becoming a crucial problem for Israel and that it was not in our national interest to weaken IsraePs power to resist and thus tostrengthen Soviet influence in the Middle East by strengthening theposition of the Arab countries^, which were Soviet clients.    It wasalso argued that if we sold weapons in times of peace and contractedto maintain the supply of spare parts and ammunition^ we were inhonour committed to continue that supply if war broke out.    Indeed,since we had always foreseen the likelihood of renewed conflict inthe area we could be presumed to have taken this into account when we entered into contracts.    It was further suggested that there wasa distinction between re-equipping the opposing forces as theSoviet Union and the United States were doing, and providing themwith supplies and spares for equipment which they already held.    Itwas noted that when the Government had come under attack for supplying spare parts to South Africa, the policy had been justified on the ground that the original equipment had been properly suppliedunder the Simons town Agreement and that the supply of the equipment implied an obligation to supply spare parts:  this mightbe quoted in criticism of the Middle East embargo, althoughadmittedly supplies to South Africa had not been made in time of conflict.    Particular concern was expressed about the decision tocontinue the training of a number of Egyptian pilots who were now inthis country on a conversion course for flying helicopters,    Thiswas attracting much criticism and appeared to be inconsistent withthe breach of contract on supplies.    It was also suggested that if itwere decided to maintain the embargo it might be difficult to continueto exclude Saudi Arabia from it.    As regards the attitude that theGovernment should adopt towards the Arab breach of the cease fire,it was suggested that whatever might be the failings of Israelipolicy, there was no justification for the breach of the cease fire and it was wrong that we should appear to be tolerant of it.On the other hand it was argued that the interests of this country would not be served if it appeared to the Arabs that our policy wasturning towards supporting Israel.    The consequences for our oil supplies and therefore for our economy as a whole would be veryserious, and our interests in the Gulf would suffer severe damage.Furthermore our ability to contribute to a cease fire, which mightbe of crucial importance at the right moment, would be gravelyimpaired.    This was of particular relevance at a time when theUnited States and the Soviet Union were becoming increasinglycommitted to the support of the Israelis and Arabs,    It had beenapparent during the past few days that we were in a position to talkconfidentially to both sides:  and in due course, possibly in association with European countries who were following a similar3
course on the supply of arms, we might be able to take a constructiveinitiative,,    Furthermore, much of the concern that had been expressed appeared to rest upon the assumption that Israel was going to lose the present conflict.,    On present evidence that wasnot so.    The argument that Israel depended on us for ammunition for her Centurion tanks could not be sustained;  suitableammunition could, and no doubt would, be supplied, by the UnitedStates.    And it should be remembered that we imposed an embargo on both sides in the conflict between India and Pakistan.It was recognised however that public opinion was uneasy, and thatthere was a considerable element, not limited to the jewish community, which sympathised with the Israelis and which mightconclude that the embargo was particularly damaging to the Israelies and had only been imposed because we were afraid of the threat to our oil supplies.    Acute problems were likely to arise in some areas; there were for example threats of resignation bylocal councillors which if implemented might stimulate a feeling ofseparateness on the part of the Jewish community which wouldhave very serious long-term consequences.    Further thought needed to be given not only to the content of our policy but also to itspublic presentation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were faced with complex and very difficult domestic and international problems.    It was important however to keep thematter in proportion.    Anything we might supply to Israel wouldbe minimal compared with the massive supplies which were nowflowing from the United States.    Fears that Israel would be destroyed were exaggerated.    The United States would not let thathappen.    It was difficult to predict how far the Soviet Union would go in support of the Arabs.    There was a danger that the twosuper powers would find themselves increasingly involved and increasingly unable to reconcile their Middle Eastern policies withtheir general policy of detente.    Our position in this could become very important.    We should not underestimate our influence withthe Arabs generally, and especially with Egypt,    Events over thelast few days had shown that we had more reliable information aboutEgypt1 s attitude than the Americans and even the Russians,    Wehad been very active in the search for a solution and our effortsmust continue.    We would be powerless to help if by a change of direction in our policy we sacrificed our relations with Egypt.    Farfrom opening the way to increased Soviet influence in the Middle Eastour improved relations with the Arabs served to counter Sovietinfluence.    The embargo was however an important domestic issue and although in the statement which he was to make in Parliamentlater that day the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary v/ould need to maintain our policy, it might be helpful if he could also make it4
clear that the situation would be kept under constant review.Cabinet could then resume their discussion of the matter atsubsequent meeting.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office17 October 19735
