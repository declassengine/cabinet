THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had called the meeting at short notice in order to consider what further action to take on the Pay-Board^ advisory report on relativities.    Copies of the report hadbeen sent to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and theTrades Union Congress (TUC) and it was to be expected that therewould be public discussion.    He had now received a letter from the leader of the Opposition asking two questions: first whether it wasa fact that the Chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB) had written to propose action in accordance with the report; 1 and secondly whether the Government would ask all the parties concerned to agree that the miners1 claim should be urgently examined as an exceptional case.    Since the miners1 claim was partly based upon adecline in their relative position the public v/ould expect it to beconsidered through the machinery to be set up under the recommenda-tions of the report.    Some people might fear that such an examinationwould lead to a surrender such as had followed the Wilberforcereport, but the difference on this occasion was that the procedure for relativities would take account of the consequential claims ofother negotiating groups.    On the other hand the use of this procedure would give rise to strong pressure to produce an answer by 1 Marchwhen the miners1 settlement was due.    No proper examination of therelativities could be carried out in that time.    If the examinationtook longer, there would be pressure to back-date the result to1 March, but in calculating the pay limit for Stage 3 no allowance had been made for the implementation of the relativities report, andthe intention had been to allow for it in Stage 4,In consultation with a small group of Ministers he had produced adraft letter to the CBI and the TUC which he now put to the cabinet for discussion.    The draft said that the Government accepted theprinciples of the report, and offered to arrange an immediate meeting with the TUC and the CBI to set up the proposed machinery.    Forthe miners this would add another option to that already offered;either they could take part in immediate discussions with the NCBon the future of the industry, or they could put their case for arelative improvement to be examined in accordance with theprocedure in the report.    In either case, however, the draft stipulated that they should accept the offer that had been made to them and return to normal working. &quot;In discussion it was argued that since the Pay Board report had been published the Government must either accept or reject it.    Rejectionwould be impossible to justify to. the public, and this in itself was asufficient reason for sending a letter on the lines proposed.   It mustbe accepted that the letter was unlikely to influence the miners&apos;ballot or to persuade the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) toask for a return to full working; and the TUC would have difficultyin agreeing to take part in the administration of any part of a1
statutory incomes policy.    However a letter on the lines of the draft,even if rejected by the TUC, would appear to the public as a new government initiative and might regain the ground that theGovernment lost when it appeared to reject an initiative by the TUC,It followed that the letter, even if not likely to be accepted, must be drafted in terms that would look reasonable to the public.The following points were made in further discussion -a. It was suggested that the letter might ask the TUCto agree to endorse the pay limit for Stage, 3.    On the otherhand it was argued that the letter already referred to paragraph 53 of the relativities report, which included the repercussions on the incomes policy as a whole among the factors to be taken into account in any examination of a case.The TUC had no mandate to give explicit support to the pay limit and it would hardly be reasonable to ask them to do sosince the pay limit and the procedures for relativities andanomalies were separate dimensions of the incomes policy.In any case the Government attitude had always been that the pay Code was the law of the land and did not require theagreement of the TUC.b. It was suggested that the representatives of professional groups such as doctors, nurses and teachers,who were not represented either on the TUC or the CBI,ought to be consulted about the report, in which many of them had a strong interest.    There would be no time however todo so in the context of the miners1 dispute.c. It was argued that to require the miners to accept theoffer that had been made to them by the NCB was to impose a condition which they might find humiliating.    It should besufficient to ask them to return to normal working.   against this it was argued that when the Government had offereddiscussions on the future of the industry they had made theacceptance of the offer a condition, and that any softening ofthis condition would be seen by many as a prelude to a surrender.    On the other hand, if the Government was takingthe line that the claims of the NUM should be treated inaccordance with the procedure that would be applied to allother such claims, it would be unreasonable to ask themfirst to accept a particular offer that happened to have beenmade; in other cases there might be no offer.
d.        The pressure to back-date the miners1 award to1 March would be difficult to resist, but the back-datingwould be open to strong objection.    Since it was known thatno provision for relativities was taken into account in settingthe pay limit for Stage 3, it would be difficult to set any /limit to the awards in Stage 3, and each one would be seen as a concession to avoid a strike.    The cumulative effects of such awards in Stage 3 might become very expensive, andthere could be a case for moving quickly to a Stage 4 whichwould contain no general provision for pay increases but wouldprovide only for indexation and the adjustment of relativities.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a letter should be sent on the general lines ofthe draft that they had considered,    At the same time he would reply to the Leader of the Opposition, sending him a copy of theletter to the TUC and the CBI and confirming that the matter hadbeen raised in a letter from the Chairman of the NCB.    Thequestion of consultations with the representatives of professionalgroups not in the TUC should be considered further.    On the drafting of the letter to the TUC and CBI, the Cabinet agreed that the TUCshould not be asked for any undertaking to endorse the pay limit for stage 3; and that the letter should not in terms require the NUMto accept the specific offer that had been made to them although thefact that an offer within Stage 3 was available to them could be mentioned.    He would arrange for the draft to be revised in thelight of the discussion so that the letters could be sent in time tobe reported in the following morning&apos;s newspapers.    The timing ofthe implementation of the result of any review of the miners&apos; claim under the new procedure should be left undefined for the time being.If asked about the cost of meeting such claims, Ministers should saythat this was a point which would have to be carefully studied whenthe claims had been examined and the total cost could be properlyassessed. ,The Cabinet -&apos; &apos;     : &apos; /: &apos;.:VTook note, &quot;with approval, of the summing up of      ,.their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office31 January 1974 (3secret
