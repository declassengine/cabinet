OVERSEAAFFAIRSChile1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat following a coup in Chile, President Allende was reported tohave committed suicide and a Military Junta had taken over.    Itwas not yet clear whether the Junta was in effective control of thecountry but he proposed that the question of recognising the new regime should be determined in accordance with the usual criteria.South africa the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernment of South Africa had announced the setting up of a judicial enquiry into the incident at the Western Deep Levels minein which a number of African mineworkers had been shot by theSouth African PoliceAnglo-SovietRelationsTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatwhen in New York for the meeting of the United Nations general assembly he proposed to raise with Mr Gromyko, the soviet foreign Minister, the question of Soviet treatment of Jews andintellectuals.    There would also be an opportunity to pursue this issue at the Conference on European Security and Co-operation.The Cabinet -Took note cf these statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there had been a successful meeting of Community foreign ministers on political co-operation in Copenhagen on10-11 September,    This had made valuable progress followingrecent tensions between France and Germany and over theUnited States relationship.    The meeting had agreed a joint declaration on United States/Europe an Economic community relations which represented a major move forward and should be acceptable to the United States Government,   It had not provedtimely to make any progress on the form of meeting which mightbe held if the United States President decided to visit Europe andthis remained a source of potential difficulty with the French.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.THE PRIME MINISTER said that his talks with the President of theEuropean Commission (M Ortoli) on 12 September had been extremely useful.    M Ortoli thought it important that theCommunity should avoid overt dispute in finding agreement on an acceptable package of proposals for the implementation of the 1972European Summit at the end of this year.    It was his intention towork behind the scenes to this purpose.    M Ortoli fully appreciated the position of the United Kingdom Government on the institution ofan acceptable Regional Development Fund and he understood thecurrent economic problems of the United Kingdom particularly theneed to sustain and inspire belief in economic expansion.The Cabinet -2. Took note of the statement by thePrime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Community Budget for 1974, to which the Council of MinibtersMeeting on 20 September would be giving initial consideration, was of considerable importance and political sensitivity to theUnited Kingdom.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would circulate a note for the information of the Cabinet setting out theproposals for the Budget and drawing attention to the major points of concern to this country.2EUROPEANCOMMUNITYAFFAIRSPoliticalCo-operationWork on theProgrammeSet by theEuropean SummitPreviousReference:CM(72) 46thConclusions,Minute 2Community budget for 1974

mewM3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN ireland said that the prospects for maintaining order in Northern Irelandnow seemed better than for some time, although the activities ofthe Protestant militants remained a threat.    In the politicalcontext the Prime Minister1 s recent visit to Belfast had been highly successful, particularly in injecting a greater sense ofresponsibility and urgency into the dissident political groupings.Although the situation remained volatile, there was now some prospect that agreement might be reached on the establishment ofan Executive;  and the Prime Ministers forthcoming visit to dublin, during which there would be an opportunity to explore thescope for co-operation in the establishment of the projected Councilof Ireland, should help to clarify further the prospects of a constitutional settlement.The Cabinet -1, Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland,northern ireland previous reference:CM(73) 39thConclusions,Minute 4Bomb Incidents THE HOME SECRETARY said that, although accumulating forensicin England evidence suggested that most of the recent bomb outrages inEngland had been the work of Irish elements, there was so far no definite clue to the identity of those responsible.    The incidentshad inevitably led to pressure for more far-reaching action by theGovernment, such as the proscription of the Irish Republican Army(IRA) or the introduction of controls on travel between theRepublic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,    The police, who hadalready intensified their efforts to deal with the present outbreakof violence, believed that further action of this kind was not yetnecessary.In discussion it was suggested that to introduce further controlswould disturb, rather than allay, public opinion.    In particular,proscription of the IRA would be ineffective so long as it was notpossible to identify the individuals responsible for the recentoutrages.    These considerations might be explained, privately,to those who were pressing for action in this respect.In addition, the Secretary of State for the Environment had beenasked to grant permission for a rally in Hyde Park on 16 Septemberin order to raise funds for the defence of the individuals who werestanding trial in Winchester on bomb charges.    There appearedto be no grounds for refusing consent; but the organisers might be warned that any comment on the trial itself could involve a risk ofcontempt of court.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thepresent situation did not appear to justify emergency action to dealwith terrorist action in Great Britain by militant Irish bodies.    Butproposals for this purpose would be submitted to the Cabinet if thisbecame necessary at a later stage.The Cabinet -2, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.
INDUSTRIAL 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT,AFFAIRS reporting on the proceedings of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) saidthat a motion to ban appearances before the Industrial Court hadTrades Union been defeated and that although the motion on pensions had beenCongress at agreed unanimously it seemed unlikely that the General CouncilBlackpool would support any significant industrial action in support of it,A motion in favour of participation by the TUC in institutions ofthe European Economic Community had been narrowly defeatedmainly owing to the opposition of Mr Scanlon0    A militant motion on the economy had been defeated by a large vote and a proposal toset an embargo on dealings with the Pay Board had been narrowly-defeated,,    The most significant pointer to the future mighthowever be Mr Scanlon&apos;s insistence at the end of the economicdebate that there should be a special congress before the TUC couldreply to the Governments proposals on Stage 3 or when the talksbroke down: the left wing would continue to press for such acongress and would probably prevail.Chryslers THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that therenow seemed to be a real risk that in the absence of a settlement oftheir labour dispute Chryslers would have to close down for aperiod.    The dispute concerned a proposed increase of  250 a year in the pay of 156 electricians.The dispute was complicated by inter-uniondisagreements and there had been an unwise statement by thecompany at an earlier stage which gave the impression that onlythe Pay Board stood in the way of the increase.    This hadexacerbated relations with the company and made it uncertain whether the non-electricians would obey a call by their union leaders to return to work.    The decision would be taken at a massmeeting on Friday 14 September.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Secretary ofState for Employment.ECONOMIC 5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be meeting the affairs Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on Tuesday 18 September;the Retail Consortium on 19 September; and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) (briefly) on Thursday 20 September and (at morelength) on Thursday 27 September.     The group of Ministers whowere considering the approach to Stage 3 under his chairmanship( were refining the various options and it would be necessary to reach6
firm conclusions by 27 September on the proposals which shouldbe put forward. Although the TUC had so far refused to engage in tripartite meetings with the CBI, they might find it difficult to decline a public invitation0THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, giving the background to the counter-inflation talks, said that for some time it had been expected that the present stage of the economic cycle would giverise to an adverse balance of payments.    It seemed likely that the deficit would continue into 1974, but he saw reason to hope thatthe balance of payments would then return to surplus.    meanwhile the deficit could be managed by drawing on the country&apos;s veryconsiderable reserves.    The real problem was one of confidence.The expansion of the economy was continuing in line with the forecast he had given at the time of his 1973 budget.    He had thensaid that he was planning for a rate of growth of 5 per cent over the18 months from the second half of 1972 until the first half of 1974,and this rate was being achieved.    He had also forecast that therate of growth would be higher at first and would then tend to slowdown, and this too was occurring^    There were, however, fearsboth overseas and in the City of London that the continuance of a5 per cent growth rate would run the economy into constraints of capacity.    There was accordingly a very difficult task of satisfyingopinion overseas while setting the scene for successful talks withthe TUC who attached importance to the maintenance of the5 per cent rate of growthB    Nevertheless by objective criteriathe performance of the economy was satisfactory.THE MINISTER FOR TRADE AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS gave theCabinet details of the monthly trade figures which were due to bepublished later in the day.    These would show a large deficit due mainly to increased expansion in raw material imports, especiallyoil.    The prices of these imports were rising and there was alsoextra buying to anticipate further price increase.    Exports were,however, exceptionally good.    The fall in the value of the pound sterling was a contributory factor to the deficit but this was difficult to quantify and the increase in world prices was the maincause.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatit would be extremely important to maintain confidence in the 1 asicsoundness of the economy both at home and abroad over the nextfew months, and it would also be desirable to counter the impression that our entry to the European Economic Community was primarily responsible for high food prices.    The Treasury should arrange to circulate suitable material on which Ministers could draw in theirspeeches and no opportunity should be lost to present theGovernments policies in the most favourable light.7
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Mortgage RatesPreviousReference:CM(73) 36thConclusions,Minute 7The Cabinet gave further consideration to the question ofmortgage rates,THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, together withthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, he had recently had further discussions with representatives of the building societies.    Theyhad expressed serious anxiety about the unsatisfactory rate ofinflow of investment funds.    The net inflow had been  148 million in July,  64 million in August and only  5 million in the first week of September, while in the second week there had been a net outflow of  4 million.    The building societies attributed this unsatisfactoryposition largely to competition from the banks, who, they claimed,were in some cases offering depositors interest of as much as13 per cent.    They had maintained that in the absence of any government action they would be obliged to recommend earlyincreases in their investment and mortgage rates.    In the light ofthese representations he had arranged for the clearing banks to beasked to restrict to 9j per cent the interest payable on deposits of under  10, 000 and also to restrict certain types of lending.    Noother means of influencing the mortgage rate were available tothe Government, short of offering the building societies a subsidyor making major changes in monetary policy; but such measures would be in direct conflict with established Government policy and could not be contemplated.    It must be doubtful, however, whethercompetition from the banks had in fact reduced the inflow of investment funds to the building societies;  and it would thereforebe unwise to entertain too high expectations about the effectiveness of the measures which had just been announced.    An increase in the mortgage rate to 11 per cent might prove to be unavoidable.    If theCouncil of the Building Societies Association (BSA) came to this conclusion at their meeting on the following Friday it was to be hoped that they would decide to recommend the necessary increaseforthwith, since any deferment or phasing of its implementationwould be even more damaging politically than would immedia&apos;action.As regards longer term arrangements, the discussions with thebuilding societies about the possible stabilisation of mortgage funds and about means of giving special help to first-time purchaserswere making good progress;  and it was likely that agreement wouldbe reached in the near future.8
In discussion it was emphasised that, if an increase in the mortgagerate to 11 per cent was necessary, it was desirable that it should bemade forthwith.    Deferment seemed likely to lead to a severeshortage of mortgage finance;  and this could have serious consequences for the housing programme.    On the other hand itwas suggested that a reduction in the availability of mortgage fundsmight not be undesirable in so far as it might lead to lower houseprices, which for many people were an even more criticalconsideration than high mortgage rates.    If mortgage finance was nevertheless to be curtailed, it was important that preference should be given to those whose need was the most urgent;  and this might point to the desirability of differential rates of interest,which would in effect discriminate against, for example, purchasersof second homes or of the more expensive type of house.    It mightbe possible, however, to find methods of avoiding a shortage ofmortgage finance which would not involve a Government subsidyor a major change in monetary policy.    For example, a substantial increase in the amount of money available for lending could besecured by a reduction in the building societies&apos; liquidity ratio.Legally, the minimum permissible ratio was 7f- per cent; but asa matter of practice the building societies normally kept the ratioat about 15 per cent.    A Government guarantee might have to be offered if they were to be persuaded to reduce it substantially; butthis would probably involve little or no actual expenditure andmight be worth serious consideration.    The possibility ofestablishing a mortgage refinance agency might also be examined,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the building societies were likely to increase the mortgage rate to 11 per cent.   Such a development would be liableto be politically damaging and the position would be even more serious if, in addition, there was a severe shortage of mortgagefinance with a consequential reduction in the volume of housebuilding.    The Cabinet accepted that no further steps could betaken to influence the situation in advance of the forthcoming meeting of the Council of the BSA; but it was essential that longer term measures for improving the basis of housing finance shouldbe found and announced urgently.    The Secretary of State for the environment, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,should therefore review the whole field of possible measures,including those which had been mentioned in the Cabinefs discussion,and should circulate proposals to the Cabinet in time for decisions to be reached before the forthcoming Conservative Party Conference.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.9
6. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that, followingdiscussions with the Ministers principally concerned, he had it inmind to announce at an early date the establishment of an inquiry into the rules of conduct and codes of practice in local government,with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To examine present local government law and practicerelating to -i. the conduct of both members and officersin situations where there is or could be a conflict between their position in local government andtheir private interests;ii. qualification (or disqualification) for service as a member of a local authority or its committees.To consider the adequacy of the operation of such law and practice and the principles which should apply, and make recommendations as to how compliance with such principlescan be achieved11.It was clear, in the light of the criminal proceedings which werepending and of the public concern to which they had given rise, thatsuch an inquiry was necessary;  and the Attorney General had advised that it would be possible to promote a general review oflocal government laws and practices without prejudicing either thelegal action which was already in train or the police investigationswhich could lead to such action,,    The committee of inquiry shouldbe reasonably small; perhaps not exceeding 7 members.    the secretaries of State for the Environment, Scotland and Wales should suggest individuals who might be considered for membership;  andthey should also arrange for the appropriate local government bodiesto be notified of the announcement very shortly before it was made.The inquiry would not extend to local authorities in Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement bythe Prime Minister,Cabinet Office13 September 1973RULES of conduct ANDCODES OFPRACTICEIN LOCALGOVERNMENT10
