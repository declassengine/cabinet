1, The Cabinet consids2?ed a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP(73) 119) on public expenditure to 1977-78.    they also had before them earlier memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Central Policy Review Staff (CF(73) 108 and 109)on the same subject, and a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Defence (CP(73) 113) on Defence Budget targets.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that since thediscussion of public expenditure in Cabinet on 25 October, he had again discussed the outstanding issues with the Ministers concerned.The outcome of these discussions had been set out in his memorandum CP(73) 119,    It was clear from the discussions whichhad already taken place that the objective of reconstituting anadequate contingency reserve had not been achieved, and the reservewas still substantially committed.    It was also clear that a numberof the savings which had now been agreed, although necessary inorder to achieve the general objective, would involve quite severedifficulties,    In the light of his discussions with the ministers concerned, he understood that, subject to a generally satisfactory settlement as a whole, most of the Ministers responsible for individual programmes were now prepared to make the savings hehad proposed in CP(73) 108, with only slight adjustment in somecases.    Five issues remained for decision.    In roads andtransport, the area of difference had been narrowed down and detailed proposals by the Secretary of State for the environment and Treasury Ministers had been circulated to the ministerial committee on Economic Policy.    He suggested that the matter should be first discussed in that Committee with the aim of reaching agreement.    In health and social security, the Secretaryof State for Social Services had felt that a reduction should beachieved by an increase in health charges after the next GeneralElection.    He himself agreed with that course but felt that therewould be political difficulties in announcing now a commitment toincrease charges at a future date.    The Secretary of State had therefore put forward the alternative proposals set out in Annex 1to CP(73) 119.    The total fell  12 million short of what was required for 1974-75 before taking account of a continuing extra cost of concessionary fares amounting to  17 million in each year.The outcome of discussions with the Secretary of State for education and Science was similarly set out in Annex 2 to CP(73) 119.Her proposals would have more than covered her contribution butfor the escalation of local authority current expenditure estimatesthroughout the period.    On local authority current expenditure asa whole, the savings so far identified amounted in 1974-75 to 74 million,    A further  74 million therefore remained to befound if this expenditure was to be restricted to the level envisaged in the announcement of expenditure reductions in May 1973, whichhad made it clear that the rate support grant negotiations would
proceed on the basis that the announced economies were being made.It would also be necessary to re-establish as nearly as possible the levels of local authority current expenditure for the years after1974-75: this would still leave this expenditure rising at over per cent in real terms.    As regards defence, the respectivepositions of the Secretary of State and himself were summarised in Annex 3 to CP(73) 119*    Over public expenditure as a whole,after caking account of savings already agreed, there remained a balance to be found rising from  75 million in 1974-75 to 230 million in 1977-78.    If this balance could not be achievedwithin the areas which he had mentioned, it would be necessary to look again at the other programmes which had been provisionallyagreed.In general discussion, it was argued that it remained of greatimportance to meet the overall objective that the expenditure totalsin the 1973 Public Expenditure White Paper should not exceed thosein the 1972 White Paper (Cmnd 5178).    Apart from the economic arguments for this course, any increase over the Cmnd 5178 levelswould be criticised by commentators and could have undesirableeffects on confidence.    Some of the reductions now proposed in thesocial services would however lead to severe political criticism,and any further reductions in this field would have even more serious repercussions.    In these circumstances it might be desirable to look again at some of the expenditure increases which had madeoffsetting reductions necessary, such as, for example, the large increase in the cost of subsidising nationalised industry prices.In general, a distinction should also be drawn between the problems arising in the earlier and the later years of the survey period.    Forthe later years, some decisions needed to be taken now because ofthe long lead time of certain types of project.    But it was notpossible at this stage to predict with any accuracy what the needswould be for some programmes, such as defence; what reductions could be achieved through, for example, increased charges;  and how successful the public services, such as the police, would bein recruiting additional manpower.    The confidence problem, on theother hand, related primarily to the planned level of expenditurein 1974-75, and possibly also in 1975-76.    In these two years themain outstanding problem was the escalation of local government expenditure.    This would need to be considered in any case in the context of the determination of relevant expenditure for the purposeof rate support grant.    If the reduction of local government expenditure announced in May could be achieved, expenditure in1974-75 would have been held to the Cmnd 5178 level, and therewould also be a consequential benefit in 1975-76.
In further discussion8 it was argued that local government expenditure was not sufficiently controllable0    For example, cases were occurring in which local authorities were entering the private housing market, thereby adding to the total of public sectorborrowing and depriving people of opportunities to purchase theirown houses.    There were also indications that the reorganisation of local government was giving rise to large increases in localauthority staff.    As the central Government met more than halfthe cost, and a substantial part of the rate burden fell on industryand commerce, the level of domestic rates was an inadequatesanction against excessive levels of expenditure.    The Governmentwere therefore faced with the choice of increasing rate support grant or allowing the rate burden to rises    Increases in domesticrates were however damaging to counter-inflationary policy,particularly as they fell heavily on middle-income groups who hadtended to suffer under the Pay Code.    Some overall legal control on local government expenditure might therefore need to beconsidered, even if this ran counter to the announced intention toleave local government as free as possible.    A number of proposalsfor increasing local government revenue had been considered inrecent years, but had been rejected as impracticable.    Analternative might be to take expenditure on education, which wasthe largest single local service, out of the hands of localgovernment.    This possibility was already under consideration for higher education, but it would anyway take several years to accomplish, and the effect would be to bring the cost within thecentral Government budget.    In the shorter term, some solutionneeded to be found to the problem of rate support grant in 1974-75.The outstanding increases in this year v/ere essentially on accountof education and health and personal social services;  and the scope for finding reductions in miscellaneous local expenditure was now very small.    To achieve reductions in specific services it would benecessary to send out firm circulars asking for expenditure to belimited, but the local authorities would claim that they were undera statutory duty to develop the services.    Even if such circularswere sent out and relevant expenditure was reduced in line with theMay announcement, it could not be assumed that local government expenditure would be reduced accordingly.    It was still possible for local authorities to continue on their existing path, and meet thecost by increasing rate poundages.    But this course might still be preferable to the acceptance of figures for relevant expenditure whichwere inconsistent with the terms of the May announcement.In discussion of individual programmes, the following main points were made -a.        The Secretary of State for Social Services had nowoffered to meet the level of savings proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, apart from expenditure on concessionaryfares, and a shortfall of  12 million in 1974-75.3
Concessionary fares were wholly in the hands of the localauthoritiess and appeared to be uncontrollable under present arrangements,    A further saving of  12 million in 1974-75could only be achieved, for example, by dismissing staff orclosing old people&apos;s homes, and this appeared open to graveobjection.    If the choice was between cutting expenditure ofthis kind and increasing health charges, the balance ofadvantage might be in increasing charges, although thedifficulty of announcing this before an election remained.The most needy groups were anyway already exempted frompaying the charges.    The Secretary of State was prepared,if he was assured of Cabinet support, to achieve the savingsproposed in Annex 1 of CP(73) 119,    These would themselves have serious political consequences, particularly the reductions in hospital capital expenditure;  the reduced rateof growth in the provision for family planning, which wouldbe strongly resisted in Parliament; the proposed legislation to restrict earnings related benefit;  and the orderactivating the rule under which those suspended from work would not receive benefit for the first 6 days of suspension.Activation of the 6-day rule would be opposed by industryand the trade unions, but it would be implementinglegislation passed under a Labour Administration, and atime of increasing employment was the most favourablemoment to do it,b. The forecasts of expenditure on education werewithin      per cent of previous estimates,    The only itemwhich nad shown a sharp increase was the cost of purchasingland for schools, but this was a relatively small item, andwas partly offset by sales of educational land.    further savings to offset the escalation of local authority current expenditure could only be achieved by reducing expenditureon salaries, which represented 70 per cent of the cost of running the service.    This would mean dismissing existingteachers or failing to recruit the output of teacher training colleges.    The largest single saving which was proposed inthe education field was an increase in the charge for school meals.    This was contrary to existing counter-inflationarypolicy, but was consistent with earlier decisions to makeregular increases in the level of charges,c. The provision for defence in 1974-75 and 1975-76 was within the level published in Cmnd 5178.    For the later years, it was questionable why the proportion of gross national product devoted to defence by the United kingdom should exceed that of other European countries;  and it was difficult to appreciate, from the papers at present before theCabinet, the effect of any proposed level of reduction on the4
effectiveness of our defence effort.    This would need furtherconsideration, but any reduction which required a cut in front-line forces would appear to cause damagedisproportionate to the savings which would be achieved.Past experience showed that such reductions could proveexpensive in the long run.d. Pledges had been given publicly that the total ofpublic and private flows to under-developed countries would amount to at least 1 per cent of gross national product.This target had not been met in 1972, but this had been a particularly poor year for private flows.    The under-developed countries had recently benefited from highcommodity prices, and the pledges regarding the level of overseas aid had been given before the oil-producing countries had made sharp increases in oil prices, which represented a large additional burden on our balance ofpayments.    There might be a case for reconsideringpledges given on overseas aid if the alternative was to makeimportant changes in domestic programmes.    It wouldanyway be desirable to see whether some part of the proposedsaving in overseas aid could be transferred from the later years to the earlier years of the survey period.e. The level of expenditure on roads would beconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on economic policy in the context of the transport policy review.    in earlier discussions it had been noted that expenditure on roads was rising faster than that on the social services.Some reductions had however already been made in the Mayannouncement, and with the further reductions which were now envisaged expenditure on roads would rise at a relatively modest rate.    The present concern about oil supplies made this a relatively favourable time to alter thebalance of expenditure between roads and railways.f. On housing improvement grants, the Secretary ofState for the Environment had agreed to limit the total ofexpenditure within a ceiling.   If it seemed likely that the ceiling would be exceeded, a decision might need to be takenwhether to change the percentage rate of grant.    No decision was however needed on this point at the present time.    Inappropriate cases, an arrangement of this kind might beconsidered for other programmes.5
NationalisedIndustriesg. The economies announced in May had been seriouslyeroded by the increased cost of subsidising nationalisedindustries1 prices.    Decisions on this subject had  beentaken ad hoc for particular industries, and although somebenefit had been obtained in the retail price index, theGovernment had not received any significant political credit for the action taken.    In the case of food price s, theGovernment had generally refused to embark on a policy ofsubsidisation, and it was questionable whether it was wise to spend such a large sum on restraining the prices of nationalised industries.    It might be worth considering theimposition of a ceiling on such expenditure, and thendeciding in which industries it was most useful to hold downprices.    It should however be recognised that although suchaction might be beneficial to the industries, it would not greatly assist with the presentational problem on public expenditure, since, with the exception of the railways andthe coal industry, the expenditure was a charge on the contingency reserve.Receipts fromEuropeanEconomicCommunityh. There was a case for reconsidering the estimate forreceipts from the European Economic Community,particularly from the Social Fund and the proposedRegional Fund.    These receipts were deducted from the forecast level of contributions to the Community,    Up to now a cautious view has been taken of the likely level of receipts,but there might be a case for taking a more optimistic view in the light of recent developments.Other Mattersi. Problems arose in some areas because large sumswere included in the public expenditure forecasts which werenot susceptible to direct control by Ministers, such as therelative price effect and debt interest.    In the case of therelative price effect, it was argued that the forecasts oughtto reflect the real cost of programmes.    As regards debt interest, the forecasts had already been pruned as much as could be publicly justified.    It was arguable that debt interest should not be included in public expenditure surveys,but it would not help confidence to exclude it in the 1973 white paper,    Further consideration should also be given urgentlyto the presentation in public expenditure of social securityupratings and the corresponding increases in national insurance contributions.    At present health and school mealcharges were deducted from public expenditure whereasnational insurance contributions were not;  and this distorteddecisions because it made an increase in charges appearpreferable to an increase in contributions.    The possibilityof changing the presentation of the public expenditure figures in this respect was already being examined.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their general discussion of public expenditure during the following week.    In the meantime, they would give further consideration to the level of local government expenditurein the context of the determination of relevant expenditure for rate support grant in 1974-75,    The Ministerial Committee on economic policy would consider the savings which could be achieved in roads and transport expenditure.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should discuss with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry andother Ministers responsible for nationalised industries thepossibility of limiting expenditure on restraint of nationalised industry prices as suggested in discussion;  and should report the outcome to the Cabinet, including the extent to which further price increases would be required in particular industries.    He should discuss with the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster the forecastlevel of receipts from the European Community;  with the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs the possibility ofincreasing the savings on overseas aid in the earlier years of the survey period;  and with the Secretary of State for Social services the scope for taking account, in the later years, of the possibility that health charges might by then have been increased.    He shouldalso examine urgently the point which had been raised about thetreatment of national insurance contributions in public expendituresurveys.    He himself would arrange for further consideration tobe given to the level of defence expenditure in the later years.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2.        Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer -i. to arrange for the ministerial committee on Economic Policy to considerthe net savings which might be achieved on roads and transport;ii. to pursue discussions with theother Ministers concerned, as indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up, andto report the outcome to the Cabinet.7
RATE SUPPORTGRANTDi stributionwPreviousReference:CM(73) 49thConclusions,Minute 32. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment (CP(73) 118) and the Minister for LocalGovernment and Development (CP(73) 120) containing proposals tomodify the distribution of rate support grant.    They also had beforethem an earlier memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment on the distribution of rate support grant (CP(73) 106);a note by him on new sources of local revenue (CP(73) 117);  and amemor andum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CP(73) 121).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT recalled that the Cabinet at their previous discussion about the distributionof rate support grant (CM(73) 49th Conclusions, Minute 3) had expressed concern at the impact which his proposals might have on ratepayers in areas traditionally favourable to the Government.The problem arose mainly in the South East of England, where local authority expenditure tended to be higher than in other partsof the country because of higher costs; this had previously been recognised by a &quot;metropolitan&quot; weighting applied to some countiesaround London.    Studies had shown that if the formula in CP(73) 106were applied, expenditure in the inner South Eastern counties wouldbe some  6.45 per head, and in the outer counties about  1.72 per head, more than the national average.    The formula had beenrecalculated accordingly.    In the case of London, the 5 per centweighting which had applied previously had been reinstated.    Theeffect was to alter the distribution of grant so that rather more would go to the South East counties and to London, while rather less would go to the rest of the metropolitan counties.    On this basis a level of resources grant at 25 per cent would give too muchto London and not enough to other metropolitan counties;  and he therefore recommended that the level should now be fixed at27-1 per cent.    On this basis, the major urban areas would stillbenefit, though to a smaller extent than under the original proposals.THE MINISTER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND DEVELOPMENTsaid that he had reviewed the proposed arrangements for limiting the increase in domestic rate burdens.    He had considered thepossibility of introducing a variable element of domestic relief,taking into account a particular authority1 s loss or gain of grantunder the new arrangements, as well as any increased chargesarising from the reorganisation of water and sewerage.    This wouldhave the advantage that the relief to those who had lost grant wouldbe largely paid for by those who had gained; but in the big cities itwould chiefly benefit industry and commerce and take some of thegains away from the domestic ratepayer.    On balance it seemedbetter to raise the present domestic element of 6p to lOp, therebyincreasing the amount of domestic derating from about 15 to25 per cent, and placing a corresponding burden (amounting to about 60 million) on industry and commerce.    This could be combined with a variable element for areas where rates would otherwise go up8confidential
because of loss of grant or the effects of the reorganisation of water and sewerage.    The Appendix to his paper showed examples of theeffect of these proposals combined with the new South East factorto which the Secretary of State had referred; they considerably reduced the undesirable consequences to which the strict application of the new formula for distribution would give rise.In discussion it was suggested that although the formula nowproposed had no direct effect on the level of public expenditure,raising the level of resources element and providing a greaterdegree of protection for domestic ratepayers would encouragelocal authorities to increase expenditure.    This would be particularly the case in London, where the proposed 5 per centweighting would lead to a substantial increase in the level of grant.On the other hand it was urged that the needs of the cities with the worst social problems must be recognised.    London&apos;s uniqueposition was acknowledged by the other metropolitan areas, and itcould be argued that under the previous proposals London wasunduly penalised.    Even the level of protection now proposed would leave most domestic ratepayers facing increased rate bills in thecoming year.    There might indeed be some case for establishingspecial machinery which would enable the Government to exercisean effective degree of control over the spending of local authorities;but rate support grant was an entirely unsuitable vehicle for thispurpose,THE PRIME MINISTER said that time did not allow the Cabinet, inthe light of the different views expressed in discussion, to reach a conclusion on this question on the present occasion.    They would resume their discussion at the earliest opportunity.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office31 October 19739
