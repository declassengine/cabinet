CONFIDENTIALENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatalthough the Vietnamese argued that in invading Kampuchea they weresupporting a liberation movement, their claim had carried very littleconviction internationally.    They had been condemned in the SecurityCouncil, where they had been saved only by the Soviet veto. There&apos;was now considerable pressure on the British Government to show itsdisapproval of Vietnam1 s action.    We had responded by suspendingour small aid programme, but there was a difficulty over a ship-building contract.    Two years ago we had agreed to contribute aidas part of a deal with Vietnam which had secured an important orderfor North-East England.    He had considered carefully whether towithdraw this contribution as part of our response to Vietnam&apos;sinvasion of Kampuchea but, in the light of the employment andcontractual circumstances, he had reluctantly decided to let theexisting arrangements stand.    He would take a low-key line in publipand explain that the aid contribution was part of a contract.    More &apos;generally, the Chinese Government was showing growing concernthat the Soviet Union were seeking to use Vietnam as their surrogatein South-East Asia in the same way as they had done with Cuba inAfrica.    The Chinese were saying in public that the Vietnameseshould be taught a lesson for invading Kampuchea, but it was difficultto predict what steps they would take against Vietnam.    They hadstrengthened their forces on the Sino-Vietnamese border, and hethought it likely that although there would not be a larga-scale Chineseinvasion, they might take limited and selective military action againstVietnam.    If the Russians reacted at all to any such Chinese moves,their response was likely to be carefully controlled.    It was, nonethe-less, a potentially risky situation.In discussion it was suggested that conventional morality pointed tocondemning Vietnam as the aggressor.    Moreover, the VietnameseGovernments human rights record was almost as bad as Kampuchea&apos;s:they were, for example, continuing to expel members of Vietnam&apos;sChinese minority as well as promoting the exodus of the boat-people.But the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia had always beenvery complex, and it was difficult to see where responsibility for thepresent situation really lay.    Besides, we should have little sympathyfor a regime as odious as that of Kampuchea.    In such a situation weshould judge where our own broader interest lay.    If by going aheadwith the shipbuilding order for Vietnam, there was a risk of prejudicingour much greater opportunities for trade with China, we should with-draw the aid element.    Otherwise we should let the deal go ahead topreserve the employment it offered.    Other West Europeangovernments were taking a similar line.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should continue to make an aid contribution tothe Vietnamese shipbuilding order.    More generally, our objectiveshould be that the Soviet Union and China should not get themselvesinto a position where they were a threat to peace in South-East Asia.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly.and thegic Armsation TalksTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that whilehe was in the United States, Vice-Premier Deng Xiaoping of China.&apos;&quot;had trodden a careful path in his comments on the Strategic ArmsLimitation Talks (SALT).    He had not wholly condemned the forth-coming agreement, though he had made his lack of enthusiasm for itclear.    There were indications of a growing readiness in the UnitedStates outside the Administration to play the China card against theSoviet Union.    Doubts among members of the United States Congressabout SALT II were likely to have been increased by the Economistsrecent interview with Dr Kissinger.    During his own visit toWashington the previous week he had made clear the BritishGovernments view that an improvement in relations with Chinashould not be made at the expense of relations with the Soviet Union,Moreover, he had pointed out to members of the United States Senatethat if they rejected the new SALT agreement, this would be seen asa rejection of detente itself and the international consequences of thiswould be very profound.    Although he would not go out of his way tomake public statements on the subject, the Secretary of State forIndustry was likely to be asked about the British Governmentsattitude to SALT II during his forthcoming visit to China and he wouldbe provided with a clear line to take.The Cabinet -2.Took note.siaOUsence:,9) 6thlusions,ITHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hisvisit to Washington the previous week had shown that the Americananalysis of the present position in Rhodesia was the same as oursand that Anglo-American co-operation remained as firm as ever.But the elections due to be held in Rhodesia on 20 April would increaseCongressional pressure on the American Administration to recognisethe Salisbury regime.    He had therefore agreed with the United StatesSecretary of State, Mr Vance, that we should redouble our efforts toCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALget the South African Government committed to elections in Rhodesiasupervised by the United Nations, on the same lines as for Namibia.There was no chance of holding such elections before those on20 April, but it would be very helpful to have obtained the commit-ment of the South African Government to them before the Aprilelections.    Whether the South Africans would co-operate was notcertain, but there were signs that they were beginning to become veryconcerned at the prospect of a government in Rhodesia which had cometo power with the political and military support of the Soviet Union.We were also discussing with the Americans whether to sendobservers to the April elections, and he had agreed with Mr Vancethat we should try to delay taking this decision until mid-March orlater.    To decide now to send observers would make it much moredifficult for us to use the period between now and the elections tocontinue to try to widen the area of agreement with all the partiesto the problem.    One possible solution might be to send a joint teamof observers made up of British Parliamentarians and members ofthe United States Congress.    This would not commit the Governmentto accepting whatever conclusions the team reached about the elections.On the other hand, to send a team on the lines of the PearceCommission would be to tie the Governments hands in advance.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that thequestion of sending observers to the April elections in Rhodesia wasdifficult.    There was a risk that if the Government decided not tosend representatives but subsequently members of the Opposition whohad observed the elections reported favourably on their conduct andoutcome, the Government would be caught tactically on the wrong foot.We had to have in mind not only how Black African countries would seeour decision but also British public opinion.    It might be difficult toexplain domestically a decision not to send observers.    The Cabinetagreed that, if possible, we should avoid taking a decision for thetime being, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary shouldcontinue to keep the matter under close review and bring it forwardagain at an appropriate moment.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited the Foreignand Commonwealth Secretary to proceed accordingly.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Foreign Affairs Council on 5-6 February had been precededby the formal opening of negotiations for Spanish accession to theCommunities.    We had been active in ensuring that the French wouldnot unduly delay the Spanish negotiations.    The point had now beenreached where it would be extremely difficult for any member statein the Community to veto the Spanish or Portuguese applications.We could therefore reasonably look forward to a Community enlargedto twelve member states.    No progress had been made towardssolving the dispute over Monetary Compensatory Amounts.    It wasmost unlikely that a settlement would be possible at the Marchmeeting of the European Council and possibly not even at the sub-sequent meeting in June.    We had been obliged to make it clear toboth the French and the Germans that this was a dispute in which wehad a major interest.    There was also resentment in the Beneluxcountries at the attempts by the French to settle matters bilaterallywith the Germans.In a brief discussion reference was made to the criticisms ofCommissioner Haferkamp in a recent issue of &quot;The Economist&quot;.At the Council the German representative had expressed apprecationof Commissioner Haferkamp&apos;s work notably in the current multilateraltrade negotiations and this had secured support from other Councilmembers.    Because the report had appeared in a British publicationthere had been suggestions that it was a British plot to secure hisremoval.   In fact Commissioner Haferkamp had been helpful to usduring recent textile negotiations.    However the accusations ofexcessive expenditure on entertainment and allowances by him werenow properly the subject of enquiries in the European Assembly andby the European Audit Court.The Cabinet -Took note.AL 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofGE FUND     State for Education and Science and Paymaster General and theSecretary of State for the Environment (CP(79) 7) about the initialfinancing of the proposed National Heritage Fund.    They also hadbefore them a letter of 7 February 1979 from the Private Secretaryto the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to the Prime Minister&apos;s PrivateSecretary.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that the draft White Paper on theNational Heritage Fund, which the Chief Secretary, Treasury, hadcirculated to the Cabinet last December (CP(78) 131), had proposedthat, in addition to the annual allocation of   5 million to the Fund,another  10 million should be allocated in the first year.    This would4CONFIDENTIALityiAffairsuary
CONFIDENTIALbe charged against the Contingency Reserve in 1979-80, when theFund was expected to be established.    The total of  15 million inthat year would approximate to the existing balance on the NationalLand Fund.    This allocation was much less than the  50 millionrecommended by the Environment Sub-Committee of the ExpenditureCommittee to which the Opposition had committed themselves &quot;asresources permit&quot;.    An annual allocation of  5 million, withoutthe additional  10 million, as the Chief Secretary, Treasury, nowproposed, would, in her view, lose much of the credit accruing tothe Government from the proposals as a whole.    It would be betterto publish the White Paper on the basis of a broad commitment to aninitial sum of   15 million, but with no commitment on the timing ofthe commencement of the Fund which, if necessary, could be delayeduntil 1980-81.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that hedid not favour delaying the commencement of the Fund unless it wasreally necessary.    The whole purpose of the Fund was to insulatethe safeguarding of the national heritage from short-term economicpressures.    It was also relevant that the public already regardedthe existing balance of the National Land Fund as a real and not anotional balance. ,THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the proposalsembodied in the draft White Paper already went a long way to meetpublic criticism.    He had earlier been willing to accept the proposedcharge of  10 million on the Contingency Reserve in 1979-80, buthad concluded that this would not be sensible in present economiccircumstances.    The argument advanced in favour of the  10 millionwas based on credibility.    But an initial allocation of  15 millionwould carry no greater conviction with those critics who favouredan allocation of  50 million.    They were in any case a very smallminority compared with those who would be ready to criticiseproposals for expenditure over planned levels at this time. Heproposed, however, that the White Paper should provide for anannual allocation of  5 million on an entirely provisional basis.Recent spending by the National Land Fund had been between 2 million and  3 million per annum;  and the White Paper would inany case make clear that, if a major proposal for expenditure on ahouse and contents arose and was approved, the Government wouldfind the necessary finance directly.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the White Paper should be published on the basisthat  15 million should be allocated to the first year of the Fund,with  5 million annually thereafter, but its commencement deferreduntil 1980-81.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChief Secretary, Treasury to arrange accordingly.CONFIDENTIAL6
SECRET5.        The Cabinet considered the draft of an agreement between theGovernment and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) which wascirculated under cover of a letter dated 7 February from the PrimeMinister&apos;s Private Secretary.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he and the otherMinisters directly concerned had discussed an earlier draft withrepresentatives of the TUC.    The present draft had been preparedby officials in the light of that discussion, and would be consideredat a further negotiating meeting.    It was hoped to secure the strongsupport both of the TUC Economic Committee and of the EmploymentPolicy Committee before the General Council met to consider it onWednesday 14 February.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the draft was an important statementof long and medium-term objectives, which would be a useful guideto action over the next three years^    Attempts would still be made tomake it a clearer guide to action during the remainder of the presentpay round.    Subject to that point, he commended it to the Cabinet.It seemed the best that could be achieved and in the light of thepreogress which had been made a decision on the Government&apos;s partto reject it would have very serious consequences for relations withthe TUC.In discussion, it was suggested that the draft before the Cabinetrepresented only an agreement between a small number of Ministersand a limited circle of the TUC.    The Labour Party had not beenconsulted.    Against this it was argued that when the Cabinet and theGeneral Council had approved it, the document would constitute aformal agreement between the Government and the TUC. TheGovernment and the Party could not be separated.    There wereoccasions when it was necessary for the Prime Minister, on behalfof the Cabinet, to take responsibility for a course of action andsubsequently to defend it to the Party.    Nevertheless on this occasionit would be important to keep both the National Executive Committeeand the Parliamentary Labour Party fully informed of developments.In further discussion of the scope for amendments, it was pointed outthat the document had been negotiated in a series of long and difficultmeetings, and incorporated concessions by both sides.    No doubtthere was room for improvement.    But there had been a real dangerof the Government and the TUC drifting apart.    The present draftwas an intelligent attempt to avert that risk.    Some changes ofemphasis might still be possible.   But it would be wrong to tabletoo many detailed amendments.    This would give an excuse forthose within the General Council who opposed the agreement to undothe work of the negotiators...    It was essential to leave the Ministersconcerned a measure of flexibility in arriving at the final version.7SECRET
SECRETIn discussion of the text, there was general agreement that itcontained much which was of value, including particularly the guidesto negotiating and dispute procedures, to the conduct of industrialdisputes, and on picketing, which were being issued by the TUC andwould be appended to the agreement.     These were potentially ofreal benefit both in the short and longer term.    But because thedocument was in form an agreement between the Government and theTUC, it necessarily stressed the relationship between the two.Much of its contents was of importance to the wider section of thecommunity.    This should be brought out, if not in the text, then inany accompanying Government statement.    It would be importantat the same time to emphasise the differing roles of the Governmentand the TUC, as well as the need for their continued co-operation.The paragraphs dealing with the guides issued by the TUC were anattempt to summarise the main points.    But it was difficult to do sowithout distortion, particularly in the section dealing with picketing,and it might be better simply to refer to this Guide without furthercomment.     A number of further amendments were suggested indiscussion.In further discussion, it was argued that if the Cabinet approved thedocument and the General Council endorsed it, immediate actionwould be needed to implement it.    There was already a danger thatpart of the text would appear in the New Statesman on 9 February,and in the weekend Press.    It would therefore be appropriate for thePrime Minister to make a television broadcast that night, givingan indication of the contents of the agreement, and placing itsessential elements in their appropriate context.  All Ministersshould make a point, over the weekend, of stressing the significanceof the likely agreement.    When the document was published,sufficient copies should be made available to the House of Commons,and a Government statement should be made to Parliament at thesame time.    Once the agreement had been published, it was hopedthat the TUC leadership would take advantage of the opportunity itgave them to intervene in individual disputes.    For example, theymight be asked to remind the various civil service unions of theirobligation not to take strike action before the termination of thepresent pay agreement on 1 April.    Indeed, Government Pressguidance about the threatened s trike by the non-industrial civilservice on 23 February should stress this point.    More generally,all Ministers with direct sponsorship responsibilities in the publicsector should insure that the organisations for which they wereresponsibile took full account of the guidance given in the agreementduring the present pay round.8SECRET
SECRETIt was also suggested that the ambitious nature of the counter-inflation target contained in the agreement should be emphasisedto the trade unions.    If the outturn in the present pay round wereabout 15 per cent, as a result of settlements averaging 12 per cent,then achievement of the 5 per cent inflation target in 1982 wouldmean an earnings outturn of about ? per cent in 1979-80 and of5 per cent in 1980-81.    These figures would be consistent withsettlements of 4-4j per cent and 3 per cent respectively.    If theoutturn in 1979-80 were as high as 10 per cent, then the averagefor the following year would be zero.    The higher the outturn atthe beginning of the round, the bigger downward steps would benecessary to achieve a 5 per cent inflation target by the end of theperiod.    The TUC had been warned of this in general terms, andit would be important to set out the figures clearly in the firstattempt to reach an annual consensus on pay and prices, which wouldhave to be made ii- March.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet authorised the negotiating Ministers to conclude anagreement with the TUC on the basis of the draft before them,subject to any further amendments which might be made in the courseof negotiation.    If the General Council endorsed the draft agreementat its meeting on 14 February, it would be published the same day andhe would make a statement to Parliament at that time.    He wouldalso indicate in broad terms the scope of the proposed agreement inhis television broadcast on 8 February,    Once the agreement wasin place, all Ministers should take every opportunity to apply it inall negotiations for which they had any responsibility.    They shouldalso take every opportunity to publicise the contents of the agreementin Ministerial speeches and broadcasts.    He would arrange for ameeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on the day of publication,and for discussions with the National Executive Committee of theParty.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office8 February 19799SECRET

OF A JOINT STATEMENT BY THE TUC AND THE GOVERNMENTIr/iVKRNMENT,  THE ECONOMY AND TRADE UNION RESPONSIBILITIESie nation is facing immense problems.    Problems of inflation,(is of technology.    Problems of unemployment. . Indeed,tntal problems about how our society operates.    We do notthere are easy answers.    We challenge those who say therelit some things are clear.    There is no answer in confrontation,ions to our problems have to be found in agreement. v Butlent will only be possible if our people all recognise thatall part of a community of interest.    Britain,  the country -:he longest industrial and trade union tradition,  can onlye successfully if there is a general and genuine consensusour people.1978 was a year of substantial economic recovery.    The rate oftion was reduced to below 8 per cent.    Unemployment fell -Jte the increase in the working population - though the levelstands is still too high.    Investment increased month byI. \Allowing for tax reductions and benefit increases, theBge of all incomes rose in real terms by almost 9 per cent.Bmers expenditure rose by over 6 per cent in real terms.The partnership between the Government and the trade unionBent played a substantial part in&quot; making this success possible.Be achievements are to be sustained,  the TUC and the GovernmentI continue to work in close and-constructive partnership. Suchfthership is essential to deal with the inter-related problemsiternational competitiveness, of the effective use of capital,&quot;comes, profits, prices, productivity, output,  growth, publicnditure and employment - problems which are central to ouromic future./Improving Industrial Relations
-2- .- *roving Industrial RelationsThe programme of reform of industrial relations agreed witht(je TUC ai?d carried through by the Government since 1974., has.brought continuing benefits to working people in this country.This includes new basic rights for workers and the establishmentof the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service,, on whichI both the TUC and the Confederation of British Industry arerepresented, to help-in disputes and to give advice to employersand unions.    Further improvements in this direction can still bemade.6 Over the same period the scope of collective bargaining haswidened.    There have been improvements in industrial relationsprocedures.    Trade Union membership has grown and spans moreoccupations.    The TUC has promoted mergers between unions. Ithas strengthened inter-union procedures and has considerablyextended its role in resolving disputes.    As a result,  &quot;who doeswhat&quot; disputes have been virtually eliminated.7 We strongly reject detailed legal regulations for the conductof industrial relations.    Experience between 1971 and 1974 showedthat legalistic intervention of this kind is harmful.    We believethat improvements can best be brought about by agreed measureswith the support of workers, unions and managements.8 The TUC has a key role in improving industrial relations andpromoting good practice among unions and employers.    There hasbeen a big expansion in TUC educational programmes for the trainingof trade union representatives.    TUC industrial committees havebeen set up through which unions jointly examine common problems,including industrial performance.    Advice is,also given toaffiliated unions on a wide range of social, economic and healthand safety matters.9 The TUC has now decided to issue advice and guidance toaffiliated unions on three, broad areas :    these guides are appendedto this document./10The Guide
-3-/ -The Guide on Negotiating and Dispute Procedures stresses .themsibility of unions and management to agree relevant andleal negotiating and disputes procedures and commends thee of conciliation and arbitration, particularly in essential,stries and services.    It emphasises that it is theonsibility of unions and their members and of management torve agreements.    Both sides should refrain from taking actionontravention of - agreements,  and where unofficial action hasn place unions should take energetic steps to get a returnormal work.    And no bfficial strike should take place, on. anr-union issue before the TUC has been able to examine thate.   The TUCs Disputes Principles and Procedures provide foriliation and adjudication by sthe TUC in cases where uryLons rot agree.In the guide on the Conduct of Industrial Disputes,  the TUCes that the right to strike is a fundamental, one for tradens and working people,  and should be exercised responsibly.ke action should only .be taken in the last resort and afternil consideration of all the factors involved.    Unions needave regard to the viability of the employing establishment,he effect on employment and earnings,  and on other workersthe community.The TUC emphasises the vital necessity of providing emergencyices, maintaining plant and equipment,  and sustaining livestockng industrial disputes.There is also a strong recommendation that union rules shouldide for strike ballots to be held,  at the discretion of then.On picketing, detailed advice is given about how it should beucted.    The guide strongly recommends as follows:The decision to mount a picket is for the union indispute.    In general and save in exceptional circum-stances, unions should confine picketing to premisesof the parties to the dispute or the premises ofsuppliers and customers of those parties.
-4-Proper identification of authorised pickets       ... .t,&apos;   -       Firm control and organisation of the picketing;anyone who joins a picket must obey instructions .from the person in chargeWhere a union member in accordance with theinstructions of his union crosses a picket line,for example to deliver essential supplies, ,sanctionsshould not be applied to him by any union15     The law has traditionally been,  and remains, neutral onthe closed shop.    The TUC Guide, on Trade Union Organisation andthe Closed Shop, takes as its starting point &apos;the fact that thebasis of trade unionism is organisation,  and 100 per centorganisation is therefore its logical objective.    Many unionsbelieve,  and many managements would agree,  that the closed shopcan have advantages in promoting stable industrial relations.The closed shop is established practice in many important areasof industry and generally operates smoothly.    However, thereare aspects of the application of the closed shop principle thathave caused concern, and the TUC Guide contains advice to unionson the flexible operation of closed shop agreements. Inparticular, unions- are advised to bear firmly in mind that theclosed shop need not be a rigid arrangement; agreementsshould provide for conscientious objectors and can provide forcertain categories of workers to be excluded from the closed shopprovisions.&apos;/ Industrial&apos; and Technological Changt
ndustrial and Technological Changeg     We recognise and share the anxieties about employment&apos;prospectsn the next few years.   .-. It is far easier to identify areas whereLqds will be lost than those where new job opportunities will beHowever, we firmly believe in the adaptability andkills of our people which will be a principal factor indetermining our economic fortunes.      The process of adaptationand the matching of skills to the prospective changes in worlddemand must go ahead with all speed.      Technological change mustbenefit the whole .-of society.      Among the benefits will be shorterworking hours, improved conditions of work and better education.But those directly affected by technological: change must be assuredthat they will be among the beneficiaries.17 The trade union movement has a key role to play,  through theManpower Services Commission and the Industrial Training Boards,as well as at factory level,  in planning to ensure that workers,particularly young people and school leavers,  are, trained&quot; . tohave the skills matched to the needs of technological developments.18 Industrial redevelopment and new technology reinforce thecase for greater industrial democracy - for each enterprise toaccept greater accountability to its workforce as well as tosociety as a whole.      We welcome the active interest of the tradeunion movement as expressed at the Trades Union Congress in theneed for urgent examination of the processes of technologicalchange and also for early legislation on industrial democracyproviding for consultation at all levels in the enterprise andfor the, right to representation in due course at Board level.We also recognise the importance&apos;of workers&apos;  representatives inthe various national subsidiaries of trans-national corporationsbeing able jointly to formulate with the Corporation its globalplans and,  collectively, to protect their interests.19 One fundamental factor is the need to increase productivity -of both capital and labour.      Our international trade performancedepends on producing the    right goods at the right price at theright time.      We need to monitor progress against the target levelsfor containing import penetration and for productivity .set by theNEDC Sector Working Parties,  and take remedial action where necessaryPlanning Agreements must play a key role in ensuring that problems

Moreover,  the initiatives of thedustry &quot;Act and the National Enterprise Board are. increasinglyurring the distinction between the public and private sectors,therefore need to find ways of relating the supply of fundsr investment to the undoubted needs of British industry and theder needs of the community.Reliance on market forces alone cannot match up to theallenge presented by the need for rapid industrial regenerationking advantage of North Sea oil and micro-electronic technology,e Government, business and financial institutions, and the tradeion movement, by their actions help to decide how the economyrforms.      This has fundamental implications for the properndling of the relationship between these great interests, andparticular there must be a close working understanding between ,e trade union movement, through the TUC,  and the Government,also imposes on the TUC, with its broad and undisputedpresentative capacity, the need to accept that its expandingle carries with it wider responsibilities.We have,  therefore,  in renewed discussions,  set out ourjectives together as a basis on which, by co-operation withindustry and between the Government and the trade union movement,can maintain our- economic recovery./ An Agreed EconomicAssessment
-7-,d Economic Assessmentie British people cannot be content with living standardsh are widely out of line with those of the rest o&apos;f Europe,this means that we must aim at a rate of economic growthh is broadly the European average.    But if we are to achieve:we must match the average Euoprean performance on inflation,(ell as growth.An adequate rate of economic growth is also vital if we arelake progress in our social programme.    The TUC-Labqur PartyBson Committee statement &quot;Into the Eighties&quot; outlined anItious programme for improvements in pension arrangements, in-child benefit scheme, the health service, help for one-parentlies, the under-fives,  the 16-19 age group,  and many others of social policy.    It is doubtful whether the Britishle would be prepared to pay the tax rates which would bessary to finance such programmes if the economy were growingvery slowly.-Some rising prices undoubtedly stem from causes which areoutside the area of pay bargaining or indeed the control ofIness or Government.    For example, world commodity prices,[tiding the price of oil,  are not within our control - althoughoil exporter we are now less affected by that factor in thes of trade than are our European competitors.    The Governmentiving high priority to the radical transformation of the EECet and to achieving an equitable distribution of EEC resources,uding in particular the CAP.    We attach great importance to1 progress in this field.But major factors - including productivity, investment,strial structure and industrial relations - are within ourIol.   The best way of keeping price rises down is by increasingt and productivity, growth,  and by regenerating and re-equippingmanufacturing base.    Equally, however, there can be no doubtgeneral rise in the level of money incomes which significantlydipped the rate of output growth would be incompatible with5ving our objective of &apos;a high wage, high productivity low uniteconomy ./ 27 Therefore
- 8 -herefore,&apos; given the facts of our international position,,t set ourselves the task of aligning our inflation rate&apos;t of our main overseas competitors, and that means gettingnnUal inflation rate, within three years from now, down.5 per cent and holding it there.      There is no precisenetical relationship between getting price rises down tocent, the economy growing at 3 per cent,  and a particularof pay settlements.     We believe, therefore, that eachbefore Easter,  there should be a national assessment bynment and both sides of industry of our economic prospectswould take all these factors,  and the relations betweeninto account. , &apos;&apos; rVThe TUC, which is as committed to reducing inflation as tother of the policies adopted by Congress,  recognises withovernment the dangers that could be caused by the escalationy settlements.      That would not only quickly&quot;wipe.out theit to those who have settled earlier in the round at modestes:   it is indeed to their detriment,  and would take usto the high levels of inflation from which we have painfullyvered.     The trade union movement acknowledges there arelems in free collective bargaining between competitive groupsur society and not everyone can improve his living standardstive^to someone else.     Trade unionists should take accountlie effect of their actions on others - and on their own bestrests.In certain areas there may be advantages in synchronisation ofbargaining, although we doubt whether it would bo practicablentroduce this overnight generally.      But we do accept thate are dangers inherent in the concept of a &quot;going rate&quot; foryear,;   this does not, in our view,  form a proper part ofElective bargaining, which should have regard to the meritshe particular situation.      The &quot;going rate&quot; concept can bely ambiguous and destabilising - it has the disadvantagesthe trade union standpoint of a pay norm,  coupled with theatiqnary effect pf successive groups building a higher &quot;goingQn the basis, of settlements previously made;
-9-/ -      - - .ye believe that to meet the challenge set out in paragraph 28iators within both private and public enterprises, includingnalised industries, should focus on the need to secure themum efficiency in the use of resources and the containment ofcosts, and that they should have regard to the impact ofleroents on prices.    There is a legitimate function for thee Commission to examine all elements of proposed price increases,uding raw material,  labour and capital costs, without discrimin-n between the production and distribution stages;    and employersId be pressed to give public commitments on prices as part ofllective agreement.    We believe that the new prices legislationmaterially help the Price Commission to restrain unjustified -e increases.The Trades Union Congress has emphasised the importance ofding discrimination against workers in the public services,e there is the problem of accommodating the costs :of increasesin the resources available, without distorting the balance ofjloyment within the public services and the levels of servicesided.    The practical question is how 10 avoid suchcrimination while recognising the difficulties that arise -uding the difficulties for the workers themselves in decidingfar to press their claim by industrial action - with regardublic health and safety.It is no solution to propose the removal from such workerstheir right to take industrial action in the last resort,ertheless, the Government and the TUC believe that means mustfound for solving these problems.    A promising approach wouldfor such groups to negotiate agreements which would satisfy1 about the method of settling their pay, and would enable1 in, return and by agreement to forgo taking industrial action.Government.. and the TUC General Council, through its appropriateittees, including its Nationalised Industries Committee andrecently established Public Seryices Committee, will as aer of urgency identify those groups which might be coveredsuch agreements,  and the form which they could best take./ 33     We believe
-10-believe that the close relationship between levels of&apos;C expenditure,  the level and quality of public service,,&apos;d&apos;&apos;for continuity in the provision of these services, andanpower employed in these services and its remunerationf sfich importance to the TUC and to the unions directlyved, and to the nation,  that a different method ofmining remuneration and conditions would be in the interestshe workers concerned as well as the wider community. Thernmenfs recent statement on comparability studies is oneing in this direction.Underlying many of the problems in the   public sector arees of relativities and comparability, responsibility and low-pay.the same issues exist in the private sector.      Theyvarise fromarisons between broadly similar jobs and between those witherent levels of skill and responsibility.      Many of theselems are resolved without serious difficulty in the normalesses of collective bargaining. .   There is no doubt, however,t they are more difficult to tackle in times of low economicnth, and there is evidence that in some respects they are becoming; intractable.      Moreover,  it has to be recognised that notryone can improve his position relative to others at one andsame time:    and attempts to do so can be both inflationaryself-defeating.Claims for major changes in relativities raise far-reachingstions of the distribution of income.      Issues can be dealth by ad hoc inquiries and it may be that further such inquiries1 be made from time to time.      But a broader national consensusthe overall distribution of income is now necessary - and indeed,onsensus through which the community as a whole can acceptor changes in this area.      For this purpose we agree that thereId be urgent consultations, with full TUC participation andering all relevant factors in this whole area,  on the continuing^gements which would be required.ion NowThese objectives have been agreed between us as a guide forion over the next three years, and for action now./37
- 11 -37 The guides on negotiating and disputes procedures,  on theconduct of strikes and picketing,  and the maintenance of emergencyservices, bear directly on current problems.      The TUC&apos;is, withthe Government1s full encouragement,  issuing these at once andurging affiliated unions to adopt and operate them. s38 The agreement emphasises&apos;the need to keep the annual rate ofinflation down,  to improve productivity,  and to avoid, wherepossible, settlements which would increase prices.      The Governmenthas made it clear that *the consequences of competitive andescalating pay claims and settlements could force it to adoptfiscal and monetary measures which it would wish to avoid.39 The Government and the TUC, together with its affiliatedunions, will continue their discussions to work out in&quot;more detail,the policies required to achieve an economy which will provideour people with high real incomes,  jobs and leisure, and the justsociety to which we are pledged.      Central to the achievement ofall this is the need to defeat inflation.      The target of gettinginflation below 5 per cent within three years is a bold one, butwe are taking it as our aim from now on.      We ask unions to haveregard to all these objectives in negotiating pay settlementsfor the remainder of this year.^February 1979
