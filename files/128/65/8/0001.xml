CONFIDENTIALMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that in Iran our immediatepriority must be to evacuate those of our citizens whose presencewas not essential.    Our Ambassador had accordingly seenDr Bazar gan, the new Prime Minister, on 14 February and obtainedhis agreement in principle to an evacuation of United Kingdom,United Stat2s and European Economic Community nationals. Itwas not clear that the Bazar gan Government yet had the means toenforce its authority throughout Iran, including the airports; sixRoyal Air Force aircraft were nevertheless standing by in Cyprusand Bahrain and wonld if possible effect the evacuation on16 or 17 February.    We had also made a start on building up effectiverelations with the new regime.    Most of the newly appointed Cabinetseemed to be reasonably well disposed towards the West, though twoof its Ministers were drawn from the Marxist faction among thesupporters of Khomeini.The Cabinet -Took note.y 3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that discussion at the Agriculture Council on 12 February hadbeen restricted by the French Presidency largely to the link betweenthe European Monetary System (EMS) and the dismantling of MonetaryCompensatory Amounts (MCAs) which the French wanted.    No progresswas made as delegations were unwilling to move from theirentrenched positions.    It was not clear whether the French weregenuinely seeking progress on MCAs or whether they wished to delaythe introduction of EMS.    The Commission^ price and greencurrency proposals were not taken forward, despite pressure for&apos; discussion of the latter from both Italy and the United Kingdom.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, noted thepossibility that the linked problems of EMS, MCAs and commonprices might not be capable of resolution in advance of the MarchEuropean Council.    Efforts should be made to discover in advancewhat President Giscard&apos;s detailed intentions for this Council were.The Cabinet -Took note.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatthere was a reasonable chance that at the Council on 19 Februarythe Commission would drop their threatened legal action against threeof our national conservation measures.    There would probably be aninitial discussion of the internal Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) toapply within 12 miles of coastlines and an agreement to extend theinterim arrangements beyond 31 March.    His recent discussionswith M Le Theule, the French Minister who would chair the FisheriesCouncil, had held out the basis of an agreement with the French underwhich we would recognise the rights of Breton fishermen within12 miles of our South-West Coast and agree to an extension of theinterim arrangements to allow time for discussions on a comprehensiveCFP to take place.    M Le Theule favoured seeking agreement onparticular aspects of a comprehensive CFP on a step-by-step basis.This was acceptable, but it was difficult to judge whether the Frenchwanted rapid progress on a CFP or whether they were concerned todelay this until after the European Assembly elections in June.The Cabinet -Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that he wouldshortly bring a paper to the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions, for discussion on 21 February, setting out his proposedresponse to the judgment of the European Court on tachographs. Ifnecessary Cabinet could accordingly consider the matter on22 February.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important for theGovernment now to seize the opportunities provided by theGovernment-Trades Union Congress (TUC) Agreement to helprestore public confidence in their ability to handle pay and industrialrelations, working in co-operation wiJi the trade union movement.There was as much at stake for the TUC as for the Government inconvincing the public that the Agreement was the right way forward.The tide could now turn if a period of relative industrial peace andresponsible pay bargaining could be achieved.    The follow up to theAgreement would be of vital importance.    It would be necessary to seewhat help the Government could give privately to the TUC in their ownmonitoring of the application of the industrial relations code. TheAgreement to reach a con s 6Zi su s 6 conomi c a ssessment should bebrought into effect as soon as possible and the Chancellor of theExchequer would be opening discussions in the following week. Theimmediate comparability issues arising from the Agreement werebeing dealt with in the context of the deal which had been agreed forpublic service manuals.    The idea of a relativities board neededfurther work and the TUC would need to be encouraged to thinkfurther about it.    Whilst individual aspects of the Agreement felldire ctly on particular Ministers he considered it would be useful toestablish a small Ministerial Group to oversee and where necessaryco-ordinate follow up action.The Prime Minister, continuing, said that following an initiative byMr L.en Murray there had been a meeting between himself and theMinisters most closely concerned with Mr Murray and the GeneralSecretaries of the four public service unions engaged in the presentdisputes and their senior negotiators.    After lengthy discussion adetailed agreement had been reached in the early hours of Saturday10 February.    Asa part of the Agreement the Government hadundertaken to establish an independent Standing Commission chargedwith carrying out investigations into comparability in the publicservices.    The first groups to be referred to the Commission wouldbe the local authority manual workers, the National Health Service (NHS)ancillaries and ambulancemen, and the university manual workers.The Agreement provided that the Commission would produce a reporton these groups by 1 August 1979 and that the Government and tradeunions concerned undertook to accept the recommendations of theinvestigations subject to the agreed stagings.    These were that50 per cent of the recommendations would be paid from 1 August 1979and 50 per cent from 1 April 1980.    The Government had agreed tounderwrite the settlement which in the case of the local authoritymanuals meant financing its share through the Rate Support Grant.The groups concerned would receive an increase of 9 per cent witheffect from their most recent annual settlement date and this paymentwould be taken into account in the comparability investigation. Attheir next annual settlement date the groups would be able to negotiate3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALeither for a further 12 month settlement or on the basis that theirannual settlement date would be changed to April from 1980 onwards.The unions and employers would be free to negotiate productivityschemes which were self-financing.    The Agreement also providedfor the TUC to be fully associated with its implementation and to beconsulted should problems arise.    Finally the General Secretariesof the unions concerned had agreed to recommend these arrangementsto their negotiating committees as a basis for settlements and forending the present industrial action.    The Ministers concerned andthe various Management and Staff Sides were now following up theAgreement which he hoped would lead to final settlements within afew days.    It had also been agreed in the discussions that the detailsof the arrangements reached should be kept secret so as to allow theprocesses of implementation to take place unhindered by speculation.It was for this reason that knowledge of the deal had necessarily beenconfined to the Ministers most closely concerned.On the whole the Agreement represented a favourable outcome of thedifficulties in which the current disputes were facing both theGovernment and unions.    The 9 per cent increase payable from thecurrent annual settlement date for the groups concerned could be abreakthrough in reversing assumptions about going rates of 15 per centor more.    The agreement on staging the comparability increaseswould create pressures for similar treatment of staged increases forthe Civil Service, nurses, teachers and other groups for whom theremight be similar investigations.    But the unions concerned in thepublic services dispute had accepted that the public service manualsgroup represented a special case on low pay grounds and hadundertaken not to press the arrangements as a precedent.    He hadalready told some of the Civil Service unions informally that theycould not have comparable treatment.In discussion of the public services dispute it was noted that the localauthority employers had now accepted the terms of the Agreementthough it had been necessary to give them an assurance that if theresults of the comparability investigation produced excessive payresults in 1979-80 then their problems in respect of cash limits wouldbe looked at sympathetically.    The Health Service and universityemployers had also accepted the Agreement.    There were signs thatthe General Secretary of the National Union of Public Employees(Mr Fisher) wanted to make the Agreement subject to inclusion in thecurrent settlements of productivity payments in advance of agreementsto achieve extra productivity but this had been firmly resisted.In further discussion it was suggested that the Agreement for thepublic service manuals could be repercussive in two respects. Firstit would increase pressure for all groups in the public sector to havesettlements of at least 9 per cent in the current round.    This had to be4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALresisted as it would entirely destroy the value of the low payprovision in the policy.    An essential element in reaching 9 per centsettlements for the groups in question had been the operation of the 3. 50 low pay underpinning.    Second there would also be pressurefor comparable treatment on timetables for the staging ofcomparability increases but those groups with annual settlementdates later than the public service manuals could not expect to gettheir first stage from 1 August.    It would be particularly importantalso to ensure that the comparability studies were conducted fairlyand rigorously.    Otherwise resentment in the private sector of publicservice comparability arrangements would be intensified. Thispointed to getting the right people on the Standing Commission andensuring effective working arrangements.    It was noted, however,that the nurses only wished to have a comparability investigation ifat least some of the subsequent increase could be backdated to theircurrent settlement date of 1 April 1979.    They justified this on thebasis that their claim for special treatment had been lodged in theprevious pay round and not dealt with.    Similarly the teachers wouldno doubt argue that comparability had been agreed for them in theprevious round.    If they were not satisfied with the terms of acomparability study, including staging arrangements, there was aserious risK that they would exercise their right to statutoryarbitration.    This would be much less satisfactory than a comparabilityinvestigation and could lead to very large increases indeed which couldonly be rejected by a Resolution of each House of Parliament.    It wasargued that if the teachers went to arbitration then the Governmentcould reserve the right to stage the resulting increases.    If this werenot possible under existing legislation then an amending Bill should beintroduced.    It was also argued that many civil servants could claimto be low paid and hence to have a claim for treatment on the sameterms as the public service manuals.    Against this it was suggested thatthe proportion of low paid in the Service was much lower than within thepublic service manuals group.    It would nevertheless be useful to havean analysis of the pay of civil servants so that the low pay elementcould be identified.    In relation to the water industry it was notedthat agreement to the settlement by the General and Municipal &quot;WorkersUnion (GMWU) had already been obtained and that of the other unionsconcerned should be achieved by about the end of the week.In discussion on pay in the nationalised industries it was argued thatthere was an urgent need to set a consistent line for negotiations.The cost of disruptive action could be particularly great in someindustries.    In the light of the 9 per cent agreement reached inrelation to the public service manuals and increases elsewhere, formost of the nationalised industries at least a strict guidelinessettlement no longer looked practicable.    But the basis for anyhigher offers was not clear.    For example, if the guidelines werenot to be rigidly applied what importance should be attached to the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrelative profitability of the industries which could point to widelydifferent increases in, say, the gas industry as compared withBritish Steel?    It was argued that it would not be desirable toestablish another general guideline figure at, say, 9 per cent andthat the only feasible approach was case by case, aiming to get thelowest practicable settlement and deploying where appropriate theprofitability factor as one, but not the only, consideration. Thepassages in the Government-TUC Agreement about the dangersinherent in the &quot;going rate&quot; concept were relevant and should bedeployed.It was also noted that holding price increases within the nationalisedindustries on a year by year basis would be helpful in obtainingmoderate pay settlements.    It was argued that the statement issuedon the previous day by the National Coal Board (NCB) announcing theircurrent price increase might undermine the Government&apos;s pricingpolicy for the nationalised industries by indicating that if costs rosesufficiently there would have to be a further price increase. Suchstatements also made it much harder for the NCB to maintain theirposition in the pay negotiations.    It was, however, also argued thatif costs did rise then the alternative to putting up prices would be toincrease borrowing and hence public expenditure.    It would be wrongexplicitly to rule out in advance price increases within 12 months.Pay negotiations within the coal industry were at present proceedingslowly and no formal offer had been made.    The mood within theindustry was not militant and informal sources within the NCBsuggested that a settlement at around 9 per cent plus productivitymight achieve a settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Cabinetagreed on the importance of maintaining momentum in following up theGovernment-TUC Agreement.    The primary responsibility fordealing with the Agreement should rest with the Ministers mostdirectly concerned.    The Secretary of State for Employment, forexample, should take the initiative in assisting the TUC to monitorthe application of the industrial relations Codes.    In addition howeverhe would establish a small Group of Ministers, under the chairmanshipof the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to oversee, and where necessaryto co-ordinate, follow up action to the Agreement in all its aspects.As to pay in the nationalised industries and the public services thegeneral aim in forthcoming negotiations should be to keep up the pacein reaching settlements.    The Cabinet recognised that settlements inthe nationalised industries strictly in accordance with the guidelinesmight not now be practicable and that negotiations would have to betaken on a case by case basis.    But they were also agreed that theoutcome in each case would have to be in single figures.    Full useshould be made of the elements of the Government-TUC Agreementdiscouraging the concept of the &quot;going rate&quot; and leapfrogging. On6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALprices, while the possible necessity for price increases at more thanyearly intervals had to be recognised in the nationalised industries,nothing should be done which encouraged such increases.    A returnto more frequent increases could cause considerable difficulties forpay restraint.    The particular issue of coal prices could if necessarybe considered further in the Ministerial Sub-Committee on PayNegotiations (EY(P)).    Finally the Cabinet had noted with approvalthe agreement reached with the trade union leaders in relation to thepay of groups involved in the current public services1 dispute. Itshould not be assumed that the staging arrangements for comparabilitywhich had been agreed for these low pay groups could be extended toothers.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invitedthe Secretary of State for Employment to be guidedaccordingly.TUREH79-805. The Cabinet1 s discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet resumed its consideration of a memorandum byMENT        the Secretary of State for Education and Science and PaymasterGeneral (CP(79) 1) about a package of special employment measuresfor 1979-80.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that veryd early decisions were required on a number of the measures whichhad been proposed by the Ministerial Group on Unemploymentamongst Young People (GEN 27) as part of a package of specialemployment measures for 1979-80.    Otherwise there was a real riskthere would be a gap in the operation in some of the measures from1 April 1979-    Among others decisions were required this week ifpossible on whether the Job Release Scheme (JRS) and the SmallFirms Employment Subsidy (SFES) could continue, at any rate attheir present level.    He understood that the Cabinet might wish todefer consideration of whether the scope of JRS or the SFES shouldbe extended further, but he hoped they would agree that he could goahead with a package the cost of which fell within the figure of 200 million which had been allocated for the special employmentmeasures in the Public Expenditure Survey for 1979-80. HisDepartment, in consultation with the Treasury, had identified acertain amount of headroom in the cost of the programmes for 1979-80,and this might mean the total cost of the package was less than hadoriginally been estimated.In discussion it was argued that if the Secretary of State forEmployment were authorised to proceed with a package costing thefull amount allocated to the special employment measures in thePublic Expenditure Survey, the Government would have correspondinglyless flexibility in deciding where public expenditure cuts should beimposed, if such cuts in the event proved to be necessary.    This wasquite a separate question from whether or not resources should bemade available from the Contingency Reserve.    It was argued thatdecisions were required most urgently on whether or not the proposalswhich GEN 27 had endorsed for expanding the Manpower ServicesCommission (MSC) programmes - the Youth OpportunitiesProgramme, including Community Industry, and the SpecialTemporary Employment Programme - should be accepted. Theplanning of these programmes required an early announcement. Itwas also important that urgent decisions should be taken on the twoschemes proposed to replace the Temporary Employment Subsidy(TES) from 1 April 1979, a short time working scheme and arestructuring assistance scheme.    Consultations with the TradesUnion Congress and the Confederation of British Industry on both ofthese schemes, and also the approval of Parliament under theEmployment Subsidies Act, were necessary before they could beintroduced on 1 April.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the GEN 27 proposals for expanding the MSCprogrammes, and for replacing the TES with a short time workingscheme and a restructuring aosiotance scheme.   They alco agreed that thexisting JRS and SFES schemes should continue.    The Cabinet wouldconsider any outstanding issues including the possible extension ofthe JRS and the SFES schemes at its meeting in the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Employment to proceedaccordingly.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury (CP(79) 9) on guidelines for preparing the 1979Public Expenditure Survey.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the 1979 Public Expenditure Survey Reportshould be prepared on the basis set out in the annex to the ChiefSecretary&apos;s memorandum.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theChief Secretary, Treasury, to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office15 February 197910CONFIDENTIAL
I CONFIDENTIALX3UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO  3CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 8th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 15 February 1979 at 10. 30 amI The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryDITURE (CP(79) 10) about the basis upon which cash limits should be set for.SH the financial year 1979-80 in the light of recent and expected pay1979-80 settlements.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Governmentneeded to publish cash limits for the following financial year earlyin March.    There were three options.    The first was to financeinflation, by adjusting cash limits to whatever level was needed toaccommodate pay settlements during the year.    The second was toadjust the volume of public expenditure forecast in the recent WhitePaper only to the extent necessary to match the Government&apos;s payguidelines.    This was no longer a serious option.    Cash limitscould be used to squeeze public expenditure, not to cut it drastically,and the adjustments which might be needed were now too big for thismethod to be practicable.    The staff reductions which would beneeded would also require redundancy payments on a scale whichcould easily wipe out the benefit.    The third option was to combinesome squeeze with some increase in cash limits.    This was thecourse which he recommended to the Cabinet.    It was arguablewhether it was too tough, or not tough enough.    In the case of non-pay expenditure, he suggested that the present forecasts should beused.    These already assumed an increase in prices of 8j per cent.If the pay outturn for the year was about 15 per cent, implying priceinflation of 12-13 per cent by the end of the year, this would impose avolume squeeze on public expenditure of between 4 and 5 per cent onthe non-pay element.    A similar cut had been imposed in 1976-77.The required reductions would be correspondingly smaller if theoutturn were below 15 per cent.    He proposed that pay should betreated differently in each of the main areas of local authorities,central government and nationalised industries.    The Governmenthad already given a commitment to meet its share of the cost1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL; of the proposed settlement with local authority manual workersthrough the Rate Support Grant.    No similar commitments had beengiven in respect of other local authority groups, although these wouldno doubt demand similar treatment.    In central government it wasnot practicable or credible to stick tc the existing guidelines. Hisproposal was that the Government should finance the whole of anyincrease, other than the first 2 per cent, above the present guidelines.The 2 per cent margin he proposed would involve a real squeeze onmanpower, but one which was well within normal wastage and whichcould be achieved without redundancies.    As for nationalisedindustries, where the cash limit applied to net borrowing, hesuggested that the Government should commit itself to allowing noincrease in such net borrowing, and be prepared to accept theconsequences for public sector prices in due course if excessive payclaims made this necessary.In discussion it was pointed out that the Cabinet had already decidedthat it would not finance excessive pay settlements in the publicsector.    The risk of a pay explosion had now receded.    It did notnow seem necessary to bring forward an immediate package ofdeflationary measures, as had seemed possible only two weeksearlier.    However it was important to maintain the policy on whichthe Cabinet had already embarked.    Last week&apos;s increase inMinimum Lending Rate (MLR) had helped to stabilise the financialmarkets.    But monetary policy alone could not carry the wholeweight of adjustment.    The Government had to set realistic cashlimits which were consistent with its overall objectives.    It wasaxiomatic that, within fixed cash limits, any increase in pay mustbe offset by a reduction in the volume of expenditure to be financed.If cash limits were increased instead, this would have implicationsfor the Budget, which the Cabinet would need to discuss in due course.So far as could be foreseen at present the achievement of the publishedforecast of a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) of 8. 5 billion in 1979-80, would require the raising of at least anadditional  1. 5 billion, of which  1 billion was made necessary bythe statutory automatic uprating of personal tax allowances. Evenwith further public expenditure cuts, it was inevitable that some ofthis adjustment would have to fall on taxation, and particularly onValue Added Tax (VAT).    Such measures would not be popular, butthere would be a serious risk to confidence in sterling if the PSBRwere allowed to rise beyond the forecast level.    Action on broadlythe lines proposed by the Chief Secretary was the best hope ofkeeping the PSBR within reasonable limits.In further discussion, it was argued that the Cabinet needed a muchfuller account of the general economic background before it coulddecide on cash limits for the following year.    There was a dangerin taking decisions piecemeal.    It could be held that the recent2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALincrease in MLR had been forced on the Government by the actionsof the financial institutions.    Cabinet needed to consider theappropriate size of the PSBR in relation to Gross Domestic Product(GDP).    It should be given a choice of options, including local andcentral taxation measures; and expenditure reductions.    The effectoh growth and employment had to be considered^    The Governmentwas now committed io an annual economic assessment jointly withthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) and it was wrong to pre-empt theoutcome of those talks;    Against this, it was argued that it wasimportant to make clear the Governmenfs intentions on cash limitswithin the next two or three weeks.    Failure to do so would beintensely damaging to confidence in sterling and could provoke anearly run on the pound which would require much more severecorrective action.It was also argued that the paper before the Cabinet was an inadequatebasis on which to take decisions.    It did not make clear the effect ofthe proposed cash limits on individual programmes.    The formulaeproposed were highly arbitrary, and left no room for the exercise ofpolitical judgment on the way in which volume cuts should fall asbetween programmes.    The effect on the National Health Service(NHS) could be particularly severe, amounting perhaps to 175 million, which would much more than wipe out the increasesthe Cabinet had agreed last year.    Moreover the Health Service unionsbelieved they had been given an assurance that NHS expenditure wouldnot be cut to finance the proposed pay settlement, even though it hadbeen made clear to them in discussions the previous weekend that theNHS could not be exempted from public expenditure cuts if these werefound to be necessary.    In another sphere the proposed method ofhandling central government cash limits would prevent the achievementof the 3 per cent target increase in real terms for defence expenditure,even though the cost of improvements in armed forces1 pay alreadyagreed was a prior commitment which would have to be reflected inthe cash limits.    Moreover manpower reductions would be bitterlyopposed by the Civil Service unions.In further discussion, it was argued that the proposed treatment ofpublic sector pay implied public acceptance that the 5 per centguideline had been abandoned.    If a 2 per cent cut in manpower werejudged necessary, it would be better to impose and justify this in itsown right, rather than by relation to the outcome of a pay round whichcould not yet be precisely forecajt.    However, the formula proposedby the Chief Secretary threw away one of the main weapons indetermining public sector pay.    It amounted to a cut of 2 per cent onwhatever proved to be the going rate, and gave no incentive tonegotiators to keep settlements down to a reasonable level.    It wouldbe much better if the formula could provide for the cost of excessivesettlements to be divided in some proportionate way between an3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALincrease in the cash limits and a volume cut in the service. Thiswould provide a powerful tool in negotiations with such groups as theteachers and the Civil Service unions.    However, this approachinvolved, in effect, the establishment of a new pay norm whereasthe Cabinet had earlier decided that pay should be determined caseby case.    There was a danger that the pattern established by theproposed local authority manual workers&apos; settlement would itselfbecome a new norm, whereas it was in fact the product of the5 per cent guideline and special treatment for the low paid, togetherwith a negotiating margin.    It did not necessarily need to be copiedexactly in other sectors.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment needed to make its position on cash limits clear in thevery near future.    Announcement of the details of the public servicesettlements would lead to questions about the implications for cashlimits.    The Government would be under great pressure to explainits policy.    The Cabinet agreed that the aggregate limits set for thePSBR should not be exceeded and that the implications of this for cashlimits had to be accepted.    The exact way in which cash limits shouldbe set and adhered to required further consideration.    The ChiefSecretary should reconsider the nature and timing of his proposedannouncement.    He should discuss the effect of his proposals withsome of the departmental Ministers who would be most concerned.He should bring fresh proposals to the Cabinet at their next meeting,indicating the effect on a few major programmes where the greatestdifficulties might arise together with a draft of the announcementwhich he might make to Parliament about cash limits. Meanwhile,it was essential that there should be no disclosure of the Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion that day, and no suggestion that the Cabinet was dividedin its views.    Any suggestion of this kind would be very damaging toconfidence in sterling.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of theirdiscussion by the Prime Minister, agreed that thereshould be no unauthorised disclosure of their discussion,and invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to bring forward newproposals on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office15 February 19794CONFIDENTIAL
