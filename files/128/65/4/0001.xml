CONFIDENTIALENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat it was very difficult to predict the course of future events inIran.    The Prime Minister, Dr Bakhtiar, was highly embarrassedby the United States&apos; Government&apos;s frequent declarations of supportfor him and he had asked us not to make similar statements sincethey would only weaken his position in Iran.    In fact he had virtuallyno chance of remaining in power.    The question was whether he couldremain long enough for an accommodation to be reached between theArmy and the Ayatollah Khomeini.    An optimistic interpretation ofthe previous day&apos;s decision to close all Iran&apos;s airports for three dayswas that the Government were seeking a cooling-off period. Theyhad some contacts with the Ayatollah, but he was a very inflexibleman to deal with and little progress had been made.    If someunderstanding was not reached between him and the Army, the outcomewas likely to be disastrous.    A review of British interests in Iranhad just been completed, and this showed that although we stood tolose substantial amounts if defence orders were cancelled, our overallfinancial position was not as exposed as it had previously been thought.In this respect we were better placed than the United States, Franceand Germany.    The Soviet Union1 s attitude to the situation in Iranhad changed.    Previously they had stood on the sidelines and did notappear to have been involved in attempts to topple the Shah. Theyhad a large Muslim population of their own and were worried by thepresent rise in Islamic activism.    But recently they had moved togiving more open support for the Ayatollah Khomeini.    The Russianswere concerned that the Americans might adopt a more overt role inresponse to developments in Iran, but although there was pressurefrom the United States Congress for action, the AmericanAdministration had no intention of becoming involved militarily.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the AyatollahKhomeini appeared to be able to control the level of Iranian oil output.At present not enough was being produced even for Iran&apos;s domesticneeds and oil was now being imported.    Because there were stillsupplies of Iranian oil on the high seas, the interruption of exportswould not hit the United Kingdom and other We stern countries for alittle time yet.    Shell expected to be able to meet their Britishrequirements in the first quarter of the year, though Esso wereforecasting some shortage in February.    British Petroleum (BP)were likely to be the worst hit, and he was trying to persuade theCompany&apos;s Chairman, Sir David Steel, that he should maintain suppliesto the United Kingdom as far as possible.    In October Sir David Steelhad told him that BP would not reduce British supplies because of the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIranian crisis.    He was however now taking the line that the companyhad no obligation to safeguard supplies for this country and that thereshould be a strictly pro rata cut for the United Kingdom as for theirother customers.    He had, however, suggested offsetting this first,by attempting to buy oil on the spot market and supplying some of itto this country;   second, by drawing on the firm&apos;s stocks;  and finally,by obtaining more oil by the lifting of the Government&apos;s gas flaringrestrictions.    If these three steps were taken, it was estimated thatthe shortfall might be reduced to 1 million tons of oil.    In his viewBP&apos;s attitude that they had no special obligation to maintain the UnitedKingdom&apos;s supplies was unacceptable and he was continuing hisefforts to get Sir David Steel to give this country priority.    It wasrelevant however that if BP wanted to maximise its profits, it couldmake far more money on the spot market at present than by supplyingthe United Kingdom.    In the meantime the International EnergyAgency (IEA) and the European Economic Community (EEC) werepreparing to introduce their emergency supplies procedures, thoughthe trigger of a l\ per cent reduction below normal levels of supplyhad not yet been reached.    He was discussing with the otherMinisters directly concerned the terms of a Parliamentary statementwhich would make clear the Government&apos;s intentions as regardsNorth Sea oil exports in the present situation.    He believed thatthis should say that home demands should be met first and then theneeds of our IEA and EEC partners.    One of the purposes of thestatement would be to prevent North Sea oil reaching South Africawho had hitherto relied heavily on Iranian oil and was seekingalternative supplies.In discussion it was suggested that there might well be a distinctionbetween a statement of BP&apos;s formal position that international andcontractual undertakings prevented them from appearing todiscriminate in favour of this country and what they were preparedto do informally to help us.    The desirability of maximising oursupplies was recognised but issues of international importance wereinvolved and we should seek to avoid any confrontation with BP.In further discussion it v/as reported that we were proposing to turndown an American request that we should supply oil to Israel to makeup for their loss of Iranian oil.    Israel&apos;s needs were small. Theycould get what they required on the spot market, and the UnitedStates had in any case given them an assurance that, if necessary,they would supply Israel with oil.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared that the United Kingdom&apos;s oil supplies were assured for thetime being.    It was, however, important to clarify the positionabout BP with a view to seeing whether there was a distinctionbetween their statement of their legal obligations and their willingness2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto help us to the maximum possible extent.    Because of the widerissues involved the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary should join the Secretary of State forEnergy in his continuing discussions with Sir David Steel.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Energy and the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary to proceed accordingly.MUNITYMRSoeanitaryan and thenoncultural10USrence:9) 3rdlusiofis,te3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Ministerial Committee on European Questions had agreedthat, if the French and the Italians pressed for devaluations in theirgreen currencies in advance cf the forthcoming annual price fixing,we should equally press for a 5 per cent devaluation of the GreenPound.    We should also press for changes in the method ofcalculating monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) for pigmeat,but we might have to consider other ways of meeting the needs of thissector if such a change could not be achieved.    If our requirementson the Green Pound could be met before the price fixing, it wouldstrengthen our hand in resisting any increases in common pricesfor commodities in surplus.    This was important in view of thepressure on the Commission not to persist with their intention o proposing a price freeze.    While Press reports that the French andthe Germans had agreed on a 2 per cent increase in common priceshad not been substantiated, there was evidence that French officialswere now prepared to contemplate some increase in common pricesas part of a deal to persuade the Germans to reduce their MCAs.The possibility of such a deal should not be discounted.In discussion, it was noted that the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food would be attending a meeting of European EconomicCommunity Ministers of Agriculture in Berlin the following day atwhich he would have the opportunity to state clearly the Governmenfsattitude on common prices.    The President of the Commission hadapproached the Prime Minister for assurances that the United Kingdomwould support a Commission proposal for a price freeze.    We shouldalso seek to ensure that the Italians would stick with us in rejectingany price increases for surplus products.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had now established anad hoc group of Ministers to consider the current industrial disputes.But it was important not to overload Ministers with the detailedhandling of emergencies, and he had therefore asked the Minister ofState, Department of Industry (Mr Kaufman) to assume full-timeresponsibility under the Home Secretary for co-ordinating all suchaction.    He would be based in the Cabinet Office and take charge ofall contingencies work while the present disputes continued. Therewas no immediate sign of a solution to the road haulage dispute, andnegotiations were now taking place at local level which might lead toa series of eventual settlements at undesirably high figures. Therewas no sign of a breakthrough in the railway dispute, despite theintervention of the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress(TUC).    The offer to manual workers in the water industry had goneto ballot, and preliminary results suggested that the outcome mightbe finely balanced.    Negotiations between both sides in the localauthority manuals dispute continued.    Meanwhile, there had beeninformal talks between a number of Ministers and representatives ofthe TUC.    As a result of these, the General Council of the TUC hadnow asked for a meeting with him the following Tuesday.Preparatory discussions would take place first with other Ministers.From the Governments point of view, there was now an urgent needto reach a wide agreement with the TUC on a range of subjects,which could form the basis of an appeal to the country.    But the TUCshowed a lack of urgency.    He had made it clear to them informallythat the Government had nothing fresh to offer, and that it was now upto the TUC to put new proposals on the table.In discussion, it was suggested that the Government badly neededearly settlements at an acceptable figure in the public sector. Thiswas becoming increasingly difficult after the Governments tacitacquiescence in high settlements for tanker drivers and in due coursefor lorry drivers.    These were establishing a psychological patternof &quot;going rates&quot; which tended to move upwards over time. Forexample, it could well prove harder to obtain a very low settlementin the steel industry, despite its serious financial position, than mighthave been the case only a few weeks ago.    Expectations had beenaroused among the public service groups, who thought they had a goodcase and public support.    In the negotiations with the National HealthService (NHS) ancillaries, management and union sides appeared to feel thatthere was no prospect of a settlement on the basis so far approved bythe Government.    It might well be necessary to offer a little more,and to introduce an element of additional flexibility into the negotiations.-If this were not done, the dispute could drag on, with damagingconsequences for the NHS and for the Government.    The nurses werealso pressing their case.    Similarly, there were great uncertaintiesabout the negotiations over the local authority manual workers1 pay4SECRET
SECRETclaim.    Cabinet had approved the previous week an enhanced offerwhich included a basic 5 per cent, the  3.50 &quot;underpinning&quot; earlieragreed by Cabinet, and its extension into bonus and overtimepayments, within a total average cost of 8. 8 per cent.    There hadbeen some misunderstanding about what was then agreed as to thefinancing of this settlement.    But the offer itself might well berejected, and it was for consideration how far, if at all, theGovernment should be prepared to finance any revised offer. Itwould however be difficult for the Government to go back on its offerto finance a settlement of up to 8.8 per cent.    Any improved offerto the local authority workers would lead to pressure for a matchingsettlement in the National Health Service.    The terms of any newdeal here would need agreement with the employers, who foresawa number of difficulties.    But they had not yet agreed the proposedterms of reference for the comparability exercise suggested by theGovernment, and they could well seek reassurance on the RateSupport Grant.    Ministers should put the maximum possible pressureon the unions to reach a very early settlement, perhaps in the contextof the talks with the TUC.    The longer the issue was left, the harderit would be to settle at an acceptable figure.    At the same time,members of the unions concerned often did not fully realise theextent of the offer which was already available to them. Betterpublicity would help.In further discussion, it was argued that Cabinet needed a freshdiscussion of the overall strategy within which these negotiationswere being conducted.    This overview should include the desiredoutcome of the talks with the TUC, as well as the position which theGovernment should adopt if these talks failed.    It was inevitable thatMinisters should be faced with the need to take a series ofindividual decisions, but the level of offers appeared to be creepingup.    Moreover even when the present group of disputes had beensolved, there were other equally important ones, notably in the powerindustries, to be tackled.    It could be argued that a new going rate ofup to 10 per cent might be just about tolerable, though it would causegreat difficulties.    But if a rate as high as 15 per cent, as theTransport and General Workers Union were now suggesting, becamethe &quot;going rate&apos; the consequences would be disastrous, and would leadto a repetition of the 1975 situation.    The fact was that inflationremained the main enemy and the Government had an inescapable dutyto take offsetting action.    There should be no illusions that a15 per cent going rate, if it emerged, would require very severeoffsetting measures and a very tough budget.    Moreover, if mattersappeared to be getting out of control sterling could come underpressure and thus add its own imperatives.    On the other hand itwas argued that the alternative to high settlements might be a seriousrisk of disruption to the whole economy.    This, too, would be5 .SECRET
SECRETdamaging and would leave behind it a legacy of bitterness. Adifferent policy was available, which would involve positivediscrimination in favour of the low paid, and a better level of publicservices, both financed out of higher taxation.    Against this it wasargued that there was no evidence of support for such a policy amongthe trade unions, who nowadays placed the greatest emphasis uponthe re-establishment of differentials.    In present circumstances apolicy on the lines suggested would not work.In continued discussion, it was argued that it was impossible to runan effective voluntary pay policy without the support of the TUC. Itwas therefore essential to seek a new deal with the TUC, despitetheir cool reaction to initial advances.    Such a deal might for exampleestablish a new norm for the rest of the present pay round, which theTUC would be prepared to accept in the present crisis, as well asthe establishment of a longer term pattern.    This would needcourage and leadership on the part of the TUC which had not recentlybeen in evidence.    Many trade union leaders did not appear to realisehow precarious the Government&apos;s position would be, especially afterthe referenda in Scotland and in Wales.    Nor did they appear to befully seized of the realities of our present economic situation. Butif matters continued to olip the alternative they had to face would bethe likely return of a Conservative Government which could beexpected to curtail their powers and future strength.    It wasimpossible to lay down too precisely the line which should be takenin the first round of talks with the TUC, and the Ministers conductingthose talks would need wide discretion from the Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thetalks with the TUC should continue along lines to be agreed by theMinisters directly concerned.    The Cabinet would resume itsdiscussion of pay policy the following Tuesday, in the light of theinitial exchanges with the TUC.    Meanwhile, every effort should bemade to bring about early settlements at acceptable levels in theNational Health Service and among the local authority manual workers.The Government&apos;s response to the current industrial unrest in theroad haulage industry and other cases would continue to be supervisedby a group of Ministers under his chairmanship, with day to dayaction in the hands of the Home Secretary and the Minister of Statefor Industry.    More generally it was essential that the Governmentshould continue to seek pay settlements at the lowest possible levels.The consequences of failure to contain inflation were plain and shouldbe brought home to all concerned.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussionby the Prime Minister and invited the Ministers concernedto be guided accordingly.6SECRET

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(78) 130) proposing a scheme for giving financialaid from public funds to candidates for the June 1979 EuropeanAssembly Election, to which the memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(78) 129) setting out the basis onwhich he proposed to lay the regulations for the conduct of theEuropean Assembly Elections was relevant.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there was astrong case, supported by representations from the Party, forproviding public funds to ease the extra burden imposed by theneed to run a campaign for elections to the directly elected Assembly.Though some funds would be available to the political Parties fromAssembly sources they would not alone suffice and were in any casesubject to restrictions in the way they could be spent.    It washowever extremely doubtful whether a bill could be carried in theHouse.    Although Liberal support was likely, the Conservativeswould oppose such a bill if introduced, the Nationalists were not infavour and there were some doubts among the Governmenfs ownback benchers.    In these circumstances it was not worth trying toget a bill through.    Since he remained satisfied of ita meritshowever he recommended that the proposal be put on one side untilafter the next General Election; if that election took place before theEuropean Assembly Elections in June and sufficient support for theproposal could then be assured in the House, a bill could be introducedat that stage.In discussion it was confirmed that a total of  320, 000 would beavailable from the Assembly to the Labour Party for activitiesconnected with the Assembly election.    Although intended forinformation purposes rather than election expenses as such, itappeared likely that other European Socialist Parties would interpretthis restriction broadly and the Secretary-General of the Assembly&apos;sSocialist Group had said that the money could be used for printingelection addresses.    The financial burden on the Party would thus beeased even without the passage of the proposed bill;  the Assemblyfunds could for example be used to produce a national broadsheet.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas clear that the proposed bill should not be proceeded with for themoment.    Instead the proposal to provide state aid for the EuropeanAssembly Election should be included in the Party&apos;s electionmanifesto, with a view - if the timing was right - to introducing abill along the lines proposed after the General Election.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrsina6. The Cabinet1 s discussion and the conclusion reached isrecorded separately.tfCEItes,7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence (CP(79) 3) to which was attached a draft of the 1979Statement on the Defence Estimates.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that this year&apos;sDefence White Paper followed closely the format and line of theprevious year&apos;s.    There had been little change in the strategicsituation during the year and there seemed no reason to make anychanges in the shape of the Statement, since to do so might arousecriticism, particularly in the House.    The Defence and OverseaPolicy Committee (DOP) had already considered a draft of the WhitePaper and the version before the Cabinet incorporated certainchanges they had agreed.    For example, the heading of the sectiondealing with the Harrier aircraft had been changed to avoiddescribing it as an offensive aircraft.    It was hoped to publish theWhite Paper in the week beginning 19 February, and he sought theCabinet&apos;s approval for the draft.In discussion it was recalled that it had been necessary the previousyear to amend the various tables which attempted to show the balanceof forces between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) andthe Warsaw Pact.    French forces, though not part of NATO&apos;sintegrated military structure, had been included in the Western totals,and the same pattern was followed in the current draft.    There were,however, dangers in drawing attention to the imbalance of forces,both in the strategic sense of advertising our weaknesses to theSoviet Union and domestically in inviting criticism from theOpposition of our defence efforts.    Moreover, these deficienciesexisted despite the fact that we were meeting NATO commitmentsat the cost of a higher proportion of our gross domestic product thanalmost all our allies.    Such tables of comparison were anywaymisleading since they used only bare numbers and took no accountof the quality of the equipment or manpower concerned.    A changeof presentation would, however, draw specific attention todifferences between this year&apos;s and the previous year&apos;s tables, andthis could lead to difficulties in the House.    It would be far lessprovocative to follow the existing format.    Nor would it beworthwhile attempting to explain in detail the qualitative factors8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinvolved.    The explanations needed would become very sophisticated,and it was better to keep the simple tables despite their drawbacks.In further discussion, it was pointed out that the section on manpowercould give rise to criticism.    Recruiting and outflow trends weregiving cause for concern, and the White Paper had to seek a balancebetween the need to set out what was a serious situation accuratelyand the danger of sounding alarmist.    The problem should be neitherunder- nor over-stated and the present draft, which had beenamended in the light of DOP&apos;s discussion, had the balance about right.It had to be recognised, however, that whichever way the problem waspresented, the Opposition would seize the opportunity to criticise theGovernment on this score.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Statement on the Defence Estimates 1979.Although the shortcomings of the tables of comparative strengths ofNATO and Warsaw Pact forces were recognised, there were likelyto be greater problems in attempting to move away from the formatapproved the previous year.    The tables should, therefore, bepublished as proposed.    The difficulties over Service manpower couldwell lead to criticism in the House and more widely, and the Cabinetagreed that the relevant passage in the draft White Paper struck theright balance.    The Secretary of State for Defence should now arrangefor the White Paper to be published.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Defence to arrange publicationof the White Paper accordingly.Cabinet Office25 January 19799CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 4th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 25 January 1979 at 10. 00 amThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary (CP(79) 4) on the sale of Harrier aircraftto China. &apos;THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatalthough British Aerospace and Rolls-Royce were discussing thes, possible supply of Harrier with the Chinese, the latter had so farbeen given no formal indication that the British Government wereprepared to authorise the sale.    But the Secretary of State for Industrynow needed to tell the firms to go ahead with formal negotiations.The strategic arguments for agreeing to sell Harrier rested in parton our view of China&apos;s future.    The Chinese seemed to be seeking toplay a responsible role in the international community. Admittedlybecause of the present situation in Kampuchea the Chinese hadconcentrated forces on the Sino-Vietnamese border, but we did notbelieve that they would take military action and they had, on thecontrary, sought to pursue the matter through the United Nations.That China should proceed in this way would have been inconceivableeven a year ago.    Elsewhere, there seemed good prospects thatChina would take up her seat on the Committee on Disarmament inGeneva and would be ready to start a dialogue in this area. Ourallies and friends, including the United States, France and Germany,all expected us to go ahead with the sale and would not oppose it.We now knew that the Indians understood our position and welcomedthe fact that any sale of Harrier would be only a part of a widerpackage.    Since the Cabinet&apos;s last discussion on the matter he hadseen the Soviet Ambassador in London.    In the light of theirconversation and of a report from our Ambassador in Moscow, henow believed that the likelihood of Soviet retaliation against the saleof Harrier to China was less than it had been previously supposed.He doubted whether the Russians, who were now beginning to realisethat they had made a mistake in not taking up more of the line ofcredit which we had made available to them in 1975, would attempt to1SECRET
SECRETcut back Anglo-Soviet trade    There were signs that because we hadtaken the issue of defence sales to China carefully and steadily andhad explained our position fully and moderately in the PrimeMinister&apos;s reply to President Brezhnev&apos;s letters, the Russians werecoming to accept any decision we took to supply Harrier. Theyrecognised from our approach to the major disarmament issuessuch as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the ComprehensiveTest Ban negotiations that we took detente very seriously and thatthe supply of Harriers should be seen as a commercial matter andnot as a step towards a return to the cold war.    The stand we hadtaken with the Soviet Union on human rights had done us no harm,and they were beginning to grasp that detente was a two way process.There was no doubt that if we now decided not to sell Harrier to theChinese, there would be profound consequences for our relationswith the latter.    We were faced with very stiff competition fromother Western countries in the Chinese market and our chances ofobtaining a good share of it would be markedly reduced if we decidedagainst the supply of Harrier.    On the other hand, if we went aheadthere were indications that we would achieve the substantial packageof orders which the Chinese now understood was our objective,,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the industrialand commercial case for selling Harrier was overwhelming. Thepotential value for the United Kingdom of civil trade with China wasof the order of  10 billion, and orders were in prospect in a widerange of industries, some of which, like the metallurgical andshipbuilding industries, were amongst the most hard pressed forwork.    Moreover, China offered us a new source of some of the keyraw materials for which we were at present dangerously dependentupon South Africa.    We were, however, facing very strongcompetition, and the fact was that in many cases we did not have acommercial edge over our rivals.    But a decision to sell Harrierwould greatly strengthen our position and would act as a catalyst inthe drive to win other orders.    He therefore sought the Cabinet&apos;sapproval now for the sale of Harrier to China and their agreementthat he should have discretion to use such a decision when it wouldhave most effect in securing a balanced package of orders.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that whether to sellHarrier to China was a watershed decision.    In his view we shouldnot supply arms to dictatorships or to countries which suppressedhuman rights, and to do so would damage what the Labour Partystood for.    China claimed that war was inevitable and she wouldno doubt use in due course any weapons which we sold her. Moreover,past events had shown that China was politically volatile, and therewas no certainty that she would continue to follow her present policies.Nor had it been shown that arms sales were essential if civil orders2SECRET
SECRETwere to be won:  the United States and Germany were not proposingto sell defence equipment to China.    Further, while we should not letSoviet representations influence our decision, it was inevitable thatthe sale of Harrier would have a serious effect on Anglo-Sovietrelations.    He was therefore strongly opposed to the proposal tosupply Harriers to China.In discussion it was argued that it would be wrong on moral groundsto sell Harrier to China.    We would not contemplate supplying armsto the Soviet Union or to South Africa, and it would be equally wrongto let China have them.    In any case to sell arms to a Communiststate was in itself a totally new departure for Britain and would notbe acceptable in the Labour Party.    Many of China1 s policiesremained abhorrent.    It was not unlikely that eventually the presentrapprochement with the West would end and there would be as muchdisappointment with her as there now was with the Soviet Union.Moreover, we should look sceptically at Chinese intentions. Inthe educational and scientific field we had already done a great dealof work to meet what we understood to be their requirements, butthere had been very little response to our proposals so far. Theyseemed to be playing a cat and mouse game, continually holding putthe promise of orders and closer relations but never entering intocommitments.    We might well find that Harrier did not secure thecivil contracts we were expecting and that in the end the Chineseplaced their orders where they got the best commercial andtechnical terms.Against this it was argued that we should keep the supply of limitednumbers of an essentially defensive aircraft in perspective.    It wasnot likely to exacerbate Sino-Soviet political relations which turned onmuch bigger issues.    Nor would it disturb the military balance inEastern Asia.    China was too weak to attack the Soviet Union, andthe only effect of supplying her with Harriers might be to makerather less likely the possibility of a pre-emptive strike by Russiain the next few years.    Moreover, when China talked of war beinginevitable she now interpreted this as meaning conflict between theSoviet Union and the West.    We had handled the Harrier issue wellwith the Soviet Union so far, and it had made them realise that, intheir pursuit of closer relations with other Western countries, theyhad neglected their links with us.    They, like the Chinesethemselves, saw that we were trying to make progress in ourrelationship with China on a broad front which embraced not onlydefence but also the political, trade and cultural fields.    They nowseemed to be taking this development more calmly, and it was unlikelythat a decision to sell Harrier would harm detente.    On the other hand,to yield now to Russian pressure would seem like vassalage. Whilethere could be no guarantee that present Chinese policies would3SECRET
SECRETcontinue indefinitely, we should not underestimate the dramaticchange which had taken place in the Chinese leadership and in theirattitude to relations with the rest of the world.    They were now farless intransigent and were moving towards a more open society.We should pursue policies that would improve our relations withthem, so that we were better placed to encourage them to movefaster on human rights.    The Harrier had become a key element inour relationship with them,    A decision to sell it would haveimportant political effects, as well as making it possible to secureorders worth ms.ny thousands of jobs in British industry which wouldprobably otherwise go elsewhere.In further discussion it was argued that the worldwide trade in armswas now so great that we should try to take a fresh initiative to bringit under control.    The United Kingdom did not itself have a policythat could be universally applied.    On the other hand, there wereclear criteria against which individual sales were considered, andin certain cases like the Middle East we had regional policies whichwe applied consistently, even though this sometimes cost us valuableorders.    President Carter still hoped to be able to restrain armssales, but so far his initiative had made little progress. TheCabinet should review the present position and consider whether therewere constructive moves which the United Kingdom could make. Itwould in any case be helpful politically if the Government were tomake a clear statement of its defence sales policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said the issuesraised by the proposal to supply Harriers to China were of greatimportance and it was right that the Cabinet should consider it fully.Strong views had been expressed against the proposal, but the Cabinetagreed by a majority that we should sell the aircraft to China andpermit its manufacture under licence.
