CONFIDENTIALIERAL. 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following the GovernmentCTION defeat on the Motion of Confidence and his statement that theGovernment would now take their case to the country, he had heldinformal consultations with a number of his colleagues and also with theNational Agent of the Labour Party.    This had led him to conclude thatthe right date for the General Election would be 3 May.    This wouldrequire legislation, which had already been prepared on a contingentbasis, to allow the Election to be held at the same time as the electionsto district councils, although elections for parish councils would bedeferred for a month.    The Opposition wanted the Election to be on26 April and had argued that a Bill to extend the provisions of the 1978Budget for a few months could be carried through all its stages on thefollowing day with a view to Parliament being dissolved this week.There was however no reason why the Government should be rushed inthis way.    A temporary Finance Bill was bound to be rather morecomplicated than the Opposition seemed to think and there was alsoother legislation which had already passed through almost all its stagesand which it would be worth trying to get on to the Statute Book. Itseemed better therefore to arrange for Parliament to meet on the firstthree days of the following week.    It could then adjourn on Wednesday4 April with Dissolution probably on  7 April.    On this basis polling inthe General Election would take place on 3 May:  and the State Openingof Parliament would be on 15 May.    In the circumstances the balance ofadvantage seemed to be against having prorogation.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER explained that the Oppositionproposal to defer for two months the expiry of the existing power tocollect Income Tax, Advance Corporation Tax and Corporation Tax wasimpracticable.    On this basis Child Tax Allowances (CTAs) would revertto their 1975-76 levels whereas the Inland Revenue had already issuedcoding notices on the basis that CTAs would be phased out.    Thus theRevenue would be collecting taxes illegally and action might be takenagainst them.    Similar problems would arise on certain other matters,for example in relation to the ceiling on mortgage interest.    Subject tothe Cabinet&apos;s agreement, he proposed to persuade the ShadowChancellor that the right course was to renew Income Tax, AdvanceCorporation Tax and Corporation Tax at their present rates, to with-draw CTAs and to commit the Government to indexing personalallowances as provided for under the Rooker/Wise amendment. Theamount by which the personal allowances should be increased could beleft open until after the Election since if a Labour Government werereturned it might well want to give more than was strictly necessaryunder the Rooker/Wise amendment:  and no earlier decision wasnecessary because there was no possibility of getting the extra moneyinto pay packets before the Election.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that an attempt should also be made to carrythe necessary Resolutions for the November uprating of social securitybenefits before Parliament was dissolved.    There would be politicaladvantages in this course, and there would be considerable admini-strative problems if a decision were deferred until after the Election.Against this it was argued strongly that there was no prospect of securingOpposition support for the Resolutions and furthermore that the figuresnecessary to determine the size of the upratings were not yet available.In any case there might be no political advantage even if an announcementcould be made now.    The matter ought to be further considered in thecontext of the Manifesto.In further discussion the Cabinet noted that there were a number of Billswhich had completed almost all their stages and whose passage into lawthe Opposition would facilitate.    Attempts would also be made to completethe Merchant Shipping Bill and the Industry Bill.    The latter wasparticularly important since if it were not carried the National EnterpriseBoard would not be able to provide necessary funding to British Leylandin May.    It was also argued that there was Opposition support for mostof the clauses of the Education Bill and that an attempt should be made tocarry as much of the Bill as possible.In continued discussion the Cabinet considered the basis on which theywould discuss the Manifesto with the National Executive Committee ofthe Labour Party under Clause V of the Party1 s constitution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatimmediately following the meeting he would be going to see The Queen.He intended to announce later that day that The Queen had agreed thatParliament should be dissolved on 7 April:  that polling would be on3 May:  that the new Parliament would be sworn in on 9 May:  and thatthe State Opening would be on 15 May.    The Home Secretary would givean early Press conference to explain the implications of the Bill to allowthe Election to take place on the same day as the district councilelections.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer would negotiate Oppositionsupport for an interim Finance Bill on the lines he had outlined. Nofurther action should be taken at this stage over the November upratingof social security benefits.    The Lord President of the Council and theChief Whip would seek Opposition support for the completion of as manyuncontroversial Bills as possible:  these consultations should also coverthe Industry, Countryside and Education Bills even though Oppositionsupport for the last two of these was doubtful.    As regards non-Parliamentary business, the Government retained its responsibility togovern during an Election campaign but it was customary for Ministersto observe discretion over the initiation of any longer-term action andover making appointments.    He would circulate guidance to hiscolleagues about this and other matters bearing on the conduct ofMinisters during an Election campaign.2 . 1CONFIDENTIAL

SECRETIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 14th Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 29 March 1979 at 10,00 amCOPY NOAY AND CASHIMITSreviouseferences:M(79) 9thonclusions,llinute 8andM(79) 13thinclusions,(iinutes 4 and 5The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the&apos; Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(79) 27) about cash limits, a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster Generalabout teachers pay (CP(79) 28) and associated correspondence.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that Cabinet had authorised him tomake an offer to the Civil Service unions for the pay increase dueon 1 April 1979.    He and the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection had accordingly met the unions, but thenegotiations had rapidly broken down.    Industrial action wasthreatened for the following Monday, 2 April.    It could escalaterapidly thereafter.    It was important to try to get the unions back tothe negotiating table.    In his view, the initial offer which he hadmade (7 per cent on 1 April 1979) was insufficient, but 9 per centshould be enough.    The unions were more worried about staging.In particular they regarded the offer of implementation in full on1 April 1980 as being tantamount to the avoidance by Government ofa Pay Research Unit (PRU) based settlement this year. Accordinglythey wanted interim staging for all grades.    The unions were alsoanxious to conclude the final staging of the 1979 pay settlement before1 April 1980, so as to avoid the danger of the final instalment of the1979 PRU being subsumed in the 1980 settlement.    His view was thatthe unions would accept an offer of 9 per cent from 1 April 1979 withreasonable staging, in two bites, over the coming twelve months.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND CONSUMERPROTECTION said that the choice before the Cabinet was betweenstanding up to a potentially damaging strike, or seeking a quickagreement.    The latter would need an immediate approach to theunions.     Informal talks had continued with the unions since thebreakdown of negotiations.    Two of them remained intransigent.The rest would probably accept a settlement on the lines suggestedby the Lord Privy Seal, provided there were a substantial stage inpayment before 1 April 1980.    Such a course could have damagingrepercussions, especially with the teachers.    This was a pricewhich the Cabinet might have to pay.SECRET
SECRETTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEAND PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the settlement for the CivilService should have regard to the effect on teachers, who had beenreasonable in their negotiations so far.    The Government shouldavoid discriminating against them.    The initial payment would haveto be the same in both cases.    It might be possible to defend adifferent staging pattern, and her preference would be for April 1980and April 1981 for the teachers, with a fall-back of January 1980 andAugust 1980.    It would also be important to reach agreement on theterms of reference of the teachers claim to the Standing Commissionon comparability.     She would like to make informal approaches tothe teachers unions in the course of the day.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that/me proposed offerto the teachers raised the question of Rate Support Grant (RSG) andCash Limits.    The Government had undertaken to find its share(61 per cent) of the pay settlement for local authority manual workersand similar groups, on the ground that they were low paid.    It wasnot committed to a similar treatment for the rest of the public sectorgroups.    If full RSG support were conceded for the teachers, it wouldbe impossible to avoid it in other cases.    This implied a modificationof the present policy on cash limits, which required a volume squeezeof some size to accommodate increases in pay above the originalguideline s.In discussion, it was suggested that the Cabinet had little choice, inthe new situation, but to seek an early solution both to the CivilService and to the teachers pay claims.    A new norm was emergingin the public sector of 9 per cent, ana it would be difficult to securesettlements at any lower figure.    The Government should not commititself on the question of cash limits.    Each case might be treated onits merits.    Alternatively the question of Government finance abovethe levels already approved could be left for settlement at a laterstage.    It was recognised that this course might involve theGovernment in clashes with the local authority associations, who mightwell refuse to authorise offers in line with Government wishes unlessthey were assured of financial support.    In these cases, theGovernment would be entitled to publicise the offer i. was prepared toendorse, and shift the blame to the local authority associations,The niceties of RSG   would not feature largely in an election campaign.It was essential that an early approach be made to the unions in bothcases, and in particular that a settlement be reached if possible thefollowing day which would allow the Civil Service unions to call offthe threatened industrial action on 2 April.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that negotiations should be resumed urgently with theCivil Service unions with a view to a quick settlement and the avoid-ance of the industrial action planned for the following Monday.2SECRET
SECRETTo this end the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P))should meet immediately after Cabinet to consider the parameters ofa fresh offer to the Civil Service unions.    Informal soundings shouldthen be taken of the unions concerned to see whether they would beprepared to return to the negotiating table on the agreed basis.EY(P) had discretion to approve an initial payment of up to 9 per cent,and any modification of the staging pattern which seemed desirable inthe interests of a quick solution.    They should also consider thequestion of teachers pay, and had full authority to authorise a revisedoffer if necessary.    On the question of cash limits, the Cabinet agreedthat the local authorities could be offered RSG support for an initialpayment to the teachers of up to 9 per cent.     They agreed that EY(P)could consider the terms of any further undertaking to the localauthorities about financial support for staged payments of the resultsof comparability studies.    On the question of other cash limits, theCabinet agreed that nothing should be   -added in public to the terms ofthe statement made to Parliament by the Chief Secretary, Treasury on23 February.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office29 March 19793SECRET
CM(79) 14th Conclusions,Minute 2 (LCA)PRIME MINISTERCASH LIMITS AND PAY -NHSIn response to my minute of 22 March,  about theNs*^h limitstreatment of NHS and armed forces pay, your Private Secretary&apos;sletter of 24 March proposed a formula on the latter which theSecretary of State for Defence could use in the defence debate.I agree that this should hold the position.Equally on the question of NHS pay,  there is no need to sayanything publicly in the next day or so.    But with the newfinancial year imminent,  the health authorities must be giventheir cash limits with no further delay.    If we do not givethem any clearer basis for planning,  a^d rest on my statementof 23 February,  they will assume that they will have to find a&quot;substantial, proportion&quot; of the excess cost of pay settlementsfor all their staff - which would imply a very drastic squeezeon NHS expenditure,  requiring severe cuts from the beginningof the new financial year.The Secretary of State for Social Services and I both recognisethat there is a presentational problem.    We think this could bemet,  if the policy is agreed as proposed in my earlier minute,by stating our decision,  to the health authorities and in public,in rather more general terms.    Individual cash limits will benotified to the health authorities on the basis that these areexpected to involve a certain overall squeeze on the volume ofresources and that they must plan their services so as to keepwithin those limits.    As always,  they must have flexibility tomanage their total resources as they judge best in the light oflocal circumstances.    As regards non-pay expenditure they willhave to make their own prudent judgement of the extent1.
to which prices may rise above the level provided for. Onpay,   it will be explained that in coming to the decision aboutthe    contribution the health authorities.should make to excesscosts,  the Government have had regard to the burdens falling onstaff in direct support of patients,  and that this is reflectedin the extent to which they will be prepared to adjust cashlimits in respect of pay settlements.     In practice, healthauthorities will no doubt review all manpower costs to seewhere economies can be made and the non-exempt staff willcertainly come under scrutiny;     indeed it is possible that thesqueeze on non-pay expenditure will lead the authorities to cuttotal manpower costs by more than the sum we have envisaged.But we would certainly avoid saying anything which might givethe impression that health authorities are required to makespecific cuts in the wages bills of particular groups of staff.On this basis,  we believe that the proposal would give healthauthorities a reasonable basis for planning their expenditure,without appearing to require any dramatic cut in particular groupsof staff or levels of service.    If you are content,  the Secretaryof State for Social Services will proceed on this basis at theend of this week or early next. -I am sending copies of this minute to our Cabinet colleagues, andto Sir John Hunt.JOEL BARNETT27 March 19790
PRIME MINISTERCASH LIMITS AND PAYIfhave seen the minute which Shirley Williams sent to you on26 March proposing that &quot;appropriate&quot; settlements with universityteachers and technicians should carry no penalties by way ofabsorption of the cost of the settlement in the relevant cashlimits.If the settlement is at 5$ plus  3.50 Underpinning, the question ofa penalty will not of course arise.    I take it however that Shirleyis thinking in terms of settlements above that figure.    In that caseI must object to what she proposes unless the Civil Service is treatsimilarly.    I have, all along been willing to agree that the excesscost of the Civil Service settlement should be absorbed to the extenof the agreed formula of at least 2$, but only on the understandingthat other public services should be treated similarly.   We havealready agreed special treatment for the Armed Forces, the localauthority manual staffs and staff in direct support of patients inthe National Health Service.    There are good reasons for thesearrangements, and I accept them.    But the setting of the &quot;trigger&quot;for absorption at 8$ for the teachers is already causing me concernbecause of the discrimination against the Civil Service which itimplies; and if Shirley1s latest proposal is added to that, thediscrimination will become blatant.    I see no reason to suppose thatour own programmes&apos; within Government can suffer a cut more easilythan the universities, and I am. certain that this degree ofdiscrimination would inflame our present troubles in industrialrelations still further - both wrongly and unnecessarily.I am sending copies of this minute to the other members of theCabinet and to Sir John Hunt.PEART-T7March 1979
PRIME MINISTERCASH LIMITS    AND PAYI agree with the proposals for the NHS/and the armed &apos;forcesset out in the Chief Secretary&apos;s minute of 22 March to you.The formula in paragraph 6 of his minute that he and theSecretary of State for Social Services have agreed for theNHS is relevant to the universities.    Two thirds of the NHSpay bill is to be excluded from the cash limit penalty; and,although no offer has yet been made to the university teachersand the offer made to the university technicians  (whose functionsare analogous to those of medical laboratory technicians),has not yet been accepted, I hope that you and the ChiefSecretary will agree that appropriate settlements with thesetwo groups should not carry any penalties.I am sending copies of this minute to the other members ofthe Cabinet and to Sir John Hunt.

He has asked that no action should be taken untilMinisters have had an opportunity to consider further.As for the armed forces, the Prime Minister would much preferit if the Secretary of State for Defence could avoid any referenceto pay and cash limits in his speech in the debate on Monday.He has asked that Mr. Mulley should only refer to pay and cashlimits if pressed.

Yoi^ say in your secondsentence that you must at least be able to make it clear tothe NHS that the squeeze will fee -no worse than is now contemplated.If by &quot;is now contemplated&quot; you sue referring to a fixed figure,then I do not think this is acceptable,  or indeed&apos;in keeping withthe next two sentences of your minute.    X am prepared to acceptthat on the pay side the present treatment will not be openedsave in the circumstances you indicate,  and I certainly acknow-ledge your right to lodge a claim for an adjustment on thenon-pay side if increases in prices exceed a certain rate. Butwe cannot be sure that the Standing Commission will not makerecommendations beyond our present contemplation, nor, of course,can we agree in advance that any&apos;claim you may put in for adjust-ment on the non-pay side would be accepted.    It follows that whatwe agree at this stage cannot be a firm figure,  and I do not thinkthat the NHS should be told that it is.    On the other hand, ifin what &quot;is now contemplated&quot; you include these risks on the payand non-pay side,  then I am content.I should in any case be grateful if you would keep my officials intouch with the drafting of the guidance which you propose to giveto health authorities.I am sending copies of this minute to the Prime Minister, ourother Cabinet colleagues and to Sir John Hunt.NLjl\ joelXbarnett^3
PRIME MINISTERThe Chief Secretary of the Treasury has minuted &quot;yocfabout theadjustment of NHS cash limits.   I recognise that his proposal isthe most that he judges possible given the decision Cabinet hastaken, and I have reluctantly accepted it on that basis.   But Iremain very anxious about the Service and political implicationsof cutting NHS resources at a time when the staff are strugglingin the face of great difficulty to keep the hospitals going andthe expectation had been - on the basis of the Public ExpenditureWhite Paper - for some modest developments in the coming year.I think it is essential that colleagues should understand theeffect of the decision taken on the Health Service.    On the basisproposed by the Chief Secretary we shall be cutting the plannedvolume of NHS expenditure by at least V/o.   This will meancancelling out the money for new developments announced in Januaryin Command 7^39 and will leave only the minimum 1% growth requiredfor &quot;standing still&quot; in the NHS as a whole in the light of the growthin the elderly population.   We shall have no margin of resources tomeet the whole range of urgent problems we are committed to tackling- for example, the serious and lengthening delays in treatment,dangerous laboratories and inadequate care of the mentally handicapped- made worse by the industrial action in recent weeks.   Even in normaltimes it could well mean cuts in services (eg closure of beds) inorder to finance commitments such as&quot;the opening of new hospitals.But the squeeze follows the biggest industrial disruption the NHShas suffered, a disruption which will have lengthened waiting listsand extended waiting periods.I am not suggesting that the NHS should be totally-excluded from anexercise in economy at this time.   We must make renewed efforts tomake economies as we have so successfully done in the past few years.We must also make staff economies - particularly in some of thegroups of ancillary workers.   But the scope for big savings in theshort run are very limited, without plunging the NHS back intoindustrial action just as the current conflict is ending.
The effect of volume cuts in the Health Service are both immediateand apparent since we have virtually none of the shortfall to befound in other programmes;   and we have already cut our capital toa dangerously low level.   We cannot therefore fudge the issues,and squeeze without it being noticed.The upshot is that   planning a major cut in expenditure in theNational Health Service cannot be kept from public knowledge. Ishall minimise the impact in whatever way I can, but we mustexpect criticism from the Service itself, from the public and fromthe Party.   We shall be especially criticised for taking this actionat a time when the Health Service has come through a very damagingdispute and when it will be seen to need more resources rather thanless to cope with its heavy responsibilities.   We shall haveparticular difficulty in the south-east, where we have already hadto impose a virtual standstill in order to - finance committeddevelopments in grossly under-provided areas in the North andMidlands.My submission is that having gone as far as it is possible byagreement with the Treasury, Cabinet colleagues should accept that -however carefully we present our decisions - it will soon becomeapparent that we are having to defer most of the developmentsplanned on the basis of the recent White Paper.    In this situationI must at least be able to make it clear to the NHS that the squeezewill be no worse than is now contemplated.    On the pay side I couldnot contemplate the possibility of re-opening the proposed treatmentof NHS cash limits unless the Standing Commission made awards thatwere quite out of keeping with what might reasonably have beenexpected.    On theron-pay side I must reserve the right to lodge aclaim for some upward adjustment of the NHS cash limit if theincrease in retail prices exceeds an annual rate of 12^.I am sending copies of this minute to pur Cabinet colleagues, andto Sir John Hunt. ^2.Z March 19792
CASH LIMITS AND PAY1.    There are two areas of the public service - NHS and armedforces - where our decision in Cabinet on 22 February on thecash limit treatment of central government pay settlementsneeds to be spelled out and made public.1. NHS2. The Secretary of State for Social Services and I have beendiscussing the treatment of NHS pay settlements in the cash limitfor hospital and community health services.3-    There are good reasons for seeking to decide this now, andfor considering this cash block as a whole, rather than decidingon each individual settlement.    For the nurses, a settlementcould be &quot;reached shortly,  though the timing is still uncertain;we shall need to be able to say at the same time what is to bedone about adjusting the cash limit.    More generally, healthauthorities need guidance on how much they will be able to spendduring the financial year,  and what volume reduction may berequired,  in respect of pay settlements as well as price increases.4. On the non-pay side, we must certainly hold the cash limitand health authorities must plan for a volume reduction of theorder of 3-4% on present forecasts.5-    On the pay side, we cannot give absolutely firm guidance,because we cannot rule out the possibility1.
CONFIDENTIAL(that a particular settlement could be so high that we mightwant to adjust the cash limit less than fully, whatever may beagreed now.    But,  subject to this, I agree with the view whichthe Secretary of State for Social Services has put to me, thatwe cannot realistically expect to impose a volume reduction, onthe NHS in respect of pay settlements for nurses, or for otherstaff in direct support of patients  (doctors, ambulancemen,medical laboratory technicians,  and other grades related tonurses).    On the other hand,  for other NHS staff (administrativeand clerical, ancillaries and maintenance men) it would be rightto plan on the basis of cuts of 2%.6.    This jvould give a volume reduction of  22 million (GB, 1978Survey prices),  additional to the squeeze on the non-pay side whichis already likely to take away most of the room for improvementin NHS standards in the White Paper totals  (a 2% reduction formedical and nursing etc.  staff would impose a further cut of about ^5 million, which in my view would be politically and practicallyunrealistic).    You yourself warned the trade union leaders thatsome cut might be necessary,  following the offer to ancillaries;in my view, and the Secretary of State&apos;s,  to apply the planned2 per cent squeeze to staff not in direct support of patientswould be an acceptable compromise.7*    As in the parallel case of the Civil Service, where you haveagreed to the Lord Privy Seal*s proposal,  it would be desirableto put this proposed package to the health authorities as soonas possible - which means,  in effect, to announce it publicly.We should need to make it clear that the treatment proposed forboth &quot;exempt&quot; and &quot;non-exempt&quot; settlements is provisional, forplanning purposes, and might need to be re-opened if either theinitial settlement, or indeed any subsequent staged &quot;comparability&quot;increase, went so far beyond what had been allowed for that someoffsetting volume reduction had to be made.8.    On this footing, I should be grateful for your agreement to-  the proposed treatment of NHS pay settlements in the relevant cashlimit - that is,  assumptions for planning purposes that the cash
limit will be fully adjusted in respect of settlements for staffin direct support of patients, but subject, to a volume reductioneof 2% in respect of other NHS staff.II.    Armed Forces9. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body is expected to make arecommendation within the next few weeks,  to take effect from1 April.    We are already committed to accepting it.    The Secretaryof State for Defence is being pressed to say whether the cashlimits will be fully adjusted to accommodate this award.    In hisjudgement it will be essential to make this clear in the debateon Monday.    I have discussed this with him,  and agree that, whenthe Defence budget is already facing a substantial squeeze on thenon-pay side,  there is no realistic possibility of offsetting anyexcess in the pay award, beyond what is allowed for at present inthe cash limit,  by a reduction in the numbers of Armed Forces. Ishould have preferred to leave open the possibility that seme partof the cost might be offset &quot;by a further squeeze elsewhere in theDefence budget.    Bu^: he sees difficulties, in this,  and in any casewe cannot now reach a firm view on whether it would be practicable.I have therefore agreed with him,   subject to your views,  that heshould use the following form of words in the debate on Monday:&quot;As I made clear to the House on 22 May last,  the pay ofthe Armed Forces will be updated from 1 April next inaccordance with the recommendations of the Armed ForcesPay Review Body in their 1979 report expected shortly.This, will be in addition to the staged payment agreed lastyear.    I can say now that there is no question of cuttingthe size of the Armed Forces to accommodate the pay awardwithin the published cash limits.    Nor is there any intentionto meet the cost by cuts in the equipment programme; butthe size of the adjustment to the cash limits can only bedetermined when we know the amount of this year*s pay award.&quot;10. Again I should be grateful for your agreement to this formof words, which-rules out any reduction in armed forces numbers,but does not entirely rule out the possibility of some squeeze3-
CONFIDENTIALelsewhere in the Defence budget.    It would be helpful to haveyour agreement to this before the week-end. if possible.11. I am sending copies of this minute to our Cabinet colleagues,and to Sir John Hunt.JOEL BARNETT22 March 1979ff.3
