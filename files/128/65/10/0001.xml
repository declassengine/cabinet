CONFIDENTIALution 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that Ministers were likely tobe pressed to make instant comments on the results of thedevolution referenda as they became available during the followingafternoon.    The Government should not be rushed into anypremature statement of intent and he proposed that initial commentsshould be on the lines that the       ernment had given the people achoice which had now been expressed;  if the results showed aclear majority for or against devolution, that would be the people&quot;sdecision.    If, as might happen in Scotland, there were a majorityin favour of devolution but with insufficient votes to meet the40 per cent requirement, it should be made clear that theGovernment would comply with their obligation to lay the necessaryOrder under the Scotland Act, but that the decision on that Orderwould be a matter for Parliament;  that there would be anopportunity for full debate;  and that the Government would considerthe advice they would give to Parliament in due course. Firmreplies should be given to any wider questions about the implicationsof the results for the future of the Government.    The Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary would take part in a discussion programmeon BBC television, with Mr Pym representing the Conservativesand Mr Beith representing the Liberals.In a short discussion the view was put forward that theGovernments decision to allow the people to express their viewsin a referendum should not be a reason for the Government to takea wholly passive attitude once the results had been declared.Important issues had been raised which were part of the campaignfor progress towards greater democracy;  these would continue tobe discussed and the Government should have a position on them.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that any immediate   questions should beanswered on the lines he had indicated.    The Cabinet would considerthe results of the referenda and the Governmenfs position at theirmeeting on the following Thursday.    Whatever the actual result,devolution to a Scottish Assembly would remain a live issue inScotland, but a clear vote against devolution might be received withsome relief in Wales.    It would be important, however, for theGovernment to show recognition of the fact that such a vote did notimply any diminution of the importance to be attached, through theresponsibilities exercised by the Secretary of State, to the closerparticipation of the Welsh in their own affairs.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing upof their discussion.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the satisfactory settlementreached with the mineworkers&apos; union was a useful bonus to theGovernment;  and there were encouraging reports of the outcome ofvoting on the pay offer made to the local authority manual workersand the other 3 public  service groups.    But the Cabinet would wishto consider how to overcome the brd publicity over the delay inreaching a settlement with the nurses.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee onPay Negotiations had agreed the previous day on the offer whichshould be put to the nurses on the staging of comparability increases.The dates wuuld be identical with those for the 4 public servicegroups.    It w^s desirable that the offer should be made very quickly.The General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress (Mr LionelMurray) had however expressed reservations about an early offeron the grounds that if the nurses rejected it before the 4 publicservice groups negotiations were completed this could adverselyaffect the outcome of these disputes.    He proposed to have earlydiscussions with Mr Murray with the aim of announcing the offer onMonday at the latest.In disct ssion it was argued that there was a strong case for makingthe offer at the earliest opportunity since the nurses had strongpublic support and they had not resorted to strike action. TheGovernment should make its own judgment on the timing,Mr Murray&apos;s concern was valid but need not inhibit an earlyintimation that an offer would be made to the nurses early in thefollowing week - by which time the public service issue should besettled one way or another.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Social Services shouldmake it known before the weekend that an offer would be made to thenurses early in the following week but without at this stage givingany indication of the nature of the offer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of the discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guidedaccordingly.3. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arerecorded separately.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that an article in the &quot;Guardian&quot;on 27 February had been very damaging.    It was based uponunauthorised disclosure of an internal Treasury document. Thereport gave the impression that a very large amount of Governmentmoney had been &quot;wasted&quot; on various forms of industrial support,mainly in order to save jobs.    This was quite wrong.    In all thecases quoted by the Guardian, a much wider range of considerations,industrial, strategic, diplomatic and economic, had beenconsidered.    Moreover the decisions had not, as the Guardianimplied, been taken behind closed doors, but after a very consider-able amount of public debate including in some cases representationsin favour of the chosen course by Opposition Members ofParliament.In discussion, there was general agreement that the leak of such adocument was mo^t unfortunate.    It was clear that the authors ofthe document had in no way been politically motivated, and had beenperforming a legitimate analytical task.    But a sensitive documentof this kind should not have been circulated to other Departmentswithout the knowledge of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Itshould be comparatively easy to counter any Opposition attacksupon &quot;waste&quot; by reference to similar expenditure approved whenthe Conservative Government was in office.    But it would beimportant that Ministers took every opportunity to put the recordstraight.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet regretted the episode.    They were however satisfied thatthe decisions described in the Treasury document and in theGuardian article had been entirely correct when wider considerationswere taken into account.  All Ministers should take every opportunityover the coming weekend, both in speeches and in Press statements,to put the record right.    For this purpose he was arranging for a fullbrief to be provided.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.VE3NMENTPORT FORUSTRYCONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat fighting was going on deep in Vietnam territory, but there wasno confirmation of the report that Vietnamese forces had beenfighting in China.    It seemed unlikely that Chinese forces would bewithdrawn quickly and the situation remained potentially dangerous.So far there was no indication of auy Soviet involvement on theChinese border.    In the discussion in the Security Council many ofthe non-aligned countries were supporting China but everyone wasbusy hedging their bets.    The Russians were not prepared to acceptany price for Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia.   We hadco-sponsored with the United States and Norway a resolution in theSecurity Council.    Although our Community partners were notprepared to join us, we had taken the view that a matter of thisimportance must be brought before the Council.    Our action hadgiven us the opportunity for improving our contacts with thecountries belonging to the Association of South East Asian Nationsbut the lack of coverage in the British Press for this step had beendisappointing.    There had been some discussion of the possibility ofconvening a conference on the lines of the Indo/China conferenceand he was in close touch with the United States Government as wellas with the French and Germans about further moves.    The UnitedStates itself would probably not wish to be involved in any conferencebut the Soviet Union would have to be.    There was a possible rolefor us to play here and, subject to the outcome of his consultationswith the Americans, there might be advantage in our taking a directinitiative with the Soviet Union.    There was a general feeling thatinternational action should be taken to restrain the Vietnamese andthat, if nothing was done, Thailand might be their next target.Meanwhile the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s visit to China wasgoing well.    The main emphasis had been on civil contracts and thequestion of military sales had been played in a low key. Theconclusion of the Harrier contract was still some months off and wewould need to make a considered judgment when we saw how thesituation in the area developed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwhile we should certainly keep in close touch with the United Stateson all these developments, there could well be advantage in theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary having a general talk with theSoviet Ambassador about the situation.    Independently of any viewsthe Americans might express, we had our own need to reassure theRussians in the light of our developing relations with China, and thenegotiations over Harriers.    In any event we might be well placedto take an initiative to promote a peaceful settlement of what coulddevelop into a highly dangerous situation:  and the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary should give urgent thought to this aspect.The Cabinet -1.

The scandal over the misuse of South African Governmentfunds had evidently gone deeper than we had realised and there wasa possibility of further revelations, and this could lead to the SouthAfrican Government deciding to adopt a hard line defensive postureand to pull out of the agreement.hode sia.Ireviousleference:rf(79) 7thusions,linute 2As regards Rhodesia, it now seemed almost certain that the UnitedStates Congress would adopt a resolution on the despatch ofobservers to the April elections.    The proposal was for the appoint-ment of two members of Congress as chairpersons, with a group ofup to 50 observers.    In his view this was a bad decision and fewCongressman had faced up to the real difficulties of what they were,proposing, in particular the military danger which the observerswere likely to run if, for example, they were to venture into theTribal Trust Lands.    If, however, Congress went ahead it might bevery difficult for us to do nothing.    In any case, if the Governmenttook no action to organise a delegation the Conservatives wouldprobably do so on their own.    This was however a very differentmatter from the visit by the Pearce Commission in 1972 which wassent by the Government in conditions of peace, when they were ableto visit many parts of the country without risk.    He had in mind thepossibility of sending a Parliamentary delegation, includingrepresentatives of all Parties, to observe the elections. Givenits composition the views of such a delegation would be likely to bevery divided and there was little likelihood of a unanimous report.But there would be some serious security problems. Hewould be consulting hies colleagues further about this..pddle EastTHE SECRETARY OF STA.TE FOR ENERGY said he had had along discussion on 28  February   with Sheikh Yamani of Saudi Arabia.He would be sending round a record of this for the information ofhis colleagues, but there were two points he would like to reportstraightaway.    The first was that the Organisation of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) would insist on a rise in the price ofoil in March and this would apply to the full Saudi Arabian productionof l\ million barrels a day.    The second was that the Saudis didnot think that Ayatollah Khomeini would survive long in Iran andthat the Saudis themselves did not want him to survive.The Cabinet -2.Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Ministerial Committee on European Questions would bemeeting next week to consider the Common Agricultural Policy(CAP) prices and the problem of Monetary Compensatory Amounts(MCAs).    The intention of the French Presidency appeared to be toavoid serious discussion of the MCA issue and the European MonetarySystem at the March European Council.    Agreement might not bepossible until the following European Council after the directelections to the European Assembly in June.    The Presidency hadproposed a number of other items for discussion includingPresident Giscard&apos;s idea for holding a Euro/Arab/Africanconference.    We would want to discuss the question of resourcetransfers and the formula which we had tabled at the DecemberEuropean Council would provide a peg for this.    His talks in Bonnearlier in the week indicated that the Germans were beginning torealise thai the imbalance in the Budget was a serious issue for us.There had been a hint that some modification to the FinancialMechanism, which because of its present provisions did not bringus any relief on our budgetary contribution, might be possible.He was having this examined by officials to see whether the ideashould be tak-an up at the next Anglo-German summit meeting in May,,THE PRIME MINISTER said that at the forthcoming EuropeanCouncil he would wish to focus primarily on the CAP and the needto hold down prices.    But he would also introduce the budgetaryproblem in order to pave the way for this to be a major topic atthe following European Council in June.The Cabinet -Took note.HE ECONOMICUTLOOK7.

They had decided that theonly practicable offer would be that the pay increases resultingfrom the 1979 pay research study would be implemented in fullby the 1930 settlement date.    No commitment should be enteredinto on any other aspect of the settlement which would be for laternegotiation.    The Sub-Committee had felt that nothing less thanan offer on these lines would offer a hope of ending industrialaction.    The Governments room for manoeuvre had beenseverely limited by the terms of the offer made to the four publicservice groups for which comparability studies had not even begun.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a, brief discussion, said thatin view of the concern expressed by some members of the Cabinethe would himself carefully consider EY(P) Committee&apos;s conclusionsand decide whether further discussion with the Ministersconcerned was necessary.

SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 10th Conclusions, Minute 7Thursday 1 March 1979 at 10.30 amHE ECONOMIC THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he wouldUTLOOK welcome the views of the Cabinet on the shape and contents ofthe forthcoming Budget.    The short-term economic prospectshad deteriorated since the last published forecast in the autumn1978, both internationally^ with a decline in world trade and anincrease in oil prices) and domestically (because of a higher levelof wage settlements).    Knowledgeable outside forecasters agreedthat the likely outturn on wages was of the order of 13 or14 per cent for the current wage round;  that the Retail PriceIndex (RPI) would rise between 9. 5 and 10 per cent, acceleratingtowards the end of the year;  that the growth of Gross DomesticProduct (GDP) would be in the range 2. 5 to 3 per cent;  and thatwithout offsetting action the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) would be between  9 and  10 billion.    He was stillworking on the Treasury short-term forecast.    It wasparticularly difficult this year.    But, on the assumption that therewould be automatic indexation of personal tax allowances, and anearnings outturn of about 13 per cent,    a PSBR of about 10 billion, seemed to be indicated.    This could prove toooptimistic, particularly if big concessions had to be made on thestaging of comparability payments.    But if this forecast wasbroadly correct, it would in his view be necessary to reduce thePSBR by about  1. 5 billion.    Decisions which the Cabinet hadalready taken on the maintenance of cash limits and onnationalised industry prices would reduce this by about 0. 5 million compared with the forecast.    It would be importantto maintain those decisions.    The remaining  1 billion could beregarded as offsetting the effect of indexation of personal taxallowances.    The Budget he would propose was therefore not, inany sense, a deflationary one.    But it would require difficultdecisions.    Part of the burden of adjustment would have to fallon public expenditure, perhaps largely through a reduction in thesize of the planned Contingency Reserve   for 1979-80. Thiswould involve forgoing  some claims which had already been putforward tentatively.    One further possibility would be to reducethe United Kingdom contribution to the EEC, but it would be verydifficult to achieve much here in the relevant time scale. The1SECRET
SECRETbalance v/ould have to be found from increases in indirecttaxation.    Last year&apos;s Budget had not increased the specificduties on petrol, tobacco or alcoholic drinks.    There was a stronghealth case for increasing the last two, and a good energyconservation case for increasing the duty on petrol. Returningthese to 1978 values would yield  500 million, at a cost of 0. 6 onthe RPI.    There were of course political difficulties about all ofthese, especially perhaps on beer.    On VAT, the easiest coursewould be to harmonise both rates at 10 per cent, since bothConservative and Liberal Parties had already proposed this and itwould be difficult for them to vote against it.     This would produceabout  610 million.    There was a good social case for increasingthe upper rate to 15 per cent, yielding a further  100 million, withan increase of 1 per cent on the RPI.    The other main alternativewas a further increase in the National Insurance surcharge (NIS)but this could not be effective before August.    It was slow toaffect the RPI.    But it would damage business liquidity when thiswas expected already to be under pressure.    There was thus a widerange of options, and it should not be too difficult to reduce thePSBR to the levels he had in mind.    Indeed, some of the increaseshe had listed could be used to provide additional funding to allowreductions in some direct taxes in the Budget, for example bywidening the lower-rate bands, or by restructuring VAT,In discussion, it was suggested that there was considerabledisparity between the main independent forecasts of the courseof the economy in the next 12 months.    There were still somevery worrying features.    The continued rise of Japanese andGerman surpluses, and the latest increases in oil prices, impliedthe danger of a return to world recession.    The overall picturefor the United Kingdom economy was nevertheless less depressingthan might have been expected a month or two earlier. Theeconomy might be moving into calmer waters.    But it would beimportant not to arouse expectations of a good Budget. Suchexpectations might be disappointed, and might also damage theprospects for a series of satisfactory pay settlements in theremainder of the pay round.   While a massively deflationaryBudget would not be appropriate, particularly given the prospectof further world recession, there was no scope for majorexpansion.    Indeed, although most economists expected unemploy-ment to rise, there were some small signs that the worst might beover.    These would be strengthened by the decision that morningto reduce Minimum Lending Rate (MLR) by 1 per cent, thuslargely removing the risk of an increase in mortgage rates,helping to keep down industrial costs, and increasing the level ofactivity slightly.2SECRET
SECRETIn further discussion, it was argued that the Government hadbecome unnecessarily committed to a target for the PSBR, asit had done in previous years, on similar monetary targets likeDomestic Credit Expansion (DCE).    The PSBR was the hardestof the monetary aggregates to forecast, and the most volatile.The figure of  8.5 billion had been published in the AutumnIndustry Act forecast and had acquired a spurious significance.The forecast in the more recent Public Expenditure White Paper,if updated for inflation, implied a ratiier higher figure. Butmarkets generally had been conditioned to expect a  8. 5 billiontarget, and anything higher might be damaging to confidence.While sterling remained strong at present, and indeed wasarguably too high for continued competitiveness, the Governmentcould not hope to control a decline once one began.    It wastherefore important to maintain the confidence of financial markets.This meant sticking to the  8. 5 billion PSBR target.It was also argued that the bulk of the adjustments necessary toachieve this target would have to lall on indirect taxation.Income  ta-x was now very unpopular and bore heavily on verylarge numbers of comparatively low-paid people.    While the LabourParty was publicly regarded as a party of high taxation and high publiexpenditure it would be wrong to over-emphasise this theme thisyear.    Indeed, the more that could be done to reduce the impactof direct taxation, the better.    It might also be desirable to domore about the taxation of wealth.    Publicity for recent verylarge inheritances had underlined the general sense ofunfairness about the present distribution of wealth in the country.However, it was also argued that the Government should emphasisecreation of wealth rather than its taxation, and that the sco^e forfurther action on wealth taxes was limited at present.In continued discussion there was support for the view that ageneral move towards indirect taxes would be widely welcomed,despite the possible impact on the RPI,    Indeed, if a return todouble-figure inflation was now inevitable, it would be wrong toresist comparatively small additions in indirect taxation, simplybecause of their RPI impact, so long as the Government couldavoid the impression of a return to very high annual rates ofinflation.    In the short-term the RPI effects of changes in VATmight be to some extent offset by the continued strength of sterling.VAT was in any case a good tax to increase.    It did not, in general,fall on necessities.    Increases worked through very quickly. Aunified 10 per cent rate would be generally welcome. Someincrease in specific taxes would also be justified.    The goodsstill subject to these duties were still cheaper in real terms thantwo years before.    The top priority for increased taxation wasundoubtedly cigarettes.    This could be regarded as a form of healthtax.    More care was needed with increases in duties on alcohol.There was still a strong emotional objection to a further penny on3SECRET
SECRETthe pint of beer.    And despite the strong energy conservationcase foi an increase in petrol, it should be remembered mat petroj.costs at the pump were rising already, and that the effect on thesmall motorist, particularly in rural areas, would be considerable.Such an increase would be difficult to get through the House ofCommons.    By comparison, increases in the NIS were notgenerally perceived by ths typical taxpayer.    The effect on theRPI was slow to work through.   But it would be a mistake topenalise the United Kingdom manufacturer at a time when his costswere rising because of continued wage inflation.    He needed to beleft in a position where he could expand again when marketconditions permitted.    There were also serious administrativeproblems about a change in NIS during the financial year.In further discussion, it was also argued that there might bescope for some modest concessions in the Budget, despite the needto keep the Finance Bill as short as possible and to avoid the scopefor damaging amendment.    The top priority might be to reducethe numbers of people affected by direct taxes.    Other possiblecandidates would include reductions in the coverage of VAT, forexample by exempting clothing or soft drinks.    There might beroom for some modest support for industrial innovation,particularly that undertaken by small firms.    Stamp duty on housepurchases at a time of rapidly-rising house prices was anothercandidate, although the numbers affected were comparatively small.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatCabinet welcomed this opportunity to share in the thinking going into the Chancellors Budget.    This procedure was a considerableimprovement on the old pattern, under which the Budget ha 1 beenprepared in conditions of strict secrecy.    It was however essentialthat Ministers should avoid giving the public impression that thiswould be a &quot;good&quot; Budget.    Indeed Ministers should remember thatthe somewhat better than anticipated prospects outlined by theChancellor crucially depended on the decision taken at theirprevious meeting about cash limits.    This might give rise tothe need for more difficult decisions than some Ministers realised.Any further suggestions concerning the content of the Budget and theFinance Bill should be sent to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asquickly as possible.    The Chancellor would then formulate hisfinal proposals, and outline them to the Cabinet at the appropriatetime.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other Ministersconcerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office2 March 1979SECRET
