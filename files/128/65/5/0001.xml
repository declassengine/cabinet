SECRETousice:H&amp;Jons,The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister (CP(79) 6)suggesting the main points to be covered in their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and a number of other Ministers hadmet the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) theprevious day.    He had emphasised to them the seriousness and urgencyof the situation and the need for an early agreement.    The TUC werenot prepared to promise more than they could deliver, and could notnegotiate a new pay norm.    But they had set out the framework for apossible new agreement, covering six items.    Further meetings withthe negotiating Ministers had been arranged, leading to another talk withthe General Council the following week.    The objective was to reach anagreement on the means of controlling inflation without moving too faraway from the present pay policy, without any promise of a new norm,but with assurances about union conduct of negotiations to ensure aperiod of industrial calm, and a plan for reducing inflation to 5 per centby the spring  of 1982.    There had been no discussion of individualnegotiations.In discussion it was first suggested that the time had come for a majornew intitiative by the Government.    A &quot;case by case&quot; approach was nolonger feasible, and would simply lead to a series of excessive settle-ments, each higher than the last.    One alternative would be to issue anew White Paper, concentrating primarily on the remainder of thepresent pay round.    This would restate the Governments priorities andpolicies as set out in the August Whifcs Paper &quot;Continuing the Battleagainst Inflation&quot;.    It would set out a new norm, somewhat higher thanthe original 5 per cent, and embody the recently announced &quot;under-pinning&quot; for the low-paid, and the proposed public sector comparabilityarrangements.    It could also restore the possibility of discretionaryaction against individual private sector companies which breached theguidelines.    A White Paper of this kind could be put to the Horace ofCommons for a confirmatory vote:  if that failed, it would be a goodbasis for an appeal to the country.    An alternative to this course wouldbe to impose an early statutory prices and wages freeze.    Such a policyhad succeeded in the past.    But this time it would be necessary to paymore attention to the re-entry problem, and to ensure a permanentstatutory backing for a structured incomes policy once the freeze ended.In further discussion it was suggested that these approaches might not berealistic in the short term.    There were a number of groups for whompay settlements must be sought in the next week or two.    It might bebetter to tackle these case by case and concentrate on proposals for apermanent long-term incomes policy which could be put to the countryin an Election.    This should include discretionary action against theprivate sector where necessary, reinforced if possible by tax measures.It might also include proviuion for a national consensus on the long-terminflation target and on the amount available for wages increases. It1SECRET
SECRETwould be best if both sides of industry could agree upon the allocation ofthis amount, but failing that, there might be provision for a RelativitiesBoard to deal with anomalies.    This approach should include provisionfor synchronisation of pay settlements if possible.    As a modification ofthis policy, it was suggested that the appeal to the country should take theform of a referendum, in order to distinguish the question of an incomespolicy from all the other issues which would arise in a General Election.There was a good chance of overwhelming national support for astructured policy of this kind.    A referendum would give the Governmentthe moral authority to impose such a policy, whatever the views of theTUC.Against these proposals for a new initiative, it was argued that unilateralaction by Government was not credible while talks with the TUC werecontinuing.    In particular, any mention of the statutory freeze wouldforfeit all chance of TUC co-operation.    Any short-term initiatives ofthis kind would involve the creation of a new norm, which would be seenas a retreat by the Government.    In exchange for this, the unions wouldhave nothing to offer.    A new norm would simply become a floor onwhich other groups, such as the power industries, would base newclaims.    The Government had already modified its pay policy within thelast two weeks, and it would be quite wrong to make a further change atthis late stage.    Nor would a policy of this kind be a sensible basis onwhich to go to the country.    In further discussion it was also argued thatthere was no chance that the trade union members of the NationalExecutive Committee of the Labour Party would endorse a Manifestowhich embodied any kind of statutory policy.In further discussion it was generally recognised that there was no chanceof a fresh deal with the TUC which would embody any new norm. Otherconsiderations apart, the Transport and General Workers Union would notbe prepared to recall its national delegate conference, and without theirsupport there would be insufficient votes in the TUC to carry a new policy.It migt however be practicable to negotiate an understanding with the TUCwhich would prevent &quot;leapfrogging&quot;, and this seems the most fruitful lineof advance.    Meanwhile, there was no alternative to the &quot;case by case&quot;approach, although in considering each offer, Ministers would have to beconscious of the implications for other claims, especially in other partsof the public sector.    The Cabinet could take no comfort from the factthat a settlement now seemed imminent in the road haulage dispute.Although this removed an immediate cause of pressure, it might bethought to establish a new &quot;going rate&quot; of something like 18 per cent inthe private sector.    All public sector unions would aim at this level infuture.     The most difficult immediate problem would arise in the waterindustry where an offer of 14 per cent had just been rejected. Therewas now no chance of securing a settlement in the Health Service or theambulance service below 10 per cent, as had been hoped a week ago. Asettlement at that level would however require massive cuts in the HealthService expenditure, or an increase in Health Service charges, if cash2SECRET
SECRETlimits were to be maintained.    It was equally important to reach anearly settlement in the local authority and water cases. Thesepresented similar problems over cash limits and rate increases. TheGovernment^ offer of 8.8 per cent, together with special treatment forthe low-paid and future comparability studies, was a reasonable one, onwhich public support could be expected, despite the general publicsympathy for the position of the very low paid.    The opposition of thelocal authority employers to comparability studies was however acomplicating factor.    It might still be possible to secure an overalloutturn in the public sector within single figures, provided that the TUCendorsed the principle of &quot;no leapfrogging&quot;.    But if this failed, or privatesector pay settlements continued to escalate, there would be no short-term alternative to stringent budgetary measures.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that the Cabinet would resumeits discussion on Thursday 1 February.    Meanwhile, urgent decisionswere needed on the conduct of the local authority manual workersnegotiations and those for the associated National Health Service andambulance grades.    It was important to avoid any impression of break-down in these talks.    He had accordingly spoken to Mr David Basnett,General Secretary of the General and Municipal Workers Union, andasked him to take the line in public that talks were continuing.    But ifthe negotiations that morning had failed to make any progress on thepresent offer, his own view was that the Government might have to takethe question of comparability out of the hands of the employers and makeits own arrangements.    He would himself also be prepared to make afurther limited concession on the low-paid, in order to secure an earlysettlement, provided it could be prevented from working through to thebetter-paid manual workers or to the grades represented by the Nationaland Local Government Officers Association.    The Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) shouldconsider the handling of these negotiations and approve any necessaryaction.    They should also consider the related question of pay in thewater industry, on which a final decision could be left until the Cabinet&apos;sresumed discussion on 1 February.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office30 January 19793SECRET
