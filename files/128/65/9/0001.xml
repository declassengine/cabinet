CONFIDENTIALrial 1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as Minister for the Civilin Service, he intended to make a statement in the House of Commonsil that afternoon about the strike action planned by the Civil and Publice Services Association and the Society of Civil and Public Servants forthe following day.    He would point out that the unions concerned hadtaken this decision in spite of the assurances that the Governmentwould implement a pay settlement based on the evaluation of evidencefrom the Pay Research Unit, and that the staging of the increaseswould be the subject of negotiation.    He would make clear that this,and the campaign of continuing disruption which was also threatened,were against the long-term interests of the Civil Service andcontrary to the agreement recently entered into by the Trades UnionCongress.    He would appeal to the two unions to show a propersense of leadership and responsibility and call off their strike, evenat this late sta-je.The Cabinet -Took note.MENTARY   2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thes House of Commons during the week following the Winter Adjournment.sian 3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that following the defeat in theons House of Lords of the Governmenfs Resolution to establish theSpecial Commission on oil sanctions he had convened the MinisterialInquiry        Group on a Further Inquiry into Rhodesian Oil Sanctions (GEN 151)under his chairmanship to consider the situation.    The view of thes Group was marginally in favour of proceeding by way of a Specialce&apos; Commission drawn from the House of Commons alone but he had&apos;st asked the Lord Chancellor to bring the issue to the Cabinet fors. decision.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that his memorandum (CP(79) 15) setout the options which now appeared to be available to the Governmentand the considerations which bore on them.    The view of GEN 151 wasthat the only practical options were to do nothing or to proceed by wayof an inquiry established by the House of Commons.    In the lattercase a Lord of Appeal could not be used as Chairman and there mightbe difficulty in finding a suitable backbencher to act as an impartialChairman and to conduct the sift of Cabinet papers.    It wouldmoreover be virtually impossible to differentiate a SpecialCommission established in this way from a normal Select Committee1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof the House, with the problems of precedent this entailed for thedisclosure of Cabinet and Departmental papers to Select Committees.The majority of the Ministerial Group had nevertheless felt that anattempt should be made to see whether a Commons-only SpecialCommission could be secured with precisely the same safeguardsas those envisaged for the abortive proposal for a Special Commissiondrawn from both Houses.    This would involve finding a suitablePrivy Counsellor, not associated Ministerially with the events, to actas Chairman and would require the co-operation, of the Opposition innominating members for the Commission, and of Mr Heath inproducing the Cabinet papers of the relevant ConservativeAdmini stration.In discussion it was argued that public and Parliamentary interestin the Rhodesian sanctions issue had greatly diminished and that thischange, coupled with the greater dangers for Cabinet documentsimplied by a Commons-only Special Commission, and the attitude ofthe House of Lords, would justify a Government decision to take nofurther action in the matter.    Against this it was argued that politicalinterest in the subject was latent and would be revived if theGovernment were to announce that they intended to drop the proposedinquiry.    The difficulties would be reinforced if it appeared, as itwould, that the Government1 s course was being determined by theactions of the House of Lords.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet believed that the Government should make onefurther attempt to institute an inquiry into Rhodesian sanctions,provided that the safeguards, including those for Cabinet and otherGovernment documents, on which they had earlier agreed could bemaintained.    They were also agreed that the necessary preliminarysteps before a final decision could be taken to introduce a newResolution on these matters into the House of Commons were thoseidentified in paragraph 5 of CP(79) 15.    It would also be important toensure that attendance at the relevant meeting of the ParliamentaryLabour Party was representative of opinion in the Party as a whole.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe most important consequence of the change of government in Iranwas likely to be the eventual effect on the whole of the Middle Eastproblem.    Because of its internal preoccupations the newGovernment1 s influence in the Middle East would probably be weakfor the next six months, but in due course he expected them to tiltthe balance.    It was of great significance that Ayatollah Khomeini&apos;sfirst visitor in Tehran was Yassar Arafat, the leader of the PalestineLiberation Organisation (PLO).    If the Iranian Government allowedthe PLO access to the sophisticated military equipment it had inheritedfrom the Shah&apos;s Government, the implications would be very serious.His talks With the Governments of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrainduring the recent visit of Her Majesty The Queen to those countrieshad shown that although they were alive to the new significance of thepresence of their Shi&apos;ite Moslem minorities, they did not feel that theywere at any immediate risk of being toppled.    Their primary concernat present was their difficulty in maintaining a moderate stance onthe Middle East problem.    The Saudis in particular were worried thatEgypt would get into an even more exposed position during the currentCamp David talks and that she would isolate herself completely fromthe moderate Arab states.    Because of its too overtly military naturethe recent visit by the United States Defense Secretary, Mr Brown, toEgypt and Israel had not been helpful in this respect.    The Americanswould have to make a very difficult judgment on whether it was worthgoing ahead and concluding an agreement on Sinai between Israel andEgypt, and much would depend on how far the United States wereprepared to sustain President Sadat of Egypt.    He had also discussedthe oil problem during his visit to the Gulf.    He had not been able todetect any sign of Saudi determination to resist an increase in oilprices, although he had emphasised to them that although we were nowan oil producer, we were resolutely against a price increase. Hethought that the Saudis were likely to increase production a little, butthey were not prepared to go very far because they were worried lestan increase should fuel their own internal inflation and lest theyshould deplete their reserves too rapidly.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was argued that the present oil problem was of adifferent character from that of 1973: it was likely that on thisoccasion two million barrels a day would be permanently lost.American pressure on Saudi Arabia to increase their production tooffset the loss of Iranian oil was likely to be less effective thanhitherto because of the Saudis1 concern about their depletion policy.The International Energy Agency (IEA) would be meeting the followingweek to consider how to respond to the effects of the Iranian situationon the world supply of oil.    By burning 5 million tons of coal a yearmore than now and by taking a number of other measures the UnitedKingdom might be able to reduce expected oil demand by 4 per cent.We could not rule out, however, the possibility that we might have tointroduce an energy emergency.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee (DOP) had commissioned theprevious day an urgent study by officials of the wider political,strategic and economic consequences of the Iranian situation and theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy would be consideringthe following day a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Energyabout the short-term impact on world oil supplies.    At an appropriatepoint we should need to co-ordinate our position with the United Statesand with our partners in the European Economic Community. Theresults of the study commissioned by DOP would be reported to theCabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.amOUS&apos;ence:9) 7thfusions,la 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatChinese forces had penetrated as far as 17 miles inside Vietnameseterritory and there were no signs that they were withdrawing. Themost worrying feature of the present situation was that there werereports that Mongolian forces were building up on their border withChina.    The Mongolian army, which had Russian officers, numberedabout 28, 000 men and had 150 tanks.    Mongolia had a long-standingborder dispute with China which it might seek to exploit in the presentsituation.    This would provide the Soviet Union with a means of puttingpressure on China without becoming directly involved themselves.In the meantime efforts were being made in the United Nations, whichwe were supporting, to obtain a Security Council Resolution which wouldcall upon the Vietnamese to withdraw from Cambodia and the Chinesefrom Vietnam, but the non-aligned countries were showing noenthusiasm for such a Resolution.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he had decided earlier in the week,in the light of the Chinese invasion of Vietnam over the weekend, thatthe Secretary of State for Industry should not enter into or endorseany firm agreements on the Harrier aircraft during his current visitto China and that similarly he should go slow on the supply of anyother military equipment which the Chinese might raise with him.The Cabinet -2. Took note.H 6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofCASTING State for the Home D3partment (CP(79) 11) proposing a supplementalRATION Royal Charter for the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) toCHARTER raise their borrowing limit and to extend the main Charter.THE HOME SECRETARY said that a supplemental Royal Charterfor the BBC was urgently required to raise their borrowing limitfrom  30 million to  100 million.    He proposed that the samesupplemental Charter should extend the main Charter, whichexpired on 31 July 1979i to 31 December 1981.    This was the dateon which the existing legislation governing the IndependentBroadcasting Authority (IBA) expired;  and it would allow time,after the enactment of the major Broadcasting Bill, for all thenecessary subordinate legislation and other consequential work tobe completed.    The supplemental Charter would not give effect tothe Government1 s proposals, as set out in the White Paper onBroadcasting, for the creation of Service Management Boards (SMBs).These proposals had been widely criticised and it was unlikely thatthey could be carried in the present Parliament.    They would haveto wait until after the main legislation.    Meanwhile the BBC hadintroduced internal changes to their management structure, asdescribed in the Annex to his memorandum.In discussion it was argued that the extension of the BBCs mainCharter on its present basis would be seen as an abandonment ofthe Government&apos;s proposals for SMBs in the face of the BBCscampaign against them.    Since the proposals were a matter forimplementation by Royal Charter, it was not clear why they neededto await the enactment of the main legislation.    It would in any eventbe wrong, in announcing an intention to apply for a single supplementalCharter, to say anything which would prejudice the Government&apos;sview on the restructuring proposals.    On the other hand, it wasargued that it would be a mistake to pick out one of the Government&apos;sproposals on broadcasting for implementation in advance of the rest,5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmore particularly since it was a proposal which would be stronglyopposed in the House of Commons and for which a majority wasunlikely to be found.    It was suggested however that the extensionof the main Charter to 31 December 1981 allowed an unnecessarily longperiod before the proposal could be implemented.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that in theabsence of a Parliamentary majority for the Governmenfs proposalsfor SMBs, the Cabinet agreed with the proposal for a singlesupplemental Charter which would both increase the BBCs borrowinglimit and extend the main Charter.    But the main Charter should beextended to 31 July 1981 and not December 1981.    In presenting thedecision no appearance whatever should be given of the Governmenthaving departed from the White Paper proposals for restructuringthe BBC.    The Government could proceed with these at a later date,with any modifications which might seem desirable.    The fact thatthe agreed terminal date for the BBCs main Charter would be6 months earlier than that of the existing legislation for the IBAwould be an indication that the Government had not succumbed to theBBCs campaign against the restructuring proposals.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 ssumming up of their discussion and invited theHome Secretary to be guided accordingly.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that, in accordance with the decision of the Ministerial Committeeon Community Fisheries Questions, he had sought at the 19 FebruaryFisheries Council to get the Commission to stay their infractionproceedings against our conservation measures in exchange for liftingthe United Kingdom reserve on the European Economic Community(EEC)/Canada agreement.    The Commission had declined to take thisoffer up.    But in subsequent discussion with the Germans, who wereanxious that the agreement should be implemented, they had agreed thatthe United Kingdom should have access to an increased cod quota atthe North of Norway in exchange for fish of less value.    In view of thissatisfactory outcome he had lifted the United Kingdom reserve on theEEC/Canada agreement.The Cabinet -Took note.7CONFIDENTIAL
SECRET8.        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury (CP(79) 13) and a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(79) 14), both about cash limits forthe financial year 1979-80.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Cabinet hadagreed in the previous week that the aggregate limits set for thePublic Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) should not be exceededand that the implications of this for cash limits had to be accepted.They had also agreed that the exact way in which cash limits shouldbe set and adhered to required further consideration and had askedhim to reconsider the nature and timing of any announcement aboutthe implications of their decisions for cash limits.    It was impossibleto forecast the outturn of the PSBR for the forthcoming financial yearat this early stage.    But it was most unlikely to fall below the 8. 5 billion contained in the published forecast and could well behigher.    There was therefore a strong possibility that tax increasesand/or further public expenditure cuts would be needed in the Budgetto bring the borrowing requirement down to this level.    He did notwish to modify the proposals he had put forward to the Cabinet inthe previous discussion about non-pay expenditure, about localauthorities or about nationalised industries.    For pay items ofexpenditure, he had listed in paragraph 7 of his paper six options,in an attempt to meet the Cabinet&apos;s wishes for more flexibility and aclearer relationship between the size of pay settlements and theextent of reductions in expenditure.    Of these, the only one he couldrecommend to the Cabinet (option f.) involved an undertaking tcexamine each case on its merits, taken with an indication that theminimum cut would be 2 per cent and might have to be higher. Herecognised that exceptions would have to be made to the proposedtreatment of pay items for the armed forces, health service staff indirect support of patients and the prison service other thanadministrative staff.    Decisions could no longer be deferred, bothbecause of the need to avoid any damage to market confidence, andbecause of the operational need for instructions to programmemanagers.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that inhis paper, he argued the case for postponement of the decisions untilthe Cabinet could see the shape of the whole Budget,    He did notdispute the decision to hold the PSBR at approximately  8. 5 billionfor 1979-80.    But this implied a deflationary package of some size.Given the decision to introduce an early Budget, and the success ofthe Government&apos;s recent funding operations, he did not believe thatthere would be any serious threat to confidence involved in anypostponement of a decision on how to achieve this result.    If it werenecessary to make an early statement, it should be confined to areaffirmation of the PSBR limit, to an indication that the Government8SECRET
SECRETwas prepared if necessary to adjust individual cash limits within thepublished overall total of public expenditure and to an indication thatthe Government would propose appropriate fiscal adjustments in theBudget.    Cash limits published before the Budget should be based onexisting policy and pay guidelines.    The Cabinet would then have tomake its choice between expenditure cuts and tax increases before theBudget and in the light of fuller information on the economic outlook.In discussion it was first stated that, despite the Cabinefs emphasis onthe need for secrecy at their previous meeting, Press stories hadappeared in the past two days which were known to have come fromsources close to Ministers.    These irresponsible disclosures hadrestricted the Cabinefs freedom of manoeuvre, and it was no longerfeasible to postpone a decision.    An early statement was necessary, tofollow as soon as possible after the announcement of the local authoritymanual workers pay settlement, in order to reassure the market.Detailed cash limits would in any case have to be set when the estimateswere published, no later than Budget Day.    It was unsatisfactory thatmarket pressures should force Ministers into premature decisions ofthis kind.    But this was an inevitable consequence of the present scaleof the Governmenfs borrowing operations.In further discussion it was argued that the PSBR was likely to be wellover the published forecast, and that fiscal adjustments of as much as 2. 5-  3 billion might be needed.    Cash limits obviously had a part toplay in finding sums on this scale.    But it might not be necessary to beso specific at this stage.    It could be sufficient to announce theGovernmenfs intention to maintain the PSBR forecast level, and toadjust cash limits accordingly.    An alternative would be to freeze say 1 billion out of Departmental programmes, and add this sum tempor-arily to the Contingency Reserve, releasing it only when it was clearthat pay settlements for those programmes could be absorbed withincash limits.    But to be convincing this policy would require clearlyidentified items to be frozen.    These would be as difficult to find as thealternatives of more specific public expenditure cuts.    Although therewere many arguments for exempting particular parts of publicexpenditure from the full rigour of the proposed cash limits regime,specially in the National Health Service,   the defence budget and thecourts service, the policy would only succeed if it were applieduniformly.    It seemed unlikely that any Minister would voluntarily offerreductions in his own programme in order to avoid the need for cuts inanother one.In further discussion it was argued that it was unnecessary to specifyprecisely the kind of price increases or other action which might beneeded in the nationalised industries.    It would be sufficient for anyGovernment statement to make it clear that nationalised industryborrowing would not be allowed to rise beyond the level included in the9SECRET
SECRETPublic Expenditure White Paper.    It was also argued that the modifiedformula proposed for dealing with &quot;pay&quot; items of expenditure was stillunsatisfactory.    It gave negotiating Ministers a relatively weak hand toplay in pay bargaining.    Yet anything more specific might, at least insome areas, be impossible to enforce, with corresponding damage tocredibility of policy.    A formula on the lines that &quot;a substantialproportion&quot; of any pay settlement above the guidelines would have to beoffset might be more effective.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that there should be an early statement about theGovernment&apos;s intentions, although shorter than that proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury.    It should be confined to an announcementthat the Government would limit   the PSBR to around  8. 5 billion; thatcash limits for non-pay items would be set on the basis that the inflationassumption of the Industry Act forecast would be maintained so thatDepartments would have to absorb any increases in prices which wentbeyond that level without any adjustment to their cash limits;  that forpay items, it was recognised that there might have to be some adjust -ment; but that a substantial proportion of any excess over the levels ofpay assumed in the White Paper must be absorbed within Departmentalprogrammer.    The statement should not list any exceptions to the policy.Although no specific reduction in staff costs would be mentioned in thestatement the Civil Service Department and other Departments shouldassume for internal planning purposes that cuts of at least 2 per cent intotal wage bills would be required.    As to nationalised industries, thestatement should be confined to an announcement that they would not beallowed to increase their aggregate borrowing beyond that provided forin the Public Expenditure White Paper.    The Chief Secretary, Ireasury,should make an announcement on these lines by way of Written Answerthe following day.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.SECRET10
CONFIDENTIAL9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofyMENT        State for Employment (CP(79) 12) about outstanding issues on thej S proposed package of special employment measures for 1979-80.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theCabinefs decision at its previous meeting had committed  161 millionof the  200 million allocated to special employment measures in the8th public expenditure survey for 1979-80, leaving  39 million for anyions, further expansions.    The Ministerial Group on Unemployment amongstJ Young People (GEN 27) had proposed expansions both in the JobRelease Scheme (JRS) and the Small Firms Employment Subsidy (SFES)but this had been on the assumption that up to  230 million could be madeavailable for the package as a whole.    If the total cost of the packagewere to be restricted to  200 million, he proposed that the  39 millionso far uncommitted should be devoted wholly to expanding the JRS. Heproposed that the age of eligibility for JRS should be reduced to 62 formen (60 for disabled men) and kept at 59 for women.    This would cost 40 million over and above the costs of running the scheme as atpresent applied to women aged 59 and men aged 64, and would increasethe tctal register effect of JRS to 66, 000 by March 1980.    To expandJRS in this way would mean that the proposals on SFES which had beenconsidered oy GEN 27, to uprate the amount of the subsidy from 20 per week to  25, and to extend its scope to non-manufacturingindustry in Intermediate Areas, could not be adopted.    JRS washowever clearly more effective than SFES in its register effect; theproposed extension of JRS would raise the impact of the scheme on theunemployment register by 42, 000, and to achieve the same effect usingSFES would be far more costly.    JRS was the only one of the specialemployment measures which acted directly on the labour supply. Toincrease the scope of the scheme in the way proposed would have animmediate effect on the unemployment register.    Moreover, JRSwould not be open to any objections from the European EconomicCommunity (EEC).    His proposal to make the scheme available todisabled men at age 60 would be attractive to the Trades Union Congressand to the Parliamentary Labour Party disablement group.    SFES onthe other hand would require a longer build-up period before itachieved its full register effect, and the EEC Commission might raisedifficulties if it were proposed to introduce it at the same time as thenew restructuring scheme which Cabinet had already agreed. Toextend SFES to non-manufacturing firms in Intermediate Areas wouldtend to erode further the advantages which Development Areas had overIntermediate Areas.    If the Cabinet agreed that JRS should be madepayable for a period of two years or more, he hoped they would alsoagree that the allowance should remain free of tax.    To make theallowance taxable would reduce the impact of the scheme, by making itmore difficult for potential beneficiaries to compare their net pay atwork with what they would be likely to receive under the scheme. Taxwould have to be deducted at source, and this would mean setting up an11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALexpensive bureaucracy just for this purpose.    Other short-term benefitssuch as sickness benefit and unemployment benefit were not subject totax.    To keep an allowance payable for two years or more free of taxwould require legislation;  he appreciated that it might be undesirable toinclude the necessary provision in this year&apos;s Finance Bill, but analternative would be to introduce a short Bill, confined to this particularprovision and another provision which his legal advisers thought mightbe necessary in order to lower the age of eligibility fcr men but not forwomen.In discussion it was argued that the Cabinet should consider verycarefully whether it was right at this time to authorise the expenditureof an extra  40 million on special employment measures, in view of apossible need for expenditure cuts in future.    The package alreadyagreed, without any extension of JRS or SFES, would have a registereffect of 267, 000.    Against this, however, it was argued that the netcost of the proposed expansion of JRS might be as little as one third ofthe gross ccst, in view of the potential savings on social securitybenefits.     The formula on qualifying ages proposed by the Secretary ofState for Employment had the advantage of helping to prepare the waytowards the establishment of a common retirement age for men andwomen.In further discussion it was argued that, although on administrativegrounds it would be possible to keep the JRS allowance free of tax until1 April 1980 by the use of an extra-statutory concession by the InlandRevenue, it was right that after that date JRS should be taxed. Intheory short-term social security benefits ought to be taxed, and it wasonly administrative considerations which had prevented this.    But ifJRS were made available for more than two years before retirement, itwas in any case no longer analogous to a short-term social securitybenefit.    If an extended JRS remained free of tax, an obviouslyanomalous situation would arise when the recipient reached retirementage and became eligible for a retirement pension which would be subjectto tax.    Pressure would be likely to build up for making retirementpensions also free of tax.    Any loss of impact which might be caused bymaking the allowance taxable would be compensated for by the fact thatit was to be made available at a younger age.    In any case, it wasrecognised that if the allowance were made taxable its gross level wouldneed to be correspondingly increased.    The prospect of having tointroduce legislation in the present Parliament on a taxation matter ofthis kind, whether in the Finance Bill or separately, was not anattractive one.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that from 1 April 1979 JRS should be available to men atage 62, and women at age 59, with a further extension of the scheme todisabled men aged 60 or more.    The JRS allowance should be uprated12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfrom 1 April 1979 to  31. 50 for a single person and  40 for a marriedperson.    It should be kept free of tax in 1979-80, but would becometaxable from 1 April 1980.    In the longer term, the whole question oftaxation of social security benefits needed to be reviewed, and thequestion of whether or not the JRS allowance should be subject to taxcould be looked at again in that context.    The Cabinet also agreed thatSFES should not be extended to non-manufacturing firms in IntermediateAreas, and that the weekly rate of the subsidy should not be increased.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Employment to be guidedaccordingly.10.        The Cabinet had before them a letter dated 20 February 1979 fromthe Private Secretary to the Minister of State, Department of Industry,to Private Secretaries to all members of the Cabinet, to which wasattached a copy of a minute dated 19 February 1979 from the Minister ofState, Department of Industry, to the Prime Minister about a furtherapplication for Government assistance by Kirkby Manufacturing andEngineering Company Limited (KME).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Ministerial Committee onEconomic and Industrial Policy (El) had considered an application byKME for further Government assistance at their meeting on31 January 1979.    They had agreed by a majority that the assistancerequested should be refused.    But a number of Ministers had con-sidered that the matter should be referred to Cabinet and he hadaccepted this view.    He had that morning received a telegram fromKME, urging the Government to agree to the further assistance, so asto put the Co-operative on its feet on a permanent basis.THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY(MR WILLIAMS), said that the application which El had considered on31 January had involved Government grants and loans totalling some 4.7 million on a rescue project totalling some  6 million. Theproposals involved the purchase of the factory at  1. 5 million, theinstallation of a modern radiator plant at  2 million, a reduction inemployment to 513, the renegotiation of terms with the major creditors,a revision of KME&apos;s corporate structure through the introduction of atwo-board structure, one each for policy and for management, and theemployment of a Chief Executive and Commercial Director on second-ment from PA Management Consultants Limited, who had supported theapplication.    Since the El discussion, KME had come forward with13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthree revisions to this proposal.    The first involved a &quot;Company-Doctor&quot; prepared to inject  750, 000 and management skill, but talkswith him had since broken down.    Secondly, Mr Robert Maxwell hadexpressed interest in rescuing KME, but following an investigation ofKME by his accountants, Coopers and Lybrand, he was prepared to tryto rescue KME only if they went into receivership first.    The Directorsof KME had been prepared to follow this course provided that it would beguaranteed that only Mr Maxwell would be allowed to rescue them, butgiven the duties imposed on a receiver such a guarantee had not beenpossible.    The Directors had then asked the Government to consider anamended version of their original proposals.    The amendment consistedof dropping the proposal to buy the factory, so that the project cost wasreduced to  4. 5 million and the request for Government assistance to 3. 2 million.    On the other hand the Co-operative would need to payrent for the factory with adverse consequences for their cash flow. Therevised application proposed, as the original one had done, thatGovernment assistance should be paid by instalments subject to satis-factory progress.    He had consulted the Industrial Development AdvisoryBoard (IDAB) about both the original proposal and the amended version.They had unanimously recommended that the original proposal should berejected, because they did not believe there was a realistic prospect of Iviability.    Cn the revised proposal, IDAB&apos;s advice was once againoverwhelmingly against acceptance, on grounds of non-viability, thoughone member had taken the view that KME should be supported on moraland social grounds.    It was relevant that KME&apos;s present difficultieswere of their own making, since they had frustrated the takeover by theWorcester Engineering Company Limited which had been proposedtowards the end of last year and which had offered a reasonable prospectof viability.    The basic objection to the revised proposals as to theoriginal ones was that they were not viable.    IDAB had considered thereport by PA Management Consultants, but had considered that themarketing projections in that report were unrealistic, that the second-ment of a Director from PA did not provide a long-term solution toKME&apos;s management problems, and that the Co-operative&apos;s access totechnical expertise would be inadequate.    As to KME&apos;s claim that theGovernment assistance they were now seeking would provide apermanent solution to their problems, it was worth recalling that theyhad already been helped twice before on a supposedly once-for-all basis,and were still coming back for more.    The best hope for preservingsome employment at KME lay in receivership.    Three companies hadshown an interest in rescuing KME after receivership, one of them beingStelrad, which had been involved in rescue negotiations at an earlierstage.    However, this company might fall out of the running as one ofthe worker-directors of KME, Mr JackSpriggs, had agreed with theconvenors at Stelrad that they would call a strike if Stelrad put in a bidfor KME.    As to resource costs, if KME&apos;s revised proposals led -against expectations - to viability, the resource costs would be about thesame as they would be if KME collapsed now.    They would be greater if14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe KME proposals were accepted now but KME collapsed later, and lessif KME went into receivership now and achieved viability by that route.He recommended that the application for assistance should be rejected.Receivership was the best course and if the Government accepted thisapplication it was hard to see how it coi^ld refuse many other applicationsfor assistance which it at present turned down.In discussion it was argued that KME&apos;s application ought to be accepted.It was true that they had asked for assistance on a supposedly once-for-all basis in the past, but there were new factors now.    They hadachieved productivity improvements and had streamlined their productrange.    Also, PA Management Consultants were prepared to put theirreputation behind KME&apos;s proposals, and to lend them a Chief Executive.KME deserved credit for the efforts they had made.    It was notnecessarily surprising that they had not yet achieved viability. TheGovernment itself had frequently pointed to the difficulty of reversing ahundred years of industrial decline in a space as short as three years.In addition, IDAB&apos;s terms of reference required them to adopt a mainlycommercial approach in evaluating proposals.    But there were widerconsiderations in this case.    Merseyside had the worst Inner Cityproblems in the country, and suffered from a deep-rooted malaise whichwould take years to remove.    The extremely militant attitudes taken bystrikers in the recent road haulage and local government disputes wereone instance of this.    Private enterprise had closed down one factoryafter another on Merseyside and KME had become a symbol of the valueof public enterprise in maintaining employment there.    In symbolicterms, the money KME were now seeking could well be worth as much asthe whole  400 million which the Government had pumped intoMerseyside so far.    If the Government had the choice, it might prefer tocreate new jobs on Merseyside rather than to preserve those at KME,but it was fighting a defensive battle against unemployment and needed touse the resources to hand.    If the application were rejected it would bea major blow to Merseyside which would have severe political reper-cussions.On the other hand, it was argued that the time had come to call a halt.KME had failed in the past to make the improvements which hadaccompanied their requests for assistance.    Their present proposalwas considered unviable by IDAB, which included trade union members,and to reject IDAB&apos;s advice in this case would make a nonsense of theGovernment&apos;s industrial strategy.    It would also mean divertingGovernment assistance away from other applicants with better prospectsof viability.    The policy of backing winners was paying off as experiencein Cardiff showed and should be continued.    Nor did the politicalarguments all point the same way.    Radiator manufacturers elsewherewere being inhibited from expansion, and thus from providing new jobs,because they were being undercut by subsidised competition from KME.The Government had refused assistance to enterprises in other areas15CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhere there would now be great resentment if KME were given furtherhelp.    KME might be a hopeful symbol to a small number of people inMerseyside.    To the rest of the country it was a symbol of the beliefthat factories could be kept going even if they were not producing goodswhich people wanted at a price which they could afford.    KME andMeriden were giving a bad name to the concept of workers&apos;co-operatives.    Nor was it true to say in this case that public enterprisewas working where private enterprise had failed.    The KME proposalswould not lead to viability, whereas there was some hope of viabilitythrough a private enterprise takeover if KME went into receivership.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a majorityof the Cabinet were against providing further Government assistance toKME and considered that the best possibility for maintaining employmentat KME would be for it to go into receivership.    They therefore agreedthat KME&apos;s request for assistance should be refused.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion, and invited theMinister of State, Department of Industry, to beguided accordingly.Cabinet Office22 February 197916CONFIDENTIAL

RIME MINISTERKIRKBY MANUFACTURING AND ENGINEERING CO LTD  (KME) &apos;. . .fFollowing the breakdown of negotiations with WorcesterEngineering,  KME applied for Government  grants and loanstotalling some  4.7m on a rescue project totalling some 6 million to preserve 513 jobs at Kirkby.    That projectwas backed by PA Management Consultants.    The IndustrialDevelopment Advisory Board  (IDAB)   advised against  it andEl Committee wished to reject  it by a  substantial majority.However a number of members both for and against theapplication considered that the decision should be referredto Cabinet because of the political sensitivity of employ-ment in Merseyside and at KME in particular.2.     However KME then received two offers of help fromthe private sector.    The first  involved a   1 company doctor&apos;prepared to inject  750,000 and management  skill,  but thesetalks have since broken down.    Secondly Mr Robert Maxwellof Pergamon Press had discussions with KME.    He has now told
s in strict confidence that following accountants1investigations he is only prepared to try to rescue KMEfter receivership.    The Directors saw me and offered togo into Receivership if I could guarantee that only Maxwellwould be allowed to rescue them.    On advice from ourSolicitor I had %o point out that the duties imposed upona Receiver made it impossible to guarantee the outcome KMEwanted.    The Directors of KME considered this to be toouncertain at this stage and have therefore retreated fromthe Receivership route and asked for their original appli- .cation as amended to be considered.3. The amendment drops the factory purchase at  l.5m.The project  cost therefore becomes  4.5m and the assistancenow requested totaIs . 3 - 2m.    The  staggered phasing of thisassistance,  which would be paid providing KME1s performanceis as planned,  remains unaltered.4. My Department&apos;s recommendation remains that the appli-cation should be refused.    The new level of assistance isstill outside the usual guidelines.    Furthermore the need topay rent reduces KME1s forecast  cash flow to a levelincompatible with the high degree of risk involved.    We donot know whether the National Westminster Bank&apos;s attitudeof sympathetic consideration to  lending KME a further  lm
CONFIDENTIAL3Id be maintained if the security of the building was notiiable.    I have consulted IDAB and while one member tookview that KME should be supported on moral and socialunds, the Board as a whole advised that the project wast viable and did not meet the criteria for assistance.The normal course of action would be to put a paper onis revised application to El Committee.    In essentials,never,  it remains unchanged;  viability is the key criteriond IDAB have again advised against  it on precisely thatound.    I am concerned that we come to a  decision on thispplication as  soon as possible.    We have an obligation toiE&apos;s creditors to do so.     I would not want to  expose HMGoaccusations,  made with the benefit  of hindsight,   that weermitted KME to continue trading when the company did notave reasonable prospects of meeting its  debts.     I have justeceived a telex from KME reporting that  this morning&apos;sass meeting voted to press the Government to make an earlyecision and to give support to KME&apos;s application.As you will recall you agreed that Cabinet should con-sider KME.    In the circumstances a further paper to ElCommittee does not seem strictly necessary.    I would propose&quot;refore to prepare a paper for Cabinet and if it is at all
ossible it would be helpful for it to be taken on&apos;2 February.    If you consider that it has to be taken onMarch our view is that *KME would probably still be in ....xistence then although we cannot guarantee this.I am copying this to members of El and to Sir John HuntAN WILLIAMSFebruary 1979
