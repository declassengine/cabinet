CONFIDENTIALMENTARYsr&apos;ss into.11mTheReport1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there would be considerable publicfeeling about Mr Jeff Rooker&apos;s Private Member&apos;s Motion &quot;PuttingAnimals into Politics&quot;, which was down for debate on Friday 23 Marchand might occupy the whole day.    It was important that the Governmentspokesmen should be able to take a positive line in what might be awide-ranging debate covering not only the export of farm animals butalso vivisection and other controversial matters.    The Home Secretarywas consulting the Ministers concerned about new proposals, includingthe establishment of an Animal Welfare Council, which could beannounced in the course of the debate:  and arrangements for the debateshould be carefully co-ordinated between the Departments concerned,including the Home Office, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries andFood and the Department of the Environment.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that itwas his intention to publish the Report of the Committee of Inquiry intopolice interrogation procedures in Northern Ireland (the Bennett Report)on the following day and to make an oral statement at the beginning ofbusiness in the House of Commons.    His original plan had been topublish the Report on Friday 23 March so that discussion of it would notcomplicate the debate on the Order for the continuance of the Preventionof Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1976 on 21 March.     This planhad been overtaken by the interview with Dr Irwin which had beenbroadcast in &quot;Weekend World&quot; on the previous Sunday, and subsequentlyby a Private Notice Question in the House&apos; of Commons on 12 March andby the publication of a leak from his own minute of 9 March to the PrimeMinister in the previous day&apos;s &quot;Guardian&quot;.    These reports gave atotally unbalanced impression of the facts and the situation needed to bebrought quickly under control.    It was therefore important to publishthe Bennett Report as soon as possible in order to correct the recordand to secure a more balanced presentation of the facts.    For practicalreasons, including the need to provide advance copies of the Report tothe relevant authorities and interests in Northern Ireland, it wasimpossible to publish the Report until the following day;  he recognisedthe objections which would normally apply to a major statement on aFriday, but considered that the issues were too important for publicationto be postponed until after the weekend, especially as the following1CONFIDENTIAL

He was glad therefore to be able toous inform the Cabinet that a full investigation had shown that no officialience: had deliberately leaked the document but that it had almost certainlyI?) 10th been in a locked attache case which had been stolen among somelusions, valuable personal items in an ordinary burglary,te 4The Cabinet -3.       Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe conclusion of an Israeli/Egyptian agreement was a major developmentwhich would have important repercussions throughout the Middle East andmore widely.    We should support the agreement but do so with out eyesopen.    In the European Community considerable doubts were beingexpressed about the wisdom of President Carter&apos;s initiative.    Several ofour partners were reluctant to support it and certainly grave dangers layahead.    President Sadat of Egypt would remain in great peril over thenext year or so.    But there were still many imponderables. Forexample we did not know what line the Saudis would take, and whetherthey would be prepared to support the settlement privately even if theypublicly criticised it.    The Americans had consistently misread theSaudi e.ttitude and underestimated the toughness of their mood.    It nowseemed likely that the Arab countries opposed to the settlement wouldmake a firm declaration in which they would talk of boycotts and othermeasures.    Nor did we know how far the United States was prepared togo in support of President Sadat and in bringing pressure to bear onPrime Minister Begin of Israel.    The latter would be essential inconnection with the Israeli attitude over the West Bank.    Unless somemovement could be achieved in this area a very dangerous situationwould arise.    Unfortunately everyone had concentrated on the CampDavid process during the last two years and had tended to ignore thefact that during this period there had been an increase of 20 Israelisettlements on the West Bank.    These were formed on a religious basisand it would be hard to get them out.    But the Arabs would never acceptthat they should continue as heavily defended Israeli enclaves. TheAmericans would need tc exercise strong influence to get the talks goingand to secure some form of Palestinian representation at them.Prime Minister Begin had conceded more over Sinai than had beeaexpected but probably because he had very little room for manoeuvreever the West Bank.    The linkage of that issue with the bilateralagreement was very tenuous and its maintenance was likely to dependvery much on United States pressure.    As regards our own attitude weshould concentrate on supporting the bilateral agreement as a first stage.But we should emphasise that we saw it only as a move on the way to acomprehensive settlement which would require major and continuingefforts by all concerned.In discussion it was suggested that we should need to think carefully howbest to give support to President Carter.    The Gulf States and SaudiArabia were bitterly opposed to him and were likely actively to opposethe settlement.    President Giscard d&apos;Estaing of France was critical ofthe settlement and indeed hoped that it would fail, being particularlyconcerned about France&apos;s oil supplies.    Chancellor Schmidt was stillpreoccupied with what he saw as President Carter&apos;s weak leadership.Many Israelis were not interested in getting a settlement which they sawas being contrary to their interests:  and Prime Minister Begin waslikely to have a difficult time ahead over the negotiations on the WestBank.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the viewexpressed by some our European partners that President Carter wasweak and had mishandled the situation was a very dangerous one. Hehad staked a great deal on a major peace initiative.    He had received amessage from President Carter seeking support and we should give thisin a sophisticated way which took account of the delicate balance of ourinterests involved and the need to retain our influence with the GulfStates.    The Labour movement had a fundamental commitment to supportan independent Israel, and it had also supported the United Stateswherever possible.    At the same time, there was in the Partyconsiderable support for the Arab States with whom we maintained closeand friendly links.    There were many risks involved in this settlementand our efforts should be devoted to giving it every possible prospect ofsuccess and using our influence with other countries to gain themaximum possible support for it.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.The Cabinet were informed of the situation following the recent coup inGrenada.    Prime Minister Gairy had a number of qualities which didnot command sympathy.    Nevertheless he had been a democraticallyelected Prime Minister and Grenada was a member of the Common-wealth.    It was clearly not our policy to get involved in the internalaffairs of other members of the Commonwealth:  but had, for example,a similar situation occurred in Barbados we should have been faced witha very difficult position if ask^d by Prime Minister Adams for help.We should do everything possible to avoid becoming entangled inarguments over Grenada.    HMS Mohawk had been sent to Barbadianwaters as a gesture of reassurance to Barbados but there was nointention to intervene in Grenada.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE PRIME MINISTER said he had reported fully to Parliamenton the recent meeting of the European Council.    We needed now tofollow up the question of our net contribution to the Community budget,taking care not to be diverted into a too general discussion about theconvergence of economic policies.    Th3 Chancellor of the Exchequerwould raise the matter at the forthcoming meeting of the Council ofMinisters (Finance) and it would come back to the European Council inJune.    There was also follow-up work to be done by the Ministersresponsible for employment and social affairs.    At the EuropeanCouncil, he had been able to point to the conflict between theCommunity&apos;s rules of competition and the political necessity forGovernment action in support of industries facing severe economicdifficulties.    In private conversation with Mr Roy Jenkins, Presidentof the Commission, he had stressed the need for the Commission to actcautiously, for example in pressing for public commitments about thecontraction of the United Kingdom shipbuilding industry.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said there had beena useful informal meeting of Ministers of Employment prior to theEuropean Council.    Seme progress had been made in identifying areaswhere Member States could operate together and in meeting some ofthe criticisms of the European Trade Union Confederation. TheDirector General responsible for competition policy had raised last-minute objections to our proposed employment restructuring schemewhich he would have to discuss with Commissioner Vouel.    He would,if necessary, as suggested by the Prime Minister, also inform thePresident of the Commission.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE PRIME MINISTER said some clearer appreciation was nowpossible of Party reactions to the referenda results.    Members of theParliamentary Labour Party (PLP) opposed to devolution were notpressing for the repeal Orders to be quickly debated and the statementapproved by the Scottish Council of the Labour Party was helpful inreaffirming the commitment to devolution but in leaving to theGovernment how the issue might now be handled.    The Liberal Party,although ready to vote against the Government in any early vote ofconfidence, would be opposed to the repeal of the Scotland Act andwilling to join in Inter-Party talks on devolution before a vote wastaken on the repeal Orders.    Mr David Steel would be making thisclear in his speech to the Liberal Assembly at the weekend. TheScottish National Party (SNP) were seeking to demand that a vote shouldbe taken on the draft Order for the repeal of the Scotland Act by27 March and that the Government should commit themselves to the5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrejection of the Order.    The Conservative Party continued to insist thatboth Acts should be repealed before any inter-Party talks were con-templated.    Against this background, it seemed right to lay the draftOrders next week and at the same time to make a statement on theGovernments position.    This might be on the lines that as the debateon devolution had continued for over ten years and Parliamentsconsideration of the legislation to afford it had taken two years, aconclusion should not now be reached by a vote following a short debatewithout further reflection.    The Governments commitment to devolutionremained and a majority of the votes cast in the Scottish referendum hadbeen for the implementation of the Scotland Act.    The Governmentshould therefore propose inter-Party talks to explore whether therewere any modifications to the scheme of devolution proposed forScotland which might attract greater support or whether a consensusmight exist for other arrangements, for example changes in theprocedures of Parliament, whereby some measure of devolution mightbe afforded.    Such a proposal should not be seen as a stalling deviceand a time limit, possibly four weeks, might be suggested for the talksto reach a conclusion.    As for the forum which might be considered forthe talks, a Speakers Conference had the disadvantage that theConservative Party would press hard for the terms of reference toinclude a review of the number of Scottish and Welsh Members ofParliament and should therefore be avoided.    A Joint Select Committeeor a Select Committee of the Commons could be considered, but the bestforum would be a relatively small ad hoc inter-Party conference whichwould not exclude representation from the House of Lords at a PartySown wish.     The terms of reference which the Government mightultimately propose would need careful consideration.    It had to beexpected that the Conservative Party would not agree to participate, butthe Government would have an intellectually defensible position in thatthe Conservative Party had always argued that devolution to Scotlandshould be considered on an all-Party basis.    It would not be easy forthem to justify a rejection of inter-Party talks, particularly given thebalance of votes cast in the Scottish referendum.    If they sought toforce the issue to a vote on the repeal Order, they would have difficultyin drafting a Motion on devolution which would attract the support of theSNP;  if they provided a Supply day for the SNP, the resultant Motionwould be likely to be of a kind which the Conservative Party could notsupport.    The SNP could in the event be found divided on a proposalfor inter-Party talks.    The draft repeal Orders for Scotland and Waleswould have to be laid simultaneously, but the Wales Act should not berepealed quickly as this would drive Plaid Cymru into supporting theConservative Party.    Further consideration would be necessary on howthe question of devolution to Wales might be handled and whetheradministrative or other proposals could be devised.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion xt was suggested that although Plaid Cymru had becomemandated to support the SNP on devolution to Scotland, there wereindications that they might not prove as firmly committed as firstreports had suggested.    The Conservative Party would be in difficultiesin explaining a rejection of inter-Party talks and might be forced toprovide for a general vote of confidence in the week beginning 26 March.If the national Parties were then to support them, the Government1 ssurvival would depend on the Ulster Unionists and it was not possible toforecast their likely attitude.    On the other hand, the PL.P would beready to welcome a proposal for inter-Party talks and the maintenanceof unity within the Party was crucial.    For the present, a special Partymeeting was not necessary.    Such a proposal waa also likely to be wellreceived by the media.In further discussion it was suggested that the possibility of securingagreement to all-Party talks was not strong and even if a forum wereestablished, the likelihood of any useful consensus emerging onmodifications to the legislative scheme the Government had proposed forScotland was remote.    Nevertheless, this did not weigh against theattempt being made and it might be possible, if only through bilateralexchanges, to reach a consensus on some measure of devolution.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the draft repeal Orders should be laid in thefollowing week and he would arrange for this to become known that dayso that it did not appear that theGovernment were merely responding topressures in the House.    It was also agreed that a statement on the lineshe had suggested, proposing inter-Party talks, should be made when theOrders were laid.    He would arrange for a group of Ministers toconsider urgently the form the statement should take and the tacticsto be adopted.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (CP(79) 17) about open government and thehandling of Mr Clement Freud&apos;s Official Information Bill.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Government spokesmen had beenrequired to hold a very difficult position during the Committee Stage ofMr Freud&apos;s Bill and the situation would be even more difficult when theBill began its Report Stage on 6 April.    The Cabinet had agreed on18 January that the question of a statutory right of access was not one onwhich they could reach a decision in the present Parliament;  that the7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGovernment should therefore seek to prolong discussion of Mr Freud1 sBill;  and that on Second Reading they should make clear that althoughthey were in favour of improved access to a wider range of informationthey had not yat reached any view on the form of access, whetherstatutory or otherwise, or on the type of information to be covered.On this basis the Bill had been given an unopposed Second Reading.At Committee Stage the Government had put down a number of probingamendments on Part I, dealing with open government, but it hademerged from Committee in an unsatisfactory form, with littlesignificant alteration.    The situation on Part II, which dealt with thereform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, was better, and ifthe Bill made further progress these provisions could be brought intoline with the Government&apos;s own policy as set out in their White Paper.It had also been agreed that the Government should aim to publish aGreen Paper setting out the issues on open government, together withthe report of a study on relevant overseas experience;  the MinisterialGroup on Official Information (GEN 29) had given some preliminaryconsideration to the draft of a Green Paper which was attached to hismemorandum, and the report on overseas experience would be readywithin the next few days.    The Group were satisfied that the schemefor open government in Mr Freud&apos;s Bill was unacceptable, but they alsoconsidered that Parliament wculd not regard further developmentsbased on existing policy as a sufficient alternative.    The Group there-fore favoured a positive commitment to a Code of Practice on the linesof the proposals in the &quot;Justice&quot; Report, and a majority felt that thisshould be given legislative backing.    The feeling in the Labour Partyand in the House of Commons as a whole was such that the Governmentwould be in a weak position to block the proposals in Mr Freud&apos;s Billunless they could put forward an alternative scheme of this kind.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposals in Part Iof Mr Freud1 s Bill were unacceptable in their coverage, theirretrospective effect and the role which they would give to the courts.They went far beyond the arrangements which had been made in any othercountry which operated a freedom of information system.    The view wasalso expressed that they amounted to a charter for paranoiacs, reflectinga lack of faith in Parliamentary institutions and founded on a totallyunreal picture of an omnipotent and repressive State with Ministersdominated by their officials.    In fact government was now more openthan ever before and the supporters of the Bill were a misguidedminority, unrepresentative of Parliament or public opinion as a whole.It was further argued that there was little support for the Bill amongthe Conservatives and that it was inconceivable for a Private Member&apos;sBill to reach the Statute Book if both the Government and the officialOpposition considered it to be objectionable.    The Government shouldnot make any concession which they believed to be wrong simply becausethey thought it necessary as a means of preventing the Bill&apos;s enactment.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOn the other hand it was pointed out that the principle of open governmenthad been accepted by the Labour Party who were committed to it in theirOctober 1974 Manifesto, and that it was widely supported in other Parties.The issue could not be pushed aside;  a similar commitment might beexpected in the next Manifesto and the issue would be revived in the nextParliament.    Strenuous efforts had been made to maintain the positionreflected in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision of 18 January but that positionwas no longer tenable.    The Government needed to make clear theirobjection to the particular form of open government that was proposed inMr Freud&apos;s Bill, and their reasons for it, but they should be ready toindicate their willingness to allow Part II to proceed and their ownsupport for an alternative scheme of open government which might bebased on a Code of Practice of the kind which had been proposed by&quot;Justice&quot;.    Such a scheme might fit in with the proposals recently putforward by the Select Committee on Procedure for a new structure ofDepartmentally related Select Committees.    It was further argued thatthe draft Green Paper annexed to CP(79) 17 was a useful document andthat there would be advantage in publishing it, if possible beforeMr Freud&apos;s Bill begain its Repoit Stage, with appropriate revisions toreflect the Government&apos;s support for a Code of Practice.    The detailsof the Code, the arrangements for monitoring it (whether by theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration, by some other agencyor by a Select Committee) and whether or not it would be wise to put it ona statutory basis would be presented as matters requiring furtherexamination and discussion.    It was suggested that these matters shouldbe referred, together with the Green Paper, to a Select Committee whichwould be able to take evidence from Ministers and others.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the best way forward lay in Government support fora Code of Practice on openness as suggested in the &quot;Justice&quot; Report.A statement should accordingly be made, at or preferably before theReport Stage of the Official Information Bill, in which the Governmentwould indicate that they could not accept Part I of the Bill, although theywould be ready to proceed with Part II on the basis of the White Paper onthe Reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 191L TheGovernment should aim at the same time to publish a Green Paper onopenness, together with the report of the study of overseas experience.The Green Paper should indicate a Government commitment to a Code ofPractice, but the details of the Code, the question whether or not thisshould be put on a statutory footing and if so, in what form, and themachinery for monitoring it should be left open for further examination.The Government should indicate that they would propose the appointmentof a Select Committee for this purpose.    Meanwhile GEN 29 shouldrevise the draft Green Paper in the light of the conclusions reached bythe Cabinet.    It would be for Mr Freud, on being informed at anappropriate stage of the Government&apos;s general intentions including theintention to propose a Select Committee, to decide whether to withdraw9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPart I of his Bill in the interests of allowing Part U to proceed.    But ifPart I were not withdrawn and could not be voted down, the Governmentwould be in a stronger position to hold back any further progress on theBill.BERRATING(IALBYITThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.6. The Cabinet considered two memoranda about the November 1979uprating, by the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Ministerfor Social Security (CP(7?) 19) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP(79) 18).THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that his paper containedfive proposals.    The first was to implement the normal annual upratingof social security benefits in line with the forecast provided by theTreasury.    The full cost of this had already been allowed for in thePublic Expenditure Survey.    The second was to make good the shortfallin the 1978 uprating, which had underestimated the movement in pay andprices during the following year.    This would cost  80 million in thefirst year and  190 million in 1980-81.    The third was to provide anadditional margin of 1 per cent, over and above the price forecast forthe pension year starting in November 1979, in order to narrow the gapbetween the long and short-term rates.    Fourth, he proposed to increasechild benefit, which was going up to  4 per week in April, by a further60p per week in November 19?9, making a total of  4. 60.    This wouldpreserve the present 85p gap between the child benefit rate and the short-term dependency allowance for children, which would otherwije widensubstantially during the year.    There was a strong feeling in the LabourParty and in the Trades Union Congress that this gap should eventuallybe eliminated.     The cost, compared with the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposalfor a  4. 50 rate, would be  20 million in 1979-80 and  50 million in a fullyear.    Finally, he wanted to increase the one-parent family premium from 2 to  2. 50, at a cost of  2 million in 1979-80 and  6 million in 1980-81.In discussion there was no dissent from the proposition that thestatutory uprating should be allowed to go forward on the basis of theTreasury forecast.    It was however pointed out that automaticindexation, whether of social security benefits or of tax allowances, wasa dangerous principle in many ways.    On the question of shortfall, itwas argued that there was no automatic obligation to make good the loss.Although an obiter dictum of the judge in a recent case had implied thatthe Government should take corrective action, the old principle of&quot;swings and roundabouts&quot; might be held to apply.    There was neverthe-less a strong feeling in the Cabinet that the shortfall should be10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALeliminated.    On the question of margins, it was argued that tc allow anextra 1 per cent would throw doubt upon the validity of the price forecast.Against this it was argued that it was one of the few ways of improvingthe position of the long-term unemployed, who still drew short-termbenefit rates, and who had not benefited at all in real terms over thepast few years.    This might point to the need to move the long-termunemployed on to long-term benefit rates.    But to do so would in manycases narrow the gap between the income of those in work and those outof work, with a further damaging effect on incentives.    On balance itseemed better not to extend this problem by adding a further margin forerror to the uprating of short-term benefits.    The same argumentsapplied to the proposal to increase the long-term scale rate.    In additionit wap argued that this proposal involved anticipating the outcome of the1979 Public Expenditure Survey, and should properly be considered inthat context alongside all the other claims upon resources.    It should beproperly and sympathetically considered at that stage.In further discussion it was argued that there was not much case for anyincrease in child benefit rates in November, given the increase due to beimplemented on 1 April.    This too involved pre-emption of a decisionwhich would be better taken in the context of the Public ExpenditureSurvey.    However, it was argued that the phasing out of Child TaxAllowances (CTAs) meant that increasing child benefit rates was theonly instrument available to the Chancellor of the Exchequer at Budgettime to match the automatic uprating of personal tax allowances.Moreover, in order to secure Parliamentary support for the lastlegislative steps required to phase out CTAs, it was necessary to bereadonably generous over child benefit.    But it did not follow that theincrease need be as much as 60p;  previous increases had gone up in50p steps.    Despite the views of the Party and the Trades UnionCongress, there was no Government commitment to raise child benefitrates to the level of the short-term dependency allowance for children,and no reason why this gap should not be allowed temporarily to widen.The Government would get little political credit from the additional lOpincrease, although the cost would be  50 million in a full year. Giventhe other pressures on the Contingency Reserve in 1979-80, there werebetter things which could be done with the money.    Because it was paidto the wife child benefit was tending not to be taken into account by themale wage-earner and the Government should publicise the veryconsiderable help it had now given to mothers with families through thechild benefit system,    However, there was a good case for increasingthe one-parent family premium by more than the amount proposed bythe Minister for Social Security;  the extra cost of an increase from  2to  3 per week would only be  4 million and this could be readilyabsorbed in 1979-80.11CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER.,  summing up the discussion, said tnat theCabinet agreed that the automatic uprating of short-term benefits shouldbe implemented in November in the usual way in line with the Treasuryforecast.    They also agreed that the shortfall on the 1978 upratingshould be made good at a cost of  80 million in 1979-80.    They did notagree that any additional margin should be added to the 1979 uprating.They agreed to postpone a decision on the long-term scale rate until the1979 Public Expenditure Survey, when it would be fully considered alongwith all the other claims on resources at that time.    They agreed thatthe child benefit rate should be increased again in November from  4 to 4. 50, and that the one-parent family premium should be increased from 2 to  3 at the same time.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer shouldannounce these changes in the course of his Budget speech, and shouldaim to secure the maximum possible public support for the improvementsin social security benefits and particularly in child benefit in thatcontext.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Minister for SocialSecurity to proceed accordingly.ES&apos;OUSnee:110thusions,27. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Prices and Consumer Protection (CP(79) 20) about san improved payoffer to the nurses.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND CONSUMERPROTECTION said that, following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 1 March,the Secretary of State for Social Services had made an offer to theManagement and Staff Sides of the Nurses Whitley Council.    It involveda basic increase of 9 per cent from 1 April 1979;  a comparability study,the re suits of which would be implemented in two equal stage s on1 August 1979 and 1 April 1980;  and an advance payment of  1 a weekfrom 1 April 1979 for those working 35 hours a week or more to bededucted from the first stage of the comparability award.    The termsof the offer were the same as had been offered to the unions involved inthe public services dispute though they were arguably more generousbecause of the smaller proportion of low-paid amongst the nurses andbecause they would have to wait for a shorter period from their annualsettlement date to the first stage of the comparability increase. TheWhitley Council representatives, on both sides, had reactedunfavourably to the offer.    In subeeqnent informal discussions withthe Chairman of the Staff Side it appeared that an increase in the advance12CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpayment from 1 April would almost certainly enable a settlement to bereached.    The Staff Side Chairman had in mind an increase to  2. 50per week.    Provided that the full amount ofthe advance payment could bededucted from the first stage of the comparability award there would beno additional expenditure involved in making the concession. TheMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on PayNegotiations (E&quot;X(P)) had agreed at their meeting on 8 March that anincrease in the advance payment would be justified in order to reach asettlement.    They recommended that payment might be increased to 2. 50 for the better-paid with the lower-paid receiving  2.    The lowerfigure was tc ensure that no-one suffered any reduction in pay from1 August should their comparability increases be inadequate to offset theadvance payment.    EY(P) had, however, been concerned about the timingof such an offer and in particular its possible impact on the prospectsfor settlements with the National Health Service (NHS) ancillaries andambulancemen.    They had hoped that settlements with these two groupswould be reached within a week but this had not happened. Thetimetable now was that the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE)Health Panel would meet on 19 March and the General Secretary wouldtry to get approval to a Motion for a return to work.    The ExecutiveCommittee of NUPE would then meet on Saturday 24 March.    If all wentwell there could be a meeting of the Whitley Council on 26 March atwhich a settlement might be reached.    This was a very extended time-table and there was no guarantee that it would end in a settlement. Twoout of the three other unions concerned had urged Ministers privately tolet this timetable Jtand and had pointed out that attempts to foreshortenit would prejudice the outcome.    On the other hand continuation of theNHS ancillaries and ambulancemen would be increasingly damaging bothto the health service and the Government.    It also made handlirg thenurses negotiations more difficult.    In his view the right course inrelation to the nurses was to make the improved offer, on the linesagreed by EY(P), without further delay.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he hadwritten on the previous day to the Chairman of both Sides of the WhitleyCouncil for the NHS ambulancemen and ancillarie s asking them to havemeetings of their Councils at the beginning of next week.    If these werenot held or settlements were not reached he would ask health authoritiesto take firmer administrative action against those taking industrial action.But whether or not an early settlement to the ancillaries&apos; and ambulancemen&apos;s disputes could be reached he favoured an early improved offer tothe nurses.    Nurses had an overwhelming case for favourable treat-ment particularly given the extra work they had accepted in the currentdisputes.    Negotiations had already been long delayed for reasons whichneither they nor the general public understood.    The risk of reper-cussions from an improved offer had been overemphasised - the generalpublic would certainly not expect that other groups such as the CivilService or the teachers would receive the same treatment as the nurses.13CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIf, as a result of further delay in making a better offer, more nurseswere forced into taking industrial action both the NHS and theGovernments own standing would suffer badly.    He accordinglyfavoured making an improved offer to the nurses, perhaps early in thefollowing week, on the lines agreed by EY(P).In discussion it was argued that nurses had already received an offerwhich was in some respects superior to that given to the unions involvedin the public services disputes.    Ix was a good offer on which theGovernment should now stand firm.    Moreover the Press could beexpected to present the proposed improvement as taking the offer to14 per cent plus comparability.    In addition the size of the increasedpayment on account might well prejudice the work of the StandingCommission because it would indicate that the Government expectedsizeable comparability increases.    On the other hand it was argued that,whilst the offer made to the nurses was a fair one, it did not provide thebasis for a settlement.    By their loyalty during the public servicesdisputes and the decision of the Royal College of Nurses not to takeindustrial action they had gained massive public support. TheGovernment had to recognise this ana the political damage which mightresult from a decision to stand out against the nurses.    The right coursewas to make ;he least concessions necessary to get a settlement and theproposed increase in the advance payment, which would not add to publicexpenditure, was the best option.    The public would appreciate thereasons why the nurses were entitled to special treatment and it would beunnecessary and unwise to attempt to tie the improved offer to anyformal no-strike agreement.    As to the size of the improved advancepayment the best course would be to offer  2. 50 to the trained nursesand  2 to the student nurses.In discussion of the timing and possible repercussions of an improvedoffer to the nurses it was argued that the offer at this stage would bebound to make it more difficult to achieve an early settlement with theNHS ancillaries and ambulancemen and that others, for example theCivil Service and teachers&apos; unions, would be bound to press for similaroffers.    On the other hand it was argued that, although it would havebeen desirable to tackle the other NHS disputes before making animproved offer to the nurses, that approach was no longer sensible.The chances of a settlement of the other disputes within a week were, atbest, uncertain and neither the public nor the profession would under-stand why the Government was holding up negotiations on the nurses.The right course would be  for the Secretary of State for Social Servicesto tell the Chairmen of the Management and Staff Sides of the NursesWhitley Council that he would like to discuss the situation with them onTuesday 20 March, which would give time for prior action in the NHSancillaries and ambulancemen Whitley Councils to settle their disputes.There might be advantage in making public the fact of such an approachin the debate on nurses1 pay in the House of Commons later that day.14CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAs regards possible repercussions on groups outside the NHS it wasargued strongly that any claims for comparable treatment should bestrongly resisted.    In the case of the teachers the pressure was likelyto be for comparable staging rather than for equivalent treatment onadvance payments.In further discussion it was suggested that an early end to the NHSancillaries dispute might be facilitated if the unions&apos; claim for theadvance payment to be made also to part-time workers were conceded.On the other hand it was argued strongly against this that it would bewrong to make yet a further change to the original agreement reachedbetween the Government and the public service unions about the termsfor the settlement of this dispute.In yet further discussion the idea of seeking to link the nurses&apos; paysettlement with a &quot;no strike&quot; agreement with the unions representingthem was considered and rejected as inopportune.    The whole questionof &quot;no strike&quot; agreements was already under consideration in theMinisterial Group on the Implementation of the Agreement with theTrades Union Congress (GEN 165) and action should be deferred untilthat Group had reported.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that an improved offer should be made to the nursesand that it should take the form of an increase in the advance paymentfrom April 1979 to 1 August 1979 which would be deducted from the firststage of the comparability award.    The increase could be up to  2. 50for trained nurses and  2 for the student nurses.    The Secretary ofState for Social Services should write to the Chairmen of theManagement and Staff Sides of the Whitley Council that day inviting themto a discussion with him on Tuesday 20 March but should not refer to animproved offer at this stage.    Reference could be made to thisinvitation in the debate in the House of Commons later that day. Inreaching a decision to improve what was already a fair offer the Cabinethad had regard to the special aspects of the nurses&apos; case.    They did notconsider that the concession on the advance payment should be taken as aprecedent for any other case.    In particular the Cabinet wished toregister its strong collective view against the extension of pre-paymentson account of comparability to the teachers, the Civil Service, and tofurther groups, eg part-time employees, within the ambit of theagreement reached in February with the unions concerned in the localauthority and NHS disputes.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guidedaccordingly.Cabinet Office16 March 197915CONFIDENTIAL
