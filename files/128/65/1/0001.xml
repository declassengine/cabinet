THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received, a letter fromthe Leader of the Opposition asking for a statement to be made onMonday 15 January about the industrial situation, to be followed onTuesday or Wednesday by a full day&apos;s debate.    He had replied toMrs Thatcher that the business already announced provided for aSupply Day on Thursday which could be rearranged for earlier in theweek if the Opposition wished, and that a statement on the industrialsituation would also be made if necessary.     The case for a statementon Monday 15 January, and the choice of Minister to make it, woulddepend on circumstances at the time:   when Mrs Thatcher had writtenher letter the threat had come mainly from industrial action by oiltanker drivers, but the principal danger -was now in the road haulageindustry.    The possible need to declare a State of Emergency would beconsidered later in the meeting, but at this stage a declaration was notlikely to be required except in Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that thesituation in the Province was now serious.     The oil tanker drivers hadstarted a full-scale strike on 5 January as a result of which 10, 000workers had already been laid off and another 10, 000 were likely to beidle after the weekend.    Hospitals and schools were facing greatdifficulty.    Industrial action by drivers in the road haulage industry wasalso having an increasingly seriouo effect.    The tanker drivers hadjust voted against the employers&apos; pay offer;  their attitude was to alarge extent politically motivated as an expression of right wingProtestant raaction against the Labour Party and British influence ontheir affairs.    A committee of shop stewards was meeting that morningand would be addressed by Mr John Freeman, the Chairman of theNorthern Ireland Branch of the Transport and General Workers Unionand of the Northern Ireland Committee of the Irish Congress of TradesUnions.    He was expected to recommend a return to work but it wasunlikely that his influence would have any immediate effect.Mr Moss Evans, the Secretary of the Transport and General WorkersUnion, had broadcast an appeal to the Northern Ireland tanker driversthe previous evening, which he had himself supported in a broadcaststatement;   and many political leaders in Northern Ireland hadcondemned the drivers&apos; action.     He hoped that they would be isolatedfrom any popular support so that if troops were needed they could bedeployed in response to a popular appeal.     The effect which troopscould have was however limited:  it was hoped that they could arrangesupplies of petrol to 64 filling stations for issue to priority users, butthey could not bring much help to industry.     The situation would beconsidered at a meeting of the Ministerial Group on the Oil TankerDrivers&apos; Dispute (GEN 158) that afternoon and a State of Emergencywould be declared if necessary.     Under Northern Ireland legislationthe Privy Council would not need to meet and no Parliamentaryprocedure would be required, but a statement would be made whenParliament resumed.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewould be an occasion for a full debate on the following Wednesday; hewould open the debate himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequerwould wind up.     The Government&apos;s policy and the line to be taken in thedebate would be considered later in the meeting, and the Chief Whipwould discuss the arrangements with the Opposition Chief Whip,Mr Humphrey Atkins, later that day.    A State of Emergency would bedeclared in Northern Ireland if GEN 158 considered that such action wasrequired.The Cabinet -1.        Took note, with approval, of the Pr:.meMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.:vious:erence:(73) 43rdiclusions,lute 3THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the text of theResolution which it was proposed to table in the Commons establishingthe Special Commission on Oil Sanctions had been circulated to membersof the Cabinet on the previous day;  the debate had been provisionallyarranged for Monday 22 January.     The text was in the general formpreviously agreed by the Cabinet and did not include names. TheResolution would be tabled when the House resumed on Monday15 January.    A further Resolution would be needed later giving thenames of Members to be appointed to the Special Commission.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brisf discussion, said that thespeakers in the debate in the House of Commons would be the LordPresident of the Council and the Attorney General;   there would be afree vote for backbenchers, but members of the Government would beexpected to vote for the Resolution.     The corresponding debate in theHouse of Lords would take place on the following day:  the results inboth Houses were uncertain, but if the House of Commons convincinglyapproved the Resolution, it was likely that the House of Lords would doso as well.The Cabinet -2.

SECRETvious;rence:78) 42ndelusions,ute 32. THE PRIME MINISTER said that hie meeting withPresident Carter of the United States, President Giscard of France andChancellor Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany on 5 and 6January in Guadeloupe had proved very worth while.    The discussionhad been confined very largely to politico-security matters and hadavoided issues which were more appropriate to an Economic Summit.There had been no personal differences between the participants, thoughthere had of course been some differences of attitude.    The talks hadconcentrated on three main areas.    The first was a wide - ranginggeopolitical discussion which had looked at the Wesfs relations with theSoviet Union and China in the medium and longer term.    The secondhad been devoted to the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) II andIII, including the grey areas.    The third had mainly dealt with currentflashpoints.    In the first area of discussion there had been agreementthat it was important that as President Breshnev of the Soviet Unionreached the end of his political career, his successor should come topower aware that the West wanted to work with the Soviet Union and notagainst her.    It was therefore necessary to maintain our link3 with theSoviet Union and to ensure that she was kept informed of Westernintentions in relation to all aspects of detente.    But he and hiscolleagues had also agreed at Guadeloupe that their relations with Chinacould not be dictated by the Soviet Union.    They had agreed that theUnited States normalisation of its relations with China was welcome, andhe had explained that the United Kingdom wanted a broad, balancedrelationship with China which embraced links in the industrial,scientific, cultural and defence sales fields, with no one area havingundue prominence.    He had given his colleagues an account of the wide-ranging industrial contacts with China which we were now pursuing.As regards the possible supply of Harrier to China, he had, in accor-dance with the conclusions of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee (DOP), informed his colleagues at Guadeloupe that theGovernrrEnt was moving towards a decision to authorise the sale of theaircraft.    Chancellor Schmidt had given his active encouragement tosuch a sale on the grounds that China felt weak in relation to the verystrong Russian forces on the Sino-Soviet border.    Px-esident Carter hadalso given strong support for the sale.    President Giscard had made itclear that France would supply China with defensive arms.    The fourparticipants had all received letters from President Brezhnev shortlybefore the meeting.    They had agreed that their replies shouldemphasise the Wesfs dedication to detente and disarmament.    It wouldbe made clear that the West had no intention of playing China offagainst the Soviet Union and that equally we could not allow Sovietobjections to interfere with our relations with China.    In the secondsession of the talks, which had been devoted to disarmament,President Giscard, Chancellor Schmidt and he had all undertaken to givePresident Carter support, both publicly and privately, for the conclusionand ratification of a SALT II agreement.    Herr Schmidt had said that,despite his reservations about the way in which the Americans had in theSECRET
SECRETpast handled the SALT negotiations, he would lend his support for theratification of SALT II not least to offset Soviet sensitivity about China.When the discussion had turned to SALT III, great concern had beenexpressed about Soviet dominance in the field of grey area systems,though President Carter had pointed out that throughout the row inEurope about weapons with enhanced radiation warheads, no Europeanleaders had drawn attention in public to the fact that the Soviet SSr20missile, which was already being deployed rather than simply plannedand could reach targets throughout Western Europe from the SovietUnion, was a far more terrible weapon.    Chancellor Schmidt had beenat his most illogical in thir part of the discussion.    He was particularlyanxious to see something done about the threat posed by the SS-20 but hewas not prepared to see new theatre nuclear weapons deployed by theAlliance on German territory, unless another member of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation was also prepared to have them. ThePrime Minister had pointed out that the United Kingdom already had anAmerican submarine base on its territory and that American F-lllaircraft were stationed here and we were therefore as vulnerable as theGermans if deterrence failed.    President Giscard had 3hown rather lessconcern about the Soviet lead in grey area systems and had made it clearthat there could be no question of French nuclear weapons being includedin SALT III.    He had himself taken the line that we should aim to securelimitations on Soviet medium-range systems, such as the SS-ZO, inSALT III and that for this purpose we should need to be ready to agreethat Western grey area systems should be included in the negotiations.It had not proved possible in the time available to arrive at an agreedEuropean view to the disappointment of President Carter who had hopedto know this before he received President Brezhnev at the end ofFebruary.    It had been left that he would probe President Brezhnev tosee how far the Soviet Union was pressing to have grey area systemsincluded in SALT III:  and there would be further quadripartiteconsideration of this question both before and after President Brezhnev&apos;svisit to the United States.    Indue course the Cabinet would have todecide the Governments position on the inclusion of grey area systemsin future disarmament negotiations, though it had to be recognised thatthe Russians currently enjoyed a substantial lead and that the West hadlittle scope for bargaining.    Nevertheless there was no doubt about theprofound disquiet in Germany about the Soviet predominance in thesesystems and in particular about the SS-20:  and when we came to considerwhether we should stay in the nuclear weapons field ourselves we shouldneed to bear in mind the extent to which the fact that we were a nuclearweapon state dissuaded the Germans from seeking to acquire suchweapons.    There had also been discussion of the French proposal for aEuropean Disarmament Conference (EDC) in which he had pointed outthe difficulties of making real progress in a conference involving 35states, including countries such as Malta, and that an EDC woulddiminish sharply any hope of agreement in the existing Mutual andBalance Force Reductions (MEFR) talks.    President Carter had4SECRET
SECRETquestioned whether the French proposal was cosmetic or was reallyaimed at disarmament.    Chancellor Schmidt, on the other hand, hadcome out strongly in support of President Giscard because he said he sawthe EDC as a signal that France was prepared to return to multilateraldiscussion of disarmament.     The meeting had not reached agreement onthis issue largely because we and the Americans were not prepared todesert the MBFR forum.    The third session on flashpoints had coveredsuch matters as the crises in Iran and Turkey.    It had also provided anopportunity for President Carter to reassure him that the AmericanAdministration was completely at one with us on Rhodesia and that therewas no truth in the rumours that they were preparing to pull out of theirpresent role on this issue.In discussion of arms sales to China it was pointed out that for the UnitedKingdom to supply weapons to a Communist country which had for longtaken the view that war was inevitable was a major step. Chinesepolicies had changed radically but there was no guarantee that they wouldnot swing equally the other way again.    The Americans and Gersaaanswere not proposing to supply China with arms, and it was therefore hardto see why we should.    Moreover, we should run the risk of worserelations with the Soviet Union, particularly in the trade field, though itwas true that the Russians had made little use of the very favourable lineof credit we had agreed with them in 1975.    Whether to supply China withHarrier was a difficult judgment to make.    DOP had now discussed thematter on a number of occasions and had concluded that the Chineseshould be told that we were willing to try to negotiate a sale of theaircraft.    They had not betn told that the Government had definitelydecided in favour of such a aale.    It had been explained to them that inany case there could be no question of the United Kingdom becoming anarms supplier to China and little else.    Defence sales had to take theirplace in a package of contracts.    As a result 12 different industrialmissions had been set up, and there were prospects for securing largeorders for British firms in areas such as shipbuilding and steel wherewe were particularly hard-pressed at present.    But our competitive edgein the eivil field was not good, and if sensibly handled, a decision to sellHarrier could open up opportunities which otherwise would not be there.Moreover, a good trading relationship with China would enable us to turnto them for some of the key minerals for which we were now dependent onSouth Africa.In further discussion it was reported that when the Secretary of State forTrade had seen the Prime Minister of Thailand the previous day,General Kriangsak had seemed relaxed about the Vietnamese action inCambodia,    He did nofciMnk that they would invade Thailand.    He had,however, a^ckwi that the West should bear in mind the needs of countrieslike Thailand, -e-&amp;pe&quot;eially in their efforts to raise living standards.5SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGuadeloupe meeting had not been intended to take decisions and none hadbeen reached.    But it had been valuable in clarifying allied thinking onvital politico-strategic matters.    The Cabinet wculd need to return in duecourse to the question of whether grey area systems should be included inSALT III.    There would be advantage if public debate on this issue wereto begin soon, though we should not want to go too far in the absence of aWestern position.    A major factor to be borne in mind was the need tohelp the Germans feel secure.    If we failed in this, the consequencescould be very sericus.    As regards China, the Cabinet would need toreach a decision on the sale of Harrier befcre the Secretary of State forIndustry visited China in February.    The Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary should circulate a paper on this issue to serve as the basis fortheir discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to circulate apaper on the proposed sale of Harrier aircraft toChina.SECRET6
CONFIDENTIAL3. THE PRISdtJETMINISTER said the Cabinet faced a series ofrelated problems on pay policy.    The tanker drivers1 dispute had nowbeen settled, but the pay increase involved was substantially beyond theGovernment guidelines.     So was the offer already made by the road2nd haulage employers.    But this had been rejected, and there was now arisk that the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) woulddeclare the strike official later that day.     The consequences of thisfor maintenance of services and for employment had not been fullyappreciated beforehand, although it was now clear they would beserious.     But the Union seemed determined to press its claims.Mr Moss Evans, the Secretary of the TGWU, clearly expected earlycapitulation by the employers.    Settlements on this scale would makeit much more difficult to maintain the pay policy in the public sector.The Ministers concerned, meeting earlier this morning, had agreedthe approach to be adopted towards local authority manual workers,National Health Service ancillaries and ambulancemen.    It involved abasic offer of 5 per cent in the present pay round;  the promise of acomparability exercise based as far as possible on genuine job forjob comparisons, the results of which would be implemented over thetwo subsequent years;   and an additional concession to the lowest paidin the form of an &quot;underpinning&quot;, the precise details of which would beagreed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) in due course.     The &quot;under-pinning&quot; device represented a slight modification of pay policy andwould have to be of general application.    Otherwise, it was essentialthat the Government should maintain its 5 per cent policy unmodified.It had been the right choice at the time, and still remained the onlypolicy which had any chance of successfully containing inflation.    As aresult of the Ford settlement and the Government&apos;s defeat on sanctionspolicy in December, there was now a real danger that the 5 per centpolicy would not hold.    He did not need to remind the Cabinet of theconsequences of the wage and price explosion in 1974-75.    But thistime there was no sign that the trade union movement, or the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) in particular, would be ready to respond as it hadthen.     Indeed the TUC had nothing to offer.     The Government shouldnot antagonise the TUC, but could no longer rely on it.    In thesecircumstances, ihe Government had to seek wider public support for itspolicies.    The Conservative Party had no satisfactory alternativesolution to offer.     Meanwhile, all Ministers should publicly support theGovernment1 s position on pay and take every opportunity to explain thereasons behind it and the consequences of excessive pay settlements.The first opportunity to do so would be when the Chancellor of theExchequer met the TUC Economic Committee that night, and therewould be a general debate on pay policy in the House of Commons thefollowing week.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion it was reported that the oil supply situation was rapdilyreturning to normal and that there was no longer a case for a State ofEmergency on this account now that the tanker drivers&apos; dispute had beensettled.     The effect of a State of Emergency would have been to allowtroops to move some 30 per cent of oil supplies, which would have beenenough to maintain essential services but not industrial employment oroutput.    Deliveries had not fallen to this level during the dispute. Thedispute continued however in Northern Ireland, and was made worse bythe road haulage dispute there and by the weather.    Large sections ofindustry in the Province were now at a standstill.    A State ofEmergency limited to the Province might still be required.     On theroad haulage dispute generally, it was reported that the situation wasstill very patchy but was deteriorating.    This was the result of secon-dary picketing as well as of the unofficial strike which had already begun.If trouble continued on this scale, or if the strike were made official andits scope extended, large-scale industrial lay-offs were inevitable by theend of the following week.    As a first step, the Regional EmergencyTransport Sub-Committees had been activated as a source of information.The TGWU was now likely to declare the strike official.    The PrimeMinister was to meet its Finance and General Purposes Committee laterin the day.    It might be possible to persuade them to dofer action untilthe Executive Committee of the Union had met;  other sections of theUnion whose jobs were at risk might then put pressure on the transportdrivers&apos; representatives to moderate their action.    However, the Unionleadership evidently expected that the strike would be a short one becausethey thought the employers would give way rapidly.    The employers&apos;attitude was influenced by the possibility of action to limit priceincreases which could be taken by the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection following a recent report by the Price Commission.This could be done in a way which did not directly relate to wage costs.An Order for this purpose was drafted and ready, but action had beenheld up to avoid unnecessary provocation.    There was a case for makingit forthwith.    There was also a case for asking the TUC to issue a Codeof Cor duct governing secondary picketing, which was playing anincreasing part in the present dispute.In further discussion it was argued that the Government must continue tocarry the TUC with it so far as possible.     The TUC was slow to initiatenew policies, but ready to respond to Government proposals. However,the General Council was deeply divided at present, and the leadershiplargely ineffective.     The Government had to present its case to a wideraudience.    There was still considerable support for the pay policy in thecountry, but this was being eroded by the sense of unfairness as excessivesettlements in some parts of the private sector left others including thepublic sector further behind.     There was no serious alternative, atleast in the short run, to a structured pay policy of broadly the presentkind.     The possibility of longer-term institutional changes, to allow theprinciple of comparability to be extended elsewhere in the public sector,was still being considered,8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOn the other hand it was aigued that the root causes of the presenttroubles might be more deep-seated.     For example, the present wave ofpay militancy might be the result of the frustrated energies of workerswho could not negotiate on other issues such as company strategy; andwhose scope for action was accordingly limited solely to pay matters.Similarly the Government might have to look for the solution inalternative economic and industrial policies.    Against this it was arguedthat there was no realistic alternative to the present economic strategy inthe short term.However, the Cabinet needed more time to work out its position in detail,particularly in preparation for the debate the following week. Mean-while, the immediate problem was the line to be taken with the TUCEconomic Committee later that day.    Here the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to seek the support of the trade unions in pursuit oftheir and the Government&apos;s common objectives and to point to the verydamaging effects on employment of, for example, the threatened roadhaulage strike.    He would ask the trade unions through the EconomicCommittee to resort less readily to industrial acticn in pursuit of payclaims and to avoid all-out strike action until the last possible moment.He would seek their co-operation over maintenance of essential supplies,and over the development of a new Code of Practice for dealing withsecondary picketing.     He would emphasise that if the trade unions couldoffer no help on pay restraint, the Government would be forced to actalone in the national interest.    It was just not possible for the tradeunions to seek excessive wage settlements, higher employment andfalling prices at one and the same time.    Indeed in the public sectorexcessive wage increases must inexorably lead to higher charges, eg inrates or prices, or lower employment because the public purse could notaccommodate them.    And more widely iu the economy excessivesettlements would oblige the Government to adopt tougher fiscal andmonetary policies which would lead to a loss of employment and tofurther increases in taxation.    He would also emphasise the politicalcase for trade union support of a Labour Government in the approach toan early General Election.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume its discussion of pay policy on the followingMonday.     Meanwhile they endorsed the approach which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had suggested he should adopt at Lis meeting with theEconomic Committee of the TUC that evening.    The real question for theTUC was whether the Government could look to them for support incarrying on with its present economic strategy.    If the TUC wanted theGovernment to succeed it had to help.     The Cabinet also agreed that thepublic service pay negotiations should be handled along the lines whichhad emerged from the discussion by the Ministers concerned earlier thatmorning and which he had described.     The Chancellor of the Exchequershould arrange for EY(P) to consider the proposed &quot;underpinning&quot; for the9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlow paid which would constitute the only immediate change in theGovernmenfs pay policy generally.    EY(P) should also consider thequestion of long-term comparability machinery on the basis of a paperalready being prepared by officials.    As to the road haulage dispute hewould himself speak to the TGWU about it later that day.    The proposalof the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection about roadhaulage prices would be relevant and, while the Cabinet favoured makingan Order on the lines proposed, tactics and timing should be reservedfor later consideration.    More generally it was necessary for theGovernment to put its case across vigorously to the public.   He -wouldarrange for a suitable speaking brief to be prepared for the use of allMinisters, who should take every opportunity to explain the Governmenfspay policy in the media and in public speeches.    The Governmenfstactics for the debate in the House of Commons the following week wouldbe considered by the Cabinet at its meeting on Monday.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the other Ministersconcerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office11 January 1979.0CONFIDENTIAL
