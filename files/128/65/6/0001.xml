MENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thec House of Commons during the following week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that in the Supply Day debate on thedisruption of the education services she would make the point thatreasons for the closure of schools included weather conditions andshortage of fuel, as well as strike action.    She would explain the stepswhich were being taken to keep schools open, including the Code ofPractice on picketing, and her consultations with the organisationsconcerned to provide for special needs, for example for children takingpublic examinations.    Four areas were particularly affected -Haringey and Barking, where almost all schools were closed (the formeron the instructions of the Education Authority, the latter because of theattitude of the teaching staff supported by head teachers), and Newcastleand Sunderland, where about one third of the schools were closed. Allthe unions involved in the dispute had said that children and teacherswould be allowed to cross picket lines, but in accordance with standardpractice teachers would not do the work of trade unionists involved inthe dispute.    A resulting problem which had not so far become a publicissue arose from the difficulty of heating schools and of providing otherservices to the statutory standards:  if this could not be done it wasdifficult to require teachers to keep schools open.    She had made clearthe Governments view that schools should be kept open for as long aspossible, but if teachers were pressed too far they would withdraw theirco-operation.In discussion of the wider issues raised by the current disruption ofessential public services, particularly as it affected burial and hospitalservices, it was argued that an unprecedented and dangerous situationhad now developed.    Public feeling against the trade union movementhad not only reached a point where a Conservative Government might bereturned with strong public support for a programme of anti-trade unionlegislation, but democratic principles might themselves be at risk. Theposition was not fully understood by trade union leaders and many of themwere in any event unable to control the forces which were at work withinthe movement.    Discipline was lacking;  action was being taken whichoffended ordinary standards of public decency;  and the country appearedto have lost its traditional strength of community feeling. TheGovernment were unable to act on many of those aspects of the currentsituation which were causing public alarm, but they could express anattitude and it would be right for particular actions to be forthrightlycondemned.    Voluntary effort, though it might amount to strike-breaking, could also receive Government support.    Against this it wasargued that many of those who were taking part in industrial action werepassionately convinced of the justice of their case; those whose actions1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoffended civilised standards were a minority and the fact that normallyresponsible people were prepared to behave in this way indicated thatthere were deep-rooted problems which ought to be recognised andresolved.    One of the encouraging features in recent weeks had been thereadiness of trade union leadership to allow essential services to bemaintained.    If it were argued that unions in certain industries had aspecial responsibility to the public, that should be recognised in specialarrangements for resolving their claims.    It was the duty of Labourleaders to pursue the path of reason and persuasion and to avoidgeneralised condemnations or a search for scapegoats.    It would bewrong to express views which might have the effect of further isolatingthe trade union movement.In further discussion it was suggested that the Prime Minister mightbroadcast in an attempt to rally the nation and to restore a measure ofindustrial calm.    On the other hand mere appeals to reason and commondecency would leave the way open for the Conservatives to continue toexploit feelings of public anger.    It would therefore be better to makesuch an appeal in the context of decisions taken by the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in no doubt about the serious effect on public attitudes ofthe present disruption of essential public services, and they had had auseful exchange of views on the thinking which should inform theGovernments own attitude.    The issues raised by the disputes would bebetter considered, however, in the context of their later discussion of paypolicy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministerssumming up of their discussion.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe situation in Iran had become chaotic, as he had predicted it would.It was impossible to foresee what would now happen.    But it seemedpossible that the Ayatollah Khomeini would not have decided to returnto Iran without having reached some prior understanding with the Army.This offered the only hope for an improvement in the situation. Thepresent Prime Minister, Dr Bakhtiar, whom the United StatesGovernment had unwisely supported so openly, was likely to be left ontne side.    British citizens had now been evacuated from the main citiesof Iran.    The Iranian Government had placed all their defence contractswith the United Kingdom in suspense.    This in effect left all the optionsopen for the future and was not necessarily as serious a step as thePress had suggested.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,following the outcome of the referendum of White voters in Rhodesia,the British Government faced a potentially difficult situation with regardto the Rhodesian elections due to be held on 20 April.    After thoseelections there would be strong pressure on the Government from withinthe United Kingdom to recognise the new regime and to lift sanctions.Much of the British public was tired of the Rhode sian problem and wouldwelcome any opportunity that appeared to dispose of it.    But theGovernment would not be able to recognise the new regime.    To do sowould split the Labour Party and would cause deep internationaldivisions, especially within the Commonwealth.    His aim, therefore,was to avoid a situation where the Government had to make a straightchoice between recognising the regime or not.    Our objective was tofollow the parallel of Namibia and to seek to get the South AfricanGovernment committed to elections in Rhodesia supervised by theUnited Nations.    Whether these elections preceded or followed theelections on 20 April could be left open.    He would be discussing thisidea with the American Secretary of State, Mr Vance, later that day.The United States Government was coming under increasingCongressional pressure to recognise the Salisbury regime, butPresident Carter and Mr Vance were showing no sign of wavering.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL

SECRETICUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO 37CABINETthonsLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCM(79) 6th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 1 February 1979 at 10. 30 amTHE PRIME MINISTER said that, following talks with the EconomicCommittee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) officials of both sideshad prepared the first draft of the economic and pay section of apossible agreement between the Government and the TUC.    It might beimproved later but at this stage it was a deeply disappointing documentwhich gave the Government no comfort.    Parallel discussions with theEmployment Policy Committee of the TUC on the industrial relationssection of the same document were to be held later in the day. Theomens for progress here were better.    Nevertheless, the TUC showedno signs of readiness to assist the Government in reaching acceptablesettlements in the pay negotiations now in progress.    It was an openquestion whether the Government should still work for a joint statementwith the TUC.In discussion it was suggested that there was still some chance of auseful outcome from the talks with the TUC.    The texts which had beenprepared on industrial relations contained many useful passages whichcould be referred to in future disputes.    Equally the draft on pay, whilepoor, contained phrases on which it might be possible to build. TheCabinet should reserve its judgment until the complete text was beforethem.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the MinisterialSub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) had discussed the previousnight the complex of pay claims covering the water industry, localauthority manual workers, National Health Service (NHS) ancillariesand ambulancemen.    They had also considered the related problem ofnurses&apos; pay.    In general, it seemed probable that the unions wereseeking settlements well into double figures, though there were somecontrary and more hopeful signs.    Ministers had decided, subject toCabinet agreement, not to increase the offers to these various groupsSECRET
SECRETat this stage, except in the water industry.    For that industry, itwould almost certainly be necessary to improve the offer in order toavoid a very damaging strike.    It was for consideration whether thebest tactics were to reach an early settlement for the NHS in the hopeof affecting the local authority negotiations, or to leave the localauthority employers to make the running.    As to nurses, Ministers hadagreed that the best approach might be an extension of the proposedcomparability studies to cover nurses, and possibly in due course alsoteachers.In discussion of the water industry it was argued that the consequencesof a strike were too serious to be contemplated.    The present offer, of13. 9 per cent, contained a basic element of only about 7 per cent, withthe balance being made up by a rather suspect productivity deal. Someimprovement in this offer could be made and still presented as withinsingle figures.    But if a settlement could not be secured within anoverall total of 16 per cent, the Cabinet might have no alternative, otherthan the surrender of its policies, to standing up to a strike. Thecontingency plans for dealing with a strike in water and sewage shouldtherefore be reviewed urgently.In further discussion of the local authority manual workers1 claim, itwas pointed out that the Government could not wholly control the actionsof the local authority employers.    It could authorise them to make anoffer, either of the present 8.8 per cent or of some higher figure, andundertake to meet its share of the additional cost through the RateSupport Grant (RSG) or it could restrict its present RSG offer to 8. 8 percent or to some higher figure, leaving it to the local authorities todecide whether to meet the additional costs of a still higher offer fromthe rates, from reserves, or by a reduction in services.    The latterwould inevitably lead to a loss of jobs for the unions concerned. Themajority of full-time local authority workers were not particularly low-paid, though they would benefit in varying degrees from the specialtreatment for the low-paid which had been agreed two weeks earlier.A high settlement for the local authority workers would set a floor forthe NHS in due course.    In any event it was important to make thelocal authority employers face up to their responsibilities. TheGovernment needed to set clear limits to the RSG support it wasprepared to offer and then leave the employers to take their owndecisions in the light of this knowledge.In continued discussion it was reported that there was now a prospectof a settlement on quite different terms for the NHS ancillaries and forambulancemen.    It had emerged in informal discussions between bothsides that a longer-term deal might be possible, covering 15j monthsand totalling about 16 per cent equal to about 14 per cent at an annualrate.    In practice it might be possible to reduce this figure in thecourse of negotiations,    Until details of the proposal were available,ZSECRET
SECRETMinisters could form no view on it.    But it was clear that the unionswere embarked upon a course of serious disruption in the NHS, and thatthe leadership had considerable difficulty in restraining their rank andfile members.    The consequences of continued industrial action couldbe very serious for Health Service patients.    The cost of any settlementsignificantly beyond that allowed for in the public expenditure surveycould not be accommodated within present cash limits.    There waslittle room for reductions in the Health Service budget without quiteunacceptable reductions in level of service.    The alternative ofincreases in prescription and other charges was politically unattractive.Unless the cost was to be met out of taxation, it might therefore have tobe covered from reductions in other public expenditure programmes.Against this view it was argued that the Health Service was notorious forthe wasteful use of resources.    It should not be assumed that sensiblecuts in its expenditure would be intolerable.    There was however noneed for Ministers to take decisions on means of financing pay settle-ments in the NHS at this stage.As to other public sector negotiations, it was reported that there was aprospect of serious disruption in parts of the Civil Service within thenext few weeks, even though the settlement date for the non-industrialCivil Service was not until 1 April and formal negotiations on the PayResearch Unit report had not yet begun.    Decisions would also beneeded on the nurses and teachers in the near future.    A little furtherahead lay very difficult negotiations with the miners and other energyindustries, whose industrial strength was very considerable.    This madeit the more important to hold the line in the early public service settle -ments if possible.In general discussion of the immediate tactics it was argued thatconcessions would be needed to secure industrial peace.    A case-by-case approach was inevitable, and the terms of offers must be tailoredto the circumstances of each negotiating group.    The Cabinet hadalready been forced to agree to a high offer in the water industry, andthis would inevitably set the pattern for other negotiations. Thereseemed no realistic prospect of securing a settlement in the NHS whoseoverall cost could be contained within single figures.Against this it was argued strongly that the Government was in danger oflosing control.    It had already suffered a number of serious setbacks.But a series of very high settlements, such as now seemed likely, woulddo great damage to overseas confidence in sterling, which had remainedremarkably strong so far.    Once this happened, it would be necessaryto take immediate and unpleasant offsetting action.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer might well need to bring forward proposals for a firstbatch of fiscal and monetary measures in the near future if the situationdeteriorated further.    The Government should therefore take a firmstand before that prospect arose.    It had considerable responsibilities3SECRET
SECRETas employer and paymaster to the public services.    It should make itsposition in respect of these services plain both in terms of the money itwas prepared to find and of the consequences for employment and theprovision of services which would follow from excessive settlements.It might be necessary to give a little more room for manoeuvre but no-one should be left in doubt that the Government did not intend to financepublic service settlements running to double figures.    Where it haddirect control, or where it could influence the course of events throughthe RSG, it should do so.    If this meant facing serious industrialdisruption, then this had to be accepted.    Such a course was preferableto a slide into hyper-inflation.    The Prime Minister&apos;s speech to theLabour Party Local Government Conference at the weekend wouldprovide a good opportunity for him to expound a stance of this kind.While there was a case for leaving any public announcement until afterthe next meeting with the TUC General Council, time was short. Onbalance, it was preferable to make an early public statement of theGovernment&apos;s position, although individual trade union leaders shouM beinformed in advance if possible.    There were great risks in adoptingsuch a policy.    But no realistic alternative was available.    It mightmean facing considerable disruption and damage.    But at the worst,the Government would at least have adopted a consistent and defensiblepolicy on which it could face the electorate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that there was little prospect of assistance from theTUC which could significantly affect the outcome of the current publicservice disputes.    It was important that the wider negotiations with theTUC should continue.    But the time had come for the Government tomake its own position as employer clear.    In this role it could notdepart from its basic position as set out in the White Paper&quot;Continuing the Battle against Inflation&quot;.    It would continue to seeksettlements as near to 5 per cent as possible, in the public and privatesectors alike.    Nevertheless it had to be recognised that higher levelsof settlement were likely in some important cases.    The Governmentwould therefore have to make it plain that, where these occurred in thepublic services, it was not prepared to finance settlements outsidesingle figures.    Such settlements would therefore inevitably lead toreduced services, higher taxation or higher charges.    The country mustcome to its senses, and the Government must take a stand. Accordinglythe Secretary of State for the Environment should see the local authorityemployers as agreed later that day.    He should make a further attemptto persuade them to agree to comparability studies for local authoritymanual workers on the lines already agreed.    In the following week, heshould indicate that the Government was, if necessary, prepared to seesome further small improvement in the offer, preferably biased towardsthe low-paid.    He should then indicate that the Government was preparedto finance, through the RSG, its share of a settlement within singlefigures.    Beyond that point, it would be for the local authorities to meetthe full cost of any further concessions they might make, whether by an4SECRET
SECRETincrease in rates, a reduction in working balances, or a reduction inservices.    The Secretary of State for Social Services should take nofurther action in the pay negotiations in the NHS for the time being. Itwas important that a settlement in the Health Service should follow, notprecede, a settlement for local authority manuals.    The Governmentwas responsible for the former and could not set the pace.    The Cabinetrecognised that these decisions might lead to protracted industrialdisputes among local authority workers and very substantial difficultieswithin the Health Service, involving perhaps the temporary closure ofcomplete hospitals and even threats to the health of patients.    But it wassatisfied that there would be even greater risks if a stand was not madenow.    The Cabinet would need to consider at a later stage how the costsof any settlement within single figures in the NHS should be financed,though there was clear evidence of waste in the present structure. Inaddition, the Secretary of State for the Environment should meet the 1Chairman of the National Water Council and instruct him to prolong hisnegotiations beyond the weekend.    He should also authorise the Chairmanto seek a settlement after the weekend within a total increase of 16 percent in the wage bill.    The cost of this increase would have to berecovered from the consumer, and there would be no increase inborrowing limits.    It was possible that even this offer would not securea settlement.    The Home Secretary should therefore arrange for theContingencies Unit to review the arrangements for a prolonged strike inthe water industry.    He would himself, in his speech to the LabourParty Local Government Conference on 3 February, make the Cabinet1 sposition clear.    The Government had not departed from its basic stance,and was still determined to secure settlements as near to 5 per cent aspossible in the public and in the private sectors.    But it had also tomake clear its own position as an employer.    The Cabinet agreed thatit was not prepared to finance settlements beyond single figures.    To doso would lead inevitably to a reduction in services, to higher taxation,and to increased charges:  and the Government should make its stand atthis point.    He would see the union leaders directly concerned later inthe day.    A policy of this kind, coupled with the necessary resoluteaction which would follow, was a high risk one.    It would notnecessarily succeed and if it failed the consequences seemed clear.But there was no alternative policy which carried less risk.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office2 February 19795SECRET
