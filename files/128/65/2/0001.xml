CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet resumed its discussion of a number of recent pay disputesand of the Governments pay policy and the line to be taken in the debatenext day.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that there was nowa slight prospect that the threatened industrial action on the railwayslater in the week would be called off.    Government intervention at thisstage would not be helpful, though he might call all three unions and theBritish Railways Board together later that day if no further progress hadbeen made.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that, despite Pressreports, there was no immediate sign of a settlement of the road haulagedispute.    One difficulty was that the Transport and General WorkersUnion (TGWU) was seeking a series of regional settlements, while theRoad Haulage Association (RHA) insisted on a national settlement. Ifthe Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) were eventuallyto intervene, this was one of the issues it would have to re solve. Hispersonal view was that action would continue for the resc of the week,but that a settlement would eventually be reached at about  62- 63 aweek on the basic wage.     The emergency machinery was now beginningto work well, and the TGWU were co-operating at local level about themaintenance of essential supplies in accordance with the agreed prioritylist.In discussion there was general agreement that the position on essentialmaterials and food was better than in the previous week, but that inindustry, many firms had already closed, and by the end of the weekthere cculd be between one and two million workers laid off throughoutthe country.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that thetanker drivers&apos; dispute in Northern Ireland was now over.    Before itended, some 300 troops had been briefly employed on maintainingessential deliveries.     But the road haulage dispute continued, and thenumber of men laid off was rising.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ICKVIRQNMENT said that 8, 000people, in small groups, had been affected by an unofficial dispute in theNorthern Water Authority.    He was considering calling in troops tomaintain water supplies, but there was a danger that this would lead toa walkout by supervisory staff.    In the longer term, there was now aserious risk of official action in the water industry which would pose agrave threat to health.    There had been signs the previous week that theunions might accept a comparability exercise similar to that offered tothe local authority manual workers.    But it now seemed that theywanted an early settlement which could be reopened later so that theycould secure whatever overall increase was given to gas andelectricity workers.In discussion it was pointed out that a State of Emergency had beennecessary in Northern Ireland to maintain essential petrol supplies.People did not understand why a similar State of Emergency had notbeen declared in Great Britain.    In fact, plans had existed for an earlydeclaration, but because the TGWU had undertaken to co-operate overmaintenance of deliveries for essential services, a better flow of petroland oil had been maintained in Great Britain without a State ofEmergency than would have been possible with one.    The only purposeof a State of Emergency in the road tanker dispute would have been toallow the requisitioning of vehicles, and at this stage it was notnecessary to contemplate requisitioning of vehicles in the road haulagedispute.    A declaration related to the latter dispute would therefore beof cosmetic advantage only - as indicating that the Government took thesituation very seriously indeed.    Nevertheless the population at largedid not understand the practical limitations of a State of Emergency andsteps should be taken to make these clear to Parliament and the publicat an early opportunity.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Opposition attack next day would belikely to concentrate upon the abuse of trade union power and the need torestrict it.    Such an attack could have considerable electoral appeal andcould seriously damage the Government&apos;s prospects in the forthcomingElection,    The Government should therefore stand firm on its counter-inflationary policy, pointing to the large increase in living standards andthe fall in inflation in the last 12 months and to the earlier co-operationof the trade unions.    It should treat the present problems as a setbackwhich did not justify the abandonment of the policy.    However, thebalance of power between employers and trade unions had shiftedsignificantly in the last 10 years.    The only way to deal with the newsituation was by co-operation with the unions.    The Trades UnionCongress (TUC) must be brought to recognise that a new agreement2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwith the Government was essential, if they were to avoid having theirpowers greatly reduced by an incoming Conservative Government. Onthe immediate situation, it would be quite wrong to encourage the RHAto settle at the sort of figure claimed by the TGWU.    The Governmentwas also justified in resisting the spread of secondary picketing. Anew Code of Conduct on this subject was now urgent.    The scope forfiscal and monetary measures coi Id be decided nearer Budget time ifthis proved necessary.     Excessive settlements in the public sectorwould have to be financed out of rate increases or reductions inservices.    The Government could not afford to finance inflationarysettlements.In discussion it was argued that the present industrial situationdemonstrated the difficulty of attempting to maintain the White PaperCounter-Inflation Policy with no sanctions in the private sector andcash limits in the public sector.    This inevitably would lead to ageneral sense of unfairness.    It would become increasingly difficult torestrict the size of settlements in the private sector following thesuccess of the tanker drivers and now of the road haulage men. Thealternatives were to continue the attempt to concain the problem andlimit damage, or to wait until the Government was forced to take sternmeasures by soaring inflation.    If the latter course was rejected itwould mean keeping the situation under almost daily review.    It mightrequire the co-operation of ACAS to accelerate a solution in the roadhaulage industry, so that the Government could then turn its attention tothe local authority and related claims.     It might be necessary to beflexible over local authorities and the water industry, where there was ahigh proportion of low-paid workers.    The only alternative to this case-by-case approach was to seek a fresh general agreement with the tradeunions.    The TUC leadership was in disarray, and it was doubtfulwhether they could in practice implement any promises they made.Even the TGWU, which has been in the forefront of attacking theGovernmenfs pay policy in the last round, had now lost control of itslocal branches.    However, many in the TUC were shaken by the eventsof the last few weeks and would be receptive to a freuh approach. Manyof the Governmenfs present problems stemmed from the breakdown inrelations between the unions and the Labour Party.    Trade union powerhad been a force for good in the past, and means must be found ofallowing it to play this part again.    However, the tendency to strikeearly in support of industrial disputes was spreadingj after a period ofcomparative calm, and it was worth considering whether the balance hadswung too far in favour of the unions.    Britain probably had the mostgenerous social security provisions for strikers of any country, andhad abandoned any attempt to restrict the right to strike in key services.But so many groups had now demonstrated their ability to threaten thelife of the nation that any such ban, to be effective, would have to covera very large number of occupations.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations(EY(P)) had agreed on proposals for the development of permanentcomparability machinery, and for a further concession to help the low-paid.    Both these adjustments would help with the impending publicservice claims, though they were also of wider application andsignificance.    On comparability, the Sub-Committee agreed that theGovernment should in due course establish permanent machinery whichwould allow comparisons to be made between public service pay andsuitable outside analogues, whether by direct job comparisons, factorialstudies which allowed comparison of particular elements in broadlysimilar jobs, the identification of &quot;peer groups&quot; with whom the pay ofparticular groups might be linked, or as a last resort by establishing arelationship with average earnings.    Such comparisons would requirean extension of the Civil Service Pay Research Unit to undertake thenecessary fact-finding, and of a supervisory board developed from thepresent Office of Manpower Economics (OME), perhaps with cross-representation from the existing review bodies, to decide on theappropriate comparators.    As a first step, a feasibility study of thiskind would be offered to the four public service groups:  local authoritymanual workers, National Health Service (NHS) ancillaries, ambulance-men and university technicians.    In due course, similar treatmentmight be given to the water industry manual workers and to nurses.It would be important to avoid indexation, the fourth of the types ofcomparability he had listed.    The unions did not want it excluded bythe terms of reference of the inquiry for the four public service groups,but it might be possible to explain to the body undertaking the inquiryhow the Government approached the problem.    On low pay, EY(P) hadagreed that the 5 per cent policy should be &quot;underpinned&quot; by a minimum 3. 50 increase, applicable in public and private sectors.    In the privatesector, not all employers could afford to pay this, and it would not bean entitlement.    In the public sector, the Government would in practicehave to allow it in all cases.    A significant majority of EY(P) hadfavoured a figure of  3. 50 rather than the original proposal of  3. 00.In discussion there was general support for the proposal to make afurther concession to benefit the low-paid.    It was clear that this wouldbe a general modification of existing pay policy, applicable to public andprivate sectors alike.    It would accordingly need to oe publicisedwidely, and not limited to the four groups with whom it was currentlybeing discussed.     There   was a case for discussing it with the TUCbefore introducing this element into detailed negotiations.    It might bea mistake to announce it in Parliament until the trade unions had beenproperly consulted.     On the other hand, it was argued that if theconcession was to have the desired effect in the public service cases, itwas necessary to move fast.    A tentative suggestion had already beenmade with the authority of Ministers, although no figures had yet beenquoted.    There was no guarantee that the General Council would accept4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALa proposal of this kind, and they had been divided on previousoccasions.    Moreover if no figure had been announced beforediscussion with the TUC they would seek to bargain for a higherfigure.    The initiative should therefore come from the Government.The right course might be to announce the change in general termsduring the debate next day, and to return to the matter after a detailedproposition had been worked out with the public service unions. EY(P)had agreed that the concession should be applied flflxibly in particularcases, although it3 benefits should be confined to the low-paid groupswhom it was designed to help.    There might however be problems insome areas, for instance with the locomotive men, who were concernedto preserve rather than to narrow differentials.    The Governmentwould have to make it clear that it could allow no &quot;knock on&quot; effects.The cost of the  3. 50 concession was considerably greater than that ofthe  3. 00, but would still only add about 0. 2 per cent to the annual wagebill.    Since it represented a change in general Government policy, itwould be necessary for the Government to adjust cash limits and theRate Support Grant accordingly.In further discussion it was argued that the use of secondary picketinghad now become a serious problem.    Ever since the National Union ofMineworkers flying pickets in the 1974 dispute, it had increasinglybecome the practice to involve unions and employees not directlyconcerned in a strike.    In some situations this had become a seriousthreat to law and order, and the Opposition wottld present it in thislight.    Where it took the form of a threat to withhold a man&apos;s unioncard, secondary picketing amounted to a threat to his livelihood, andthus intimidation, and was an extremely effective weapon in the hands ofstrikers.    The situation had changed since the time of the DonovanRoyal Commission, and there was now a strong argument for reviewingthe law on picketing or seeking an agreed Code of Practice. TheGovernment had already conceded that secondary picketing was wrongby seeking to limit it by voluntary means.    The present state of the lawwas obscure.    The Trade Union and Labour Relations Act had notmaterially changed the position (though it had restricted the right topicket a man&apos;s home).    Picketing was legal provided it was peacefuland in pursuit of a trade dispute.    But the definition of a &quot;trededispute&quot; was already being restricted by the courts and neededclarification.    Nor was it clear what constituted &quot;peaceful picketing&quot;.The Government&apos;s consultative document issued in October hadsuggested ways in which the right of picketing could be reconciled withother rights.    But it was an extremely complicated problem, and theGovernment should not enter into a premature commitment to legislate.The issues should be considered more carefully by the Ministers mostdirectly concerned.    But this must be done quickly if the Governmentwas to make its position clear before the Election campaign began.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnissionIn continued discussion it was reported that EY(P) had approvedproposals to strengthen the Price Commission and to modify the&quot;safeguards&quot; provisions of the present legislation.    The Press hadcarried reports of the Governments intentions, and there were nowsigns that some companies were trying to beat the lirnits by submittingvery early proposals for price increases to the Price Commission.It was therefore desirable that an early announcement should be made,and that when a fresh safeguard Order could be introduced intoParliament, following consultation, the changes should be maderetrospectively to the date of the Governments announcement.    It wasunlikely that these changes would do much, except in the very shortterm, to moderate increases in prices, but it would be an importantpart of the Governments programme to demonstrate that it was doingwhat it could in this direction.    There was a separate problem overthe recent report of the Price Commission about prices in the roadhaulage industry, which might be re-examined by Cabinet later in theweek when the position in the present strike became clearer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the position in the various existing and threatenedindustrial disputes.    They agreed that there was no operational needfor a State of Emergency at this stage.    The Home Secretary shouldexplain this, drawing a distinction between the tanker drivers&apos; disputeand the present road haulage dispute, in his statement to the Housethat afternoon.    In the debate the following day, he would open forthe Government.    He would first emphasise that the Government stillbelieved in a continuing counter-inflation policy and did not intend toabandon the main features of its White Paper.    Secondly he wouldannounce the Governments intention to legislate to strengthen the powersof the Price Commission and to modify the safeguards on the linesproposed by the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection.He would say that the changes in the safeguards would take effect fromthe date of the announcement.    Third, he would say that the Governmentwas ready to modify the general policy on the low-paid.    It might bepracticable not to go into too much detail about this, but the Cabinetaccepted the  3. 50 underpinning figure and had given him discretion toannounce or withhold the figure as developments, including the course ofthe public service negotiations, required.    He would say fourthly thatthe Government was ready to respond, if it were the wish of both sidesin a dispute in the public sector, by providing Uric facilities for paycomparisons to be made on the lines of the Civil Service Pay ResearchUnit.    Finally, on secondary picketing, -he would say that theGovernment had issued a consultative document, and now proposed tobegin talks about a voluntary Code of Practice.    These five features ofhis speech could be seen as a determined attempt to rebuild theGovernments policy after the damage which had been done by theCommons vote to end sanctions.    The Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection should make all the necessary preparations for6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe proposed legislation on the Price Commission, on the lines ofoption b. in his paper to EY(P).    He would arrange for a small groupof Ministers to consider the problems of secondary picketing and theresponse to the Government&apos;s consultative document on the subject.The Secretary of State for Employment, in consultation with theSecretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary of State forSocial Services, should continue -he negotiations with both sides in thelocal authorities and Health Service and ambulancemen disputes, to seewhether they could be persuaded to make a joint approach to theGovernment about the comparability exercise.    This could be extendedto cover university technicians if employers and unions wished. Ifpressed on the point, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, could explain inpresenting the Public Expenditure White Paper later in the week thatthe Government would adjust cash limits to take account of underpinningfor the low-paid but was not prepared to underwrite pay settlementsoutside pay policy as modified.    The Cabinet would resume itsdiscussion of the road haulage dispute, and the possibility of an Orderto limit prices in the industry, at its meeting on Thursday.    He wouldarrange for a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party to be held onWednesday following the debate.    He would also arrange to tell theGeneral Secretary of the TUC about the main lines of the Governmentsannouncement before the debate.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office15 January 19797CONFIDENTIAL
