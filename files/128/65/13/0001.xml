The Cabinet learned with deep regret that Sir Richard Sykes,tlASSADOR the British Ambassador at The Hague, and a servant accompanyingrHE HAGUE        him had been shot earlier that morning.    Both had since died oftheir wounds.    There was as yet no information about theorganisation or persons who might be responsible.OJAMENTARYAIRS2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.    It was noted thatif the Official Opposition tabled a motion of censure it wouldprobably be debated on Wednesday, 28 March.lolutioniousIjrence:79) 12thelusions,ute 4The Cabinet considered the text of the statement which the PrimeMinister proposed to make in the House of Commons that afternoon.In discussion it was pointed out that the Scottish National Party (SNP)and other Members would press the Prime Minister for a firm dateon which the Orders to repeal the Scotland and Wales Acts would bedebated.    The SNP had demanded a firm date and if that weregiven, it might influence their Members to vote with theGovernment and also avoid suggestions which might otherwise bemade about the ambiguity of the Government&apos;s intentions.    On theother hand, it was argued that the draft statement was firm instating the Government&apos;s intention to bring discussions with otherParties to a conclusion by the end of April at the latest and, aftertheir conclusion, to bring the issue to a decision.    A commitmentto a precise date for a debate on the Orders would limit theGovernments room for manoeuvre, for example if the discussionswere to have a successful outcome, and it might also be counter-productive if SNP Members considered the interval to be too long.The SNP were unpredictable and not necessarily united. TheGovernment also needed to take account of the attitude of theLabour Party and of the country as a whole.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould make a statement in the House of Commons in the terms of thedraft which had been circulated, subject to certain amendmentswhich had been suggested in discussion.    He would also speak ontelevision that evening.    In reply to supplementary Questions aboutthe date for a debate, he would say that a date would be discussedin the normal way through the usual channels following the conclusionof the bilateral talks.    How soon they would conclude, within thetime limit set for them, could not at this stage be predicted.    It wouldbe for the SNP to judge their position in the light of his statement; butif they chose to precipitate an election the Government would have astrong position on which to take their stand.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.(JTINGENCYiERVE 1979-80iri ouserence:(79) 10thiclusions,ite 7 and(79) 12thicluoions,ate 63. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(79) 23), on the Contingency Reserve for 1979-80,THE CHIEF SECRETARY said that, as the Cabinet already knewthe Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering the possibility ofcutting the 1979-80 Contingency Reserve as one means of containingthe Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR).    Since then anexamination of the alternatives had convinced him that this was asensible course to follow.    He accordingly proposed that theContingency Reserve for 1979-80 should be reduced from  800 millionto  500 million.    Although this might appear to be an easy option itwould in fact significantly reduce the scope for meeting unexpectedfuture needs without also finding offsetting reductions in expenditure.It was relevant that, of the  500 million remaining in the ContingencyReserve nearly  200 million was already committed to upratingsocial security benefits and child benefits as decided by the Cabinetin the previous week.    If subsequently Ministers wished to repeatthe Christmas Bonus and Winter Fuel Schemes, about a further 150 million of the Reserve would be absorbed.    Decisions by theMinisterial Committee on European Questions (CQM) the previous dayon butter subsidies would account for up to a further  18 million.If his proposal were to be accepted it would be essential for hiscolleagues to understand that the scope for future claims on theContingency Reserve without offsetting savings elsewhere would bevery restricted.    It would also be necessary to hold strictly to thedecision of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY) theprevious week that the financing requirements of the nationalisedindustries should be contained within the provision in the recentPublic Expenditure White Paper;  and that the cash limits were setin accordance with the proposals he had circulated to his Ministerialcolleagues on that Committee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that whilst heaccepted the proposal of the Chief Secretary, Treasury in relationto the Contingency Reserve, he did not agree that the decision by theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy the previous weekrequired that he should be committed to further increases in bus andrail fares in the autumn; it might be possible to secure the samereduction in borrowing by other means.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the ChiefSecretary&apos;s proposals were less objectionable than any of thealternatives.    Some contribution to achieving the PSBR target hadbeen made the previous week by the decisions to limit social securitybenefits.    He did not judge it desirable to do more.    It was wrongto underestimate the severe cut in take home pay for men whichwould result from the withdrawal of child tax allowances. Thatsomeone else in the family would be receiving increased childbenefit would not wholly convince wage earners that they were notsuffering a real loss.In discussion there was general support for the Chief Secretary&apos;sproposal, but it was argued that the remaining Contingency Reservewould leave an extremely small margin, especially when added tothe constraining effects of the Cabinetis earlier decisions on cashlimits.    However the Treasury were prepared to be flexible aboutvirement between different elements of a department&apos;s programme.There would also need to be flexibility to cope with unavoidabletransfers of expenditure from the present financial year to the nextdue to the current industrial action in the Civil Service.    The realproblem was whether the Reserve would be sufficient for thoseinevitable additional expenditures which could not at present beforeseen, for example to support British Shipbiilders whose financialsituation was critical and where many jobs were at stake. TheNational Enterprise Board too might have difficulty in financinga major new initiative which it was planning without selling off someof its existing investments.    There were however small contingencyprovisions within existing departmental programmes which wouldassist to some extent.    Nevertheless the unavoidable implicationof accepting the Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal would be that Ministersfaced with unexpected additional expenditure would have to reconsidertheir priorities in order to contain it within their existingprogrammes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposal by the Chief Secretary, Treasurythat the 1979-80 Contingency Reserve should be reduced from 800 million at 1978 Survey prices to  500 million.    They alsorecognised that expenditures already committed and in prospectwould leave only a small margin in the Contingency Fund. Theywere, however, prepared to accept this situation, and itsimplications, and endorsed the assumptions on which the ChiefSecretary&apos;s proposal had been formulated.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theChief Secretary, Treasury and other Ministersto be guided accordingly.3CONFIDENTIAL

An early decision was needed in order to allow the LordPrivy Seal to make an offer at a negotiating meeting on Monday,26 March.    The due settlement date was 1 April.    The Governmentcould be criticised if they had not made a negotiating offer by thisdate, just as the Civil Service unions had been rightly criticised fortaking industrial action before the negotiations had begun. TheSub-Committee had found difficulty with a number of points. Theywere not convinced that the evidence produced by the Pay ResearchUnit (PRU) on the rates which should be paid was wholly acceptable.Among other doubts they did not believe sufficient account was beingtaken of the value of such elements as job security and the CivilService pension rights.    The Sub-Committee had divided equallyon the question of whether the value of these elements should bereferred to arbitration.    Subject to this point however they did notthink it right to seek to change the rules of the game in the middleof the operation so that the generality of the PRU evidence wouldhave to be taken as a basis for negotiation.    The Sub-Committeehad also failed to agree on the size of the initial payment to be madeon 1 April 1979.    The Lord Privy Seal wished to offer up to 9 per centin negotiation; the Sub-Committee thought that the initial offershould be 6 or 7 per cent with a negotiating ceiling of 8 per cent.SECRET
SECRETThe Sub-Committee had also had particular difficulty in arriving ata view on the appropriate staging of payments beyond 1 April 1979.Certain assurances had already been given to the unions and toParliament to which the Government might be held to be committed.Nevertheless, a majority of the Sub-Committee believed that stagingshould be extended beyond the terminal date of 1 April 1980 proposedby the Lord Privy Seal.    Otherwise, they thought, the Civil Serviceunions would be put in a specially privileged position compared withthe rest of the public sector.    In their view, this would lead to verylarge payments, of 25 per cent or more, being made to all publicservice groups during 1979-80, greatly weakening the Government&apos;sposition in their fight against inflation.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that industrial action had already begunand would spread rapidly if the Government could not make anacceptable offer in the following week.    Ministers had decided in1977 to reactivate PRU.    They now had little choice but to live withthe evidence it produced.    In his view, it was necessary to make agenerous initial offer, and to promise to complete staging no laterthan 1 April 1980, with an interim stage in October 1979, if there wasto be any hope of avoiding serious industrial action.    It would be amistake for the Government to go to arbitration on issues, such asjob security and pension rights, on which it might well lose. Butthese might form the basis of a more general reference to theStanding Commission on Comparability at a later stage, outsidethe context of the present pay negotiations.In discussion, there was general agreement that the Governmentwould have to negotiate on the basis of the evidence produced by thePRU.    While Ministers might be dissatisfied with this evidence, asthey had been with some of the findings of the Pay Review Bodies inthe previous year, it was not easy to go back on commitments oncegiven.    The evidence indicated an average increase in pay for thenon-industrial Civil Service up to Assistant Secretary of about25 per cent, but this average covered a wide range of individualrates.    For security reasons it was important not to quote individualfigures which might prejudice negotiations.    There was also generalagreement that the pressure could be taken off negotiations if it weremade clear to the unions that the initial payment would be back-datedto 1 April 1979, in line with normal Whitley procedures, even thoughnegotiations might have to continue after that date.In discussion of staging, it was argued that the teachers, anotherkey group, might have been prepared to accept a longer period ofstaging, with stage payments in January 1980 and August 1980, oreven January 1981, covering a longer period than the local authoritymanual group for whom special treatment had been conceded. Butthere was no hope of securing this if the Civil Service completed the2SECRET
SECRETprocess within a year.    The teachers would then almost certainlywish to go to arbitration in line with Burnham procedures. Thiswould establish a new pattern of high and early settlements in thepublic services.    It would add greatly to inflationary pressure.But the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposal for the Civil Service was equallyquestionable.    It involved three payments in just over 12 months.It was important to try to get back to an annual pattern ofsettlements.    In any case, the Government were now publiclycommitted to completing the process of implementation by1 April 1980.    The new rates based on PRU could be introduced inequal stages on 1 April 1979 and 1 April 1980, the first twosettlement dates after the completion of the PRU survey. Thiswould be in line with the treatment given to the police and fireservices.    A firm promise had been given to base the 1979 settlementupon PRU, as part of the price of a guidelines settlement in 1978.The process of pay research had been completed before the1 April 1979 settlement date.    A similar pattern could be adoptedfor other public service groups.    This would preserve the specialtreatment given to the local authority manual workers and relatedlow-paid groups who were being given a payment in advance ofcomparability studies, together with a payment on account, althoughthe full results of comparability would be staged in over 16 months.However, if this pattern were adopted for the Civil Service, theteachers and other public sector groups would certainly want tofollow.    The total result would be a formidable increase in theoverall level of settlements in the public sector.    Assuming thatthe Civil Service settlement had to be completed by 1 April 1980, itmight be necessary to concede some form of interim staging,perhaps on a differential basis to favour the low paid, as the priceof an early settlement.    The destructive effect of industrial actionin the Civil Service should not be disregarded.    The resultingpattern would not be wholly rational, but the practice of staging hadgrown up in response to various pressures in the last pay round andthe present one.    It was too late to devise a new and internallyconsistent pay policy for the public sector in the present pay round.It was however important that no commitments should be given aboutthe implementation of the next PRU survey in April 1980.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the PRU evidence must be accepted as the basisof negotiation of pay increases for Civil Service grades up to Principal.The pay of PRU grades above Principal could be dealt with when theexpected report from the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) was tohand.    The Cabinet ruled out any appeal by the Government toarbitration, while noting that the questions of job security andindex-linking could be the subject of a general reference to theStanding Commission on Comparability once the present Civil Service3SECRET
SECRETnegotiations were over.    The Civil Service unions could be givenan assurance that whatever initial payments were agreed innegotiation would be back-dated to 1 April 1979.    The Lord PrivySeal, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Prices andConsumer Protection, should open negotiations with the unionsearly the following week with an initial offer of 7 per cent for allgrades up to Principal payable from 1 April 1979, leaving theremainder of the new rates as agreed in negotiation to be paid on1 April 1980.    The negotiating Ministers had discretion to concedea higher initial payment, up to 9 per cent, if this proved necessarythough they should not go above thi s and should only move to it insteps and under pressure.    They also had discretion to agree tointerim staging for the lower-paid grades, if this seemed necessaryin the interests of a settlement although the Cabinet would preferto avoid interim staging if possible.    The settlement should applyto controlled fringe bodies as proposed by the Lord Privy Seal. Theremaining proposals in paragraphs of CP(79) 25 were left to thediscretion of the negotiating Ministers to deploy as necessary. Nocommitment should be given about the implementation of the 1979PRU survey in April 1980.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion and invited theLord Privy Seal and the Secretary of State forPrices and Consumer Protection to be guidedaccordingly.Cabinet Office22 March 19794SECRET

The critical issue of stagingcomparability payments would need to be considered in the light ofthe Cabinefs decisions earlier in the meeting on the pay of the CivilService.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that since the EY(P) decisions theScottish negotiating committee had met on 19 March. Notwithstandingthe decisions of Ministers, the local authority employers hadimmediately made an offer of 8 per cent, which had however beenrejected.    The English and Welsh employers had made acorresponding offer of 7 per cent, in line with Ministerial decisions,at their meeting on 21 March.    This had been raised in negotiationto 8 per cent.    But this too had been rejected.    No decision had beentaken on the question of a reference to the Standing Commission onComparability.    The local authority employers had been told that theGovernment would be prepared to finance its share of the cost of asettlement up to 8 per cent, but no higher.    No promises had beenmade about Government financial support for the results of anycomparability study.    The Cabinet1 s earlier decision on Civil Servicepay meant that her previous proposals on staging as reported inCP(79) 26 were no longer tenable.    In her view it was inevitable thatthe teachers should be offered the same staging pattern as the CivilService.1SECRET
SECRETIn discussion, it was argued that there was no need to assume thatthe teachers should receive comparability payments on the samedates as the Civil Service.    It could be held that equal treatmentrequired payment of any comparability settlement with the teacherson the two annual pay dates following the completion of thecomparability study.    It would in any case be difficult to come to afinal view until the results of the negotiations with the Civil Servicewere known.In farther discussion, it was suggested that the Government held thefinal card in negotiations with the teachers through its right ofdecision on the Rate Support Grant (RSG).    The Government, forexample, could always refuse to finance its chare of any arbitrationaward.    This would deter the teachers from pressing their rightunilaterally to go to arbitration under the Burnham procedures andgave the Government a measure of control over the offers which thelocal authority employers would make about the implementation ofthe findings of a comparability study.    Against this it was arguedthat such a refusal would be wholly unprecedented and out of linewith the Governments previous policy as well as greatly unfair tothe teaching profession.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said theCabinet agreed that no final decisions could be taken on teachers&apos;pay until after the Civil Service negotiations on 26 March. TheSecretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, should make fresh proposals to himafter that meeting, and he would arrange for further Ministerialdiscussion at that stage.    Meanwhile, the Cabinet had taken nodecision on RSG to support teachers&apos; pay beyond endorsing the offerto support an 8 per cent initial offer already agreed in EY(P). Itwas important that no further assurance, or hint, of further RSGsupport should be given until Ministers had considered the matterfurther.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister andinvited the Secretary of State for Education andScience and Paymaster General and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office23 March T?792SECRET

DEVOLUTION:    DRAFT STATEMENTWith permission, Mr. Speaker,  I will make a Statementabout the Government&apos;s proposals for further action&quot; on&apos;devolution to Scotland and Wales following the referendums &quot;which were held on 1 March. ..tI would remind the House that it is now almost ten yearssince the Royal Commission on the Constitution was appointedat a time when there was obvious discontent with the workingsof Government in Scotland and Wales.    For a decade possible -changes in the system of Government have been intenselydebated, not only in this House - where all parties have beenconcerned to put forward their own suggestions - but also inScotland and Wales.Parliament was engaged for almost two years in theconsideration of the detailed legislative schemes the Govern-ment proposed for devolution and, after change and amendment,these schemes were approved in the Scotland and the Wales ActsAs this House proposed, referendums were then held sothat the Scottish and Welsh people could vote on whether theywanted the Acts to be implemented.    The results of thosereferendums are now known.    They are advisory to Parliament,and it will be for Parliament to decide whether devolution tis to be given to Scotland and Wales./    In the light
In the light of the results of the refer en durns, theSecretaries of State for Scotland and Wales are today layingdraft Orders, as they are required to do by Section 85(2) ofthe Scotland Act and Section 80(2) of the Wales Act.Whatever view night now be taken on the decisions to bereached,  there can be no doubt that the public concern inScotland and Wales for a form of Government which is closer tothe people still persists.    The debate will continue..8t:I believe that all reasonable opinion would think it :right that the Government and other parties represented in thisHouse should not, without further reflection,  rush to finalconclusions on so critical a matter.In Scotland,  a majority of the votes cast in the referendumwas for the implementation of the Act.    In the light of thatvote, we are ready to consider carefully modifications whichnight now be proposed to the scheme of devolution in theScotland Act and ready, too, to consider no less carefullyany other proposals which might be put to us.    We would aimto explore whether a basis exists for the establishment of anall-party conference of some kind to consider these matters.The&quot; Government is therefore proposing to approach otherparties in the House urgently to discuss, in the light of thelong search for acceptable and workable changes in the systemof Government in Scotland and the outcome of the referendum,/ whether
whether a measure of agreement might not be found toprovide for the better Government.of. Scotland.    It seemsappropriate to the Government that these discussions shouldbe concluded- by the end of April.As for Wales, the Government accepts that the decisivevote in the referendum means that the Wales Act must berepealed.    We shall therefore recommend that Parliamentshould approve the draft Order.    But changes can clearly becontemplated which might better reflect the wishes of theWelsh people.    We shall therefore also be approaching otherparties to consider whether an agreed approach can be madefor Wales.I would urge the House to reflect carefully on thesituation we have reached on devolution and on the proposalsI am now making.    A too hasty reaction or an attempt toignore the strength of feeling which has been expressed andto set aside the long debate on devolution which s^till con-tinues, could do great damage to the United Kingdom as awhole.
