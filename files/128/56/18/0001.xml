1. THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at the meeting of theCabinet on 25 March there had been a firm consensus in favour of holding the referendum as early as possible in June - if possible onThursday 5 June.    This choice of date would have important political advantages:  it would shorten the campaign and mean that fewer people would be on holiday (thus reducing the pressure for postal voting).He recognised, however, that there were problems about a date as early as 5 June in Scotland because the new regional authorities there,which would be responsible for the local conduct of the poll, would only be taking office on 16 May,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that hitherto had discussions with the regional authorities in Scotland had been on thebasis that the referendum would not be held before 19 June,    Three ofthem - Borders, Tayside and particularly the Highland Authority - had expressed serious doubts, because of staffing problems, about their ability to conduct the referendum even on 19 June, though that date should be manageable.    The doubts and difficulties would be all thegreater if an earlier date were proposed,    A referendum on 5 Junewould leave only 13 working days after the local government reorganisation came into effect.In discussion it was suggested that, the Scottish problem apart, there could be some advantage in holding the referendum on 19 June.    Thiswould leave a longer interval after the Spring Bank Holiday; and itmight prove fairer so far as the campaigning organisations were concerned.    Against this it was argued that a date later than 5 Junewould cause problems at least equal to those in Scotland, notably inrespect of people on holiday; for example, 12 June would clash withminers1 holidays in some areas, and by 19 June the school holidays in glasgow would have started.    The Committee and remaining Stages ofthe Referendum Bill would be taken in the House of Commons on22 and 23 April (with the possibility of a third day on 24 April).Subject to that, the Bill would be introduced in the House of Lords on23 April in the expectation that Royal Assent wouldbe obtained by8 May.    This would leave time for the Referendum Order in Councilto be made immediately after its approval by both Houses ofParliament early in the following week.    Thus, unless someunexpected hitch occurred, the Parliamentary timetable should beachieved in time to hold the referendum on 5 June.In further discussion there was strong support for the view that, whilethe Scottish problem was a very real one, the difficulties might be largely confined to certain parts of Scotland and every effort should bemade to find a solution compatible with a referendum date of 5 June.With this in mind, the new regional authorities in Scotland might beable to enlist the help of the staff of the existing local authorities, thenew district councils and the sheriff clerk service, appropriately1
experienced local government officers who had recently retired or would be doing so on the reorganisation of 16 May and, possibly,civil servants in the Scottish Office itself.    Sir Philip Allen, theCounting Officer designate for the referendum^should be asked to examine urgently on the spot thenature of the problems in Scotland and the kind of help that could mostusefully be given to the regional authorities in order to enable them tomeet the date of 5 June,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, in moving the Second P.eading of the Referendum Bill on 10 April, theLord President of the Council should indicate that it was theGovernments intention that (subject to Parliamentary approval) the referendum should be held on 5 June,    He should, however, add thatthis date was dependent both on securing Royal Assent to the Bill by8 May and on a satisfactory solution being found to the Scottishproblem.    To this end the Home Secretary, in consultation with theLord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for Scotland,should arrange for Sir Philip Allen to make an urgent report on theextent of the difficulties and means of overcoming them.    If, after allowing for any special measures that might be taken, the three ministers judged that the Scottish problem made it impossible to conduct the referendum satisfactorily before 19 June, the HomeSecretary should report to the Cabinet in the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister !summing up of their discussion.2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the arrangements relating tothe conduct of Ministers on the referendum issue had got off to a reasonably good start.    In accordance with the Cabinet discussion on25 March, the guidelines which he had issued (C(P)(75) 1) precludedMinisters who differed from the Governments recommendation fromspeaking in the current debate in the House of Commons on therecommendation.    The Cabinet had not however discussed whetherdissenting Ministers should be free to vote at the end of the debateagainst the Government Motion.    The Whip issued to the Parliamen-tary Labour Party had indicated that there would be a free vote on the motion, but it had been represented to him that Ministers whodiffered from the Governments recommendation should not vote against the Motion, but should abstain.    Given the number ofdissenting Ministers it could raise serious constitutional issues ifthey all voted against the Government Motion, and it was arguable thatthe free vote should not apply to Ministers.    He would welcome theviews of the Cabinet on the matter.In discussion the general view of the Cabinet was strongly in favour of allowing Ministers a free vote in the debate;  there had been an assumption that this would happen, whichever way the Governmentsrecommendation had gone.    The result of the vote would be freely usedin the referendum campaign as an indication of the view of the Houseof Commons, and a false picture would be given to the country if ministers were unable to vote according to their convictions.    those ministers who were known to intend to vote against membership in the referendum would find it difficult to explain in their constituencies a failure to vote in the same sense in the House of Commons.    The deepdivisions on this issue, between Ministers and within the LabourParty, were well known, and a free vote would not itself significantlyincrease the embarrassment they caused.    After the referendumhowever the Labour Party could be expected to coalesce again, and theverdict of the electorate should then be accepted by the Government.Moreover if a free vote in the present debate was not extended to ministers, there would be the strongest objections, at all levels of theGovernment and among backbenchers, resulting in a number of rebelsin the Lobby and in animosity and dissension on a scale which the&quot;agreement to differ&quot; was designed to avoid.    The three-line Whip,Imposed on Labour Members in the debate on Community membershipin October 1971, had caused considerable bitterness, even though no formal action had been taken against those who had not obeyed it.    If a free vote were allowed on the present occasion, some Ministersoutside the Cabinet who were unable to support the Governmentsrecommendation might feel in the event that abstention was theappropriate course; the decision to vote against was not one theyshould take lightly.3
In further discussion it was suggested that, as a modification of theguidelines, one or two Ministers who could reflect their experience ofthe European Community while in office should be free to speak in thepresent debate against the Governments recommendation, but theCabinet confirmed their earlier view that this would be entirelyinappropriate.    Although the National Executive Committee of theLabour Party had decided that both sides of the argument should be putfrom the platform to the special conference of the Labour Party, thiswas not a true parallel for the Governments position in the House ofCommons, where Ministers should speak only in accordance with government policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,   said that itmight have been preferable if the question of voting by Ministers hadbeen considered by the Cabinet at the time of their decision on the&quot;agreement to differ&quot;, when the nature of the Governmentsrecommendation was not known.    Nevertheless, the general view ofthe Cabinet was that Ministers should have a free vote at the end ofthe current debate.    There should be no change in the guideline that ministers should not speak in Parliament except in support of theGovernment5s recommendation.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office8 April 19754
