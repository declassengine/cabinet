1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were informed that, following their discussion on23 January, there had been informal talks with Governmentbackbench supporters who had voted during the Committee stage of the Social Security Benefits Bill for amendments dealing with the earnings limit and with the payment of non-contributory invaliditypensions (NCIP) to disabled housewives.    It had now been agreedthat the Government would not at Report Stage seek to securedeletion of the amendment providing for NCIP to be payable to disabled housewives at the same rate as the main NCIP.    despite this, it was not certain that the Government would be successful in securing deletion of the amendments dealing with the earnings limit,though every effort was being, and would continue to be, made tosecure a satisfactory outcome.    The steps to be taken should itprove impossible to secure deletion of the amendment would be amatter for later consideration; it would be important that theyshould be such as to minimise any impression that the Governmentwere in the last resort prepared in a matter of this importance toallow themselves to be ruled by the wishes of a small group of theirbackbench supporters.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, TREASURY pointed out thatin the following week there would be a number of debates, as recommended by the Scrutiny Committee, on European economic community (e.c.) documents.    As a matter of Party managementhe could not continually whip late at night Ministers and other loyalsupporters of the Government to vote against fellow Party members.Ministers in charge of these items of business should therefore seek to reach accommodation with those Government backbenchers whowere likely to object to the proposals, in an attempt to avoid votestaking place.In discussion it was reported that a new procedure was being introduced whereby any policy   issues raised by a forthcoming debate on an e.c. document would be considered by the ministerial committee on European Questions (EQ) and the Parliamentaryhandling of the debates would, in accordance with normal practice,be considered at Legislation Committee (LG).    It was pointed outthat on occasions when Ministers had tried to be conciliatory, theyhad met with no response from opponents to the e.c. proposals.    Inthe forthcoming debate on the draft directives relating to freedomof establishment of doctors and dentists it was hoped that an
accommodation would be reached with the critics, but at theexpense of the Government adopting a position which was to come degree inconsistent with the attitude it had previously expressedin the House of Lords and in the e.c. Council of Ministers.    the opponents to Government motions on these documents formed a smallelement in the Party who were using the occasion to express theirfundamental opposition to Britain&apos;s membership of the e.c..    there could be no hope of satisfying them.    However, a small minorityshould not be allowed to dictate Government policy, and theGovernment should maintain its authority.It was suggested that some of the debates in the House had beenunnecessary.    However, the Government had decided to let theHouse have its head on this matter, in the expectation that it wouldbe reasonable.    If experience showed that it was not prepared to be reasonable, the whole arrangement  would need to be reconsidered.It was also pointed out that on occasions the issues involved were more fundamental than those of Parliamentary handling.    Anannouncement would have to be made shortly on steel closures,which would bring up the limitations which the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community placed on Parliamentssovereignty over investment in the private steel industry.    this issue formed one of our renegotiation aims as set out in the february manifesto, and should be pursued accordingly.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that ministers should try to keep their relations with Governmentbackbenchers on these issues as smooth as possible, though ofcourse keeping within the collective decisions of EQ and LG.    Thewhole procedure for Parliamentary debate on e.c. documents might need to be reviewed in the light of the forthcoming report of theSelect Committee on Procedure.The Cabinet -Took note.
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY raidthat Mr Ian Smith had rejected his proposal to send representatives to Salisbury for confidential discussions with Mr Smith himself andwith the African National Council.    He was keeping the Africanleaders informed and the Press would also be told.    He intended to treat the matter in a low key.    It was clear that a wide gapremained to be bridged and there could be no question of calling a constitutional conference at this stage.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theTurkish Cypriot refugees had now been moved from our sovereignterritory in Cyprus and, as we had expected, the TurkishGovernment had started to transfer them from Turkey to thenorthern part of Cyprus.    Our decision had inevitably embarrassedour relations with the Governments of Greece and Cyprus;  theTurkish Government had so far failed to respond to our urging, andto pressure from the United States, to make a concession helpful tothe Greek Cypriots.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad decided it would be timely to take up a standing invitation fromthe Portuguese Foreign Minister, Dr Soares, and he would pay a visit to Portugal the following week.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.3
3o The Cabinet considered a note by the Home Secretary(C(75) 14) on the British Broadcasting Corporation^ (BBC) licence fee.    They also had before them a minute dated 27 January fromthe Home Secretary tc the Prime Minister on the same subject.THE HOME SECRETARY said that at their meeting the previous day the Broadcasting Committee had reached a substantial measure ofagreement.    The BBC had represented that in order to cover theirdeficit and the estimated costs of maintaining services at theirpresent levels over the next 4 years they would require the licenc3fee to be increased from  7 to  9 for black and white television and from  12 to  18 for colour.    The BBC had behavedirresponsibly over its last pay settlement but, following discussionshe had had with the Chairman, machinery had been set up whichshould prevent any repetition;  and the Committee did not think thatthe consumer should be penalised for that act of. bad judgment on thepart of the BBC.    He had also spoken to the Chairman aboutextravagance, although it was fair to say that the BBCs costscompared favourably with those of their independent and foreign competitors.    In the present economic circumstances it was desirable to encourage austerity by some limitation of income,and to give the BBC a rather smaller increase in fees than they had sought.    Whereas his paper to the Broadcasting Committee had proposed a fee of  8.50 for black and white and  17 for colour, theCommittee had on balance preferred a fee of  8 and  18.    Thiswould be slightly more generous to the BBC, especially in the latex-years as the proportion of colour sets increased; and it would bedesirable to jome extent to favour the users of black and whitetelevision, amongst whom were many from the poorer sections ofthe community.    He had considered whether to go further by loadingall the increase on to the licence for colour, but this would meanputting it up to  20, an increase of 67 per cent since 1971 which itwould be hard to defend;  moreover the division between the users of colour and of black and white television did not correspond at allexactly with that between rich and poor.    The BBC were hoping foran increase that would last for the next 3 years.    In his view itwould be a mistake to specify how long the increase should last.It might well be less than 3 years, especially as the BBCs estimates of future inflation probably erred on the side of optimism.    It was desirable that the new rates should run for at least two years, untilthe Annan Committee of Enquiry on the Future of Broadcastingreported, but it would be for the BBC to make a case to theGovernment if they found themselves in serious financial difficulties.It would be impossible at this stage to make a long term settlementexcept at the cost of undue generosity in the early years.    he invited the Cabinet to agree therefore that he should announce thefollowing day an increase in the BBC licence fee to  8 for black and white and  18 for colour.britishbroadcastingcorporationlicence fee
In discussion it was argued that the consequences of the HomeSecretary&apos;s proposal, as set out by the BBC in terms of staffredundancies and reductions in hours, would be quite considerable;and it would be unfortunate if, as a result, proposals for improving the service in areas which were now inadequately served failed tomaterialise.    At a time of economic stringency it was all the moreimportant to maintain good entertainment in the home.    If the nextincrease came about the beginning of 1977 it might coincide with theAnnan Report and need not be politically embarrassing to theGovernment,    In the longer run there might be a case for a new system of financing, for instance by a surcharge on new colour setswhich would be less open to evasion and would get a.way from theneed for periodical increases in fees; but this was a fundamentalpolicy question on which it would be wrong to pre-empt any recommendations which the Annan Committee might make.The following points were made in further discussion -a. The system by which old people living in old people&apos;shomes paid only 5p for a television licence was provingdifficult to administer and there was discontent among thosewho did not qualify.    Some local authorities were nowusing rate money to provide free licences to old age pensioners living in their own homes.    An increase in the fees would make the local authority schemes more expensive, and thus might give rise to complaints fromratepayers and at the same time accentuate the discontentfelt by pensioners,    A general scheme for the provision of cheap licences to households consisting of old age pensionerswould be expensive, probably too expensive to be financed from the rates in the present circumstances;  and if the BBCwere to finance it the licence fees for the rest of the population would have to be increased yet further.    Moreover it wouldbe difficult to prevent the misuse of such a scheme whenpensioners were living with younger people.    nevertheless the possibility, and the cost, of devising a workable scheme would be worth further examination.b. The present BBC charter forbade it to acceptadvertising even by Government Departments.Consequently Government advertising, such as the campaign for saving fuel, brought large profits to the independentbroadcasting companies.    The arguments against allowing the BBC to show advertisements did not apply to the public sector.    Although the BBC themselves would oppose thechange, the possibility of enabling, or requiring, them toaccept public sector advertisements merited examination.5
c. Adjusting the fees so as to tilt the balance in favourof black and white television would help to discourage firmsfrom abandoning the manufacture of monochrome tubes inthis country, with the harmful consequences this wouldhave for employment,,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should announce thefollowing day an increase in the BBC licence fee to  8 for blackand white television and  18 for colour.    It was to be hoped thatno further increase would prove necessary before the AnnanCommittee reported^, but the duration of the settlement should beleft unspecified.    The Home Secretary should arrange for further study to be given to the possibility of providing cheap licences forblack and white television to pensioner households and for theconclusions reached to be discussed by the Broadcasting Committee.The possibility of amending the BBC charter to permit paidadvertising by public sector bodies should first be discussed with lord Annan, to ascertain whether his committee were minded todeal with the subject;  and subject to his views the Home secretary should arrange for a stvidy to be made of the possibilities and a paper prepared for discussion by the Broadcasting Committee.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Home Secretary to proceed accordingly.6
5&apos;jGAR 40 The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (C(75) 13) on thePrevious present state of the negotiations on the price to be guaranteed for reference: sugar imported in 1975 from the African, Caribbean and PacificCC(75) 3rd (ACP) sugar producers, the sugar supply situation, and the optionsConclusions, open for future action,iiinute 2THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat we should stand firm on the offer of  250 a ton cif we hadalready made, and do nothing at present to improve our existing offer.    This would allow pressures to build up within theACP group.    When the ACP producers sought further talks and showed themselves ready to move from their position, we wouldhave to make some small improvements in our offer in order toobtain agreement.    He proposed that those improvements shouldbe the conversion of our offer to an fob basis;  an increase in theoffered price to  240 a ton fob (equivalent at current freight rates to an increase of  5 a ton);  and an assurance that, if world pricesremained high we would consider giving a further guarantee, at a level to be considered at the time, for the period after 1975.    Hecould not be sure that they would be enough to secure agreement;but bilateral contacts since the last round of negotiations had takenplace with the responsible Ministers from Mauritius, Guyana, andSwaziland, and those countries were ready to be more flexible thanJamaica, whose spokesman was conducting the negotiations for thewhole ACP group, had been hitherto.    The Guyanese Minister had expressed the view that  2 40 a ton fob would probably be acceptableas long as it was accompanied by a formula which gave assurance of some premium above the basic e.c. price in future years whenthe world price was above that price,THE MINISTER FOR OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT said she feared that this assessment might prove over-optimistic.    The ACP groupwas showing remarkable solidarity.    Some of the francophonemembers, who previously had been dominated by France, felt thatthey at last had an able and articulate spokesman for their interests, and would not readily allow a split to develop.    Jn the upshot the whole Convention of Association under Protocol 22 of our treaty of Accession might be jeopardised.    In her judgment theprice needed to be offered to bring sufficient pressure for the ACPcountries to reach an agreement on sugar was higher than had been proposed.In discussion it was reported that Mr Manley, the Prime Ministerof Jamaica, had spoken by telephone to the Prime Minister theprevious evening.    The importance of not prejudicing the Protocol 22negotiations had been accepted, especially after the success of theACP/e.c. Ministerial conference in Jamaica in July 1974;  and7
Mr Manley had expressed anxiety about the risk of ultimate failurein the sugar negotiations through miscalculation on the part of either side.    Both sides in the negotiations wished to avoid beinginflexible, but there were limitations to the extent to which room for manoeuvre existed.    The Prime Minister had particularlyemphasised to Mr Manley the considerable burden to our balance ofpayments which the price we had already offered represented, andthe attractions for the producers of a long term contract.    He had made it plain that, when the ACP countries wished to resume negotiations, we would be ready ior further talks.In further discussion it was argued that the price we had offered was fully defensible as fair to developing countries, represented aconsiderable increase in the price of sugar which had obtained, or would have been contemplated, a year previously, and was generousin the light of prospective sugar supply and demand.    It would therefore be a mistake to accede to the ACP demands.    TheMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had been right to stand firm on his offer of  250 a ton cif until now, and should continue todo so for the time being.    However, when it was plain that theACP countries were ready to moderate their demands, and bearing that mind the implications for the overall Protocol 22 negotiations, itwould be right for him to have discretion to make the adjustments to our present offer which he proposed, with a view to reaching agreement.The Cabinet -1. Agreed to adhere for the time being to the offer to guarantee a price of  250 a ton ciffor sugar imported in 1975 into the United kingdom from the ACP countries.2. Invited the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, when talks with the sugarproducers resumed, and if necessary in orderto reach agreement with them, to make the improvements in the offer set out in paragraph 8of C(75)13.Cabinet Office28 January 1975
