PARLIAMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.It was noted that, because of the slow progress being made withthe Industry Bill in Committee, it would probably shortly benecessary to make the Bill the subject of a timetable Motion.i FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle East2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary said that although a number of the Arab leaders and the soviet union were advocating a return to the Geneva Conference intheir public statements, it was fairly clear that there was no great enthusiasm for this.    Israel, Egypt and the United States,at least, hoped to return to the step by step approach to asettlement which the American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger,has been pursuing.  It now seemed possible that the immediatecause of the failure of Dr Kissinger&apos;s last visit to the middle east was a misunderstanding between him and the Israelis duringthe final stages.    If, however, the step by step approach was tobe resumed with any prospect of a successful outcome, the israeli Government would need to adopt a more flexible policy of negotiation and the Prime Minister and he had urged this when the-Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Allon, has called on theim earlier in the week.    With Mr Allon&apos;s agreement he had given an accountof their discussion to the Federal German Foreign Minister,Herr Genscher, so that if it seemed useful to do so it might beused in the discussions which Herr Genscher was to have with president Sadat of Egypt.Cyprus THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that although the relations between Mr Clerides and PresidentMakarios appeared to be deteriorating still further, the formerhad not carried out his threat to resign as the Greek Cypriotnegotiator in the inter-communal talks.    These were to begin in Vienna on 28th April. There was little evidence thatthe Turkish Cypriot negotiator, Mr Denktash, would be in aposition to adopt a conciliatory attitude and the prospects forprogress were not favourable.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
Energy and Raw        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the materials preliminary conference of oil producing and consuming countries,held in Paris, had developed into a confrontation between the consumers who wished to confine the di&amp;cussions to energy supplies,and the producers who wished to extend the field to include other raw materials.    The conference had as a result failed to achieveanything.    The prospects for it had never been good since theFrench had regarded it largely as a means of advancing french national interests with the Arab States, while the Americans hadstrong reservations about the value of a conference of the kind proposed.    It would be wrong to abandon the aim of achievingco-operation between energy producers and energy consumers,but we should not be in too great a hurry to reinstate a conference.It was important to find some way of dealing separately with theproblem of raw materials other than energy sources, and the initiativewhich the Prime Minister would be taking at the forthcoming meetingof Commonwealth Heads of Government in Kingston. Jamaica on thesubject of commodities should provide a starting point.    If we couldengage Commonwealth support for the ideas we had in mind, this might lead to wider support in the United Nations and elsewhere.The initiative had received a general welcome from our partners in the European Economic Community.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit was clearly desirable to deal with energy and other commodities in separate discussions.    The next step would be the initiative oncommodities which he would be taking in Jamaica.    He would be visiting Washington on his way back from Jamaica and would discus3with President Ford the way to move forward towards discussions on energy with the producing countries.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2
SFERENDUMpiledlugdomitizens-VerseasIre viousfference:iC( 75) 17thtonclusions,ftnute 53. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(75) 48) about the right of United kingdom citizens overseas to vote in the referendum.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that on 13 march the Cabinet decided that British people living abroad who were not onthe current register   should not be enabled to vote in the referendum.The Referendum Bill accordingly made no provision for them.    Therewas however a good deal of pressure on the Government to reversethis decision which had been strongly criticised during the SecondReading debate on 10 April.    At the end of that debate theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury, received a letter signed by about40 Labour Members, urging the Government to make arrangements toenable British people living abroad to vote in the referendum; andsome of them had subsequently put down an amendment to the Bill tothis effect.    The letter had also included the separate proposal thatpostal voting should be allowed to holidaymakers.There was a serious risk that, if the Government continued to resistin Committee in the following week the proposal about British people living abroad, the proceedings would be prolonged and an amendment would be carried against the Government.    This might delay the referendum from 5 June (which was otherwise feasible now that it was clear from Sir Philip Allen&apos;s report that the Scottish problem could be solved) to 19 June, since Earls Court was not available on 12 June.Officials had accordingly been instructed to report urgently on the feasibility of a scheme for the enfranchisement of defined categories of British people living abroad.    Their report, which was in theAppendix to&apos; the paper, showed that a scheme could be devised whichwould substantially meet what was required, but with a number ofimperfections and anomalies.    This scheme would represent a majordeparture from the arrangements obtaining at Elections.    In his judgment, however, there was little risk that a Speaker&apos;s conference would recommend that it should be imported into electoral law - though this risk would apply with great force to any proposals to allow those on holiday to vote by post in the referendum, which he believed thatthe Government should continue to resist to the utmost.    On balance,and in the light of discussions he had had with the backbenchersconcerned, he recommended that the Government should adopt thescheme described in the Appendix to his paper and that he should tableGovernment amendments to the Bill to give effect to it.The Cabinet first considered the question of giving postal votes toholidaymakers.    It was argued that there was a possible case forconceding this, in the unique circumstances of the referendum,chiefly because of the threat it presented to the timely passage of theBill.    If the upshot was the postponement of the referendum till alater date, the case for postal votes for those on holiday would be
even stronger.    Although there would be technical difficulties inmaking the arrangements in time for polling day on 5 June, they shouldnot be insuperable.    Moreover, from the wider aspect of electoralpractice, it might not be possible to avoid indefinitely the possibilityof introducing postal voting for holidaymakers into General Elections.Against this it was strongly argued that, on grounds of principle andpolitical factors, the Labour Party had always been resolutely opposedto an extension of voting by post.    The holding of the referendum didnot justify a departure from this position.    Even if the Governmentwere in the event defeated on the issue,  heir subsequent positionwould be stronger at a Speaker&apos;s Conference which considered this extension to arrangements for General Elections.    In preparing forthe referendum, an extension of postal voting would increase thedifficulties of the local authorities in Scotland.    Everything possible should therefore be done to resist this proposal and defeat any amendments, recognising that any defections among government supporters could well be offset by the votes of the smaller opposition parties.The Cabinet then considered the proposals relating to British people living overseas put forward by the Lord President of the Council.    Itwas argued in their favour that the prospect of a Government defeatwas very real, and that an initiative by the Government would alsoassist in resisting postal voting for holidaymakers.    It was clear thatthose who would qualify would include a significant number of peopledoing valuable work overseas who could not be on the register at homeand would reasonably feel entitled to vote in the special circumstancesof a national referendum; the scheme outlined in the report by officials might be more narrowly drawn so as to eliminate anomaliesso far as possible, and to exclude, for example, people over 60 andothers unlikely to have a real connection with this country.    If theproposals were to be accepted, it would be right to do so at once inview of the need to print and distribute the ballot papers, and toensure that the Referendum Bill could be enacted in time for pollingday to be on 5 June.On the other hand, it was strongly urged that the circumstances of the referendum did not justify any change in voting arrangements forBritish people overseas.    There were many doing useful jobs abroadwho would have made arrangements to vote by proxy; there were alsopeople in this country who, for one reason or another, raised problems affecting their entitlement to vote.    It would be impracticable to make arrangements which would be wholly fair and free from challenge; andthe scheme worked out by officials was likely to create more anomaliesand other difficulties than it would remove.    If it were adopted, there4
would be a serious risk of a damaging precedent in relation to a future Speakers Conference.    In general, it would be unsound tointroduce any departure for those overseas from the well-tried votingsystem of General Elections.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet took the view that the electoral register(apart from the addition of peers) and the arrangements for absentvoting in the referendum (apart from the special arrangements to bemade for Servicemen) should be the same as for a General Election.The Cabinet accordingly reaffirmed their earlier decision to rejectproposals for postal votes for those on holiday and others away from home and also came down against the proposal in the Lord Presidentof the Councils paper to extend the register to include certain Britishsubjects overseas.    The risk of a Government defeat, and of a delay to the referendum, were recognised;  and the Lord President of theCouncil and the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, should do their utmost to ensure that amendments to the Referendum Bill to this effect were defeated in the following week.    To this end theGovernments case as regards British people living overseas should beput to a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on Mondayevening, 21 April.    The Lord President of the Council should howeverhave a technically sound amendment prepared so that, if theGovernment were defeated on this issue on a defective amendment,they could arrange to substitute their own version in the Bill at alater stage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office17 April 19755
