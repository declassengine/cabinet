jlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO     6 lCABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 4th conclusions tuesday 21 January 1975 at 10. 30 amlUROPEAN The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lord President oflOMMUNITY the Council on the need for a referendum on membership of theIfFAIRS European Economic Community (e.c.) (C(75) 7), on the handling ofinformation and the media during the referendum campaign(C(75) 8) and on the organisation of the referendum poll (C(75) 9).The Lord President of the Council had also circulated a report byan official working party on the practical implications of a referendum (C(75) 6).THE PRIME MINISTER said that, if the Cabinet agreed that the manifesto commitment to give the British people the final say oncontinued membership of the e.c. should be fulfilled by holding a referendum, he envisaged that the necessary legislation should betaken through Parliament as soon as possible after the Easter recess and after the Cabinet had considered, in late March,   the outcome of the renegotiation.    The question would then arise of the positionof individual members of the Cabinet during the referendum campaign.In their discxisaiona towards the end of March the Cabinet would consider how far the manifesto objectives had been met.    This would involvea careful weighing up of the specific results of renegotiation in orderto reach an overall view of the case for continued membership ofthe e.c..    A minority of the Cabinet might then be unable to acceptthe majority view, and if that situation arose he had it in mind torecommend to the Cabinet that the Ministers concerned should,subject to certain conditions, be free to express their point of view in the country during the course of the referendum campaign.    Thisarrangement, which he envisaged being made whether the majorityview was in favoiir of or against continued membership, would be without an exact precedent.    In 1932 some Cabinet members had been allowed to differ publicly from the majority Cabinet view on thequestion of import duties, but that Cabinet was a coalition of political parties whose differences on this issue were known.    It had beenformed in special circumstances and did not long survive the1secret
agreement to differ.    The justification for a similar arrangement on the e.c. issue would be that a number of Ministers had heldvery strong convictions over many years on the issue and, if theydiffered from the majority verdict on renegotiation, were entitledin the unique circumstances of a referendum to make their viewsknown.    But the Ministers concerned should not make speechesduring the campaign which involved direct or indirect personalattacks on their colleagues in the Government, and the freedom toexpress differing views in public should not be available before theconclusion of the renegotiation.    In the intervening period Ministerialspeeches should not hamper the task of renegotiation by suggestingeither that we ought to remain in the e.c. at all costs, or that we ought to withdraw whatever new terms were negotiated.In discussion there was general agreement with what the PrimeMinister had proposed.    Indeed it could be regarded as a corollary of the decision to have a referendum on this unique issue which cutacross Party lines and traditional loyalties.    It should not involvemembers of the Cabinet differing with each other in public: itwould however permit certain Ministers to argue against therecommendation on the outcome of renegotiation which theGovernment would present to Parliament and the country inaccordance with the majority view of the Cabinet.    In view of thesincerely held differences of view about e.c. membership, to insist on the normal rules of collective responsibility during the referendum campaign would produce deep dissension and couldimpair the unity of  he Cabinet at a time of severe economic problems.    The decision to hold a referendum, thereby giving an individual vote to each member of the electorate on the e.c. issue,made it reasonable to give a similar freedom to members of theCabinet.However the potential disadvantages of the proposed arrangement should not be underestimated.    Problems in Scotland and Walescould be aggravated;  strong speeches would be made on both sidesduring the referendum campaign;  the credibility of the Governmentcould be strained;  and the media would play up the differences ofview between Ministers.    This would make it more difficult for theGovernment to present a united front to the country after the referendum, not only in implementing the referendum decision, butalso in handling the other critical issues which were then likely to face Ministers.    It would be essential to keep the period of difference as short as possible and to make every effort to avoidcontroversy of a personal character.    While it might be appropriate for one Minister to present a different point of view on a particularissue raised by another Minister, the manner and timing of the presentation should be arranged to avoid the impression of a personal confrontation.2YiYYY&apos;
The view was strongly put forward that an arrangement on theselines between members of the Cabinet should extend to theParliamentary Labour Party and to the Labour Party in the country,and that tolerance of differing views would be allowed at all levels,A special problem would arise over the proposed Special party conference.    It was arguable that the Party itself must be free toexpress its view.    On the other hand the Government would stillbe bound by the Manifesto.    It might be preferable to promote a debate which did not seek to reach an agreed conclusion orto commit the Party to conducting an active campaign in support cfthe view reached by the Conference,On balance it was felt that while the Cabinet must preserve a united front until the results of renegotiation were known it might be best to announce now that the proposed arrangement would be made.There was already much speculation about the position, in view ofthe known opinions of individual Ministers.    An announcement latermight be misinterpreted as an unhappy compromise.    It v/ould be essential, however, for an early announcement also to make clearthat there would be a Cabinet recommendation on the outcome of renegotiation, even if some members dissented from it.    And whilerenegotiation was continuing, Ministers should not express or implypersonal decisions on the basic question of membership.    The other member States of the e.c. would see no point in making concessions to our specific renegotiation demands if it appeared that theGovernment were not negotiating in good faith, and that the outcome of negotiation   was unlikely to affect the Government&apos;s finaldecision.    It would not be possible for Ministers to refrain fromany speeches or statements on e.c. matters during theremainder of renegotiation, particularly since other political parties, Government backbenchers, sections of the Labour Partyorganisation and the specialised pro- and anti-e.c. organisationshad already begun to campaign.    It should be possible for speeches and statements to be made within the framework of the Manifestoposition and the needs of renegotiation:  and special care should betaken to clear them with the Prime Minister.There was also general agreement that every effort should be madeto shorten the period of difficulty, by holding the referendum beforethe end of June.    The timetable for the legislation would be verytight, and its passage might be assisted by a preliminary debate inParliament, about the detailed and the technical aspects of a referendum, on the basis of a Government statement or White Paper.Parliament might also be furnished with the information collected by officials about referendum practice in other countries.3sje4 :ret
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the decision of the British people on EECmembership should be given by way of a national referendum,which should be held as soon as possible after the conclusion of the renegotiation and after the passage of the necessary legislation.The Cabinet also agreed that they would need to reach a decision bythe end of March, in the light of the outcome of the renegotiation,on whether the British people should be recommended to vote for continued membership of the e.c. or for withdrawal.    The Cabinetaccepted his view that, if at that point a minority of the Cabinet were unable to agree with the majority decision on what the Governmentsrecommendation should be, the Ministers in the minority should be free to advocate a different view during the referendum campaignon the basis of guidelines precluding any engagement in controversyof a personal kind which could impair the unity of the Government.He would circulate for consideration at their next meeting a draft statement announcing these decisions.    The statement would alsosay that Parliament would have an opportunity of debating, beforethe introduction of the Referendum Bill, a &quot;White Paper on some ofthe procedural provisions which it would contain.The Cabinet were also agreed that, while it would be unrealistic toavoid further Ministerial speeches on European Community matters in advance of the conclusion of the renegotiation and of the referendum campaign, Ministers should exercise the greatestrestraint, in both the number and the content of such speeches, inthe interests of the renegotiation and of the Governments standing in the country.    He wished to see in advance any Ministerial speech on the e.c..Finally the Cabinet also needed to take decisions on certain major issues about the organisation of the poll and information policy, andthe Lord President should circulate a further memorandum forconsideration at their next meeting briefly setting out the urgentquestions raised by C(75) 8 and 9.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister!summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 January 19754secret
