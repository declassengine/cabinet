QUESTIONS OFPROCEDUREPARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSI Mr JohnStonehousePreviousReference:CC(75) 25thConclusions,Minute 11. THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were twoprocedural rules the application of which had been somewhatrelaxed during the referendum campaign but which should henceforthbe strictly observed.    First, there had been a number of occasions when the text of a speech by a Minister had been released to thePress under an embargo some days before the speech was due tobe delivered.     This practice should in general be avoided.    Itcould give rise to misunderstanding, particularly if there were aleak or if the speech as delivered had to be changed because of changes in circumstances.    Moreover, it was more difficult toensure that anything which was said about matters outside the speaker&apos;s own sphere of departmental responsibility was clearedwith the responsible Minister.    Secondly, it was important toensure that such clearance was obtained in.all cases, as indicatedin paragraph 104 of Questions of Procedure for Ministers (C(P)(74)6).2. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatMr Stonehouse was trying to secure the postponement of the debate on a Motion for his expulsion from the House of Commons whichwas at present planned for Thursday, 12 June.    It was clear thatfor legal reasons he would be unable to return to this country intime for the debate.    Extradition proceedings in Australia werenot complete;  moreover, Australian law required him to be held for 15 days from the date of his committal for extradition: andthis requirement could not be waived.    It would be unsafe to agreeto his return to this country except in custody and as a result ofextradition proceedings, since otherwise there would be no powerto prevent his absconding.    These difficulties were, however,largely of Mr Stonehouse&apos;s own making and would not have arisenif he had not opposed extradition in the first place.    The SelectCommittee would be meeting again on 10 June in order to review the conclusions they had reached in the light of the most recent developments, and the Attorney General had been invited to let them have his views.    He was uneasy about the prospect of an earlydebate for fear that it would prejudice the possibility ofMr Stonehouse&apos;s receiving a fair trial in later criminal proceedings.This point had however been discussed with the Speaker, who had indicated that he intended, by applying the normal sub judice rule,to prevent the debate from trespassing on any questions relatingto possible criminal activities by Mr. Stonehouse.    This wouldaccord with the line which had been taken by the Select Committee,which was that the case for expulsion rested entirely on non-performance of Parliamentary duties and not on any allegationsabout criminal activities.    An important advantage of allowing the debate to take place during the present week was that if it werepostponed it would in practice not be possible to hold a by-electionbefore October.
In discussion, anxiety was expressed that an early debate might prejudice the possibility of a fair trial.    It was not clear thatthe sub judice rule formally applied to legal proceedings inAustralia as well as in this country; and in any event the Speakermight have considerable difficulty in ensuring the strict observance of the rule in the course of the debate.    Moreover, it appeared thatMr Stonehouse was now making genuine efforts to return to thiscountry;  and that being so the public might well consider it unjustthat he should be expelled from the House of Commons in his absence.    On the other hand, if the debate were postponed until he returned to this country it might well in fact have to be deferred until after his trial - ie for many months - since it was doubtfulwhether he would be granted bail.    In any decision for or against an early debate a major factor should be the attitude of the SelectCommittee, by whose recommendations the Government had hitherto been guided.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewere arguments for and against proceeding with the debate as planned.    In favour of an early debate it had been argued that aby-election could otherwise not take place until the autumn.    Thisshould be looked into further: if the argument rested on precedentor on a Standing Order of the House, it was arguable that a changein practice would be justifiable in the special circumstances.    Adecision would however have to be deferred for 48 hours in order toallow time for the Select Committee to review the position in thelight of the latest developments.    The Cabinet would not be meetinguntil the morning of the day planned for the debate, and therefore the decision whether or not the debate should go ahead would be taken on behalf of the Government by a group of Ministers consisting ofhimself, the Lord President of the Council, the Lord Chancellor,the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Employment, theChief Whip and the Attorney General.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
3. THE PRIME MINISTER outlined to the Cabinet the substance of the Statement he was due to make in the House of Commons that afternoon on the result of the referendum on membership of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.).He intended to refer to the clear and unmistakable nature of thedecision, and to the widely consistent pattern of voting in theUnited Kingdom.    He would refer to his hope that, with the twotests of the February 1974 Manifesto now met, the country as awhole would follow the lead of the Government in placing pastdivisions behind them and in working together to play a full and constructive part in the Community.    He would recall that, atthe outset of the renegotiation, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had said to the Council of Ministers of the Communitythat a successful result would provide a firm basis for continuingBritish membership of a strengthened Community.    The statement would also acknowledge the positive attitude of commonwealth countries to Britain&apos;s continued membership and would express thehope that we should be able to bring even more to our relationship with them from within the Community following the clear decisionof the electorate.    It followed logically from the referendumdecision that Britain should play its full part in the Communityinstitutions.    This was consistent with the Labour Party&apos;s election manifesto and the line taken during renegotiation.    A number ofprominent Labour MPs who had been against our continued membership of the e.c. had, following the referendum decision,said that the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) should now take upplaces in the European Assembly.    This was a decision for the PLP,not the Government;  but he would recommend that course in his statement, and ask the Liaison Committee to pursue it.    Similarlya number of trades union leaders had, following the referendumresult, said that the trades unions would probably now take up theirplaces in the Community institutions, particularly the Economicand Social Committee,In conclusion the Statement would emphasise that, while we could best improve our own economic situation, and attract investmentfrom a settled position within the Community, our future would continue to depend on what we were prepared to do by our own efforts.In a brief discussion it was suggested that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary might usefully consider preparing for cabinet a memorandum which would survey      European Communitypolicy and indicate the way in which the Government should approach the main issues and other Community business which layahead.    The more constructive our general stance, the less likelywe were to be forced into a defensive posture on the less easy issues,and the more likely we were to be able to handle matters to our advantage.statement on THEREFERENDUMRESULT
