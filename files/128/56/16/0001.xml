PARLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the week following the Easter Recess,It was noted that there would be a free vote at the end of the debate on the Motion to approve the White Paper on Membership of theEuropean Community and the Governments recommendation tocontinue membership, which was to take place on 8 and 9 April,civil SERVICE        2, The Cabinet resumed their discussion of Civil Service pay,pAy Their discussion is recorded separately.previous reference:CC(75) 15thConclusions,Minute 2FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CC(74) 41stConclusions,Minute 23. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had discussed the situation with the American Secretary ofState when the latter had stopped briefly in London on his return to washington after the failure of his latest mission to the Middle East,Dr Kissinger had been in a very pessimistic mood.    It was important to avoid any public impression that we attributed blameto one side or the other.    It seemed likely, however, that the failureof the mission was finally brought about by differences within the israeli Cabinet.    Dr Kissinger had obtained Egyptian agreement toa declaration on non-belligerency in return for Israeli withdrawal from the passes and the oilfields.    After protracted discussion the israeli Government had decided that the declaration in the formproposed did not meet their requirements.    We must now expect aperiod of heightened tension in the Middle East with the attendantdanger of confrontation.    President Sadat of Egypt would have lessroom for manoeuvre and would probably feel obliged to follow a more extreme Pan-Arab line.    There was a reasonable prospect thatfighting would not be resumed during the next few months: the nextstep would probably be a resumption of talks in Geneva, possibly ona limited agenda.    The role and status of the Palestine LiberationOrganisation would be an important issue.    A reimposition of the oil embargo was not likely in present circumstances but it was likely,in some form, if war were to break out again.
)PortugalpreviousReference:CC(75) 8thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Portugal was confused and potentially dangerous.    the armed Forces Movement was subject to internal stresses and wasunpredictable,    Reports within the past few days that changes wouldbe made in the Portuguese Government which would represent a step towards the establishment of a totalitarian regime controlled bythe Communists, had caused alarm within the North atlantic alliance,    He had not supported suggestions that Soviet Ambassadorsin Alliance capitals should immediately be called in to receiverepresentations and had counselled against any action which couldbe regarded as interference in the composition of the portuguese government,    He had, however, instructed our Ambassador inLisbon to urge upon the President of Portugal, Dr Costa Gomes,the importance of holding the general elections in Portugal on25 April as planned, and to express our hope and expectation thatno changes would be made in Portugal before the elections that would prevent these from being held in a stable and balanced atmosphere.Some other members of the Alliance and the European Economic.Community would be sending similar instructions to theirAmbassadors,The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
SUITE PAPERONOFTHEMOPEANcommunity4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(c(75) 43), to which was attached a draft of a White Paper onmembership of the European Community.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theWhite Paper was a supporting document to the Prime Minister1 sParliamentary statement of 18 Marchc    It was right that theGovernment should provide a comprehensive and authoritativestatement of the facts about the renegotiated terms and of theGovernments assessment.    The draft was based on the conclusions the Government had reached and thus reflected the view of themajority in the Cabinet who were in favour of continued membership,The White Paper would be followed by a popular version, whichwould be distributed to all households before the referendum.Chapter 2 gave the full details of the renegotiated terms.    Chapter 3set out certain other important aspects of Community development.Chapter 4 dealt with the issue of sovereignty on the lines of theLord Presidents report to Cabinet following the study by theLegislation Committee.    Chapter 5 set out some wider considerations,including the probable consequences of a decision to withdraw fromthe Community - an aspect which was attracting increasing public attention.In discussion it was recognised that those Cabinet members whowere unable to support the Governments recommendation on european Community membership were also unable to accept muchof the substance of the White Paper, which had been drafted as astatement of the Governments case.    In considering the draft text3a number of amendments to the draft were agreed.    The following main points were made -a. The draft used the word &quot;our&quot; somewhat ambiguously.The text should be amended where necessary to make clear whether this word referred to the Government or to thecountry as a whole.    References to the &quot;Labour Government&quot;should be confined to references to the Government of1964-70.b. Chapter 4 should be amended in accordance with thecorrections which the Lord Chancellor had indicated.    the role of Parliament, in relation to the introduction of directelections to the European Assembly and otherinstitutional changes, should be made clear on the lines suggested separately in writing by the Lord Advocate.    this chapter should also mention that United Kingdom courts were required to apply Community law.3
c. The references in Chapter 4 to the 1967 White paper on the legal and constitutional implications of membershipmight be embarrassing, because of the objections raisedby the Government, when in Opposition, during the passageof the European Communities Act 1972.    But on balance it seemed right to acknowledge the clear analysis in the 1967White Paper,    Nothing in that White Paper, or in subsequent developments, altered Parliaments undoubtedright to exercise its sovereign law-making powers.d. Paragraph 5.2 should make it clear that the improvements in Community policy towards the developingworld meant that countries such as India were now beinghelped, in addition to African countries.e. The final paragraph should start with a statement that if the referendum went in favour of continued membership, the Government would be ready to play a &quot;full part in developing a new and wider Europe&quot;, as stated in theLabour Party Manifesto of February 1974.    The last sentence of the present draft should be deleted.f. On balance it seemed desirable to publish the white paper before Easter;  later publication could be severely criticised in Parliament, in view of the debate arranged for the week beginning 7 April.    But the Foreign and commonwealth Secrstary should have an opportunity of examining the final text before it went to the printer.    this meant that publication could not take place before Thursday27 March;  but it was not considered that publication on thatdate would carry overriding disadvantages from the publicitypoint of view.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up the discussion, said that thedraft should be amended to take account of the corrections made bythe Lord Chancellor in Chapter 4 and of the other amendmentsagreed in discussion.    Subject to the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s approval of the final text, the Cabinet agreed that theWhite Paper should be published on Thursday 27 March.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of theLord President of the Council&apos;s summing upof their discussion.2. Authorised the publication on Thursday27 March of the White Paper on membership of the European Community.
EECREFERENDUMGuidance onprocedureBetweenAnnoun ce ment of theGovernmentRecommendationand ReferendumPreviousReference:CC(75)15thConclusions,Minute 55. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister,circulated under cover of C(75) 41, setting out proposed guidelineson the procedure to be followed by Ministers during the period upto the referendum.In general discussion there was wide support for the view that theproposed guidelines were insufficiently flexible;   and that, if theywere rigidly applied in their present form, they could increase thedifficulties of the Government in present circumstances.    It wouldbe better to place greater emphasis on relying on the good senseand responsibility of all Ministers to act in such a way as to minimise the damage caused by the differences between them.As to arrangements relating to the referendum campaign in thecountry, it was suggested that parts of the guidelines set out inparagraph 2(1)-(4) would prove too restrictive to be workable.&quot;While no Minister should allow himself to appear to be in directconfrontation with another Minister, it might not always be possibleto avoid appearing to be in direct confrontation with a Governmentbackbencher who took a different view, particularly since it wouldnot be practicable to control all the arrangements made by producers of the broadcasting organisations.    A restriction on Ministersappearing with representatives of different political Parties orother organisations could not work since the Umbrella1 organisationsthrough which the referendum campaign would be conducted, both infavour of Britain*s continued membership of the European community and against it, necessarily contained representatives of severaldifferent political Parties and organisations.    Against this it was argued that some restrictions or limitation of activities would berequired in the interests of the Party as a whole, especially as itwas now apparent that some Ministers had decided to carry theirdissent from the Governments recommendation to the extent of leading the campaign against it.    On balance the feeling of theCabinet was that the restriction contained in paragraph 2(3) shouldbe deleted, though it was recognised that all Ministers would haveto exercise great care in choosing those with whom they would be associated on public occasions.    On the question of speaking in a constituency represented by a Labour Member of Parliament it was felt that the normal courtesies, by which that Member would be consulted in advance, should suffice; the latter&apos;s expressagreement should be sought where a Minister proposed to address a meeting of the constituency Labour Party.As regards the Ministerial handling of on-going Community business during the period of the referendum campaign, whether within theGovernment machine, in Brussels or in Parliament, to whichparagraphs 6 and 7 of the Prime Ministers note referred, it waspointed out that a major part of the work of some dissenting
Ministers - and in some Ministries all the junior Ministers alsodissented - related to Community business;  and the ministers concerned could not abdicate their responsibility for this.    Therewas general agreement, however, that all Ministers, in dealing withon-going Community business, whether in Brussels or inParliament, should speak and act in accordance with the Government1 decision, making it plain that they were doing so, and refusing to bedrawn into statements conflicting with the Governments policy.Given such an approach, it would not be necessary to apply a generalban to the attendance of dissenting Ministers at meetings in Brussels,particularly when the issues under discussion were of a technicalnature unrelated to the main referendum issues.    It was suggestedinstead that Ministerial attendance at meetings in Brussels shouldbe decided after consultation, and in agreement, with the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,    Similarly in the Parliamentaryhandling of Community business, such as Parliamentary questions and Scrutiny Committee work, dissenting Ministers would have toexercise restraint and good sense, but it should not be necessaryto transfer all Questions relevant to renegotiation or the referendumcampaign to other Ministers,    Ministers should answer questions in as neutral a way as possible, saying if need be that they weredescribing the policy of the Government and, if necessary,referring supplementary questions to the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement on the results of renegotiation.    There would, however,be advantage in establishing under Foreign and commonwealth office chairmanship a committee of the Parliamentary Clerks ofthe Departments directly concerned to consider and refer to Ministersany Parliamentary Questions which might seem to raise particular difficulties.    It should remain the responsibility of the Ministers,not of Permanent Secretaries, to ensure that the instructions andbriefing for officials with business in Brussels remained in line with Government policy.While there was no dissent from paragraphs 8-11 of the PrimeMinisters note dealing with the conduct of civil servants, it wasagreed there was no objection to dissenting Ministers making useof the normal office facilities, such as photocopying, available totheir private offices.In further discussion the general view of the Cabinet was opposedto the publication of the guidelines in full, but it was suggested thatthe gist of paragraph 2, dealing with participation in the referendumcampaign in the country, could be made public with advantage,possibly by means of an answer to a Question to the Prime Minister.In the expectation that differences of view on Ministerial conductor activities could well arise during the course of the referendumcampaign, it was also suggested that it would not be productive forsuch issues to be pursued regularly at meetings of the Cabinet.    If:YYYY: Y.

CONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 16th Conclusions, Minute tuesday 25 March 1975 at 9.30 am the LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, following the cabinets discussion on 20 March, a meeting of the Ministers principally concerned, under the chairmanship of the Lord President of theCounciL, had considered what offer should be made to the non-industrial Civil Service    It had been concluded that the lowestoffer which could be represented as within the terms of the pay agreement, and which had any chance of acceptance by the staff side, was 31-jr per cent.    It was proposed that negotiations with theStaff Side should start immediately after the Easter holiday.    the initial offer would be lower than 31^r per cent, and if agreement could not be reached at or very near the latter figure the matter would be allowed to go to arbitration.CIVIL SERVICEFAYPreviousReference:CC(75)15thConclusionsMinute 2THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up a briefdiscussion, said that the Cabinet approved the course of actionwhich had been described by the Lord Privy Seal.    Any settlement which was reached would cover a period of 15 months, and it was essential that it should be presented publicly in terms of an annual rate of increase.    An overall figure of 31g per cent was equivalentto about 25 per cent on an annual basis, and this could be regardedas just within the terms of the social contract.    It was particularly important that nothing should be said at this stage about thepossibility of going to arbitration.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Lord President ofthe Council and invited the Lord Privy seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office26 March 1975%HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government copy NO     34CABINET
Ihis DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPUBLICEXPENDITUREPreviousReference:CC(75) 12thConclusions,Minute copy NO39CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 16th Conclusions, Minute 6Tuesday 25 March 1975 at 9. 30 am the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(75) 39) proposing a reduction of  1, 000 million in planned public expenditure in 1976-77;  and a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Social Services (C(75)37) seeking authority to announce the 1975-76 capital allocations to health authorities.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that -the country was Hving beyond its means by running an externaldeficit equal to 5 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).This deficit was financed by overseas borrowing on the Euro-market and from the oil producers, and so far it had been possible to do this without having any political conditions attached to the loans.In the coming year it would be more difficult to borrow, both because there was less money available and because the UnitedKingdomfs credit was low and falling.    The reason for this wasthat the United Kingdom&apos;s rate of inflation was twice that of the othercountries  in  the   Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD).    This affected the balance of payments andthe public sector borrowing requirement.    The United Kingdom&apos;balance of payments deficit, was the highest of all countries in theOECD and was expected to be of the order  of  3, 500 million in 1975.The public sector borrowing requirement for 1974-75 was now put at 7, 500 million - higher than the estimate in November; and ifpolicies were not changed it would be higher still in 1975-76.    a continuance of this situation could lead to a collapse of confidence and a run on sterling.    If that occurred, the Cabinet would be facedwith a stark choice.    Either they would have to adopt the policiesappropriate to a siege economy, or they would have to borrow fromthe international institutions, and possibly the United States, on terms which would to a considerable extent dictate the economic policy to be followed.    It would be far better therefore to keepcontrol of events so that the need to make such a choice did notarise.
In his view it was necessary to relate what the Government did in1975-76 to a plan covering a period of three to four years.    He fullyaccepted that the necessary structural change could not be achieved without intelligent use of the new developments in micro-economic policy represented, for example, by the National Enterprise Boardand the introduction of planning agreements;  but by themselves these would not be enough.    The central problem was inflation, particularlywage inflation.    It would be necessary, before the next wage roundwas due to begin, for Ministers to discuss their approach to it; butthere was no possibility of getting a substantial lessening of the rateof wage increases in the current round.    Other action must thereforebe taken in the 1975 Budget.    World trade was falling,and the forecast was that it would not see an upturn until the first half of 1976, when the upturn might be quite rapid.    It was essentialthat the country should then have the productive capacity availableto take advantage of the corresponding export opportunities.    the key year was likely to be 1976-77, and the proposed cut of  1, 000million in that year was an important element in achieving our objectives.    At the time the White Paper on Public Expenditure,published in January, was compiled, the assumption was that theannual growth rate of GDP between 1973 and 1979 would be over  per cent.    Such forecasts were inevitably uncertain, but it was now thought that growth was more likely to be below 3 per cent.This would imply that there was room for only a negligible increasein privately financed personal consumption.    An approach of thiskind would inevitably las?olve increases in direct and indirect taxation;but indirect tax increases fed through into wages by way of their effect on the retail price index (RPI);  and the direct tax increase would need to be as much as 5p. - 12p. extra on the standard rateof income tax.    Increases of this magnitude would put an end to any chance of the trades unions continuing to base settlements oncomparisons with the RPI before tax and contributions.    Thereforehe recommended that, in order to ease the tax changes which would otherwise be necessary in the 1975 Budget, public expenditure in1976^77 should be cut by  1, 000 million.    An illustrative distributionof these cuts was contained in che Annex to his paper, and he soughtagreement to proceed with bilateral consultations with his colleagues on the precise reductions to be made.    He pointed out that varioussensitive areas - including echool meals and milk, industrialsupport, agriculture, housing, a range of social services, and basicneeds for education - had been left untouched;  and he was quite prepared to see flexibility about the way in which cuts were taken on capital or current expenditure.    But it was in his view essentialto have overall reductions of the proposed magnitude if theGovernment was to start 1975-76 in control of the economy.2
In discussion it was questioned whether the Cabinet could be expectedto agree to public expenditure cuts of this order without theopportunity to consider the overall strategy of which such cuts were only a part.    Expenditure reductions would do nothing for the balanceof payments in 1975-76;  nor would they moderate wage inflation inthat year.    Their major object appeared to be to ensure that when1976-77 arrived the United Kingdom had sufficient productivecapacity available to take advantage of the expected upturn in world trade.    It was however arguable that if unemployment continued to grow for the next twelve months there would in fact be sufficient sparecapacity available for that purpose without any action being taken bythe Government to cut public expenditure.    This was a matter onwhich the Cabinet needed more information, including in particular the forecast of unemployment.It was further argued that this was not the kind of proposal whichcould be discussed in isolation.    A special discussion of theGovernments economic strategy was essential at which possible alternatives to that of which the proposed cuts were a part could beconsidered.    The same was true of the distribution of any cutswhich might be agreed, which should be made to reflect a carefullythought out view of priorities rather than the standard Treasuryprescription which had been proposed.    On a whole range of policiesthey meant that the commitments in the Party Manifesto would haveto be set aside or postponed.    Such changes should not be discussedbilaterally;  they required collective consideration.    It was true thatthe January White Paper had contained a warning that the government might have to reappraise the programmes in the light of changingconditions; but it was wrong to contend that this meant the figures would be revised within three months of publication.    The truth wasthe Government had  Slipped into a crisis, and on the basisof the present proposal they would never be able to build up the socialwage through public expenditure as the Labour Party wished to do.The better course would be for the Government to consult fully andcandidly with the trade unions, and to take the public into their confidence, confronting the unions with the choices between jobs and higher wages, and between lower taxes or higher public expenditure.There were alternative courses not covered in the papers beforeCabinet which should be considered.    It was recognised that, given theadditional strain imposed upon the balance of payments by the oilprice increases of the last eighteen months, more painful policiesthan simply public expenditure cuts might well be needed; but thewhole complex needed discussion.    The proposed cuts could berepresented as abandoning the social contract completely and con&quot;stituted a massive deflationary package which would increaseunemployment in a way which would make it impossible to get back to full employment in the lifetime of the present Parliament.    They
would cut productive capacity and cause falling investment to go evenlower.    They could lead to a slump of 1931 proportions.    There wasno question but that imports had to be reduced;  the only question was how it should be done.    Selective import restrictions were one possibility;  and they could be combined if necessary with rationing and allocation of some imported materials, tax increases,transitional employment subsidies, control of capital outflow, control on banks to ensure funds for the public sector and the maintenanceof the price cede.    It was essential that such alternative policiesas these should be fully considered.On the other hand it was argued that an alternative approach of thiskind was not remotely viable, being not only protectionist butinvolving the adoption of a siege economy.    A strategy of this kindwas not open to a country which was overspending by 5 per cent,since it would make it impossible to borrow overseas, and thiswould in turn make a very severe cut in living standards unavoidable.While it was true that the expenditure reductions proposed would cause anger and dismay among some Party supporters, the samewas true of any satisfactory way of dealing with the problem of inflation.    The fact had to be faced that the Government was pursuingthree major objectives - a voluntary incomes policy, full employment and a civilised level of public expenditure - not all of which could besimultaneously realised.    It had hitherto been held that a statutoryincomes policy was unthinkable because it would mean breakingfaith with the unions; but the fact remained that the Chancellor^proposals involved breaking other commitments.    The Governmentshould therefore reach a judgment on the merits of the situation-Whatever else the Government did, action would be needed drasticallyto curtail public expenditure.    No doubt there was room for discussion on just how the cuts should be applied - eg was it acceptable that, in health and personal social services they would mean that expenditure would decrease by 0. 4 per cent when an increase of ljr per cent wasnecessary simply to keep pace with the growth of need?;  while in education they would imply that the Government would have to denyposts to trained teachers - but given the present situation,particularly the paramount need to indicate in the April Budget how the public sector borrowing requirement was to be reduced in future,it was essential that cuts of the magnitude proposed should be agreed.Furthermore it would be wrong to regard the proposals as simply adeflationary package.    They were part of a larger strategy whichaimed to shift resources into export and investment.    Without them the other aspects of the Budget would have to be more severe.Public opinion was in any case expecting firm action by theGovernment.4
OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/said that insufficient time remained tocomplete the discussion at this meeting.    The Cabinet would resume their discussion later in the day.Cabinet Office26 March 19755
