.parliamentary   1. The Cabinet wexe informed of the business to be taken in:fAIRS the House of Commons during the following week.It was likely that the debate on Devolution, which would be takingplace on 3 February on a Motion for the Adjournment, would continue on the following day.    The Lord President of the council would seek confirmation that the fact that the debate would arise ona Motion for the Adjournment would not inhibit discussion of matters requiring legislation.It had been intended to debate the Prayer against the Import Duties(General) (No. 5) Order on 27 January.    It was however desirablethat the Secretary of State for Trade should speak for theGovernment, and since he would be out of the country on that datearrangements would be made to defer the debate until after his return.locial Security The Cabinet were informed that the Government were in danger of benefits Bill being defeated during the Report Stage of the Social security benefits Bill, which was to be taken on 29 January.    Twoamendments had been accepted during Committee Stage againstthe Government&apos;s wishes.    The first provided for the relaxationand eventual abolition of the earnings limit;  the second providedfor the introduction of a non-contributory invalidity pension (NCIP)for disabled housewives at the same time and at the same rate asthe main NCIP,    It was arguable that, with the present evenly balanced House of Commons, the Government must accept with goodgrace that amendments to Bills would sometimes be carried against their wishes.    But deletion of the amendment dealing with the earnings limit was vital - it would ultimately add about  225 million a year to public expenditure - and might in the last resort have tobe made an issue of confidence.    The amendment relating to disabled housewives was however likely to present the greater difficulty politically,    The Government had already decided on theintroduction of an NCIP for disabled housewives in 1977, two yearsafter the introduction of the main NCIP, and for operational reasons it would be impossible to advance this date.    But the intention wasthat the benefit should be at the reduced rate which normallyapplied to dopruidantB - ie it would be  4. 30 a week rather than 6. 90;  and if the benefit were payable at the higher rate therewould be additional expenditure of   5 j million a year.In discussion, it was argued that there was a good case on meritsfor resisting the abolition of the earnings limit; moreover, it was essential to do so from the point of view of preserving the credibilityof the Governments economic strategy, which required them to show
the greatest determination in controlling public expenditure.    Inrelation to the benefit for disabled housewives, the main danger indeparting from the normal practice, under which dependantsreceived a lower rate of benefit, was that there would in the longrun be a risk of very serious repercussions throughout the social security field, particularly in relation to supplementary benefit andretirement pensions.    The cost of these could run into hundreds ofmillions of pounds.    As against this, it was argued that the newbenefit was sui generis.    It would after 1977 be payable to men andwomen who had never been able to work owing to congenitaldisability, and it would thus not be possible to draw distinctionsbased on the degree of dependency of those entitled to it.    It would therefore be difficult in principle to defend a lower rate of benefit for women than for men.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was essential to secure the deletion of theamendment   dealing with the earnings limit.    There would bepolitical advantage in stressing very strongly the Governmentsconcern about the public expenditure aspects.    In relation to disabled housewives, it would probably be best for the government spokesman to argue that the new benefit was sui generis; that inprinciple it was right that it should be paid at the same level to all men and women alike; that having regard to the economic situation the Government could not commit themselves now to introduce thebenefit for housewives in 1977 at more than the rate normallyappropriate for dependants;  and that they would keep under review,having regard to the economic condition of the country, the date when the higher rate would be introduced.    It would be useful if theSecretary of State for Social Services would discuss informally with government backbench supporters who had voted for the amendment in Committee how they would react to such an approach;  and in thelight of that she and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council and the Chief Whip, should decide the precise lines to be taken in the Debate at Report Stage.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister fssumming up of therr discussion.
2.        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat he had received a curt reply from Mr Ian Smith to the messagehe had sent on his return from Africa.   He had therefore sent afurther message observing that Mr Smith had not commented onthe substance of the earlier one or on the proposal that he should send representatives to Salisbury for confidential discussions withMr Smith himself and with the leaders of the African national council (ANC).    He had now made firm proposals for the timetable for such a visit.    The South African Foreign Minister, Dr Muller,had recently called on him and it was clear from their discussion that the South African Government had not yet decided how muchpressure to apply to Mr Smith at this stage to come to a settlement.The ANC appeared to be behaving reasonably, and if they were ableto impose a cease fire on their supporters, the South Africanswould be under pressure to withdraw their police forces from rhodesia and to step up pressure on the illegal regime.    It was important that his report to the Cabinet should be held in strict confidence.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a recent conversation with the Soviet Ambassador confirmed that theSoviet leaders were attaching considerable importance to the visit to Moscow which the Prime Minister and he would be making inFebruary.   We had passed to the Russians the draft of a joint statement or communique which we would wish to see emerge fromthe visit, and which, if the Russians accepted it, would be a document of substance.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theevacuation of the Turkish Cypriot refugees from our sovereignterritory in Cyprus should be complete within a few days.    TheGovernments of Cyprus and greece had protested on the ground that weihad not required the Turkish Government to respond by allowingGreek Cypriot refugees to return to their homes in areas now underTurkish control; but the two Governments were endeavouring to contain public demonstrations of protest.    It had been necessaryto present the decision in humanitarian terms; the TurkishGovernment would not have agreed to an explicit link between action by them helpful to the Greek Cypriots, and the evacuation of theTurkish Cypriots.    It was possible, however, that the Turks wouldmake a helpful gesture; Mr Denktash, the Vice President of cyprus and leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, appeared to favoursuch a move.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
ORTHERN 3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDUPLAND said that there were elements of hope in the present situation, butit was confused.    We might face a period of several months inwhich there was no formal and complete cease fire but a measureof restraint by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with violencecoming largely from disaffected groups.    Discussions were takingplace within the leadership of the Provisional IRA and between IRAor Sinn Fein representatives and others.    The Protestantparamilitary groups were very sensitive to any tumours that theGovernment was treating with the IRA, and there was a danger thatthey would react violently.    Any approaches to Ministers or members of Parliament, seeking to involve them withintermediaries or directly with the IRA, should be treated withgreat caution and reserve,The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland.
4. The Qabi.net considered a draft, circulated under cover of anote by the Prime Minister (C(75) 11), of a statement to be made bythe Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the means by whichthe British people would decide the issue of Britain&apos;s membership of the European Community.In discussion it was argued in respect of paragraph 5 of the draft statement that it would be wrong to reach a firm view now on the timing of Parliamentary debates.    Thus it might be right that theParliamentary Labour Party and the House of Commons should holddebates before the Government reached a decision on the irrecommendation to the British people about continued membership of the Community;  and it was also possible that the House might wish to debate the issue of substance before renegotiation was completed.    On the other hand the House might wish to reach itsown conclusion on the question after the Government&apos;s recommendation was known.    The position of Ministers in these debates could notbe settled now but previous precedent suggested that they need notnecessarily involve a Parliamentary vote on the question of substance.    From the Parliamentary angle and in order to maintainthe credibility of the Government1 s position in the Community, itwould be important that the Government should reach a decision ontheir recommendation to the British people as soon as possible after the outcome of the renegotiation was known.    It was accordingly agreed that the draft statement should both acknowledgethat the announcement of the Government&apos;s recommendation wouldcertainly provide an opportunity for the House of Commons to debate the question of substance and also make clear that a debateat an earlier stage was not precluded, subject to the convenience of the House.    Paragraph 5 of the draft statement should be furtheramended to make fully clear that the Government decision following the completion of renegotiation would be a decision upon their ownrecommendation to the country on whether we should remainmembers of the Community on the basis of the renegotiated termsor whether we should withdraw.The Cabinet agreed that paragraph 7 of the draft statement shouldbe expanded to include, among the matters to be dealt with in theproposed White Paper on the referendum arrangements, the form ofthe referendum question to be put to the British people and thequestion of broadcasting arrangements.    The firm passage in thedraft statement about the timetable for the referendum legislation might be thought to be a hostage to fortune.    But on balance therewas clear advantage in exposing the programme in this way, inorder to concentrate the minds of those who would be concerned inParliament.    Publication of the Bill before the Easter Recess might still be possible and could offer considerable advantages.Certain drafting amendments were also agreed.rpERENDUMI EECJmbershipnit Statement
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that he should make a statement in the House ofCommons that afternoon in the terms of the draft attached toC(75) 11, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion,,Consideration would later be given to the handling, including theposition of individual members of the Government, of theParliamentary debates that might be held, if necessary before aswell as after the outcome of the renegotiation was known and theGovernment had decided the recommendation they would make onthe question of Community membership.    While there could be acase for giving Parliament an opportunity to express views on thequestion of substance before the Cabinet decided on therecommendation which they would make, it would be important thatthe Cabinet should proceed as quickly as possible to a decision ontheir own recommendation to the British people.    In advance ofthat decision, individual Ministers would continue to be bound by theterms of the Manifesto in respect of renegotiation and should not therefore declare their views on the issue of substance or in anyother way exercise the freedom foreshadowed in the circumstancesdefined in paragraph 6 of the draft statement.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Approved the draft statement attachedto C(year) 11, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.
[-niation The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lordcy and Poll President of the Council (C(75) 12) setting out the decisionsjoiiisation required urgently on information policy in the context of the referendum on membership of the European Economic Community(e.c.) and on the organisation of the referendum.    The lord president had previously circulated fuller memoranda on information policy (C(75) 8) and on the organisation of the poll(C(75) 9)oTHE LORD PRESIDENT said that he proposed that the Governmentshould undertake an information effort starting with factual   *.information about the European Community and extending later tothe preparation of material designed tc present the outcome of renegotiation and its implications for the country in the light of theGovernments recommendation.    A special interdepartmental unit,established in the Cabinet Office, should carry out this programmeunder the guidance of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on European Questions.Further thought should be given to the limitation of expenditure on propaganda activities by outside organisations.    There should beinformal consultation with the British Broadcasting corporation and the Independent Broadcasting Authority on the arrangementsthey would be making in order to maintain a fair balance.    Thepossibility of Government assistance to outside organisations,perhaps by arranging for the free distribution of certain informationmaterial, should be explored.    Consideration should be given tothe possibility of banning public opinion polls for a specified period.    Decisions were required on whether the result of the referendum should be decided by a simple majority and on whether there should be special conditions about the size of the poll or ofthe majority.    It was also essential to decide whether to keep open the option of a central count of all votes cast throughout the UnitedKingdom.In discussion it was argued that experience showed the impossibility of producing Government-sponsored information in neutral formeither on general issues such as the present nature of theCommunity or on technical areas such as its impact on trade.    TheGovernments information effort might need to be restricted to thepublication of the White Paper on the outcome of the renegotiation.Any information provided should be subject to the approval ofMinisters collectively.    On the other hand, it was argued that theGovernment had a responsibility to ensure that the public hadadequate information to allow them to give an informed decision inthe referendum.    The recent White Paper on Developments in theEuropean Communities March-October 1974 (Cmnd 5790) was an example of neutral information which could be satisfactorily produced7
by the Government.    Denmark, the Republic of Ireland and Norwayhad organised large information programmes when they heldreferenda on accession to the Community.    Without an adequateprogramme, there was a danger of apathy and a low poll, whichwould be of advantage to neither side.It was suggested that the problem might be approached byconsultations designed to ensure that the pro-and anti-EECorganisations were providing the information that the public would need.    One role for the Government might be to correct factualerrors made by the outside organisations.    Another possibilitywas for the Government to appoint a neutral information adviserwhose impartiality would be accepted by both sides.In discussion of the information activities of outside organisations,the intention to consult the British Broadcasting Corporation and theIndependent Broadcasting Authority was welcomed. . Further work would be needed on the advisability and possibility of controllingother outside organisations.    Attempts to limit total expenditure by the two sides were unlikely to be effective, but there was a case for limiting or banning specific activities such as newspaper orhoarding advertisements and paid canvassing.    The activities ofthe British Commissioners and the Community&apos;s InformationService were strongly resented in some quarters, although theymight prove counter-productive.    A ban on public opinion pollswas unlikely to be effective, particularly because polls could becarried out on behalf of foreign publications and their articles onsuch polls would then be treated as news items in this country.In further discussion, on the organisation of the referendum poll,there was general agreement that the result should be decided bya simple majority, and that there should be no special conditionsattached to the size of poll or the nature of the majority.    On thecounting and announcement of the votes, it was argued on the onehand that a central count was appropriate, as the purpose of the referendum was to allow the electorate of the United Kingdom as awhole to decide whether the United Kingdom should remain amember of the e.c..    The publication of local or regional results which showed that certain areas had voted in a direction contraryto the United Kingdom result might provide the nationalist partieswith a continuing grievance to exploit and could seriously embarrass the development of the Governments devolution policy.    On theother hand, it was argued that a central count would be seen asdesigned to thwart the nationalist parties and would itself give thema grievance to exploit;  and the Government could not in practiceprevent the views of individual regions becoming known throughpolls of voting intentions and of how people said they had actuallyvoted.    There were arguments against a constituency or localgovernment district basis for declaring the results, and a countycount might therefore be preferable.....     confidential
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould arrange for a group of Ministers to consider further thenature, content and general practicability of any government information programme and to report to the Cabinet.    The lord president should give further consideration to the possiblearrangements for controlling the information activities of outsideorganisations, and in particular to the need for controls on particular activities such as newspaper advertising and paidcanvassing.    The Cabinet agreed that there should be no ban onopinion polls; that the referendum decision should be by a simple majority;  and that the Government should be guided, as far aspossible, by normal Parliamentary election practice.    The cabinet should return as soon as possible to the question of a local orcentral count of votes, or the basis of a more detailed study of the feasibility of a central count.The Cabinet -1. TotMinister1 sTook note with approval of the Primer&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.        Invited the Lord President to circulate a further memorandum on the feasibility of a central count.Cabinet Office23 January 1975
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChancellorPENBITURE        of the Exchequer (C(75) 10) to which was attached a printed proof of!ITE PAPER the White Paper &quot;Public Expenditure to 1978-79&quot;.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the White Paperembodied the decisions on Public Expenditure which the Cabinet hadtaken in the autumn.    The figures were consistent with the decision that the annual average increase to 1978-79, starting from the baseline in the survey report, should be about Z\ per cent in demand terms.    He had set out in his memorandum the main points to whichhe thought Cabinet should give attention.    External confidence was at present uneasily balanced, and if there were a collapse therewould be very unwelcome decisions to be taken.    It was important that publication of the White Paper should not provide a shock to overseas confidence.    The announcement already made on the2.\ per cent limit had been accepted as reasonable, and he thoughtthat people generally would be relieved to find that that target hadbeen met.    Nevertheless, the short-term prospects as seen nowwere different from those assumed last summer, when the surveyreport was compiled;  but the expenditure programme was a rollingone and it should be possible to keep to the planned trend over theperiod in spite of short-term fluctuation.    But more seriously,some of the medium-term assumptions which had been madebegan to look over-optimistic.    The projected terms of trade now appeared worse;  the growth of productive potential would be smaller than previously thought unless there were an increase in investment;  and total output each year might be lower.    For these reasons he had proposed in the Annex to his memorandum certainrevisions to the printed text, designed to show that the Governmentwere aware of the changing situation and stood ready to take action as necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that cabinet agreed that the White Paper should be published the following week, using the revised text for Part 1 proposed by the Chancellor.There was some feeling that the additional publicity arrangements proposed in paragraph 8 of the Chancellor^ paper might be improved by the production of a popular version of the paper for distribution to post offices and trades unions.    This was a matter which neededfurther consideration and it should be remitted to the presentation of Government Policies Committee under the parliamentary secretary to the Privy Council Office.The Cabinet -1. Approved the publication of the white paper &quot;Publie Expenditure to 1978-79&quot;, withthe amendments to the text set out in the annex to C(75) 10.
2. Invited the Presentation of government policies Committee to consider and advise on the possibility of publishing a popular version of the White Paper at a later stage.11
