Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.SOCIALSECURITYUPRA TINGPreviousReference:CC(74) 12thConclusions,Minute 32. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Social Services (C(75) 42) and the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(75) 44) about the timing of social security benefit increases in 1975.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had invited her to consider how poorer consumers might be protected against theincrease in fuel prices which the Government had approved inorder to reduce Government subsidies to the fuel industries.    Thefirst uprating of social security benefits and family allowances was due to take place in April 1975.    Under the plans embodied in thePublic Expenditure White Paper, there would, in July, bo increases in family income supplement (FIS), supplementary benefit disregards(SPD) and discretionary heating additions (DHA).    The seconduprating would then take place in December.    This, however, wouldmean that many beneficiaries would not receive any additionalpayment until December, several months after the higher fuel prices had begun to affect their fuel bills.   This was unacceptable.    simply to bring the uprating to an earlier date, and make no other change,would be operationally impracticable, since the staff concerned were unwilling to undertake the additional load of overlapping workwhich this would involve.    She had therefore proposed that the increases in FIS, SPD and DHA be delayed from July to October(in spite of the disadvantage this involved for the recipients) and thatthe second uprating of social security benefits be brought forward from December to October, to coincide with the other increases,an arrangement which would be operationally sensible and acceptable to the staff.    If this were done, however, she judged that, given the likely continuing rate of inflation, it would be necessary to pay a 10 Christmas bonus.    These proposals had been unacceptable to theChancellor of the Exchequer, on the ground that they would lead to anunavoidable presumption that there would be upratings of social security benefits every six months in later years, and that the 10 Christmas bonus would become a permanent feature.    He had suggested as an alternative leaving the increases in FIS, SPD andDHA in July, moving the second social security uprating from december to late November, and bridging the gap during which fuelincreases would begin to bite by making a  10 lump sum payment in
September.    This however was operationally impracticable, and she and the Chancellor had been unable to agree on any feasiblecompromise.    Her scheme and the ChanceIlor&apos;s were identicalin cost in 1975-76, and the point in dispute related solely to thepossible consequences for later years.    In her view the frequency of upratings in later years would be governed by the rate ofinfla.tion rather than by any precedent set in 1975.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Governmenthad already extended a considerable degree of protection to pensioners, who had had an increase of 20 per cent in real termssince July 1974.    In his view to adopt the proposal of the Secretaryof State for Social Services would be to commit  300 million in1976-77 just at the point of time when he was about to embark onbilateral discussions to agree savings totalling  1, 000 million inthat year.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere was a clear majority in favour of 15 November as the operative date for increases in family income supplement,supplementary benefit disregards and discretionary heating additionsas well as for the second social security uprating.    If, after all,the Secretary of State for Social Services found it was practicable to increase the first three at an earlier date, she would be free todo so.    In any event the second uprating of social security benefits and family allowances should take place on 15 November.The Cabinet -1.       Took note with approval of the Lord Presidentof the Council&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for Social services to arrange for family income supplement, supplementary benefit disregards and discretionary heating additions tobe increased in mid-November;  and for the seconduprating of social security benefits to take place on thesame date; but left her free to make the increases inthe first three at an earlier date should this provepracticable.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services about phasing out private practice fromthe National Health Service (C(75) 27).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. SOCIAL, SERVICES said that although there might not be time for the Cabinet to come to animmediate decision, the matter was one of considerable urgency.The National Union of Public Employees had for some time beentalcing direct action to secure the closure of pay beds and this was likely to intensify.    Moreover, the Confederation of Health ServiceEmployees, which had not hitherto been involved, had now indicated that they too would be taking direct action unless a statement of theGovernments intentions about the phasing out of private practice inthe National Health Service had been made by 8 May.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up a verybrief discussion, said that the Cabinet noted theneed for an early decision.    There was however not sufficient time to deal with thematter at that meeting, particularly in view of the implications for public expenditure.    The Secretary of State for Social services would no doubt take these into account in the discussions she wouldbe having with the Chief Secretary in the light of the Cabinetsearlier decisions about public expenditure generally.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting after the Easter Recess.PHASING OUTPRIVATEPRACTICEfrOM THENATIONALHEALTHSERVICE3
top SALARIES 4C The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thepEVlEW BODY Lord Chancellor (C(75) 38) drawing attention to certain anomaliesCONSEQUENTIALS&quot; which had arisen as a result of the decision of the Cabinet in thepreceding December to implement only part of the recommendationsof the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) in their report on top salaries.previous reference::C(74) 52ndonclusionsMinute 2THE LORD CHANCELLOR explained that there were certain posts,the pay of which was customarily linked with the pay of judicialposts and which were in practice indistinguishable from comparableposts dealt with in the TSRB report.    He could illustrate theanomalous position to which he wished to draw Cabinet!s attentionby the position of the Law Commissioners.    The Chairman, being a high court judge, had had his salary increased by the decision oflast December.    The Secretary of the Commission (who was anUnder Secretary in the Civil Service) had also received an increase by the same token.    But the Commissioners themselves had so farreceived none, with the result that they were now receiving less thanthe Secretary.    In his view this kind of anomaly was not a situationwhich should be allowed to continue, and he recommended that stepsbe taken to give consequential increases to the holders of the postslisted in the Annex to his memorandum.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Lord Chancellor was appealing against an earlier decision whichhad been taken by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.The3?e was a wide range of posts, the pay of which was fixed as a consequential of the posts covered in the TSRB report;  a numberof anomalies had arisen because of the decision in December to postpone any increases in the pay of nationalised industry postsuntil the receipt of the report of the Royal Commission on income distribution and Wealth.    However, there was a clear view in cabinet that it was not possible to agree increases for the postsreferred to by the Lord Chancellor in advance of the rest.The cabinet took note with approval of the Lord Presidentof the Council&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
5, THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that ong-,;..RENDUM 20 March the Cabinet had agreed that he should convene a meetingI ... later thai day of the Ministers immediately concerned to consider theIxtetiSJon of report by officials attached to C(75) 35 about two possible schemes forjraficbise enabling more members of the Armed Forces and government servants working abroad (ie Service voters) to vote in the referendum,Previous At present only about a quarter of Servicemen were on the register.Reference: Scheme A provided for a supplementary register on the basis of earlyCC(75) 15th declarations for next year&apos;s register, with special arrangements to conclusions, allow postal instead of proxy voting.    Scheme B would allow membersjinute 3 of the A.vmed Forces to vote in person in their units.A meettig of the Ministers concerned had been unable to reach adecision.    Some had argued that, by using one or other of the two schemes, provision should be made to enable more Service voters to^ote in the referendum.    Others had taken the view that it would be wrong to make an ill-prepared departure from the General Electionrules that might not, in the event, yield a bigger Service vote andmight delay the referendum.    However^ they had all agreed that the referendum Bill should be published on 26 March without any special provision for Service voters;  that he should report the position to theCabinet;  and that, if the Cabinet decided to make such a provision,the Government should move the necessary amendments in Committee.In discussion it was argued that both schemes, as well as being wrong in principle and uncertain in operation, would (because of the time required to implement them) make It more difficult to hold the referendum before 19 June;  and it now appeared desirable to hold the referendum as early as possible in June.    Moreover it would be wrong to depart from the existing arrangements without full discussion by a speaker&apos;s Conference,On the other hand it was pointed out that there was already strong pressure in Parliament for the enfranchisement of more members ofthe Armed Forces.    The Service authorities were confident that adequate arrangements could be made for Scheme B, in such a way asgreatly to increase the number of Servicemen and their wives whowould have a chance to vote.    This scheme (as distinct fromScheme A) would not prevent the referendum from being held on June if this date were finally preferred on general political grounds.In further discussion it was suggested that, notwithstanding the cabinet&apos;s decision on 13 March against postal votes for holidaymakers,there should be a free vote for Government supporters in the House ofCommons if amendments to the Bill providing for such postal voteswere moved in Committee.    Against this it was argued that the carrying of such amendments might delay the passage of the Bill inthe House of Commons and cause difficulties for the Government in theHouse of Lords,    It was right, as the Cabinet has agreed on 13 March,
to have a free vote on the national count because that would be a uniquearrangement for a unique occasion.    But, if holidaymakers were givenpostal votes in the referendum,, it was likely to prove impossible to deny them the same facilities in General Elections.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, summing up thediscussion, said that a majority of the Cabinet took the view that scheme B should be adopted for Servicemen and their wives.    TheCabinet accordingly agreed that he should arrange for appropriateenabling amendments to be moved by the Government to the referendum Bill in Committee.    Action should now be taken in theDepartments concerned to settle what detailed provisions for service voters should be made in the draft Referendum Order.    The Secretaryof State for Defence should make administrative arrangements as amatter of urgency to implement Scheme B and ensure that it would be effective if it were decided to hold the referendum as early as 5 June.These arrangements should be reported to the Home Secretary and himself.It was the view of a majority of the Cabinet that there should not be a free vote on the question of postal votes for holidaymakers.    TheCabinet accordingly reaffirmed their decision of 13 March and agreedthat steps should be taken to secure the defeat of any amendments tothe Referendum Bill on this issue.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Lord President ofthe CounciPs summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office26 March 19756
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO    39CABINETCONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 17th Conclusions, Minute 1Tuesday 25 March 1975 at 5. 00 pmPUBLICEXPENDITUREdeviousReference:CC(75) 16thConclusions,Minute 6The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C(75) 39) proposing a reduction of 1, 000 million in planned public expenditure in 1976-77;  and amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services (C(75) 37)seeking authority to announce the 1975-76 capital allocations to health authorities.In the resumed discussion it was again argued that, after the october 1974 election, the Government should have reviewed in depth their longer-term economic strategy.    This had nothappened.    The public expenditure cuts now proposed were onlyone item among a package of measures which needed to beconsidered more widely.    The cuts by their effects on subsidies and rents would involve breaches of the social contract and of theelection Manifesto and they would increase the level of unemploy-ment by up to 100, 000 above what it would otherwise have been.The presentation of such proposals was of very great importance,and there should be discussions with the trades unions in advance to get some kind of agreement;  otherwise the Governments claimto consult the unions would appear meaningless.    Such consultations should cover not only public expenditure but other elements in the strategy which should be put to the unions as a choice so that theyunderstood and accepted that lower council rents and higher food subsidies necessarily involved higher direct taxation.    The unions,and indeed the people of the country, needed to be faced with theineluctable choices;  if high levels of unemployment were to be avoided then there would have to be a much tougher version of thesocial contract.    The Budget statement should make clear thealternative scenarios to that envisaged in the Chancellors package,scenarios which might include a transitional employment subsidyand a basic poverty programme in return for greater wage restraint.    In this way it would be possible to demonstrate that theextent of the cuts needed in public expenditure was dependent uponthe extent to which the country was prepared to go along with alternative policies.    Unless something like this were publicly
presented, the chances of ever getting a tougher, mark 2 version of the social contract would be jeopardised.    In relation to thebalance of payments problem it was disturbing that the Chancellor&apos;sproposals appeared to do little about moving resources into the exporting industries.    There might be a case for temporary import restrictions of the kind used in both France and Italy; but it was important that they be transient otherwise they and other measures in the so-called siege economy could destroy the competitiveness ofBritish manufacturers.It was also argued that -a. In the light of the country&apos;s current economic difficulties it could be argued that the cuts proposed were much too small.    Admittedly some of the commitments in the Manifesto might suffer, but it was going too far to say they were being abandoned - the cut proposed wasonly 2 per cent of the total in one year, and although this would mean deferring some projects, the mostsensitive areas had been spared.b. It would be important for senior Ministers to consult closely with the Trades Union Congress (TUC)on the present situation and the strategy proposed fordealing with it.    The Government had a good record infulfilling its part of the social contract and there wasno denying that the major breaches of the contract had come from the unions.    Nor was it necessarily truethat the trades union movement would be so opposed tocuts in public expenditure as had been suggested;  on past experience they would prefer expenditure cuts to increases in direct taxation.c. Of the large spending programmes, only defence had been subjected to collective consideration by cabinet.    Given the extensive defence review whichhad just been completed, culminating in the publicationof a White Paper only a few days previously, the present proposal, as far as defence was concerned, was simplyan arbitrary cut which formed no part of a general plan.d. The Parliamentary situation today was not what itwas during the parallel experience of the 1960s.    TheGovernment had a much smaller overall majority in theHouse of Commons.    If the Government decided on cuts of the size now proposed, they must expect opposition from their own backbenchers which would make thepassage of essential legislation difficult.    For thisreason it was necessary for the whole strategy to bediscussed with the TUC and the Confederation of BritishIndustry  (QBI),    and for the whole Labour movement andthe nation to be shown the need for a tough strategy.
In further discussion it was argued that unemployment in theUnited Kingdom was lower, and rising more slowly, than in anyother major industrialised country:  the social contract had notbeen fulfilled in terms of wage restraint and a good case could bemade for a more draconian package even than that which had been proposed.    It needed also to be remembered that in the last year the social wage had been increased by 12 per cent in real terms,at a time when private consumption had been able to go up by only  per cent.    It could be argued that, while public expenditure cutswere taken seriously by the political parties and the trades unions,they made far less impression on the general public.    It was of vital importance to make clear that whatever unpleasant featxiresthe Budget contained, it might have been possible to mitigate them had there been lower wage settlements.    It was impossible toreflate with the present level of wage increases.    The expenditure cuts proposed were essential as a meens of coping with theposition as it was now.    Even so, such macro-economic measures could not deal with all our economic difficulties; micro-economic measures to stimulate exports, restructure industry, retrainworkers, were needed as well.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up the discussion, said that itwas clear that a majority of the members of Cabinet were infavour of the proposals put forward by the Chancellor of theExchequer.    The structure of his Budget as a whole could not beput into commission, but no doubt in framing his Budget statement the would take into account the points which had been made in discussion.    These would also be reported to the Prime Minister.Bilateral discussions between the Chief Secretary, treasury and the individual spending Ministers should proceed as a matterof urgency and there would be a further discussion by the cabinet of the distribution of the overall reduction in public expenditure during the week beginning 7 April.    On the question of the capitalallocations to Regional Health Authorities in 1975-76, if theannouncement of these would in no way affect the ability of theSecretary of State for Social Services to offer her share of the1976-77 cuts, then she could write to the health authoritiesaccordingly.    If this were not the case, she should consult theChief Secretary, Treasury on what could be done.The Cabinet -1.    Took note with approval of the Lord President ofthe Council&apos;9 summiscg up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report back in the second week of April on the outcome of the bilateral discussions with the spending Ministers.3
3.    Authorised the Secretary of State for social services to announce the capital allocations to regional Health Authorities for 1975-76 providedshe were satisfied that this would in no way impairher ability to make her share of the agreed 1976-77reductions; but to consult the Chief Secretary,Treasury on what action to take if she were not sosatisfied.Cabinet Office26 March 1975
