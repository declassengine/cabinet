t[is DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys government copy NO O /cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 22nd conclusions tuesday 22 April 1975 at 11.30 amBRITISH The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theLEYLAND Exchequer (C(75) 50) on the future of the British Leyland MotorMOTOR Corporation (BL);  a memorandum by the Attorney General on theCORPORATION   legal aspects (C(75) 51);  and a note by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (C(75) 52) on the arrangements forinforming the Commission of the European Economic Community.THE PRIME MINISTER said that when BL had approached theGovernment for financial assistance in December 1974 it had beenagreed that a high level team led by Sir Don Ryder, IndustrialAdviser to the Government, should be set up to make recommendations on the future of BL, and a group of the ministers immediately concerned had been formed under the chairmanship ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to oversee this task.    The RyderReport had been received on 27 March.    It was a long and detailed study by experts;  it raised many wide-ranging issties as well asdetailed points of procedure.    There had been speculation - for themost part inaccurate - about the nature and content of the report and it was important to make an early announcement.    In themeantime it was of the utmost importance that the strictest securityshould be preserved about the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the decisionseventually reached.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the group under &apos;his chairmanship comprised the Secretaries of State for Employment^Industry and Trade and the Attorney General; they had discussed the report with Sir Don Ryder in considerable detail.    Therecommendations in his paper represented the unanimous views ofthe Ministerial Group,The Ryder Report was a highly professional piece of work carriedout by a distinguished team.    The Ministerial Group had broadlyaccepted the conclusions of the report and had recommended that itshould be accepted as a basis for future Government policy towards
BL: nevertheless Ministers had recognised that there were majorrisks involved.    First, the assessment of the firm&apos;s performancedepended critically upon its market penetration.    The Ryder teamhad assumed that the BL share of the home market would remainconstant but a 25 per cent improvement in BL&apos;s sales in western europe would take place over the next seven years.    This had to beachieved in the face of very severe competition.    Secondly, thescale of investment over the years 1975 to 1982 was immense;  BLwould be expected to spend annual amounts that were between nineand ten times more than in any previous year.    The physical task of absorbing investment on this scale was daunting.    However, a major reason for BL&apos;s poor performance in the past was outdatedequipment, and the only chance of it attaining its objectives lay inmajor new investment,    Thirdly, the financial needs of BL over theyears 1975 to 1982 were estimated at  2, 800 million;   the Ryder teambelieved that half of this requirement could be generated internally,but it had to be recognised that the estimates of profit were highlyuncertain and the Government might have to find much more than 1, 400 million.    Fourthly, the productivity record of BL had beenappalling.    Much of this could be attributed to bad management atthe top, and the Ryder team had gone out of their way to emphasisetire high quality of middle management.    Nevertheless, ifovermanning were to be reduced and improved co-operation by theworkers brought about, a major effort would be needed on the partof the new management to change the views and attitude of theworkforce.There were in addition questions affecting the economy of thecountry as a whole:  an investment of  2, 800 million over the nextseven years implied a rate of expenditure equivalent to 5 per cent of total expenditure in manufacturing industry: there was no certainty that the motor industry was the best place to invest thesesums: the return on this investment would be poor, even in the view ofthe Ryder team.    These wider aspects had been considered by a group of senior officials under the Permanent Secretary to theTreasury.Although acceptance of the Ryder recommendations involved a significant risk, the Ministerial Group had seen no practical alternative to this course.    To abandon BL would place in jeopardythe jobs of 800, 000 people directly or indirectly employed by BL;the collapse of BL would also have severe repercussions on exports and imports of cars.    But the Governments commitment to BLwould have to be carefully formulated: on the one hand it wouldhave to carry conviction with overseas customers and ensure the effective co-operation of the management and workforce in keeping the firm going.    On the other hand the initial financial commitmentmust be clearly limited and there must be checkpoints at which to review the plans and make major adjustments if these proved
necessary over the next seven years.    Annexed to his paper wasa draft statement which the Secretary of State for Industry might make on Thursday 24 April when it was envisaged the report wouldbe published.    This sought to preserve the delicate balance and toemphasise that the Government were not prepared to finance BL atany cost, particularly in relation to wage demands.Against this general background, the group of Ministers had madea number of specific recommendations.    First, that theGovernment, should accept the Ryder Report as the basis for future policy towards BL.    Secondly, that they should announce their intention to take a major shareholding in the company;  should agree to underwrite an equity subscription of  200 million andshould offer to buy out the existing shareholders on the termsrecommended in the Ryder Report.    Thirdly, the Governmentshould stand ready to provide  500 million of additional capital upto 1978, in the form of either long-term loan or additional equity.Fourthly, no commitment should be made at the present time forthe provision of finance for the period after 1978,    The plan wasthat the Secretary of State for Industry should see the Board of BLon the following day, with the prime purpose of securing their co-operation.    Later that day the Trades Union Congress and representatives of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions should also be seen.    On 24 April the Secretary of Statefor Industry would make his statement in Parliament and simultaneously publish an edited version of the P/yder Report,from which commercially sensitive information and anythingpotentially libellous about the existing management would have beendeleted.    He envisaged that there would be a debate early in Mayon an Affirmative Resolution to give a further guarantee of 50 miUion to enable BL to increase their bank borrowing as an interim measure while the long-term financial arrangements were determined.    The need for this further interim help would be a factor in securing the BoardS early compliance.    On thelegislative aspects, there would be advantage in seeking to proceed by agreement;  any compulsion would require a hybrid Bill, andthe immediate ambit of enabling legislation could be limited.    the funds required in 1976 and beyond might possibly come from theallotment made to the National Enterprise Board (not) which could,this were agreed, be increased from the present  1, 000 million to  1, 200 million,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he endorsed the Chancellor of the Exchequers conclusions.    He also supported the Chancellors reservations about the risks which the acceptanceof the Ryder strategy brought in its train.    It would be essential tomonitor carefully the achievements of the new company in relationto their targets, and to worker co-operation.    The Government
should emphasise their firm intention to acquire the majorityshareholding in the company.    It would otherwise be impossible todefend a decision to invest  l, 400 million of public money in a company with an equity value of less than  60 million.    This was alsopresentationally necessary in relation to the European economic community, since they would require confirmation that we wereincreasing public ownership and not subsidising private industry.If the Ryder scheme to achieve a controlling interest for theGovernment were unsuccessful, the long-term objective could stillbe met by making the  500 million additional capital in the form of equity or convertible loan,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that there wereoverwhelming reasons for keeping BL going.    If the companyfailed, there would be a great influx of car imports,    BL had great export opportunities if they chose the right strategy.    Hequestioned however the wisdom of placing too much emphasis on theEuropean market.    There were many outstanding markets for BL&apos;sproducts, particularly trucks and buses, outside Europe,    the strategy however would be for the new management to devise inconsultation with the not,THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that the Ryder Report envisaged the equity base of BL being enlarged by a rights issue of 200 million, which the Government would underwrite.    TheGovernment would also undertake to buy out the existing shareholdersat lOp a share - the same price as the rights issue.    The Ryderteam believed that relatively few shareholders would take up therights issue, and so the Government would become a majorshareholder.    Existing legislation did not contain powers to giveeffect to these proposals, and a short enabling Bill, of the type usedto bring Rolls-Royce into public ownership, would be needed.    Thiscourse however depended heavily upon the willingness of the BLBoard to accept the scheme and to recommend it to shareholders.Even then the Companies Act required the scheme to be endorsed by a majority in number of the shareholders and creditors present at a meeting, representing three-quarters of the value of each classof members and creditors affected by the scheme.    After this,the scheme had to be submitted to the courts, and it would be for a judge to decide whether the scheme was acceptable^ and to hearobjections.    The case might even go to appeal.    If the Cabinet were unwilling to rely so heavily upon the reaction of the Board of BL,and in particular on       wholehearted support from Lord Stokes,they might see advantage in introducing a Bill which would take overthe courts&apos; functions under the Companies Act and give thereconstruction scheme statutory backing.    This would require ahybrid Bill, which, although less controversial than full scalenationalisation, would still not be enacted until the next Session of
Parliament.    If the BL Board were prepared to support the Ryderscheme and recommend it to the shareholders, he advisedfollowing the normal route laid down by the Companies Act, withan enabling Bill.    If however the Board were opposed, there seemedno alternative to a hybrid Bill, which would inevitably lengthen the timetable.In discussion, it was argued that the Cabinet should not be expected,without studying the Ryder Report itself, to endorse without furtherconsideration recommendations which pre-empted resources on sucha massive scale and which had profound implications for public sector borrowing.    Ministers had been required to make major cutsin their spending programmes in order to reduce public expenditure,but they were now being asked to take the Ryder Report on trust and toback with  1, 400 million of public money a company with a nominalvalue of about  60 million.    Even on the assumptions in the report,there would be no adequate return on this money for seven years.The effect on overseas confidence might be a factor in supporting BL,but overseas confidence would also be affected by a large increasein public sector borrowing.    It was unrealistic to suppose that theGovernment could limit their commitment to the initial injection of funds.    The co-operation of the BL Board was being assumed, butthe Board had responsibilities to their shareholders.    An offer oflOp a share, whether to sell out to the Government or to take up a newrights issue was ingenious, but it ignored the fact that the rights issue would be in a company controlled by the Government and not operated on commercial lines.    The shareholder&apos;s interest, for example,might best be served by shutting down plants with bad prospects andconcentrating on the specialist products which sold well.    It wasspecious to say that the BL shares were worthless;  in many cases,the shareholders had paid 45p or more for them, and there were many small shareholders, including share clubs formed amongst BLemployees, who would look to the BL Board for a lead on where their interest lay.Against this, it was argued strongly that the team led bySir Don Ryder was extremely well qualified to reach the bestjudgment on BL&apos;s future.    Further delay and uncertainty would damage that future, not least because of continuing and misleadingleaks in the Press.    There was wide agreement that although there were grave risks involved there was no real alternative to accepting the Ryder Report, but the Government would have tomonitor and control the performance of management and workers to ensure that the firm did not slip back into its old ways withfrequent industrial disputes and overmanning.r-::: IT;;-/
In further discussion, the following main points were made -general a,, The scheme proposed gave shareholders a fairchoice: if they believed their shares were under-valued,they could stay in and, if they wished, take up the rightsissue;  otherwise they could accept the Governments offer to buy their shares.    Although the Ryder team did not recommend Government control as such, they believed that many shareholders would sell out to the Government and thata sufficient number would not take up the rights issue so thatthe Government would emerge as the majority shareholder.b. The need to reduce overmanning was recognised,but it was important that proposals to achieve this shouldhave full regard to the claims of the assisted areas,particularly in Scotland and V/ales.    The Government, asthe majority shareholder, could influence the choice oflocations for new plant or the expansion or contraction ofexisting plants.c. The draft statement proposed for the Secretary ofState for Industry to make in the House of Commons requiredsubstantial alteration.    Not only should it include a suitableacknowledgment to the work of the Ryder team, but it wouldbe appropriate to mention the skills Lord Stokes had shownas a salesman for BL products and a spokesman for thecompany abroad.    The statement should also be more specific about the conditions the Government were attaching to providing financial helpj, and about the methods open tothem for ensuring compliance.    It should be drafted in morepolitical terms, to pose the stark alternative to support which would mean receivership for BL and put nearly one million jobs in jeopardy.    The obligations of the workers should be stated in tough and unequivocal terms:  anycomparison with nationalised industries should be deleted.d. Improved industrial relations at BL were a key tosuccess: it was worth considering whether a special teamto resolve disputes, on the lines adopted in the motor industry during the previous Labour Administration might be set up.The team&apos;s activity need not be confined to BL, but it couldserve for the whole of the industry.
Legislatione, Although it might be necessary, as a contingencymeasure, to prepare a hybrid Bill, the first choice shouldbe to follow the normal procedure under the Companies Act,and to take powers in a short enabling Bill to allow theGovernment to purchase the existing shares by agreement and to underwrite the rights issue.    If this failed, throughthe intransigence of the Board or the shareholders, it might then be better to go for outright nationalisation using ahybrid Bill, but it was not necessary to make this decision at the present time.The European Economic Communityf. It would be necessary to consult the Commission ofthe European Economic Community (e.c.); there were noobjections to the course set out in C(75) 52 being followed,but it would be wrong to give the Commission a copy of theedited version of the report, which contained the price atwhich the Government would offer to buy shares and othersensitive information, until the Cabinet had received copies,which would be on the following day.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although the Cabinet recognised the doubts and uncertainties involvedin accepting a report which forecast seven years ahead, and althoughstrong arguments had been advanced for delaying a decision, theCabinet agreed that the conclusions of the Ryder Report set out inparagraph 2 of C(75) 50 should form the basis of future policy towards BL and endorsed the other recommendations in that paper.Any delay would create an unacceptable risk of a leak; it was particularly important that their discussion and the conclusions reached should remain secret and they should not be passed on to ministers not in the Cabinet.    The Chancellor of the exchequer should investigate the possibility of suspending dealings in BL sharesforthwith, or at least before the report was given to the BL Board.There would be a major scandal if any leak led to share pricesincreasing due to prior knowledge of the proposals the Governmenthad now agreed.    Subject to finding a way of avoiding this, theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Industry should seethe Board of British Ley land on the following day and should seek to secure their co-operation in the implementation of the Ryderscheme.    The Cabinet saw presentational advantages in Lord Stokesremaining in an honorary position in the restructured company.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should arrange for theCommission of the e.c. to be informed forthwith of theGovernments intentions, but they should not be given a copy of the
se :retreport until the following day, when the Secretary of State for industry should arrange to circulate advance copies to the Cabinet.    TheSecretary of State for Industry should also amend the draft statement in the light of the points made in discussion, and clear it with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself.    The statement should be made on 24 April.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for the Ministerial Group to give further consideration tothe legislation required if the BL Board refused to recommend theRyder proposals to the shareholders.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.28 Endorsed the conclusions of the Ryder Reportset out in paragraph 2 of C(75) 50 as a basis for future policy towards BL and also endorsed the other recommendations in that paper.3. Invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to investigate the question of suspending sharedealings in British Leyland.4.        Invited the Secretary of State for Industry -i. to see, on the following day, theChairman and the Managing Director andsubsequently the whole Board of british leyland to explain the Government&apos;s decision and to seek their co-operation in implementingtheir proposals;  and subsequently to seerepresentatives of the Trades Union congress and of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions;ii. to circulate to the Cabinet an advancecopy of the edited version of the Ryder Report;iii. to amend the draft statement in the lightof the discussion and to clear it with the PrimeMinister, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer;iv. to arrange, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, for a debate,early in May, on an Affirmative resolution to authorise further guarantees for bankborrowing by British Leyland.
5. Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to arrange for the Commission of theEuropean Economic Community to be informed of the Government&apos;s intentions as indicated inthe summing up.6. Invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to arrange for the Ministerial Group on british leyland to give further consideration to the formof legislation required if the British LeylandBoard refused to recommend the Ryder proposals to their shareholders.Cabinet Office22 April 1975
