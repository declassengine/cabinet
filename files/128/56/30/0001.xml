parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.Aircraft andShipbuildingIndustries bill the Cabinet were informed that, since it would not be possiblefor the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill to become lawduring the present Session, the Secretary of State for Industryproposed, after his forthcoming meeting with representatives ofthe Trade Unions concerned, to make a statement in the Houseindicating that the Bill could not proceed this Session because ofthe very heavy pressure on Parliamentary time.    The statement would however emphasise that the Government attached thegreatest importance to it and would give it high priority in thenext Session.    In the light of this there were strong arguments against proceeding with an early Second Reading.    A finaldecision about this should however depend on whether other wayscould be found to end the uncertainty which was at presentdelaying investment decisions in the industries, and to enablethe trade unions to bring forward the proposals which they had intended to put to the Organisation Committees which would beset up after the Bill received its Second Reading.Pay of Membersof parliament the PRIME MINISTER said that the report of the Top salaries review Body (TSRB) which he had recently received recommendedvery substantial increases in the pay and allowances of Membersof Parliament.    He had discussed its handling with the ministers immediately concerned and the main conclusion reached was thatthe Governments response to the report could not be settled until their overall anti-inflation policy had been agreed.    It was clearthat the pay of Members of Parliament could not be considered in isolation, and that whatever national guidelines emerged would almost certainly have to apply also to Members of Parliament.Allowances were however in a different position and here it shouldbe possible to take a much more sympathetic attitude to the TSRBrecommendations.    The immediate problem was the timing^ of publication of the report.    The choices were, first, to publish nowwithout comment; second, to publish now with a government statement indicating that though the recommendations dealing withallowances could be considered as they stood those on pay wouldhave to be modified in the light of whatever national pay guidelineswere agreed; and third, to postpone both publication and statementuntil the national package had been settled.    The third optionwould involve holding back the report until the second half of July.
In discussion there was genersl agreement that it would be undesirable to publish the report without a substantive government statement.    In favour of early publication, it was argued that astatement on the lines proposed by the Prime Minister would bewell received by the public and would be understood by Membersof Parliament (though the position should of course be explained in advance to Government backbench supporters).    And the longer the report was held back the greater the danger of a seriousleak - it was significant that some information about recommenda-tions already appeared to be circulating.    On the other hand itwas argued that until an overall anti-inflationary package had beenagreed it was doubtful whether a time could be found for publicationwhich would not involve some danger of prejudicing dicussionswith the interests concerned;  and this should be regarded as the over-riding consideration.    It was however suggested that publication on the same day as the national guidelines were announced would be open to the particular objection that it wouldthen scarcely be possible to allow to Members of Parliament agreater pay increase than was strictly permitted by the nationalguidelines; but on merits there was a good case for allowingthem more - though not the full TSRB recommendation - havingregard to the fact that their pay had been unchanged for 3^ yearsand that they were therefore one of the very few groups which hadreceived none of the pay increases which had been permissibleunder the various incomes policy provisions which had appliedduring that period.    In consequence a number of government supporters were suffering genuine financial hardship.In further discussion, the following points were made:-a. There was a strong case for Members1 secretaries to be paid by the Government or by the House authorities,rather than by Members themselves.    The present arrangements were unsatisfactory in that they were opento abuse yet did not remove the possibility of some members being substantially out of pocket.b. It was questionable whether the Government should accept the TSRB recommendation that Members1 pay should not be linked to that of an agreed analogue (forexample, Civil Service Assistant Secretaries or a Houseof Commons official grade) but instead be reviewed every two years.    It w as doubtful whether the Review Bodysystem worked to Members&apos; advantage, because the time was almost never ripe for agreeing the substantial pay increases which could be expected to result from reviewsmade at relatively long intervals.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would be undesirable to publish thereport without a statement by the Government.    They had howevernot decided whether the balance of advantage favoured early or later publication, and the discussion would be resumed at their meeting in the following week.    If however there were before then a serious leak of the reports recommendations, a decision whether to publish at once, and if so what should be said inthe accompanying statement, would be taken by himself inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council, the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Home Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for employment and the Chief Whip.    The Lord President should keep in mindwhat had been said in the course of discussion about arrangementsfor meeting the cost of secretarial services and about the TSRB&apos;decision to recommend that Members1 pay should not be linked with that of some outside analogue.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.THE CHIEF WHIP reported that the Chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and he had drawn up a listof Labour Party nominations for the European Assembly.    the list had been discussed in the Liaison Committee and would beput to a meeting of the PLP that afternoon.    The list ofnominations had been designed to provide a strong representation.Although, on Committee of Selection criteria, the Labour party were strictly speaking entitled to 19 places in a total british delegation of 36, it had been decided to put forward 18nominations, 6 of whom were peers.    Using the same criteria,the Liberal Party would be entitled to 1 place in the delegation and other minor parties to 1 place.    The Liberal Party had made representations that they should retain their existing2 places but he had made plain that this would require areduction in the 16 places allocated to the Conservative Party.In discussion it was suggested that although with the addition of18 Labour Party members the Socialist group would become thelargest group in the European Assembly, there was a possibility that the Conservative and the Christian Democrat groups in theAssembly might combine, and so equal the Socialist groupaugmented by 18 Labour Party members.    It might therefore have been preferable to insist on the full 19 Labour Party places,to ensure that the Socialist group was strongly placed to obtainCommittee chairmanships.    However this possibility had become apparent only after the basis of allocation of places had been settled in discussion with the other parties.Representation at theEuropean AssemblyPreviousReference:CC(75) 26thConclusions,Minute 3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the list of nominations as drawn up by the chairman of thePliP and the Chief Whip, and approved by the Liaison Committee,should be submitted to the meeting of the PLP that afternoon.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.
FOREIGNAFFAIRSRhodesiapreviousReference:CC(75) 27thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYinformed the Cabinet that, following the independence ofMozambique, he planned to announce the end of the Beira patrol.This decision had been taken in the knowledge that the MozambiqueGovernment would not allow oil to pass through its territory to rhodesia, although it was doubtful whether any formal undertaking to this effect could be given.The Cabinet -1.Took note.UgandaPreviousReference:CC(75) 28thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that president Amin had told General Sir Chandos Blair on his departure that the British community in Uganda would now be watched as potential spies.    The next morning he had summonedthe staff of the British High Commission to his presence and itwas feared that he might be intending to imprison or deport them.However, in a typically unpredictable manner, he had receivedthem cordially and had handed over to the Acting HighCommissioner his second message to The Queen.    This had proved to be slightly more conciliatory than his first message.The Prime Minister had accordingly sent him a further message, building on these conciliatory elements and repeatingthat provided Mr Hills was reprieved, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary was ready to go to Uganda and discussthe whole range of issues between the two countries.    this message had been made public by Radio Uganda, which was an encouraging sign.    There was now some pressure on PresidentAmin and we awaited his response.The Cabinet -2.
