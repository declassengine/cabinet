1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.    The debate on the Motion to take note of the Town and Country Planning(Industrial Development Certificates Exemption) (No. 2) Order,which was to take place on 25 February, would need careful handling because of the strong feelings aroused amongst LondonMembers of Parliament,    The Government spokesman wouldhave to show sympathy with the case for considering special measures to improve employment prospects in certain parts ofLondon - for example, the dock areas now awaiting redevelopment.The Cabinet were informed that a difficult position had been created by an amendment, which had been adopted by the Houseof Lords, reinstating the Lords Hybrid procedures in caseswhere private rights were infringed by land acquisition.    TheBill was due to have its third reading immediately, and theintention was that Commons consideration of Lords amendmentsshould take place on 26 February.    If the House of Commonsdisagreed with the amendment which had been made it was by no means certain that the House of Lords would acquiesce.It had been suggested that a compromise might be found underwhich the hybrid procedures would continue, subject to a stricttime limit; but the Ministers concerned had reservations about this because of the delay which would result.    It must however be borne in mind that substantially greater delay would arise from the fact that Orders for the acquisition of land would requireaffirmative resolution and therefore could not at present be madewhile Parliament was in recess.    It was however possible thatthis difficulty could be overcome by an amendment of theStanding Orders of the House of Lords, though this would not be practicable unless the hybrid procedures were restored.    Itwas for consideration whether there should be a short postpone-ment of the Bill&apos;s third reading, so as to allow time for theMinisters concerned to decide how best to proceed.    Whateverconclusions were reached would have implications for other legislation - for example, the Industry Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat the issues involved required further examination.    TheLord President, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, should therefore consider urgently how to proceedand inform him of the conclusions reached.The Cabinet -1.      Took note,  with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.1h-u-tmtit.
2.      Invited the Lord President of the Council,in consultation with the Secretaries of State forEnergy, Industry and Scotland,  the Lord Privy Seal,the Deputy Chief Whip and the Chief Whip, Houseof Lords, to proceed as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.The Cabinet were informed that problems had arisen inconnection with an amendment recently adopted by the House ofCommons, against the Governments advice, which was intendedto raise the earnings limit by stages to a substantially higher level.The amendment was in fact defective and would have the effect of abolishing the earnings limit altogether after 1977 or 1978.    Itwas therefore proposed to put down an amendment in the Houseof Lords which would have the effect of securing what the House ofCommons had in fact intended - ie to raise the earnings limit by stages to  50 and then enable it to remain at that level unless anduntil varied by Regulations made under existing powers.    Therewas some danger that such an amendment might provoke a counter-amendment, which could be carried, providing for theimmediate abolition of the earnings limit, but on balance this risk seemed worth running.The Cabinet -3.       Took note.The Cabinet considered the handling of the debate, planned for27 February, on the European Economic Community (e.c.) draft regulations providing for the establishment of a Regional Fund.The present intention was that the debate should be on a Motion totake note of the Commission^ documents and of further develop-ments to be brought to the attention of the House; but it was argued that a debate on this basis would be inappropriate becausefinal decisions, which would be effective for the next three years,were expected to be taken at the meeting of the Council ofMinisters which was being held at the beginning of March, so thatthe matter would not again be coming before the House ofCommons.    The House should therefore be given an opportunityof recording a definite decision on the merits of the proposals.Objection could be raised to them on the grounds that theEuropean Commission would have power to supervise someaspects of British regional policy, and that it would not bepossible to make use of the Fund for meeting expenditure on some
of the Governments regional policies. In these circumstances a debate on a modified &quot;take note&quot; Motion was bound to be regardedas a procedural device intended to prevent the House of Commonsfrom recording a decision, and therefore to make the proceedingsmore difficult than they need be.As against this, it was argued that although a case could in principlebe made out for holding the debate on a Motion expressing approvalof the proposals, this course could not properly be adopted inadvance of the receipt of the forthcoming report of the ProcedureCommittee.    It would be undesirable to seek to defer considerationof the proposals by the Council of Ministers until after that report hadbeen received, because of the importance which some members ofthe Community, in particular Ireland and Italy, attached to the earlyestablishment of the Regional Fund.    But the proposed terms of the motion were in fact wholly proper:  there could be no objection tothe House of Commons being asked to take note of revised proposalswhich were approved by the relevant Ministers, followingnegotiations during which they had acted in accordance with objec-tives     which had been agreed by the Cabinet.    As regards theobjections of policy, some relatively minor changes could be made,without much difficulty, which would enable the regulations to operatesatisfactorily.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theestablishment of a Regional Fund was not of major importance to us;but it would be undesirable to seek to delay matters in view of theimportance which seme other members of the Community attachedto it.    This was not a subject which was at issue in renegotiationand it had not been referred to in the Labour Party!s election manifesto.    Moreover, it appeared that it would be possible to makethe relatively small administrative changes which would enable theCommunity regulations to operate satisfactorily.    On that basis,and having regard to the modifications to the Commission^ original proposals which had been secured as a result of recent negotiations,it would be appropriate that the debate in the House of commons should, as proposed, be on the basis of a Motion to take note of theCommission^ documents and of further developments brought to theattention of the House,The Cabinet -4.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of their discussion.
::liamentary THE PRIME MINISTER said that the election of a new Leader of the;1tegy Opposition was likely to create a changed position in Parliament,which could make the handling of Government business moredifficult.    It was not in the Governments interest to bring about aconfrontation and he proposed to continue his practice ofanswering Questions in the spirit in which they had been asked.    Itwould be desirable in all Parliamentary proceedings to concentratediscussion on policy questions and to seek to elicit from theOpposition what their own policies were on the subject underdiscussion.    This was likely to be particularly important in relationto economic and monetary matters where divisions amocgOpposition supporters might become apparent.The Cabinet -5. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s statement.4
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the Foreign ardCommonwealth Secretary had enjoyed an exceptionally warm andattentive reception throughout their recent visit to the Soviet Union.The Joint Statement which he and Mr Brezhnev had signed at the endof the visit was a substantial and important document.    It was clearthat the Soviet leadership had taken a political decision to improve their relations with us both on grounds of mutual bilateral interestand as part of their policy of detente with the West.    They had expressed the wish to widen contacts between the two countries,and not only at the higher levels.    The prospects for increasing our exports to the Soviet Union had been enhanced.    We had not come under pressure to make concessions which could be damaging to the interests of our allies.    An incidental but not unimportantbenefit was that Mr Brezhnev had been led to redefine theexpression &quot;peaceful co-existence&quot; which had hitherto formed partof the jargon of the international class struggle.    This change wasreflected in the text of the Joint Statement.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s statement.5
europeaneconomiccommunityreferendumpreviousReference:CC(75) 8thConclusions,Minite 33. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(75) 19), to which was attached a draft white Paper on the referendum about membership of the european economic Community (e.c.),THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the draft White Paper took account of the previous discussions in Cabinet about the referendum,A number of sections included alternative passages in order toenable the Cabinet to reach a conclusion on the questions which hadnot previously been resolved.    The draft put forward three alternative versions of the wording on the ballot paper.    On theGovernments own information activities, the draft had beenprepared on the basis that there was agreement that the Governmentwould issue a popular version of the White Paper on the outcome ofthe renegotiation and on the Governments recommendation,together with an explanation of the referendum arrangements.The Cabinet now needed to decide whether in addition theGovernment should issue a factual pamphlet about the e.c. andstatements of the opposite points of view about membership of the eec.    The Cabinet would also wish to consider the proposals tobe made in respect of the activities of outside bodies.    Subject to decisions on these points, he proposed that the White Paper shouldbe published on 26 February, with a view to a debate in the Houseof Commons on 6 March or early in the week beginning 10 March,In discussion of the wording on the ballot paper it was argued thatthe question on the ballot paper would be more neutral if it askedwhether we should &quot;be&quot; rather than &quot;stay&quot; in the Common Market,as in the third version in the draft.    But &quot;be&quot; was misleading,since it might suggest that the question was whether we should have joined the e.c. in the first place, and &quot;Common Market&quot; mightimply that we could opt out of particular aspects of the Community,such as the common agricultural policy.    On balance it seemedpreferable that the question should ask whether &quot;the United kingdom should stay in the European Community&quot;, as in the second versionin the draft.    This version represented the balance of view amongthe organisations which the Lord President had consulted.    the alternatives, together with a number of other variants, would nodoubt be raised in the debates in Parliament,Discussion of Government Information activities showedsubstantial agreement with the view that the Government should issue a popular version of the proposed White Paper explaining the outcome of the renegotiation and the Governments recommendation.This popular version should also explain the mechanics of the referendum.    In addition the Government should ensure thatstatements giving the opposing points of view were readily availableto the voters.    These statements should, if possible, appear in
the name of the two umbrella organisations in the campaign.    it seemed unnecessary to issue separate material giving factual information about the Community.There was a difference of view on the extent and form of thematerial to be distributed to each household.    It was argued that itwas inappropriate for the popular version of the White Paper to be distributed in this way.    On the analogy of a General Election,each household should be given a statement of view by the opposingsides; if, in addition, the Governments recommendation was included, the course advocated by the Government would app3ar toreceive twice the publicity.    Against this, it was argued that the analogy of a General Election was not entirely apt.    TheGovernment had conducted the renegotiation, and it would be quitewrong if a Government distribution of material to each householddid not include the Governments own account of the terms they had secured and of the conclusions they drew.    The campaigningorganisations would tend to concentrate on the basic issue of membership: the Government were in the best position to explain to the electorate the terms which had been renegotiated.    On balance,therefore, the distribution to households should include a popularversion of the White Paper, together with an explanation of themechanics of the referendum.    The statements by the campaigningorganisations setting out the two sides of the case should be delivered at the same time, but not included in the same documentas the popular version of the White Paper.In discussion of absent voting it was pointed out that many membersof the Services who were abroad would in practice not be registeredto vote and would be excluded from the referendum.    Representationshad also been made on behalf of other people working abroad, notonly in e.c. countries.    Although there appeared to be practicaldifficulties in dealing with these cases, further consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of making some arrangement to give thempostal votes.    There could also be pressure for postal votes for people absent on holiday, particularly if the referendum timetableslipped.    Rather than prolong the uncertainty by deferring the referendum until after the summer holidays, it might be advisable to keep open the option of the July date, though the concession of apostal vote to holiday-makers could have repercussions for electionsgenerally.It was argued that so far as the information activities of outside bodies were concerned great care should be taken to preventsubsequent resentment over the referendum result on the groundthat one of the two campaigning organisations had greater resourcesthan the other.    Although no general view on this point had emerged from the bodies so far consulted, a strong case could be made out7-[i    :v&quot;;.&quot;..:&apos;.
for giving a small Exchequer subvention to the two sides in the campaign, provided that the organisations to receive the moneycould be satisfactorily identified.    The question should be raised on this basis in the White Paper, and the Treasury should now be consulted about the amount of money to be allocated.In addition the White Paper should propose that the majororganisations and interests should disclose the money they had bothreceived and spent for the purposes of the campaign.    Thispassage should be in sufficiently general terms to cover a possiblerequirement for companies to disclose such information to theirshareholders.In view of these measures it was not necessary to propose a banon paid advertisements.    The Lord Presidents consultations had shown no general support for such a ban.    Television advertisementswould be prohibited under existing legislation.It was reported that satisfactory discussions were taking place,within the inter-party machinery for political broadcasts, about the&quot;referendum broadcasts&quot; which the British Broadcasting corporation and the Independent Broadcasting Authority proposed to arrangeduring the campaign.    A provisional bid had been made for ministerial broadcasts, which would involve a right of reply.    the broadcasting organisations had confirmed that they would take special care in their news and feature programmes to ensure a balance between the opposing points of view, and they would welcome the formulation of ground rules by the inter-party committee.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the White Paper should propose the secondversion in C(75) 19 of the wording to be included on the ballot paper.The Lord President should indicate, in his lobby conference and inthe debate in the House of Commons, that this version represented the broad consensus of view which had emerged from his consultations,but should mention the main variants which had been suggested andwhich would no doubt be discussed in the debate.    The White paper should state that the Government proposed to distribute to eachhousehold a popular version of the White Paper giving the outcome of the renegotiations and the Governments recommendation, and also an explanation of the mechanics of the referendum;  and that, at thesame time, but not in the same document, each household would receive a statement written by the campaigning organisations of the opposing points of view on membership of the e.c..    The white paper should not exclude the possibility of postal voting byServicemen and others working abroad.    The Home Secretary, inconsultation with the Lord President and the other ministers concerned, should consider whether a practicable system could be
devised for these cases; he should also consider contingency planning on a confidential basis for postal votes for holiday-makers,so that a July date for the referendum did not have to be excluded,though the repercussions of this extension of postal voting would need to be carefully considered.    The Y/hite Paper should indicatethat the question of a subvention for the campaigning organisationswas being examined, but that such a subvention would depend onsatisfactory arrangements being made to identify the recipientorganisations.    The Lord President should pursue this matter further in consultation with his colleagues directly concerned.The paragraphs about disclosure of expenditure should be writtenin slightly more general terms, to take account of the points madein discussion.    The White Paper should not propose any ban onpaid advertisements beyond the existing ban in respect of televisionadvertisements.    Subject to amendments to meet these points andother drafting points, the Lord President should arrange for thepublication of the White Paper on 26 February.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2. Authorised the publication of the white paper attached to C(75) 19, amended inaccordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.Cabinet Office20 February 1975
