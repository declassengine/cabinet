: parliamentary: affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary would be leaving London on27 April to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in Jamaica and would then visit Washington for discussions with president Ford and Dr Kissinger:  they would therefore be out ofthe country for the next two weeks.    Meetings of the cabinet would be held if necessary under the chairmanship of theLord President of the Council, but at present it seemed unlikelythat a meeting would be required during the week beginning28 April.e.c. 2. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that on[REFERENDUM the previous day the House of Commons had carried on a free vote,by a majority of over 100, an amendment to the Referendum Bill,Previous the effect of which would be to ensure a declaration of the resultssReference; by counties in England and Wales, regions in Scotland and for;CC(75) 21st Northern Ireland as a whole.    He had made it clear before theConclusions vote that the amendment still left open the question whether the minute 3 votes should be counted at Earls Court or in the counties and regions.The Opposition had now put down an amendment for the Report stage of the  Bill, later that day, the effect of which would be to ensurethat the votes were counted in the counties and regions.    he recognised the efficient planning work which the Home Office had done, and he believed that there were marginal advantages in favourof a count at Earls Court, if only because a recount, should this be necessary, would be much easier to carry out there than in60 counties and regions.    But he and the Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, both thought that the Government were likely to be defeated if they tried to resist the amendment.    He had alsoinformally consulted the county authorities who had raised nodifficulty about counting arrangements.    He accordingly proposedthat he should announce in the House that afternoon that theGovernment accepted the principle of the Opposition amendmentand that, if it were withdrawn (because it was technically defective),they would move an appropriate Government amendment to the same effect in the House of Lords.1
Discussion showed general agreement for this proposal.    Thefollowing points were made -a. The effect of accepting the proposal would be thatresults for individual counties and regions would have to bemade known or declared as soon as they became available.It was likely that the early results would include those ofsparsely populated Welsh counties and some heavily populatedEnglish counties and that there should not be too serious a risk of creating a misleading impression of the likelyUnited Kingdom result.    It would probably be best for thecounting of the votes to begin on the day after the referendum;  the danger of any adverse effect on sterling would be minimised if as was likely the first results werenot known until at the earliest late on Friday 6 June.b. Votes in the Northern Ireland Border Poll had beencounted at Belfast and the same would be done with the votes for the Convention Elections there on 1 May.    Thereshould therefore be no great difficulty about counting theNorthern Ireland referendum votes in Belfast as well.c. It was likely that Earls Court would be used to countthe votes in Greater London as well as the Service votes.d. Although there might be some advant age in dividingGreater London into smaller units for the purpose both ofcounting the votes and declaring the results, it would be unwise to make this change at this stage, particularly in viewof the implications for districts outside London.e. A recount would probably be unavoidable if the resultfor the United Kingdom was within a bracket of 2 per centeither way.    Further consideration should be given to thecircumstances in which the National Returning Officer mighthave to institute a recount, and to the best arrangements tobe made in that event,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the Lord Presidents proposal.    This decisions would however underline the importance of emphasising publiclythe national character of the referendum result.    The HomeSecretary, in consultation with the Lord President, should discuss with Sir Philip Allen the practical implications of a recount and seek his advice on any other technical questions that might arise.On a separate point the Independent Television News had extendedto a number of Cabinet Ministers an invitation to participate in a2
major programme when the referendum result was announced;this could tend to promote the kind of confrontation it would be beto avoid, and Ministers who received invitations should let himknow before committing themselves to take part.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3
FOREIGNAFFAIRSVietnamPreviousReference:CC(75)19thConclusionsMinute 23. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there was no sign of a ceasefire and an early attack on Saigonmust be regarded as likely.    He had therefore instructed the ambassador to leave with his staff and with any members of theBritish community who wished to go.    This evacuation was takingplace that day.    Most other embassies were also leaving.    Hewould wish to reopen the Embassy as soon as possible and he had informed the Government of North Vietnam that he regarded the closure as temporary.    The Ambassador would, for the time being,stay in Singapore.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office24 April 19754
