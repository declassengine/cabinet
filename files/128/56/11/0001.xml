1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    The Speaker had agreed that the debate on the White Paper about the referendum on united Kingdom membership of the European Community, which was planned for 11 March, might take place on the basis of a Motion for the adjournment, despite the fact that legislation was involved.It was proposed that the House should rise for the Easter Recess on27 March and resume on 7 April,THE PRIME MINISTER said that the British broadcasting corporation had recently changed their practice by inviting ministers to appear in the programme &quot;Any Questions&quot;.    There were someattractions in accepting such invitations: the programme wouldprovide another platform for the public presentation of theGovernments policies, and Ministers could make better use of it forthis purpose than could backbench Members of Parliament, to whominvitations had hitherto normally been limited.    Moreover, it mightafford a useful opportunity of drawing attention to the recent apparentshift in the policy of the Conservative Party towards allowing workers to be laid off when firms were in financial difficulties.    But theseattractions were more than outweighed by the danger that ministers would be faced with questions going outside their own areas ofresponsibility.    Furthermore, because of the impossibility of givingstonewalling or defensive replies on a programme of this kind,Ministers might be led into attempting to deal off-the-cuff with matters about which they were not fully briefed.    On balance,therefore, it would be best for inviations to take part in this programme to be turned down.2, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C(75) 21) to which was attached a draft of theStatement on the Defence Estimates 1975, together with a minute of4 March 1975 from the Prime Minister to the Secretary of State for defence.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at their last meeting the cabinet had agreed that further consideration should be given to the question of how the defence expenditure figures should be expressed in theDefence White Paper in the light of the fact that the White Paper on public Expenditure to 1978-79 (Cmnd 5879) had noted that the figuresfrom 1976-77 were provisional.    This point had been examined; thefigures in the Public Expenditure White Paper were described asprovisional only pending final Defence Review decisions aftercompletion of the process of consultation with the allies.    It would not1
therefore be appropriate to describe the figures as provisional in theDefence White Paper.    This did not mean that the defence budgetfigures were now immutable;  all public expenditure programmes were liable to review and the defence programme was no exception.Indeed this point had been expressly minuted during the previous cabinet discussion.The outcome of consultation with our allies was summarised in his minute of 4 March.    The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)had expressed considerable disquiet at our proposed reductionsparticularly in the Mediterranean.    Nevertheless, the Defence and oversea Policy Committee had concluded that we should stand firm onthe basic proposals we had put to our allies and only offer certain limited measures to go some way towards meeting the concern whichNATO had expressed.    These measures, which were described in chapter I of the Defence White Paper, entailed no increase in the agreed force levels, and the small expenditure involved would have tobe met from within the agreed defence budget.    Nevertheless in considering the Defence &quot;White Paper the Cabinet should note that inthis marginal sense it went beyond the proposals which Cabinet had approved for discussion with our allies.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement and approved the text of the Statement onthe Defence Estimates 1975.2
EC NEGOTIATIONeviouseference:C(75) 10thonclusions,Knute 43. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and he would be attending the Dublinmeeting of the European Council on 10-11 March.    The mainrenegotiation items for discussion in Dublin would be our contributionto the Community budget and access for New Zealand dairy products.On the former a good deal of progress was still required.    As regardsNew Zealand it was clear that they were more interested in price levelsthan in quantity, but the rate of decline of quantity remained an issue.We had also given notice of our need for assured freedom to controlprivate investment in the steel industry, if necessary involving a review of the Treaty of Paris if the result of the referendum was thatwe remained a member of the European Community.    At Dublin theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and he would, of course, benegotiating strictly within the terms of the Manifesto.    It wasimpossible to foresee whether sufficient progress would be made in dublin to bring the renegotiation process to an end: but, if this werethe case, he had given some thought to the situation that would thenarise.    He had decided that the United Kingdom delegation would dono lobby briefing of any kind.    Anything said to the Press should be onthe record: and this would be confined to saying that negotiations had gone as far as they could and that he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would be reporting the results to the Cabinet,He would not say whether, in his view, the terms obtained were goodor bad: nor would he say whether he would recommend the Cabinet toaccept them or not.    A full stocktaking report on the renegotiationprocess would be circulated to the Cabinet immediately before the weekend of 15-16 March.    He envisaged that the Cabinet would meeton Tuesday 18 March to consider their recommendation: and that thiswould be followed by an early announcement.    Following the latter -and if a unanimous recommendation had not been reached - theproposed &quot;agreement to differ&quot; would start.    Assuming that thistimetable could be achieved he was concerned at the prospect of threemonths of campaigning on a divisive issue.    There might beinducements for the Opposition to restrict obstruction to the referendum Bill once the Second Reading stage had been completed,and he had asked the Lord President of the Council to considerwhether it would be possible to bring forward the date of the referendum.    When the Cabinet met to consider their recommendationhe would also circulate guidelines within which Ministers would operate the proposed &quot;agreement to differ&quot;.    It was clearly of thegreatest importance to the Government&apos;s cohesion as a whole to avoidemotive or personalised campaigning by members of the Government.In discussion it was suggested that before the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil the Cabinet should consider the position over the wholerenegotiation field, so that the opportunity could be taken at Dublin toraise all the matters about which we were still concerned.    It couldbe argued, for example, that our approach to the common agricultural Policy (CAP) had not hitherto been sufficiently
fundamental and that we should press for further changes on tariffs and levies in order to improve access for food imports.    Also, itwas not clear what progress we should make over steel in view of theTreaty provisions, and Ministers had yet to conclude their review ofthe Parliamentary aspects, which raised questions about the Treatyof Rome itself.    But it was pointed out that the renegotiation had been conducted throughout on the basis of a number of specific and agreedobjectives.    The Dublin meeting would be concerned with the outstanding points,  including the New Zealand and budgetaryquestions, on which a decision was essential before the Governmentcould reach a decision.    It would not be justifiable to raise newissues at this stage or to reopen ones that had been settled.Moreover if we remained members of the Community, we would continue to pursue a number of our objectives further in the continuingbusiness of the Community - for example in the stocktaking of the cap and in the multilateral trade negotiations - and it was clear thatour negotiating strength in the Community would be substantial.    the renegotiation had been linked from the outset with the continuingbusiness of the Community:  and if we remained a member reform ofthe Community would not stop with the end of renegotiation.It was also urged that before the Cabinet took a final decision on the outcome of renegotiation after the Dublin meeting, the parliamentary labour Party (PLP) should be given an opportunity to express views.A PLP meeting, to which the Government could not give a clear lead,might present difficulties, particularly for the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, who as the Minister conducting the renegotiation would be expected to have formed a view on whether hehad been successful.    But the importance and sensitivity of the issuemade it necessary to find some acceptable way of involving the PLPbefore the Cabinet decision was reached.    It should be possible topresent the outcome in the form of a general checklist, such as thePrime Minister had given in his speech to the London Labour Mayorson 7 December.    A PLP meeting after the Cabinet decision couldraise problems if any Ministers at that time differed from themajority view.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet and Ministerial Committees had held a number of fulldiscussions about the conduct of renegotiation and about our objectives in the different sectors.    The matters to be raised at Dublin would bethe small number of outstanding items which he had mentioned.    Itwas not necessary for the Cabinet to have a further discussion beforethe meeting.    After the Dublin meeting he hoped that it would be clearhow far the other members of the Community were prepared to go in meeting our renegotiation objectives, but no agreement would bereached there about the outcome of the renegotiation as a whole and hewould speak to the Press on the lines he had proposed.    The time for
the Cabinet to review the renegotiation package as a whole would therefore come after the Dublin meeting.    The Cabinet agreed thatthe PLP should meet to express views, but without a resolution orvotef on the outcome of renegotiation before the Cabinet took their final decision.    The Cabinet should therefore start their discussion onMonday 17 March with an elucidation and stocktaking of the outcomeunder each item of the Manifesto.    He would arrange for the papersbefore the Cabinet also to include a report on the consequences andimplications of withdrawal from the Community.    He would himselfopen the discussion at a meeting of the PLP the same evening, with apresentation of the outcome of renegotiation, without giving any recommendation.    The Cabinet would meet again on 10 March to evaluate the package as a whole and reach their decision.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office6 March 19755
