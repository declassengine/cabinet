rJohn THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it wasftonehouse proposed that there should on 12 June be a debate on a Motionbringing before the House the Reports from the Select Committee&quot;jevious recommending Mr Stonehouse&apos;s expulsion unless he returned toeference: this country and resumed his Parliamentary duties within aC(75) 3rd month.    There was one minority school of thought in the House ofoadusions, Commons that, procedurally, it was not for a Select CorrimitteeIjnute 1 to prescribe a period of grace and that, before their recommenda-tion could be effective, the House would have to adopt a substantivemotion providing for Mr Stonehouse&apos;s expulsion at the end of amonth, beginning from the date of the resolution.    The consequenceof this would be that, unless a change were made in the standing order which prevented by-elections during recesses,Mr Stonehouse&apos;s constituency would remain unrepresented formany months.    A second minority view was that, since mr Stonehouse would almost certainly be arrested if he returnedto this country and thus prevented from resuming his parliamentary duties, it would be unjust to expftl Mm Jor.fK.Uiag todo something which it was not within his power to do.    Majorityopinion in the House, however, supported the recommendations ofthe Select Committee and he proposed accordingly to put down a motion for Mr Stonehouse&apos;s expulsion for debate on 12 June.    Ifthe Motion were adopted, a by-election could take place during thefirst week of July.   But it could not be ignored that in the attorney general&apos;s view the legal position was not wholly satisfactory,particularly because the Select Committee&apos;s Report in effectbrought pressure to bear on Mr Stonehouse to leave Australiabefore his legal rights there had been exhausted.    If he neverthe-less wished to return voluntarily to this country, he would have toapply to the Australian courts for release from bail;  such anapplication need not, but probably would, be granted.    Again, ifARLIAMENTARYfFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week following the SpringRecess.    It was proposed to use Monday, 9 June for the SecondReading of the Statutory Corporations (Financial Provisions) Bill,rather than as a Supply Day.    The latter would be preferred bythe Opposition, who had indicated that they would welcomebusiness on that day which would not involve divisions;  moreoverthere would be advantage in securing an even spread of the numerous Supply Days which were outstanding.    But the SecondReading debate of the Statutory Corporations (financial provisions) Bill would provide a suitable opportunity for a debate on steel, for which the Opposition had foi some time been pressing and which the Lord President had undertaken that time would be found during the first week after the Recess;  and on balance this seemed the preferable course.
the pending application to the Australian courts for his extraditionto this country was successful when it was heard later in the month,Mr Stonehouse would under Australian law have to be retained inAustralia for 15 days from the date when the extradition order was granted; and it was doubtful whether this requirement could bewaived.    Moreover, if he returned here voluntarily and was arrested on arrival, his ability to resume his Parliamentary duties would depend on whether or not he was allowed bail.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theSelect  Committee had made no e,ssumption either way about Mr Stonehouse&apos;s guilt but was concerned solely with the questionwhether or not he should be regarded as having abandoned his parliamentary duties.    The Cabinet agreed that plans should be announced for a debate on 12 June but that no Motion should be putdown until much nearer the time.    The position should bere considered and the debate if necessary postponed if Mr Stonehousereturned to this country, as he had stated he intended to do in orderto attend a meeting of his constituency party on 11 June, or if itwere clear that he had made a genuine attempt to return and to resume his Parliamentary duties but had been prevented from doing so by legal processes in this country or in Australia.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would be readily available for official business through the Recess.    No Cabinet meetings had so far been planned but arrangements could be made as necessaryfor the collective consideration of urgent business.    The meetingof the Ministerial Steering Committee on Devolution        whichhad been arranged for 3 June had however been deferred until13 June.    Arrangements would be made, either after the DS meetingon 13 June or more probably on 16 June, for a meeting of the ministerial Committee on Industrial Development (IDV) to undertake a thorough review of the Industry Bill following completion of itsCommittee Stage and in preparation for the Report Stage.    In themeantime the Official Committee should prepare an analysis of the position reached and clear as much ground aspossible in preparation for the IDV meeting.    Following the latterthere would need to be urgent discussions with the Trades UnionCongress and the Confederation of British Industry leading to cabinet decisions on 19 June.
3LIC 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePENDITURE: Prime Minister (C(75) 60) setting out proposals for the futureTUR.S considernation by Cabinet of public expenditure questions..0CEDURESTHE PRIME MINISTER reminded Cabinet that, at the meeting on10 April, he had undertaken to consider the arrangements whicherence: should be made to enable the Cabinet in future to reach a,(75) 19th collective view on its public expenditure strategy.    Ministers^elusions, had expressed concern about the economic judgment implied byMite 3 any particular level of public expenditure, and about how the public expenditure system could be made responsive to the Governmenfsown political strategy.    He had considered the problem carefully,and had consulted closely with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.His proposals for improving the arrangements were set out in his paper.    What he had tried above all to do was to ensure that, ata sufficiently early stage for its views to influence the content ofthe public expenditure survey report, Cabinet had adequateopportunity to consider the economic assessment upon which forwardspending plans would have to be based, and the political andeconomic options open.    The economic assessment would be presented by the Treasury, together with a commentary by theCentral Policy Review Staff (CPRS); it would put before Cabinetthe main elements of the Treasury&apos;s Medium Term EconomicAssessment.    This presentation would lead to a separatediscussion in Cabinet at which decisions would be taken on the broadallocation of resources between public expenditure and private consumption.     At a subsequent Cabinet meeting there would be a discussion of public expenditure priorities on the basis of a paperproduced jointly by the CPRS and the Treasury in which the PolicyUnit at 10 Downing Street would be involved.    This would enablethe Cabinet to discuss the political and economic options open to themand consider where their whole public expenditure policy wasleading them in terms of the next General Election.    In this waythe public expenditure survey sfeporc, when it was prepared, shouldreflect the Governmenfs own decisions more clearly than had beenpossible in the past.    Even so, there would remain unresolvedproblems after the report had been completed, and he proposed thatthe Official Steering Committee on Economic Policy should considerthe report, identify the main issues for Ministers, and set out the options which were open.    In this way the final Cabinet discussionia the Autumn would be on material which took full account of the priorities Ministers had expressed earlier; and Ministers would been abled to concentrate their attention on the major issues withoutgetting involved in the more indigestible material in the report itself.This new procedure was bound to some extent to be experimental,and might need to be adjusted in the light of experience.    his proposals related to a normal year, but since the 1975 Survey wasunusually late in starting, he had set out in paragraph 12 of his paper a modified arrangement whereby some of the ideas could be-
injected into this year&apos;s procedure.    He hoped that Cabinet wouldendorse the proposals as meeting their desire to have anopportunity to discuss the economic background and the political implications of major issues of public expenditure at an early stage in the annual cycle so that officials could then be given politicalguidance before carrying out the Survey.Lx discussion there was a general welcome for the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposals, which were regarded as a major step forward.    Two specific suggestions were made;-a. In the discussion of the Medium Term Assessmentenvisaged in paragraph 9 ii. of the paper, it should bepossible, without putting the Budget into Commission,to include options on tax policy as one of the aspects tobe covered.b. Given the complexity of the subject, it would be helpful if, whenever public expenditure was to bediscussed, the papers could be circulated 7 days,rather than 48 hours, in advance of the meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet clearly welcomed the proposals he had put forward.    Itwould now be for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the  CPRSto provide Cabinet with the material needed to implement those proposals.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider what could be done to meet the specific   points raised in discussion.The Cabinet -1.       Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theCentral Policy Review Staff to arrange for the proposals in C(75) 60 to be implemented.3. The Cabinefs discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster (C(75) 64) recording the conclusions of the groups of Ministers under his chairmanship which had considered aproposal by the Secretary of State for Industry to impose temporaryrestrictions on imports of textiles and clothing.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said mat his paper set out the arguments which had convinced the group ofMinisters, in spite of their natural concern, to decide against theimposition of import restrictions.    The root of the problem did notlie in an increase in textile imports - the degree of import penetrationin 1975 was tending to fall compared to 1974 - but in a marked decreasein demand at home and abroad.    It was essential not to add to thedifficulties of developing countries;  it was also most important notto undermine the Multi Fibre Arrangement which helped our industry by making it possible to spread the increasing imports fromdeveloping countries more fairly among the developed countries,including those in the European Economic Community the developed countries too were suffering severely from the recession,and would certainly retaliate if we imposed discriminatory restrictionsagainst them, as had been shown in the case of Turkey recently.    Therest of the world expected the British Government to abide by inter-national agreements and obligations, and its credit must not bedamaged, or there was a risk of turning a temporary problem into one which was much bigger and lasted longer.    However, the group ofMinisters fully realised the difficulties of the British textile and clothing industry, and for this reason had tended to favour his suggestion that some ether method should urgently be sought to provideselective help to those parts of the textile industry that were hardesthit.In discussion there was general agreement that the difficulties of the textile and clothing industry demanded urgent attention, both on general grounds and from a political point of view: the industry facedthe worst recession since the 1930&apos;s.    The trade unions concerned were generally moderate and responsible, the industry hadmodernised and improved productivity, and it deserved special help to enable it to weather the current recession.    A letter just receivedfrom the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress arguedstrongly in support of this, and also requested the Government to giveimmediate consideration to the request from the British TextileConfederation for temporary restrictions to be imposed on imports across the board.    So strong was the feeling among theMembers of Parliament concerned that it was imperative for referenceto be made to the problems of the industry during the economicdebate later the same day.    There were strong arguments againstimposing restrictions on imports, but it was certainly worth seeing if more help might not be provided under the Industry Act, on the linesof the existing scheme under Section 8 to help the wool textile part of
the industry.    However, it was important to remember that the objectof such assistance was to regenerate British industry;  this meantgiving help in ways which would enable useful production to expandwhen the recession ended and not subsidising goods which no-onewished to buy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discusssion, said the cabinet agreed that the condition of the textile and clothing industry was serious and deserved special consideration.    They accepted the strong arguments against imposing restrictions on imports on textiles and clothing, particularly those from the developing countries; but they wished urgent consideration to be given to the possibility of providingmore help under the Industry Act, to assist the industry to ride out the recession and to be well-placed to take advantage of the coming up-turnin world trade.    He proposed in his speech in the economic debate that afternoon to refer to the very thorough examination which Ministers had given to the problem, and to promise a statement on the following day.That statement should be now drafted by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Industry;  it should explain the arguments for rejecting import controls, and promise an urgent investigation into other means of helping the industry under the provisions of the industry act.    The Secretary of State for Industry, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, should then examine urgently whatselective schemes might be appropriate, with the object of making anannouncement during the recess or shortly after.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.    Agreed that restrictions should not be imposed ontextile and clothing imports, either across the board oron a selective basis, but that urgent examination shouldbe given to the possibility of extending further selectivehelp to the textile and clothing industry under theprovisions of the Industry Act.3.    Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Industry, to prepare a statement to be made by the Prime Minister the following day, onthe lines indicated in the summing up.4.    Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,urgently to examine the scope for further selectiveBchemea to help the textile and clothing industry underthe provisions of the Industry Act with the object ofmaking an early announcement.Cabinet Office22 May 1975 6
CONFIDENTIAL annex cc(75) 25th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 22 May 1975 at 10. 30 am the Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer on public expenditure and economic strategy (C(75) 62),on the significance of the borrowing requirement (C(75) 61), andon the public expenditure survey 1975 (C(75) 63).THE PRIME MINISTER emphasised that on this occasion therewas no question of the Cabinet committing themselves to anyparticular magnitude or distribution of public expenditure cuts,nor was it desirable that at this stage they should seek to closeany options.    The purpose of the exercise was to consider a procedure designed to present Ministers at a later stage with aseries of options on the basis of which it would then be possibleto make political choices.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the new arrangements which had been agreed under the preceding itemcould not be fully adopted in the current year because of the constraints of the calendar.    He agreed that the only decisionsrequired at the present meeting were procedural ones.    For thispurpose the Cabinet would need to look at the total proportion ofthe national income which might be allocated to public expenditure;but the time for a decision on this, and for a discussion of public expenditure priorities, would be in July when more work had beendone.    Final decisions would not be appropriate until Septemberwhen the Survey report would be available.His proposal was that the Public Expenditure Survey should proceed on the basis that expenditure in 1978-79 might need to bereduced by at least  2, 000 million at 1974 Survey prices below theprojections in the Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd. 5879).However, in order to assemble sufficient options to enable theCabinet to make shifts in the present pattern of priorities if they so wished, he proposed that officials should identify cuts totalling 3, 000 million.    In reaching his view that cuts totalling 2, 000 million might be necessary he could not ignore the fact that between 1955 and 1975 the proportion of the gross domesticPUBLICEXPENDITURESURVEY 1975THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO   4 cabinet
product (GDP) taken by public expenditure had increased from42 per cent to 58 per cent, most of the increase having takenplace in the last 10 years.    This bad been reflected in the taxburden on ordinary people.    In 1965 the income tax on theaverage earnings of a married man with two children took5. 6 per cent of his income, whereas today it took 18. 9 per cent.In 1955 69 per cent of the working population paid income tax,whereas today 82 per cent paid it.    Furthermore, it should beremembered that when the low paid entered the tax system, theydid so at the rate of 35 per cent.    If present public expenditureplans were left unchanged, it would mean that by 1980 incometax would have to be raised to 45p in the pound.    Nor could this be avoided by imposing heavier taxes on the richest part of thepopulation.    Indeed even if all taxable income above  6, 000 ayear (just over twice average earnings) were confiscated, itwould raise only  450 million on a once-for-all basis ascompared with the current public sector deficit of  7, 600 million the public sector&apos;s present spending plans (including onlending)involved spending 119 pence for every 100 pence of revenueraised;  and it was this fact which was reflected in the balance ofpayments deficit which last year amounted to 5 per cent of thenational income.The medium term economic forecasts were worse than previouslyfor two reasons.    The rate of growth of GDP, formerly put at per cent per annum, was now expected to be rather less -perhaps only Zj per cent.    Furthermore, the oil producers werespending their surpluses quicker than had been expected, which meant that the developed countries would have to pay in goods fortheir oil sooner than anticipated.    The United Kingdom had therefore to close its balance of payments gap at a faster rate than hadbeen planned.    These two factors alone meant there were fewerresources available for public expenditure.    In addition, it was now likely that North Sea oil would become available more slowlythan had previously been hoped;  and the fact that inflation in theUnited Kingdom was running at twice - and by later in the yearmight be running at three times - the rate elsewhere in the world,meant that Britain&apos;s ability to borrow overseas would be greatly reduced.    This was the background to the draconian target forcuts which he now proposed.    Of the  3,&quot;000 million to be identified,one half should be sought by considering the implications of statedpercentage reductions in current and capital expenditure on goods and services, while the balance would need to be found from a range of other expenditures, including transfer payments.
In discussion it was argued that,  while the decisions now soughtwere said to be only procedural in character, it was not unknownfor such decisions later to acquire a more substantive nature.As regards the proportion of GDP taken by public expenditure itwas relevant that 20 years ago the public sector in the UnitedKingdom took a lower proportion of GDP than in any otheradvanced country.    The significance of the percentage increase could not therefore be judged without comparisons with theposition in other countries today.    Doubt was also cast on thesuggestion that the country was living 5 per cent above its means -a reference to the scale of the balance of payments deficit -since a recent newspaper article had put the figure at nearer2 per cent.    Furthermore the cuts proposed were unsatisfactoryin that they treated virtually all public expenditure as if it wereuniform in its nature, drawing no distinction between expenditureinvolving the use of resources and expenditure on the acquisitionof assets.    If the need for a cut of  2-3, 000 million were based on the argument that the level of tax would become too high, then the Cabinet should discuss the merits of high taxation and high public sector spending against a lower level of both.If on the other hand the argument were founded on the balance ofpayments position, the brief reference in the paper was not anadequate basis for forming a firm view.    It was by no meansproven that it was necessary to push up the level of sparecapacity - which would be the consequence of the cuts proposed -to such an extent.    The political implications were enormoussince for the first time the Cabinet was discussing cuts in absolute terms, and not merely cuts in rates of expenditure growth.Indeed there must be serious doubt whether it would be possibleto impose cuts of this kind on local authorities without new machinery for the purpose.    One of the by-products of the cuts would be likely to be a disastrous effect on the prospects for theconstruction industry.In further discussion it was argued that the whole diagnosis andstrategy were wrong.    The situation was much worse than hadbeen suggested.    Unemployment was rising sharply, and wouldprobably be over one million by the end of the year.    The country was on the edge of a deep slump, as was evidenced by fallinginvestment intentions.    It was by no means certain that the upturnin world trade would take place at the end of the year, and even ifit did other countries - notably Germany, Japan and the UnitedStates - were better placed than Britain to take full advantage of it.Cuts of the magnitude proposed would lead to increased unemploy-ment which would produce a loss of  1, 200 million in tax revenue,and an additional cost of  1. 000 million in social security payments,so that the net effect would be to produce savings of only 800 million.    If public expenditure priorities had to be replanned,this should be done in a full employment context.    The reductions3
proposed would simply cut back the real resources available.Moreover by embracing a macro-economic strategy of the kind proposed, micro-economic strategy would be put in a straitjacket.The strategy implied high unemployment, but jobs were productivecapacity, and this would represent one further step in theratcheting down of productive capacity in the United Kingdom.There was a wholly feasible alternative policy based on import controls - which the Government would be compelled to bring inwithin a year in any case - combined with increased investment inthe context of fuller employment.On the other hand it was strongly argued that a policy based onimport controls totally failed to deal with inflation which was thecentral and crucial element in the current economic situation.Inflation was the problem which above all needed to be tackled,and it was vital that Ministers should turn to consideration of it after the recess.    The current rate of inflation was bankruptinga wide range of institutions and unless checked could threatencivilised government itself.    If the Cabinet were unwilling to faceup to the swingeing public expenditure cuts proposed, they mustbe prepared to consider a much tougher pay policy than they had followed hitherto, even if this meant considering voluntary guide-lines with some kind of statutory back-up machinery.   The TradesUnion Congress (TUC) were already considering possible adjust-ments in pay policy, as were the Confederation of British Industry,and it was high time that the Government defined its own policy.Against this, it was argued that whatever was done about wageinflation had to be done by winning the consent of the unions.    Toimpose a statutory policy would be a breach of faith.    The truthwas that the adjustments to pay policy which were feasible werenot going to produce any spectacular reduction in the rate of inflation.    Moreover it would be wrong to put the burden of failure in the past 12 months on the trades unions when cabinet had itself rapeatedly agreed to pay settlements in excess of the tuc guidelines.    A statutory policy, which, while it was in,operation, would build up intolerable pressures, could only lead togross injustice.    What was needed was to get trade union agreement to a broad policy package, which must include measures to avoid any further increase in unemployment.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as regardsthe balance of payments, there was no question but that the country had lived 5 per cent beyond its means in 1974.    The deficit was expected to be over  1 billion lower in 1975.    Nevertheless, theposition towards the end of this year was likely to be worse than ithad been in the first 4 months of the year, because those four months had seen the benefit of orders placed earlier which were now drying up.    The monthly figures were therefore likely to getworse.   It was however wrong to suggest that cutting public expenditure4
would lead to increased unemployment.    The question was whetherpeople should be employed in the private or in the public sectors.Much public sector employment was, in the literal sense, non-productive:  and what the economy needed was an increase in production.    The upswing in world trade, when it came, shouldsuck more people into productive activity.    He agreed that ministers must discuss wages policy immediately after the recess.The TUC guidelines had not, for the most part, been complied with, and it was fair to ask whether the Government could rely upon a further voluntary bargain working better next time.    Inany case, whatever was done on wages, the problem of the balanceof ra&amp;crarces in the economy remained and the need for the public expenditure cuts would still be there.    He repeated his own viewthat a reduction of  2, 000 million would be needed but if Ministersreally wished to review their public expenditure priorities,   it was clear that some programmes would have to go down more than theaverage in order to benefit others.    For this reason it was essential to identify larger savings in all programmes totalling 3, 000 million.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatwhile the Cabinet were not at one on the need for cuts in public expenditure of the magnitude proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer, they accepted that only by asking officials to proceedwith the expenditure survey on the basis put forward in theChancellor&apos;s paper  C(75) 63 could they ensure that they wouldhave available sufficient options later in the year should majorcuts have to be made.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should therefore arrange for officials to proceed as proposed in his paper(755/63..    This did not however imply any assumption about the eventual decision: all that was being done was to prepare theinformation on the basis of which Cabinet would be able to arriveat firm conclusions later in the year.    Before this he would arrange for a full days discussion at Chequers of public expenditurepriorities.    It was also clear that Cabinet would need to resume their discussion of the broad economic strategy shortly after the recess.    He noted the wish to consider economic options otherthan public expenditure cuts.    It would be necessary to considerthe question of inflation and pay policy, but it was essential toavoid any speculation that a statutory policy was being contemplatedsince this could lead to a. damaging rush of pay claims.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.
I     mi        :2.    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor officials to proceed with the 1975 public expenditure survey on the lines indicated in the appendix to his paper C(75) 63 but on the clsar understanding that theCabinet had reached no decision on the eventualquantum.Cabinet Office27 May 1975
