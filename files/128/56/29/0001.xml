THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT40COPY no cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 29th ConclusionsFriday 20 June 1975 at 10. 00 amECONOMIC The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary of StateSTRATEGY for Employment (C(75) 66 and 67), a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C(75) 70) and a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C(75) 72).THE PRIME MINISTER said that there were three major Cabinetson economic matters in prospect.    The present meeting was concerned with the economic situation generally, concentrating oninflation and pay policy.    There would be a discussion in earlyJuly on the Medium Term Economic Assessment, leading to broaddecisions on the allocation of resources between public expenditure and private consumption.    And there would be a meeting on 25 Julyabout public expenditure priorities in the light of which the public expenditure survey would then continue, leading to final decisions on public expenditure in the autumn.    The purpose of the present meeting was not to reach final decisions on how to deal with inflation, but to provide an opportunity for a frank exchange of viewsso that the Cabinet could reach a consensus about a solution whichthe country and the trades unions would find acceptable.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that therewere three courses between which the Government could choose in framing an incomes policy for the next pay round.    They could continue with the present voluntary policy, operating within TradesUnion Congress (TUC) guidelines; they could continue with collective bargaining without any guidelines; or they could opt for a statutoryincomes policy.    He favoured the first of these options since eachof the others h?-d obvious disadvantages.    A voluntary policy withoutguidelines ran the risk of being ignored in the private sector; whilethe Government would attract all the odium associated with applying the policy stringently in the public sector.    As for a statutoryincomes policy, he believed that it would give rise to very serious difficulties.    There would be strong resistance from the tradesunion movement, despite the findings of recent public opinion polls,0
and a rigidly applied statutory policy would almost certainly lead to serious industrial disputes that would deter foreign investors.    the tuc had however drawn up proposals of their own on the developmentof the social contract which he had circulated under cover of C(75) 67.The TUC document had not yet been formally endorsed;  it was dueto be considered by the General Council on 25 June.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection and he would be meeting the TUC later in the day to discussthe paper, and he urged that the Cabinet should give their support tothe TUC approach.    If the Government did not support this initiative,they would have to hammer out a separate policy of their own, and in doing so they would run the risk of damaging their relations with the tuc.    The document pointed to the need to get the rate of priceinflation down to at least 15 per cent.    This target called for a majoreffort to get average wage increases below 20 per cent early in thenext wage round.    The document suggested a number of options for achieving this.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer had howeversuggested that the Governmenfs target for reducing the rate of inflation should be a halving of the current rate of inflation by thethird quarter of 1976.    This would imply a wage norm of 10 per cent for the next round of pay negotiations;   the TUC were extremely unlikely to be willing to accept a figure at this level and even if they accepted it would find it almost impossible to ensure compliancefrom individual unions.    He therefore suggested that a more reasonable target would be a wage norm of 15 per cent.    If theGovernment did decide to back the TUC document he hoped that, forthe time being, there would be no mention of target figures either for reducing the Retail Price Index (RPI) or for a wages norm.   His suggest-ion was that there should be a Government statement on incomes policy in mid-July covering the Governmenfs overall objectives, the targetfigures for wage norms and reduction in inflation, higher incomes,and the salaries of Members of Parliament.    It might be worth whilehaving a report by officials on top salaries and the effect of review body awards.    Once a wages increase target had been set, it wouldbe of the highest importance to ensure that there was widespreadcompliance with this when wage settlements were being made.    Itmust be recognised however that there would be some degree ofslippage, and the hopes of compliance over the next pay round hadbeen darkened by the recent decision by the Amalgamated Union of engineering Workers (AUEW) opposing any form of pay restraint.Nevertheless, the chances of making the social contract work overthe next round were better than last year, and if there were a fixedpay norm,this would make matters easier.    The TUC were anxiousto put their policy across to the country, and the Government shouldbe supporting them in this.    One way of doing this would be for theGovernment to publish a White Paper in July which would set out insimple terms what a particular wage norm would mean in terms of reducing the rate of price inflation.    It was essential that the country should have confidence in a policy to bring down the rate of inflation and that workpeople should willingly consent in operating such apolicy.    He did not believe that the Government could force a harshprices and incomes policy upon an unwilling country.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the economicsituation of the country required the Government to be more drastic in its action than had been suggested.    Although the balanceof payments situation had improved, and although the United kingdom was doing better in respect of unemployment and output than otherOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)countries, the United Kingdom rate of inflation was double that ofOECD as a whole, and unit wage costs in Britain were four timeshigher than the average in other OECD countries.    Foreign fundswere still flowing into the country, but this situation could changewith dramatic suddenness, and if there were a large-scale outflow of funds later in the summer this would compel the Government toimpose drastic emergency measures.    These might involve cutsin public expenditure of  1, 000 million starting in the current year,which couldl lead to a rise in unemployment that might leave 2 million people out of work in 12 months.    There would inevitably be cuts in real income and in investment.    None of these grave measures wouldin themselves have any effect on inflation, so it would still benecessary for the Government to introduce a statutory wages policy.The urgency of the economic situation required the Government toproduce a credible prices and incomes policy by the end of July atthe latest.     The most dramatic solution would be to freeze wages fora year which would bring down the annual rate of increase in theRPI to 6. 6 per cent by late 1976.    This would represent a fall in real incomes of 7 per cent, and probably put 60, 000 people out ofwork.    There was no chance that such a policy would be acceptable.If the Government were to aim to halve the rate of price inflationby the end of the next pay round, it would be necessary to keep wage increases below 10 per cent, or a flat rate of  5.    Even these ratesof increase made no allowance for the effects on the economy of a continuing depreciation of the exchange rate, of an oil price riselater in the year, or of increasing deficits in the nationalised industries.    The Government had to convince the TUC of thenecessity of a tough incomes policy.    Admittedly the TUC proposals in the document attached to C(75) 67 were highly significant in thatthey demonstrated that the TUC were for the first time proposing thatwage rises should be related to the following, rather than to theprevious year&apos;s,price increases.    The Government should supportthe TUC in the line they were proposing, especially since some union leaders might not find it easy to persuade their own unions to accept these proposals.    The degree of compliance with whatever wagesnorm might eventually be agreed was however of fundamental importance; we should aim to achieve better results in this respectthan we had done over the past year.    He agreed that there wouldhave to be acceptance on the part of the trades union movement:but the Government had to devise policies which would meet theserious situation with which they were confronted and at the sametime retain the confidence of the country&apos;s foreign creditors.    Animportant aim of any policy should be to prevent public sectoremployers from paying increases above the agreed wages norm; and
it would thus be necessary to suspend arbitration and the use ofreview bodies in the public sector and to abandon the principle of comparability.    If the Government were to commit themselves tokeeping within the agreed guidlines in respect of employees for whose pay they were ultimately responsible, they had to ensure that private employers followed suit, and this would not be easy; but unless they could do so, they would find themselves being pushed intoa statutory incomes policy.    If the Government could not persuade the trades union movement to accept a voluntary incomes policy withstringently drawn guidelines, they would be driven to economic policies which would have grave effects upon public expenditure andemployment.    The present rate of high wage settlements was ineffect beginning to force a Labour Government to adopt Tory policies.Moreover, he could not afford to introduce any demand reflation inthe economy until an eftective wages policy was being seen to work.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection stressing the gravity of the economic situation, saidthat the control of events could be wrested out of the Government&apos;shand at any moment.    She thought that the timetable put forward bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer was too relaxed;  the government must have a clear policy by the end of June.    The cardinal aim ofthe Government1 s policy should be to get the rate of inflation down toa single figure year-on-year by the autumn of 1976;  even this rate of inflation would still present grave difficulties and the ultimate targetmust be a zero rate.    To achieve such a target, an incomes norm of15 per cent for the next pay year was much too high.    The figuresprovided by the Treasury suggested that the country could not afford a wages increase norm higher than 10 per cent.    To achieve thiswould call for some very bard decisions, and it would not be possibleto hold to such a norm unless an Independent body - which might beset up jointly by the TUC and Confederation of British Industry (CBI) -were set up to monitor and report on whether individual wage settlements did or did not conform to whatever norm or guidelineswere adopted.    The degree of compliance would be crucial to thesuccess of the policy.    One way of encouraging both employers and employees in the public and private sectors to comply with an agreedincomes norm might be to prevent costs incurred in making wage settlements above the norm from being passed on in prices.    In thepublic sector, no increases in public expenditure would therefore be sanctioned to cover the excess, nor would price or fare increasesbe allowed.    Any wage settlements above the norm would thus need tobe financed by savings from other parts of the annual budgets of theDepartment or nationalised industry concerned.    Similar action would be needed in the private sector, though there would be greater difficulties there.    She did not believe that price increases to finance inflationary wage rises should be passed on automatically tothe public.    Frequently it was the poorer sections of the communitywho had to bear the brunt of such increases.    She appreciated thatthere would be pressure to match tougher control of incomes by
tougher control of prices, but she did not believe that profit marginsin many industries could be squeezed very much further.    Manyfirms were already only just remaining profitable and no more,and it would be difficult to place severe restraint on the prices of essential goods unless firms were convinced that an effective incomes policy could be secured.    Any thought of a price freeze was anillusion:  the TUC did not understand this and the Governmentshould make it clear to them.    If it were felt that the trades union movement would not be prepared to go along with a 10 per centincomes norm over the next pay round, it might be possible to achieve the same effect on inflation with a larger wages norm ifpayments were staged at 6 monthly intervals.    The net effect overthe whole round might still bring the RPI down to single figures bylate 1976.    If the policy were actually seen to be working it mightbe possible to achieve some degree of selective price stabilisationstarting in,  say, the first quarter of 1976. So far ascompliance was concerned, it would be worth while examining thepossibility of synchronising wage settlements and long-term agree-ments.    She was sceptical of the chances of a voluntary policysucceeding but she agreed that this, rather than a statutory scheme,was the right starting point.In the course of discussion it was argued that too little account hadbeen taken of the extremely precarious nature of the presentsituation.    Even the timescale suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer - to have a credible policy by the end of July at thelatest - was probably unduly long.    At any moment the Governmentshand could be forced by a run on the pound which would lead to national disaster.   At the latest the Government must have a policy by the middle of July.    This should include wage settlements at10 per cent, and there should be some kind of sanction even if itwere kept in the background.    Failing this, the policy would notwork and the Government might well face a collapse of sterling inAugust.    While it was difficult to find satisfactory sanctions,psychologically it was important that the force of law should liebehind the policy in order to secure general acceptance.    Theescalation of the public sector borrowing requirement was gravelydamaging to the economy and incompatible with an effective anti-inflationary policy.    Stringent public expenditure cuts would be needed to get it under control, but these would involve grave damage to public services and could only be faced if they were backed by an effective incomes policy.    The control of public expenditure inconstant price terms had been disastrous, and ceilings in money terms would be essential.    There should be a review of all the mainsocial programmes, on an interdepartmental basis, and to the samedepth as had been the case with the defence review.
There was general support for the view that the problem was one ofgreat urgency.    It was suggested that overseas observers had expected the announcement of a firm policy immediately after the referendum on the European Community.    It would be necessary topresent a package to Parliament before the end of July, and thisshould include both an incomes policy and cuts in public expenditure.There was agreement on the need to achieve a consensus.    a voluntary policy had no chance at all unless the Government could give a clear assurance that those who settled in the early part of the wage round would not be any worse off than those who settled later.The Government must make clear its implacable determination toensure that the necessary policies would be carried through.In further discussion the view was expressed that a statutory policy would have to be introduced within a matter of weeks, in spite ofthe enormous difficulties it involved, because the results of anyother policy would be even worse.    It would of course be preferableif an improved voluntary policy could be allowed to run on for somemonths in order to assess its success, but it was arguable that therewas insufficient time for this.    The TUC paper already recognisedthat settlements must be below the going rate of increase in the RPI,It was not credible that settlements below the RPI could be achievedon a voluntary basis; nor was it fair to ask trades union leaders toattempt to operate such a policy.    That was the responsibility ofthe Government.    A statutory policy would be opposed by the tuc and would lead to a severe strain upon the Governmenfs relationswith the trades union movement; but there were millions of tradesunionists awaiting a lead in the form of a policy which would applyto everybody.    The Government should appeal to the rank and file inthe unions over the heads of their leaders.    It was true that anyadoption of a statutory policy would be a breach of the election manifesto; but the same was true of all the available alternative courses.    If it were argued that the miners&apos; attitude would be afatal obstacle to a statutory policy, the answer was that the position was no different with a voluntary policy, since in either case theGovernment would have to face up to strikes.    It would be worthwhile considering some form of flexibly-applied permanent statutorypolicy which could be used to move towards a more egalitariansociety.If a voluntary incomes policy were to be successful, the Governmentin its role as employer would have to hold a hard line; thi a wouldbe seen by public sector employees as discriminatory and equivalentto a statutory policy.    There would be industrial disputes with therisk that much public administration would collapse, especially inthe field of social security.    It was doubtful, therefore, whether a voluntary policy could be delivered even by the Government, whowould be forced to make concessions going beyond the guidelinessimply in order to keep essential administration going.    If this were&apos;&quot;, y&apos;
so, then a statutory policy was the only alternative, providing some system could be found to penalise excessive settlements.    A voluntarypolicy would not be convincing either at home or abroad;  and the urgency was such as to leave no time for gradualism.Against this it was argued that no satisfactory sanctions could be devised to enforce compliance with a statutory policy.    One form which these might take would be to make it illegal for employers topay more than the level laid down in the guidelines; but it was admitted that this had the serious disadvantage of leaving the employer exposed to strikes causing him severe financial damagewhen he was simply seeking to comply with the law (although it mightbe possible to devise a scheme for reimbursing firms from government funds for losses arising from standing firm against a wage claim in excess of the statutory limit).    Under the previousstatutory policy no prosecution had ever taken place;  and had a prosecution been brought and fines imposed but not paid, it was difficult to envisage what would have followed thereafter.    Legalsanctions through the Courts were not a productive way of proceeding.A statutory policy was not a way out: it would require consent just asmuch as a voluntary policy, and in this connection the TUC document was a remarkable step forward.    To get consent the Government hadto win the argument.    This was not something the Government couldleave to the TUC.    It was for the Government to win support for thekind of policy the TUC were now considering.    This called for anorchestrated effort on the part of all Ministers.  Sanctions of a legalkind were useless.    The true sanctions on failure - rising unemploy-ment, public expenditure cuts - had already arrived.    What wasnecessary was to make the ordinary worker feel that he would be worse off simply chasing paper increases in his pay.    He mustrealise the danger that unemployment could hit him, that he would lose part of the social wage, or that continuing inflation would renderany wage increases he could get useless.    A statutory policy whichwould split the Party and require Opposition support to get it through parliament would not work and was the route to coalition; but a voluntary policy needed consent which the Government would have towin.In further discussion it was argued that it was crucial that the policy adopted should be a joint Government/TUC/CBI policy.    There shouldbe a numerical target for price inflation and some clear way ofmeasuring whether any particular settlement was within or outsidethe guidelines needed to achieve that target.    An independent body was needed to ensure that such judgments were quite unambiguous.    there might also be a need for an independent body to deal with anomalies.It might be that such a body could be allowed to authorise settlementsbeyond the guidelines, up to some previously fixed total for thecountry as a whole; and it might also provide a degree of cover forthe Government when, as might well be necessary in some cases, a compromise had to be reached.
It should be made clear to the TUC that if after 6 months, say, theirpolicy was not succeeding then the Government might be forced tobring forward a statutory   scheme.    They would also have to allow a massive increase in unemployment although on recent experienceit was far from clear what level of higher unemployment, and forhow long, would be needed to have the required influence upon wage settlements.    Against this it was maintained that unemployment wasnot an alternative to an effective incomes policy.    Unemployment was an effect of inflation, and it was not conceivable that any short termlevel of unemployment would have the effect upon pay settlementswhich was required.    There  should be no question of the Governmentpresiding over a policy of unlimited unemployment.    As in the 1930s,the country was facing a slump; but it was doing so at a time whenpeople were no longer prepared to accept the consequences of a slump in terms of unemployment, and a policy which relied upon risingunemployment was not acceptable.In continuing discussion the following main points were made -a. One difficulty was that the British people, even if theyappreciated intellectually the effects which inflation could and would have, did not have the same emotional involvementas was the case in Germany: the reverse was true ofunemployment.    For this reason it would be difficult toget the consent which was essential if a satisfactory policy were to be followed.    One possibility which might make a flat rate cash sum more acceptable as a norm would be to announce that it would be tax free, while any payment inexcess of that flat rate would be taxable in the ordinary way.b. The Government and the naticn had to recognise thatthere had been a shift of power to the trades unions and tomulti-national companies.    In time, as these transfers of power became formalised, the Government would haveto come to terms not just with the TUC but with the shop stewards.    What trades unionists wanted was, not just wages,but a full and active part in the management of industry; andthe survival of the Government depended upon a creativerelationship with the trades unions right down to the shopfloor level.c. It was crucially important to get the truth of the presentsituation across to the country.    To achieve this it would benecessary to establish a high-powered public relations unitto plan a publicity campaign so as to make clear what would happen to unemployment, investment, the social wage and living standards generally if an excessive level of wage increases continued, and what benefits restraint would bring.Such a unit could organise speeches, graphical material,draft a White Paper and so on.    This would help to create theattitude of mind amongst the public which would be receptiveto the tough policies needed.
d. There should be a stringent control of top salaries.The Government had been mistaken in its acceptance ofthe last proposals by the Top Salaries Review Body.e. One difficulty of a voluntary policy would be theproblem of the low paid.    The first test of such a policy would in fact come with the first two large groups in thenext pay round, the Local Authority manuals and theNational Health Service ancillaries, all of whom were affected by the TUG low pay minimum target.    If this meant settling at, say 30 per cent, this would set the tonefor the whole of the subsequent round - even though in latersettlements the low pay element was absent.    It might bethat low pay could not be satisfactorily dealt with throughcollective bargaining, and it was worth considering whetherthe Government should not undertake to deal with the low payproblem - for example by means of family allowances -leaving collective bargaining to settle normal increases.f. On timing, it was noted that in the first week of july the national conference of the National Union of Mine workers would take place.    Mr McGahey had already endorsed theclaim of  100 a week, equivalent to a 63 per cent pay claim,and this could easily become the official union claim.    Itwas therefore urgent to put the gravity of the situation to theTUG at once;    they must be made aware that excessive wage claims could lead to the closure of uneconomic pits.g. If there were to be a serious run on sterling broughtabout by inflationary wage settlements for the more powerfulgroups of workers, then the result would beunemployment amongst the poorer sections of the communitywith less bargaining power.h. Even the TUG document showed signs that the authorsdid not yet fully comprehend the difficulties of the presentsituation. . Thus, it said that not enough had yet been doneon prices, whereas the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer Protection had made it clear that there was noroom to squeeze prices further.    The document looked forfurther improvements in the social wage, and for improve -ments in the operation of the national insurance and supplementary benefit rules, all of which could only lead to higher public expenditure, which was equally unacceptable;and it called for defence cuts going beyond those theGovernment had recently decided to be the maximum possible.All of this was wanted as the price for a 15 per cent normwhich was itself probably too high.
j.     While the case against a statutory policy was a powerfulone, the possibility of a run on sterling was such that a contingency plan for a statutory policy should be preparedso as to be available for use as necessary.Finally it was argued that presentation of the choice as between a statutory and a voluntary policy tended both to polarise and toover-simplify the argument.    The Government must try to reach agreement with the TUC but in the last resort could not shrinkfrom taking whatever action was necessary.    If however adequatesanctions could be found (eg through cash limits, suspension ofthe review bodies, the price code etc, even though some of these might themselves require legislation) it might be possible to provide sufficient back-up for a policy which was itself based on collective bargaining.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,although final decisions could not be taken at this meeting, there seemed to be a consensus in the Cabinet that the aim should be to achieve a wages norm of 10 per cent (or its equivalent) from thebeginning of the next pay round.    A statutory policy would be highlydivisive and there was strong support for a determined effort tomake a voluntary policy work.    This meant the Government playingan active role along with the TUC, but the TUC must be warnedof the consequences if a voluntary policy did not succeed.     itwould be important to use Ministerial speeches, perhaps a white paper, and other forms of publicity to bring home frankly to thecountry what the situation was; and also to indicate what might bedone by positive Government action to stimulate industrial investmentif only inflation were checked.    If a voluntary policy were to be successful, the Government would have to accept its responsibilities in relation to the public sector.    This could involve eg the temporary suspension of pay comparability and the review bodies in respect oftheir own employees and the introduction of cash control of wages forother public sector bodies.    In this connection some means would need to be found of putting discipline upon local authorities.    a voluntary policy would certainly need some monitoring arrangement whereby individual settlements could be seen to be within or beyondwhatever general guidelines or norm might be adopted: this mightbe discussed with the CBI and the TUC.    The time within which a new policy had to be devised and agreed was severely limited.    At themoment the onus lay primarily on the TUC, and they should be asked what kind of supporting action they wanted from the Government;but if the TUC iailed to agree upon an effective policy, then theGovernment would have to consider unilateral action as a matter of urgency.
The Cabinet -1.    Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the secretaries of State for Employment and for prices and Consumer Protection to be guided accordingly intheir meeting with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress later in the day.Cabinet Office24 June 197511
