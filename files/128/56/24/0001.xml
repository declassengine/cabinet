irLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inrrAIRS the House of Commons during the following week. gislativeirogrammeIt was reported that good progress was being made with thelegislative programme for the current Session, but only at the costof requiring the House of Commons to sit for unprecedently longhours.    In view of the Governments very small overall majority,this was imposing an extremely heavy burden on government supporters.    Their average age was significantly higher than thatof Opposition Members;  and there was a number who were in badhealth and should not continue to be exposed to this degree of pressure.    The disruption of Members1 domestic life also could notbe ignored.    The need to secure some improvement in the present state of affairs should be kept clearly in mind when, after the recess, the Cabinet considered the content of the next Sessionslegislative programme and the handling of the outstanding part ofthe programme for the current Session,:ec.eferendumEuidelines on procedure for/iinisterspreviousReference:lc(75) 16thConclusions,[Minute 52, The Cabinet discussed problems arising from the applicationof the Guidelines on the Procedure for Ministers during the period before the e.c. referendum circulated by the Prime Minister on April (C(P)(75) 1).It was reported that some practical difficulties had arisen fromthat guideline which stated that a Minister should not allow himself to be put into a situation in which he appeared to be in directconfrontation, on the same platform or programme, with another minister who took a different view on the question of membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.).    In particular, therewas a problem in connection with a programme on e.c. membershipwhich Independent Television were intending to present on theTuesday before polling day.    It would take the form of a two-hourdebate between supporters and opponents of e.c. membership;  andit would be very unsatisfactory if in a major programme of this kindthe effect of the guideline was that, as at present seemed likely, thecase for continued membership was presented entirely by membersof the Opposition because the opposing view was being expressed bydissenting members of the Cabinet.    There was therefore a case for relaxing this particular guideline during the final stages of the campaign, even though it would remain desirable to avoid personalcontroversy between Ministers,1
In diocussion, it was argued that the guideline about avoidance of confrontation had caused problems to opponents as well as tosupporters of e.c. membership.    Fcr example a problem had come to light in connection with a programme now in preparationwhich had been built up from a series of separate interviews givenby supporters and opponents of e.c. membership,    The interviewshad been edited and juxtaposed, and a commentary added at the end,The view had been taken that this constituted &quot;confrontation&quot; -despite the fact that the interviews had taken place separately andthe programme constructed by subsequent editing - and some of theMinisters had been asked to withdraw.    As a result the programme would cease to offer a balanced presentation of the arguments,In further discussion support was expressed for the view that, eventhough some Ministers had already planned their programme ofpublic appearances on the basis of the guidelines as they stood,there was a case for modifying this particular guideline during thefinal stages of the campaign.    This course would arguably involve some dangers;  but Ministers should be expected to observe thenormal rules of good taste and restraint, and it would also bedesirable for the period of the relaxation to be as short as was consistent with securing its objective.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, in the important programmes likely to beappearing on television and radio during the finaJ stages of the referendum campaign, it would be undesirable for the guidelines to result in the case in favour of continued membership of the EECbeing put mainly by members of the Opposition Parties because ofthe need to avoid confrontation.    Accordingly the guideline at paragraph 2ii, of C(P)(75) 1 dealing with the avoidance of confrontation should cease to apply in respect of radio and television programmes for the period from Sunday 1 June untilpolling day;  but Ministers should continue to be guided by normalconsiderations of restraint and good taste, bearing in mind theimportance of doing nothing which, would hinder the restoration of normal Cabinet solidarity immediately the referendum was over.Ministers should continue to inform his office of any invitations they received to appear on radio or television during that period.    Theguideline on direct confrontation should in any event and withimmediate effect not be regarded as applying to radio and television programmes which were built up by editing interviews givenseparately by individuals; but Ministers should bear in mind thepossibility that interviews they gave might, as a result of editingby the broadcasting authorities, be used in ways which they did not envisage at the time of the interview.    It was important that theviews of the Government on continued e.c. membership should be clearly presented, and he himself would seek to do this in the public speeches and radio and television broadcasts he would be makingduring the period before the referendum.2
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the United States Congress,against the wishes of the American Administration, had decided to suspend the supply of arms to Turkey.    The ban was not likely to be lifted in the near future and, unless other ways could be found of helping Turkey, the efficiency of her armed forces would suffer,her ability to contribute to the defence of the North Atlantic treaty organisation^ (NATO) South Eastern flank, which had already beenweakened by the withdrawal of Greece from military participation in the Alliance, would be reduced, and there might well be increasingdomestic pressures on the Turkish Government to withdraw fromNATO.    The Turks had appealed to other members of the Allianceto sell her arms and spares.    The American Administration wantedus to help and we would be expected to declare our position in NATOon 19 May.    The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had discussed the matter on the previous day and had come down strongly in support of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;recommendation that we should respond favourably to the Turks&apos;request.    But it had also been agreed that, because of the difficultpolitical problem which the request created, the Cabinet should beinvited to confirm that decision.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theTurkish request to her NATO allies raised difficult issues but hehad no doubt that it was right for us to make a positive response.We had already decided to allow arms sales to Greece and a refusal to be even-handed would increase rather than reduce Turkishintransigence on the Cyprus issue.    He had hoped to form a common policy with the Federal German and French Governments aimed atensuring that a resumption of military supplies to Turkey should be accompanied by Turkish concessions over Cyprus,    But the germans had already agreed to an unconditional resumption of supplies andthe French intended to approach any Turkish request from acommercial standpoint.    The attitudes of the two governments would place us in an isolated position if we refused to supply.    Butin telling the Turks that we agreed in principal to sell arms he wouldalso let them know that we hoped they would respond by changingtheir attitude on some aspects of the Cyprus problem, including thetreatment of United Kingdom nationals resident in the Turkishoccupied zone.    In addition to their immediate need of spares andarms to fill the gap left by the American ban, the Turks were interested in buying Ja:;uar aircraft.    We should need French3: i . : :&apos;:t:iV    .
agreement to this.    Delivery of this aircraft would not in any case be possible before the end of 1976,In discussion it was argued that major issues of principle requiredus to refuse to meet the Turkish request.    Whatever the Frenchand German attitude might be, our Treaty obligations in Cyprusplaced us in a special position.    The Turks had been guilty of aggression.    On the other hand it was noted that our efforts tomove Turkish policy on Cyprus towards a position which offered the prospect of a settlement were already achieving some success and were welcome to President Makarios,    This ground would be lost by an outright refusal to sell arms.    Our overriding concern,however, must be the NATO interest: the effectiveness of theTurkish armed forces in their NATO role would be reduced andthe pressures inside Turkey for withdrawal from the Alliancecould be greatly strengthened by such a refusal.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the course of action proposed by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and agreed to by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee,    The Turks should be told that inprinciple we were prepared to supply them with arms and sparesand the British Aircraft Corporation should be informed that negotiations for the sale of Jaguar aircraft could go ahead.    Butthe sale of individual items of equipment and spares and of Jaguaraircraft should be kept under review by the Defence and overseas policy Committee which would take into account the relevance ofeach request to Turkey&apos;s ability to discharge her obligations towardsNATO defence.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
itjSTRlAL 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of-yOCRACY State for Trade (C(75) 59) on employee participation on companyboardscTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the ministerial committee on Industrial Development (1DV) at their meeting on22 April had decided that an independent Committee of inquiry should be set up to advise on employee participation on companyboards, and he had been asked to take the lead in drafting anannouncement.    He had circulated a draft announcement, includingthe proposed terms of reference for the Inquiry to members of theCabinet on 12 May;  these had already been agreed by the colleaguesconcerned and he had arranged to make a statement in the House on13 May.    The terms of reference had been made known toMr Murray and Mr Jack Jones of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)at a meeting with the Prime Minister on 12 May, at which he andthe Secretary of State for Employment had been present.    On thefollowing day Mr Murray had written to the Prime Ministerexpressing strong reservations about the proposed and suggestingalternative terms of reference.    He had therefore, at the last moment, after a copy of the statement had been given to theOpposition been forced to defer the statement.The TUC wished to exclude reference to study of schemes for industrial democracy in other countries, in particular in theEuropean Economic Community;  and any analysis of differentschemes of industrial democracy.    They wanted the terms ofreference to provide that the extension of industrial democracymust be based on the trades union organisation.    The revised termsof reference in C(75) 59 were designed to meet the first two points;but he felt unable to accept the third.    The TUC would prefer a consultative document based on their own proposals: if an inquirywas inevitable, the TUC wished it to be confined to study of how to implement their own proposals.    The Government ought not however to accept this view.    An inquiry must have regard to the viewsnot only        of the TUC but also of the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) and of management.    It must be based on seekingcommon ground, and terms of reference which were narrowly drawn to pre-judge the issue would be self-defeating;  a genuine discussion was essential.    It had to be recognised that the TUC were notunanimous on what action to take;  the views expressed byMr Murray and Mr Jack Jones did not necessarily represent theattitude of the major unions, and the tuc&apos;s debate at the 1974Congress had been inconclusive.    The CBI had accepted the principleof an inquiry, although they had not been given the terms ofreference.    Even the revised terms of reference were heavilyslanted to the TUC view, and any further concession to the TUC would destroy the prospect of a consensus.
He believed however that the revised terms of reference in C(75) 59would meet the case.    Further delay would prove embarrassing tothe Government not only because of the abrupt cancellation of thearrangements for a statement on 13 May, but because of theexistence of a Private Members Bill on industrial democracy,introduced by Mr Radice.    This Bill had been given an unopposedSecond Reading on 7 March, and was about to enter its committee stage.    The Bill had been prepared in consultation with the TUC;  itwent much further than the Governmu/its intentions, and only by anundertaking urgently to set up a Committee of Inquiry could theGovernment hope to persuade Mr Radice to withdraw his Bill,There were no prospects of amending it suitably in the committee stage, and the only hope lay in blocking it at the Report Stage,Further consultation with the TUC was likely to lead to dispute andconfrontation, rather than the resolution of differences.    he therefore sought agreement from the Cabinet to make a statementlater that day containing the revised terms of reference for the inquiry.In discussion, it was argued that the need for an Inquiry had alreadybeen accepted by IDV.    It was essential to have an assessment ofthe implications of worker participation for company law in relationto companies and for the statutes in relation to public boards.    the inquiry would have many complex issues to consider, and if therewere to be any prospect of legislation in 1976-77 its report must beavailable within 12 months.    Delay at this stage could be critical.The Secretary of State for Trade should therefore make a statement that day on the lines already circulated, with the terms of referencerevised as in C(75) 59.    If this proved impracticable, at least the issues should be settled very urgently, so that the statement couldbe made early in the following week.    It was suggested that, ifurgency was of paramount importance, a statement of principlemight be made, leaving the terms of reference for the Inquiry to be announced later, together with the membership.    Against this, itwas argued that it was important to settle the terms of referencebefore any public announcement was made.On the other hand it was strongly argued that industrial democracywas a major issue of policy on which the Cabinet needed furtherdebate.    The implications had not been fully thought out, and the viewattributed to the TUC by two or three of its senior officials was notnecessarily representative of the body of opinion amongst the unions.But to press ahead without full consultation with the TUC and consideration of all the issues would be to stumble into a minefield.The tuc&apos;s support was almost an essential prerequisite.    TheCabinet should therefore consider whether there need be a Committeeof Inquiry - a consultative document, and further practicalexperiments might be preferable.    If there were an Inquiry, it was by no means clear that it should be confined to board representation;6
negotiation and representation at shop floor level also raiseddifficult issues.    There was also the question whether representations should be through the trades unions, or by some form of divectelection open to all workers in an enterprise.    The Labour PartyManifesto for each of the 1974 elections strongly implied industrial democracy through the medium of the trades unions, even if thisleft unsettled whether national officers or shop stewards were intended.    There was a strong preference for using the tradesunion&apos;s national organisation as a vehicle, but it was recognisedthat a pragmatic approach was needed,    Examples were quoted toshow that representation was best selected from those who had power and influence with the workers in a particular enterprise:these might often be the shop stewardSj but the desirability offreely electing representatives should not be overlooked,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was against the Secretary of Statefor Trade making a statement in the House of Commons that day.The discussion in IDV in April had been on the basis of anticipatingthe Committee Stage of the Radice Bill, but this opportunity had nowgone and the Lord President and the Chief Whip could ensure thatthe Bill was prevented from getting its Third Reading on 11 July,The Cabinet had therefore more time in which to debate the issues.It would however be desirable to have formed a collective opinion,before the TUC/Labour Party Liaison Committee meeting in June,in particular, on whether there should be an Inquiry, what form itshould take and its terms of reference.    a group of Ministers should look at the whole question, talcing into account not only the implications of employee representation on boards in the private sector but also the repercussions in the nationalised industries.The group should comprise the Lord Chancellor (in the chair), the secretaries of State for the Environment, Employment, Energy,Prices and Consumer Protection, Industry and Trade, the paymaster general, the Attorney General and the Minister of State, NorthernIreland Office,    The Lord Chancellor should arrange for the group&apos;spreliminary views to be reported to the Cabinet before the meetingof the TUC/Labour Party Liaison Committee on 23 June,    In themeantime, the Secretaries of State for Employment and for trade should consider how Mr Radice might best be persuaded to withdraw his Bill on the basis of assurances of the Governments action.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Invited the Secretary of State for employment and the Secretary of State for Trade to consider howMr Radice might be persuaded to withdraw his Bill.
3, Invited the Lord President of the Counciland the Chief Whip, if the approach to Mr Radicefailed, to ensure that the Industrial Democracy Bil]did not receive a Third Reading.4. Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for a group of Ministers to examine the question ofindustrial democracy on the lines indicated in the summing up, and to report their preliminary views to the Cabinet before the meeting of the TradesUnion Congress/Labour Party LiaJson Committeeon 23 June.
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theLord President of the Council (C(75) 54) and memoranda by theSecretary of State for Trade (C(75) 47 and 58) on the supply of spares and equipment to South Africa0THE LORD PRESIDENT said that his memorandum explained thereasons why the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee  (OPD) attheir meeting on 21 March reaffirmed the conclusion reached bythe Committee on 14 November 1974, that we should be prepared tocontinue the policy of supplying spare parts to South Africa, but thatif the contractual position in any particular case was such as toshow that an exception should or could properly be made to this general principle the Committee should consider it.    they considered that a hardening of our policy, as proposed by theSecretary of State for Trade, could lead to substantial difficulties and endanger our interests over a wide area.    South Africa mightretaliate against of non-military exports.    A decision to withholdspares necessary to maintain equipment already supplied would benoted by other countries and could damage our reputation world wideas a supplier of defence equipment.    We were not under pressure from the African countries to tighten our restrictions on arms supplies to South Africa still further.    The Committee had also decided on his own casting vote as chairman, that an order forDecca Doppler air navigation radar should be allowed to go.    InNovember the Committee had decided that applications for dualpurpose equipment, that was to say equipment which could be usedeither for civil or for military purposes, which were destined forexclusively military use, should be considered individually.    Thearguments in favour of allowing the Decca equipment to be suppliedwere that it was required for air safety, that equipment of this kindhad been exported previously to South Africa, and that to refuseexport would seriously prejudice the company^ future prospects inSouth Africa.    A clear majority of the Committee had been infavour of allowing the export of 1, 200 gas masks with canisters,destined for the South African Navy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he wished to distinguish between &quot;sharp&quot; spares, clearly related to the offensiverole of a weapon, the supply of which we should bring to an endwithout delay;  and &quot;non-sharp&quot; spares where we could reasonablyphase out supplies more gradually.    Sharp spares included gunneryequipment and practice ammunition, bomb carriers and night visionequipment.    It was inconsistent to adopt a policy of not sendingarms to South Africa and to continue to send ammunition to theSouth African Navy.    It was also inconsistent to continue indefinitelyto supply non-sharp spares for weapons provided many years ago,thus enabling the life of these weapons to be prolonged, or evenmodifying them so that they were more up to date than weaponsoriginally supplied.    So far as non-sharp spares were concerned,9;,RMS FOR50UTH AFRICASir&apos; ::.;r;t
the contractual position should be examined in each case and,regard being given to the nature of the equipment and the period for v/hich it had been in use, ways should be sought of phasing outthe supply in an orderly manner without involving Government actionto break existing contracts.    He was opposed to the supply of theDecca equipment which was known to be for exclusively military use and which would improve the effectiveness of the South African AirForce.    It would be impossible to justify the export of the gas masksdestined for the South African Navy which were of a militaryspecification and could be used for anti-riot situations;  and although these were covered by ting contract the export should be refused.    In his judgment his proposals would not damage ourrelations with South Africa.In discussion it was argued that the Secretary of State for Trade&apos;sproposals represented a fundamental change of policy.    Relationswith South Africa would be adversely affected and this could well beto the disadvantage of developments in Rhodesia and Namibia.Retaliation by the South African Government might affect not onlyour civil trade but also the supply of uranium upon which our energyprogramme was heavily dependent.    It was also argued that theexisting policy on spares was designed to enable the equipment toserve its natural life and did not include the provision of sparesfor significantly changing the equipment and bringing it up to date.It was also noted that the Decca equipment was required for transport aircraft and could not be fitted into other forms ofmilitary aircraft.    The order in question was part of a continuingprogramme of supply to transport aircraft of the South African AirForce which had begun in 1968.    It was not correct to describe the gas masks as anti-riot equipment: they were not for riot control,being designed for protection against biological and chemicalweapons: they were similar to equipment issued to the Royal Navy,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that sincethe new policy on the supply of arms to South Africa had been adopted,the Secretaries of State for Trade and Defence had reached a wide measure of agreement in this complicated field.    Our policy onarms and on other matters affecting Southern Africa had created astrongly favourable impression among the African countries.There had been no suggestion from African leaders at the recentCommonwealth Conference in Jamaica that our policy and practice on the supply of arms and equipment was unacceptable to them.    Itwas the view of the Cabinet that we should continue the existing policy on the supply of spares as formulated by OPD on 14 November,and recently reaffirmed by the Committee.    Applications for theexport of spares would be examined individually: there would be abias in favour of supplying them when the effect would be essentiallyto continue the natural life of equipment;  and a bias against supplyif they would have the effect of significantly modernising the equipment.
If the Secretaries of State for Trade and Defence were unable toagree on a particular item the matter would be considered by OPD:and only very exceptionally should individual items be brought tothe Cabinet for decision,,    In view of the fact that Decca equipment of this type had been supplied since 1968 and could be used only in transport aircraft, the Cabinet agreed that the export should beallowed,    Similarly, in view of the explanation given about thenature of the gas masks they, too, should be allowed to go.    Itwould of course be necessary in the present developing situationin Southern Africa to keep our arms policy under review.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime MinisterTssumming up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 May 197511
