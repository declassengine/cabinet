1. THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that it had been agreed thatthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and he should present to the negotiation Cabinet on Monday 17 March a report of the results of the renegotiation of our terms of membership of the European Economicevious Community (e.c.);  and that they should give a similar account that[ference: evening to the back-bench members of the Parliamentary Labour0(75) lith Party.    He had now made arrangements to meet early that eveningnclusions, all members of the Government other than members of the Cabinet,;nute 3 who otherwise would not have an opportunity to be given an account ofthe results of the renegotiation and to express views on them.    TheCabinet would then at a further meeting the following day decide whatrecommendation to make to the British people.In discussion it was suggested that since the views of most membersof the Cabinet were now public knowledge they should be free toexpress differing opinions forthwith.    On the other hand it was emphasised that the Cabinet needed to reach their decision after examination of the factual results of renegotiation and hearing theviews of their supporters.    This could not be before Tuesday18 March and until then there was no collective decision to differ from.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwould be necessary for the Cabinet, after considering a factualpresentation of the results of renegotiation, to reach a formaldecision on their recommendation to the British people.    He wouldaim to announce the Governments decision on Tuesday 18 March orWednesday 19 March and individual members of the Cabinet wouldthen be free to dissent publicly.    But there would then be some threemonths before the referendum, during which time the Governmentsnormal work must be carried on.    He would circulate guidelines underwhich the agreement to differ would operate, including arrangements to cover the position of those dissenting from the government&apos;s decision when dealing with matters related to e.c. issues inParliament, in the normal processes of Ministerial policy making,and when attending meetings of the e.c. Council of Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.I&quot;Vl-zx.v;.. \i.
pLlAMENTARY   2, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theIpAlRS House of Commons during the following week.IdustrialjcriONBYIvClLLARYJaff atI LACE OF-STMlNSTER3, The Cabinet were informed that some 420 ancillary staff, all of them industrial civil servants, were on unofficial strike at the palace of Westminster.    They had organised picket lines, which werenot being crossed by Civil Service and Post Office van drivers.    from now on picketing was to be on a 24-hour basis and this would effec-tively cut off mail and incoming supplies generally.    Services withinthe Palace of Y/westminster were deteriorating, and would do so muchmore rapidly in the near future, to such an extent that parliament might have to cease work by the middle of the following week.    Sincethe Recess was near, the effect would not be disastrous so far as thelegislative programme was concerned;  but the wider implications ofa closure brought about by unofficial strike action would be veryserious indeed.In discussion it was pointed out that the strike action had arisen froma claim by 180, 000 indxistrial civil servants for the principle of comparability to be applied to their pay as from July 1975 and in themeantime for an interim pay increase to be made.    The handling ofthese claims was to be discussed by the Cabinet separately.Particularly difficult problems were raised by the claim for an interim payment, which would involve a clear breach of the 12-monthrule.    It was possible that acceptance of comparability would by itselflead to a return to work; but the prospects of this could not beregarded as good.    It was argued that it would be undesirable to give way to unofficial strike action, or for the Government to allow it to push them into action which they would not otherwise have thoughtproper.    Discussions with the trade unions concerned had beenarranged for the following Monday and it would be unwise to take anyprecipitate action in the meantime.    A serious situation would however arise if Parliament were forced to close down, in particularbecause it might become a precedent for comparable action to be takenin future, not merely in furtherance of an industrial dispute but as a means of subjecting Parliament to pressure for political purposes.But conditions in the Palace of Westminster might quickly become impossible, in particular because of an increasing hazard to healthdue to the accumulation of refuse;  and it would be wise to makecontingency plans for emergency action, perhaps even involving theuse of troops.    The consequences of such action would however be extremely serious: it would, for example, be liable to cause nation-wide official action by the industrial Civil Service, and there mightwell be repercussions in services which had not so far been seriously affected (for example, Parliamentary printing).    An attempt should therefore be made to explain to the unofficial strikers the serious
implications of the action they were taking;   such an approach mighthave some prospect of s^^ccess since there were indications that the strikers were not fully aware of the serious implications of their action or even fully informed about its objectives.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would shortly be giving separate consideration to the pay ofindustrial civil servants.    As regards the dispute currently affectingthe Palace of Westminster, they agreed that it was necessary toprevent the closure of Parliament without making unjustifiedconcessions to unofficial strike action.    If an early return to normal working could not be secured, emergency action might have to beconsidered.    The Secretary of State for Employment should considerthe possibility, perhaps through a very early meeting of the general purposes Committee of the Trades Union Congress, of arranging forresponsible trade union leaders to represent to their members the seriousness of the action being taken and urge an immediate return to normal working.    In view of doubts whether the strikers fully understood the implications and objectives of the action they were taking, he should also consider whether it would be useful to seek toarrange a meeting early in the following week at which the situation could be fully explained to them and a return to work urged.    But thepossibility of continued industrial action could not be excluded, and,despite the normal convention that the Civil Contingencies Unit did nothandle matters directly affecting the Palace of Westminster., theHome Secretary should arrange for the Unit to put in hand urgentcontingency planning for emergency measures which would enableParliament to continue to function.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,2. Invited the Secretary of State for employment to consider the questions referred to in the summing up and to report his conclusions to the Prime Minister.3. Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the contingency planning of emergency measures to be putin hand by the Civil Contingencies Unit.3
4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the lord president of the Council (C(75) 25 and 29) and the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (C(75) 28) on the referendum aboutmembership of the European Economic Community.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there were several issues raised in the White Paper on the Referendum(Command 5925) on which final decisions were needed so that work could proceed with the drafting of the Referendum Bill in time for itto be considered by Legislation Committee on 25 March andintroduced in the House of Commons before Easter,    Five of these issues were considered in the annexes to C(75) 25.    He proposed thatthe wording on the ballot paper suggested in paragraph 10 of command 5925 should be incorporated in the Bill, which should also provide for the Home Secretary both to appoint a National returning officer who would supervise the arrangements for a national count andcertify the result and to approve the names of observers at the count.Consideration should be given to a free vote on the Government side onthe issue of a national count in Committee.    The Bill should providefor grants of equal size, not exceeding  125, 000 in each case, to britain in Europe and the National Referendum Campaign, on condition that they made a return after the poll of all income andexpenditure from the date of publication of the Bill to the date of the referendum.    Finally the Bill should provide for the ReferendumOrder, which would adapt the existing electoral machinery, to bemade under the Affirmative Resolution procedure,    A draft of theOrder would be made available before the Second Reading of the Bill,but would not at that stage specify the date of the referendum.Discussion showed general agreement with these proposals.    It was however agreed that the words &quot;the Common Market&quot; should be addedin brackets at the end of the Question on the ballot paper so that itwould run:-&quot;Do you think that the United Kingdom should stay in theEuropean Community (the Common Market) ? &quot;.Further consideration should be given to the appointment under the referendum Order of independent observers at polling stations.Justices of the Peace might be suitable, except in Northern Ireland,Every effort should be made to secure Royal Assent to the Bill in timefor the Referendum Order to be laid, to be debated in both Houses ofParliament, and to come into force before the Whitsun Recess.    Itwas also suggested that there was a need to clarify the arrangementsfor the circulation to each household of the statements of both sides ofthe case mentioned in paragraphs 29-30 of the Referendum white paper; and it was argued that these statements should be separate
documents to the fullest possible extent, though arrangements shouldbe made for simultaneous delivery and for printing the documents in similar layout and format.In further discussion it was argued that, if it were decided to have a free vote in Committee on the issue of a national count, this should not extend to members of the Government.    The Government had reached a decision on the matter and it remained important toemphasise the character of the referendum as a national poll on anational issue:  a distinction should be drawn between Governmentmembers and backbenchers, as had been done on other issues onwhich a free vote had been allowed.    On the other hand, it was urgedthat this was an issue on which a free vote on any amendmentproposing the alternative arrangements to a national count should alsoextend to members of the Government, recognising that theGovernment would be able to give a firm lead about their own view,and that there would be political advantage, both now and in thefuture, in allowing an entirely free expression of opinion to the Houseof Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet endorsed the proposals in C(75) 25, subject to addingthe words &quot;(the Common Market)&quot; to the Question on the ballot paper and to giving further consideration to the arrangements for appointingscrutineers.    The Lord President of the Council should arrange forthe Referendum Bill to be considered by Legislation Committee assoon as practicable and introduced before Easter so that it could becarried as quickly as possible through both Houses of Parliament.The Lord President of the Council would indicate the governments view when the proposal for a national count was discussed in committee but there should be a free vote which should extend to members of the Government.    The statements of both sides of thecase to be circulated to each household should be separate documents,though so far as possible of identical format; they should be printedand simultaneously delivered at Government expense; they should avoid the appearance of a Government publication and carry a cleardisclaimer of Government responsibility for the contents.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.
tension of THE HOME SECRETARY, introducing C(75) 23, said that, in view of;nchise and the unique circumstances of the referendum, it was most desirable to^itional ensure that there was the greatest possible opportunity for people toting register their votes.    He therefore proposed that holidaymakers andcilities others away from home on polling day already on the register shouldbe entitled to vote by post;  that Service voters (ie members of the armed Forces and other Crown servants abroad on government business, together with the families of both groups) who had neglectedto register should be given a second opportunity to do so; and that theregister should be extended to include other citizens of the UnitedKingdom and Colonies living abroad who could demonstrate a continuing connection with the United Kingdom.    He was satisfied thatthe various practical difficulties could be overcome.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, as he had indicated in C(75) 29, he was strongly opposed to these proposals.They would represent a substantial departure from the arrangementsused at General Elections;  they were opposed by many members ofthe Labour Party inside and outside Parliament; and they would create serious anomalies.    He accordingly proposed that the electoralregister (apart from the addition of peers) and the arrangements forabsent voting in the referendum should be the same as in a GeneralElection.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were divided on the HomeSecretary!s proposals as a whole.    There was however a good deal of support for the proposal as regards Service voters and government servants serving abroad who fell into the same category, providedthat satisfactory machinery could be devised in time.    The other proposals raised greater difficulties.    It was argued in their favourthat the referendum was unique and could be regarded as different inprinciple from a General Election;  and that on a national issue suchas European Community membership every effort should be made toensure the widest possible franchise embracing all those at home andabroad who could reasonably be regarded as entitled to vote.Against this, it was strongly urged that, whatever their merits inprinciple, the proposals would create great practical problems for theauthorities at home and abroad and be bound to lead to seriousanomalies.    Moreover, if they were adopted for the referendumthere would be strong pressure for their adoption at general elections.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet took the view that the electoral register(apart from the addition of peers) and the arrangements for absentvoting in the referendum should in general be the same as for aGeneral Election.    The Cabinet accordingly rejected the proposalsfor postal votes for those on holiday and others away from home and
also rejected the proposal to extend the register to include certain british subjects overseas, other than Service voters.    On service voters, including Government servants abroad, they took the view thatthey should be enabled to register and vote provided that satisfactorymachinery could be devised in time.    To this end the Cabinet Office,in consultation with officials in the other Departments concerned,should carry out an urgent feasibility study for consideration by theCabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister !s summing up of their disaussion.
-$ 5. THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Glasgow Corporation[ASGOW had asked the Government for help in dealing with the accumulation ofrpUSE rubbish which had built up over the last eight weeks while the 350IMPUTE dustcart drivers have been on unofficial strike over a pay claim.Agreement had been reached, earlier in the week, between the glasgow Corporation and the shop stewards representing the strikerson terms for the immediate resumption of work, but these had to be ratified by a mass meeting of the men to be held the following day.There were grounds for hoping that a settlement would be achieved,but if one were not and the strike continued, the Secretary of State forScotland was under a strong obligation to respond immediately to theCorporation^ request for help.    The only practical form this could take was to put in troops.    It was important that, if this action had tobe taken, the troops should arrive quickly, and that they should be withdrawn as soon as the strike was settled.    If a backlog of rubbishstill remained, it would be for the Glasgow Corporation to find ways of supplementing their own employees, possibly by using contractlabour.    On this basis, he recommended that, as a contingencymeasure, the Secretary of State for Scotland should be authorised tooffer troops to clear the rubbish.    He himself had held a meeting onthe previous day with the Ministers immediately concerned, and detailed contingency planning could be undertaken by the Scottish office in consultation with the Ministry of Defence.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that there had been no prior consulation with the Glasgow Corporation about the way in which thetroops might be used, nor had reconnaissance been carried out since this might become known and prejiidice the chances of a return towork.    If a decision to use troops were made in time on Friday14 March 200 could be deployed by the following Monday and thebalance of 400 by Thursday.    Troops could not easily be spared fromoperational commitments, and it would be a serious step to use themfor strike breaking; but the case for it would be apparent since the accumulation of rubbish presented a potentially serious hazard to health.    It would be essential, however, to avoid any confrontationbetween troops and pickets.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that, if the strikers refused on the following day to return to work, the potential health hazard from the accumulatedrubbish provided a strong argument for agreeing that the Governmentshould help the Glasgow Corporation.    In these circumstances theywere prepared to authorise the use of troops for the duration of thestrike only.    The problem of clearing any remaining backlogremained for subsequent discussion.8
The Cabinet -1. Took note^ with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Agreed that, if the Glasgow Corporationrefuse workers voted to continue their strike, theGovernment should respond to the Corporation^request for help by offering the use of servicemenfor the duration of the strike only.3, Invited the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultation as necessary with the Home Secretary, to arrange forthe necessary contingency planning to be carried out for the deployment of troops early in the following week,, should the need for this arise.4. Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland,in consultation with the Lord President of the Council,the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for defence, to arrange, if necessary, for an announcement in the House of Commons on the following day that theGovernment were prepared to help the glasgow corporation by the use of servicemen.6.

-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC 2/IAJESTY!S government copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 12th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 13 March 1975 at 10. 30 am[VIL The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal (C(75) 26),RVICE the Secretary of State for Social Services (C(75) 30) and the Secretary.Y of State for Employment (C(75) 31) on the 1975 pay research results forthe non-industrial Civil Service,THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the system of pay research that hadbeen in operation for the last 20 years was an extremely precise andrefined procedure for implementing the principle of fair comparisonsrecommended by the Priestley Commission.    The 1975 pay researchgave a figure of 18 per cent for the increase in comparable outsiderates;  this figure was lower than had been expected.    In a pay agreement signed in December 1974 the Government had approved twomodifications of the system.    The first was a correction for time lag,which added 9 per cent to the figure for 1975.    The second was to move the operative date for pay adjustments from 1 January to 1 April;  andthe allowance for the 15-month period since the last increase addedanother 7 per cent, giving a total increase of 34 per cent since the lastpay research.    He recognised that this percentage increase would cause difficulties for the Government but it was no surprise; when the pay agreement was negotiated in December the figures had been expected to amount to 39 per cent to 44 per cent.    The source of thedifficulty was that the Trades Union Congress (TUC) guidelines for payincluded no mention of comparability.    On the other hand theGovernment had given numerous undertakings to preservecomparability for the Civil Service,     The results of the pay researchwere known to the National Staff Side (NSS);  and if they considered thatthe Government had broken faith with them there would not only be animmediate disruption of work but a danger of discrediting the whole system with longer-term consequences that would be very serious.There could be no question of arbitrarily reducing the figure.However, if Ministers were to tell the NSS that the economic circumstances of the country made it difficult for the Government to fulfil its undertakings^, they might agree to forgo the change of
operative date and accept an increase backdated to 1 January,    Thiswould give a 27 per cent increase and save about  72 million for theGovernment,    An approach of this kind seemed to offer the best chance of a compromise.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the paperenclosed with his memorandum had been considered by the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy (EC(P)).    It did not attempt to state the whole case,nor did it express the views of everybody in the Sub-Committee;  butit was intended to be read together with the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s paper toshow the grave problems to which his proposals would give rise.There was an acute problem of reconciling the proposals with the TUCguidelines and with the Government posture on public sectornegotiations that had been agreed in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy.    Even if the proposals could be justified in detailit was the figure of 34 per cent that would appear in the headlines,and reliance on the principle of comparability would hinder the efforts of the TUC to restrain other trades unions from arguing their owncases on the basis of comparability with the miners.    Governmentagreement to a settlement in breach of the guidelines would weaken the position of every negotiator, both in the trades unions and on themanagement side, who wished to observe the social contract.    the repercussions were set out in detail in the annex to his paper,    Themost direct repercussions would be in the Post Office where there wasa danger that the recent settlement would be reopened.    There wouldalso be repercussions on the forthcoming negotiations for electricityworkers and railwaymen and on the dispute in the industrial CivilService in which the principle of comparability was a major factor.There was no question of discriminating against the public sector, but now that economic conditions were beginning to deter expensive pay settlements in the private sector it was all the more necessary to keepthe public sector settlements within the TUC guidelines.    Hesuggested therefore that the Civil Service trades unions should be toldof the Governments difficulties and asked for help in supporting thesocial contract.    They might agree to reduce the annual rate of increase from 27 per cent to 22 per cent, which was still in excess ofthe rise in the cost of living.    The Government might at the sametime ask the TUC to bring their influence to bear on the trades unions concerned.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that because the miners had obtained a large pay increase through freecollective bargaining and the electricity workers were likely to do thesame it did not follow that there should be special restraints on pay forthe Civil Service who were not free to engage in collective bargaining.The system of pay research and the Review Bodies were intended toprovide a substitute for collective bargaining.    The principle of fair
comparisons on which they were based was reaffirmed in thedecisions that the Government had taken on the new Civil Service pay agreement, on the report of the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB) and quite recently in the letter that had been sent on the Prime Minister !behalf to the Chairman of the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body(DDRB).    If the Government abandoned this principle for the CivilService they must revoke their decisions on the TSRB and withdraw their assurance to the DDRB, who would probably then resign withdisastrous consequences for the National Health Service.    If theyrejected this course the only fair alternative was to maintain theprinciple of comparability until the end of the present pay round inJuly, and then introduce new and tougher guidelines that would apply toeverybody.In discussion it was argued that the Government could not abandon theprinciple of fair comparisons which arose out of the Prieatley report.This system had worked well, and the frequent Government under-takings to maintain it had placed their integrity at stake.    If the CivilService felt that the Government had broken its promise there would beindustrial action which might be concentrated on computerisedoperations in the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and Departmentof Health and Social Security,    The result might be to transform theCivil Service into an organisation dominated by militancy, a development which would in the long run be more damaging even thanthe miners&apos; strike.    If the Government chose to make an example ofthe Civil Service, they would not necessarily succeed in influencingother negotiations.    The railwaymen, in particular, would be moreinfluenced by che miners&apos; settlement than by anything that happened inthe Civil Service.Against this it was argued that now that the rates of pay increases inthe private sector were tending to decline it was all the moreimportant to procure a comparable decrease in the public sector.The Government had had to concede a high settlement for the miners and might have to do the same for the power workers but they would betrying to persuade other public sector employers to reduce their ratesof settlement.    The aim must be to reduce the current rate by about per cent and this could not wait until next July.    Otherwise theGovernment could be faced with the stark choice between a sharpdeflation and a statutory incomes policy.    In present circumstancescounter-inflationary policy must be given priority over everything else.Without abrogating the principle of fair comparisons, therefore,Ministers should try to persuade the Civil Service unions on grounds of national interest to accept less than they had been promised.Besides forgoing the change of operative date they might also be persuaded to accept a staging of the time-lag correction.    If theunions rejected this approach and took their case to arbitration theywould probably be awarded at least as much as the Lord Privy Seal
had proposed but the process of arbitration should at least delay thea.ward until after the electricity workers&apos; settlement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal, together with the Chancellorox the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Employment, should see the members of the NSS during the following week.    They should explain the economic situation of the country, the importance ofmaintaining the TUC guidelines and the difficulty of reconciling theCivil Service settlement with them.    They should ask the NSS toaccept that their operative date should remain at 1 January in spite ofthe pay agreement and that the correction of the time lag should be implemented in two equal stages with an interval of a year.    If itwould help to win agreement the Government might have to considerwhether the A.\ per cent that was to be withheld in 1975 should be paidback in the form of arrears of pay at the next pay settlement in 1976.If this approach were unsuccessful he would himself see the NSS,though probably not until after Easter.    If they chose then to go to arbitration the results would not be known until after the Budget, bywhich time the situation might be different.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord Privy Seal, with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Employment, to speak to the National staff side on the lines proposed.Cabinet Office14 March 19754
r;;,::,:;,,,rTflflS DOCUMENT IS THE FR.OPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no cabinet confidential annex cc(year) 12th Conclusions, Minute 7Thursday 13 March 1975 at 10. 30 amlUBLIC THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that sheEXPENDITURE        was ready to announce a programme of capital expenditure on newhospital building schemes for 1975-76.    The programme was inaccordance with the recent White Paper on Public Expenditure, andwould cause widespread disappointment.    She was about to write tothe Chairmen of the Regional Health Authorities to tell them theirallocations of capital for 1975-76 when she received a letter from theChief Secretary,, Treasury, asking all Ministers to make no freshannouncements of public expenditure that would carry substantialcommitments beyond 1975-76 without prior reference to the Treasury.Since all commitments for new hospitals came into that category she had withdrawn her circular.    There were now only three weeks to go before the financial year 1975-76 began.    The withdrawal of the circular at that stage would disrupt planning and money might be wasted.    Any further delay in announcing the programme would arousespeculation about the reasons for it.    Her purpose in raisiag thematter was to ask about the status of the Chief Secretary&apos;s letter.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that when the cabinet had approved the White Paper on Public Expenditure he had said that itmight be necessary to adjust the expenditure for later years in thelight of the economic situation.    In particular it might be necessary to lower the base for the rolling over of Departmental expenditure programmes.    It might now be necessary as a part of his Budget tomake cuts in the projected rate of public expenditure in 1976-77.    Itwas for that reason that the Chief Secretary had asked Ministers to incur no new commitments for that year without prior reference to theTreasury.    Until the decisions were taken it would be only prudent toavoid announcing any further specific projects.1
THE PRIME MINISTER^ summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped to decide in the course of thenext week whether it would be necessary for his Budget package toinclude cuts in public expenditure for 1976-77.    He would then discussthe matter with his colleagues.    Meanwhile the Secretary of State for social Services should continue to withhold her circular.The Cabinet -Took note, with approvalj of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Social Services to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office14 March 19752
