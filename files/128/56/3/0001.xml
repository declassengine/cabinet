i^parliamentary   L The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the &quot;FAIRS House of Commons during the following week.iebate It was reported that difficulties were still arising on debates onnEEC European Economic Community (e.c.) documents.    A number oflocuments Government supporters had put down an embarrassing amendment tothe Government Motion to take note of the documents on agricultural&quot;previous prices which was due to be debated that evening.    The need to keep,efercncc: members late to vote against their own colleagues caused problems;C(75) 1st of Party management,ionclusions,ilnute 4 In discussion it was argued that the problem arose partly because some members were using the new situation to extend Parliamentaryinvolvement into an area previously the preserve of the Executive.On agricultural prices, for example, traditionally Parliament had not known what proposals the Government was considering until the finaldeterminations had been made and announced, and the Governmentwas accountable to the House only at that stage;  it would therefore bean extension of the role of Parliament for it to become involved whilenegotiations were proceeding.    On the other hand it was pointed outthat if Parliament were to exercise an effective role in EEClegislation, it would need to make its views known before decisions were taken by the Council of Ministers.    The Lord President of theCouncil and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would shortly be circulating a joint, memorandum on the handling of these debates.lr John THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL reported that a messagefonehouse had recently been received from Mr Stonehouse asking forarrangements to be put in hand for him to relinquish his seat in theHouse of Commons.    Subsequent reports had suggested that on theadvice of his lawyer he was having second thoughts, and attempts had therefore been made through the British Consul General to securewritten confirmation of his intention to resign.    These had so far been unsuccessful; but the Consul General was hoping to arrange ameeting with Mr Stonehouse and his lawyer during the course of theday,    If, however, no firm indication of Mr Stonehouse&apos;s intentionshad been received by the beginning of the following week it would seemright to proceed with the establishment of a Select Committee to make recommendations about the action to be taken.In discussion it was argued that the matter should be approachedcautiously, despite the strength of feeling amongs the Government&apos;sbackbench supporters that it was intolerable that Mr Stonehouseshould continue as a Member of the House of Commons.    members were chosen by the electors in their constituencies, not by the House
itself;  and the House should therefore beware of acting tooprecipitately over the removal of any properly elected Member,Moreover, while it was true that Mr Stonehouse could not look after his constituents&apos; interests while not in the country, there were a good many instances of Members who had been absent for relatively long periods without giving rise to serious dissatisfaction. .Mr Stonehouse had not been convicted of any criminal offence, andthe objections to taking action merely on the suspicion of such an offence were obvious, particularly since it might be found that illnesslay at the root of some of his recent actions.As against this, it was argued that, in the circumstances of hisdisappearance involving his feigned death, Mr Stonehouse had treatedParliament with contempt;  and he had almost certainly abused hisprivileges as a Member of the House,    And while it was true that noallegations of fraud had been substantiated, he did not deny that he had entered another country by means of a forged passport.    Moreover,the longer the present situation continued, the longer would the electorate of Walsall North be left without effective representation,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that important issues of principle were at stake andthat the decision must not be determined by the present strength of feeling amongst the Governments backbench supporters.    The lord president of the Council should discuss the matter informally withthe Speaker to ascertain whether the basis of any action by the Housemight be that the House had been treated with contempt and perhapsalso that Parliamentary privilege had bean abused.    There should alsobe informal consultations with the Opposition before any action wastaken.    Subject to the outcome of these discussions, it would be right, if no further action had been taken by Mr Stonehouse to relinquish his seat by the beginning of the following week, to arrangefor the matter of his continued membership of the House of commons to be referred to a Select Committee.    If this were not theCommittee of Privileges itself, it would be desirable for anyspecially constituted committee to consist largely of members of theCommittee of Privileges, who were accustomed to dealing with suchmatters in a judicial spirit and would not be unduly swayed by thestrength of feeling amongst backbench Members.    It would be important to ensure that the points which had been raised during the cabinet&apos;s discussion were before the Select Committee and taken intoaccount by them.    The Lord President of the Council should keep himinformed of how it was proposed to proceed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthai the decision by the Soviet Union to repudiate its Trade Agreementwith the United States had led to speculation that the policy of detentewas under threat and that Mr Brezhnev might be in difficulty with hiscolleagues.    It was premature to reach either conclusion.    TheRussians had clearly decided that the conditions about Jewishemigration from the Soviet Union which the United States Congresshad sought to lay down, and the restriction of credits to be madeavailable by the United States Export/Import Bank to the very modestfigure of $300 million over four years, rendered the Trade Agreementunacceptable; but there was no evidence of any intention on the part ofthe Soviet Union to abandon detente,.    Nor should any political significance be attached at this stage to the fact that Mr Brezhnev hadbeen absent fiom public view 9ince the end of December.THE PRIME MINISTER., summing up a brief discussion, said that although it was unlikely that the failure of the Trade Agreement would carry wider implications for detente, the Russians might decide for political reasons to switch some of their trade with the United states to other suppliers.    When he and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary visited the Soviet Union in February a substantial increasein the level of our exports to the Soviet Union would be high on theagenda for discussion.The Cabinet -L Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat he had held discussions in London on 9 and 10 January and in brussels on 14 January with representatives of the sugar producing countries on the supplement to the price to be paid in 1975 for sugarimported into the United Kingdom under Protocol 22 of the Treaty of accession to the European Economic Community (e.c.).    As cabinet had agreed, he had finally offered a price of  250 a ton cif, making it plain that this was the limit.    The producers had in discussionlowered the price they were seeking from  315 a ton to  283 a ton,but at that level had linked it with an extension to 1 July 1976.    Thefollowing morning he was holding a confidential meeting with theMinister of Agriculture for Mauritius at the latter&apos;s request.    Itcould emerge at that meeting that there was further movement by atleast some of the producers.    He had kept representatives of the refinery workers and the Members of Parliament concerned in touchwith the position; they were content with the way it was being handled.
In discussion it was suggested that it was right to stand firm on 250 a ton.    This was a profitable price; the residual world market price was falling sharply, and there were considerable advantages tothe producers in obtaining a long-term contract.    In the light offurther developments, the Cabinet should have a discussion next week on the general position reached and the implications of the optionsopenGThe Cabinet -2. Invited the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food to circulate to the Cabinet for discussionnext week a memorandum on the position on sugarsupplies and prices in the light of the alternative courses of action which were open.,p THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidices that there had been a general discussion in the e.c. Council of&apos;5&quot;76 Ministers (Agriculture) on 13 and 14 January on the prices to bedetermined under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 1975-76.The discussion in the Council of Ministers would be resumed on20 January and continue for much of that week.    The prices were dueto be decided during the course of that meeting, but it was nowdoubtful if they would be.    The meeting would in any case be a difficult one.    His line at it would be in accordance with thediscussions on the subject in the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions,In discussion it was noted that it would be crucial to secure, inaccordance with our renegotiation objectives, an improved regime forbeef, though this did not mean that we need object on doctrinal grounds to any degree of intervention.    The likely increase in prices fordairy products, due both to the next transitional step to e.c. price levels and to the price increases currently under discussion, was aworrying feature.    The Ministers concerned had not reached agreement on the price for milk to be guaranteed to United Kingdomproducers and on the consequences for the consumer price of milk -an issue that was separate from, but related to, the CAP pricenegotiations,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food should be guided in thenegotiations by the discussions that had taken place in the ministerial committee on European Questions.    Any issues, such as that of the milk price, which had not been resolved should be pursued urgentlywithin that Committee, and be reported to the Cabinet if necessary.
The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up this part of their discussion and invited the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food to proceed accordingly,,CENSUS 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary976                        of State for Social Services (C(75) 5) about the inclusion in the 1976___                       census of a question about parents  countries of birth.Parents1Countries THE PRIME MINISTER said that the issue had been fully consideredif Birth by the Home Affairs Committee in December 1974, when it had beendecided on balance that the question should be included;  and theposition of the Secretary of State for Social Services had not then been reserved.    It would therefore not normally be appropriate for thematter to be reopened in Cabinet; but he had agreed to make an exception on this occasion, bearing in mind that the Secretary ofState for Social Services, who was acting on behalf of the RegistrarGeneral and not in her Departmental capacity, had been prevented by pressure of even more urgent business from attending the meeting ofthe Home Affairs Committee.    Very strong grounds would howeverhave to be adduced before it would be right to reverse the decision which the Committee had reached after a full discussion,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theinclusion in the 1971 census of a question about parents  countries of birth had given rise to more complaint than any other question andhad imperilled the success of the census as a whole.    There was no evidence that public feeling had changed significantly since then -indeed, the position might be even more difficult in 1976 than it hadbeen five years earlier, in that Irish people might become reluctant to provide the information required.    It was unlikely that theinformation given in response to the proposed question would beaccurate: in 1971, when 3 per cent of people had failed to answer thequestion, those who had not replied were greater in number than the immigrant community.    Moreover, even if a wholly satisfactory response could be secured, the information collected would bemisleading because many people one or both of whose parents hadbeen born in the new Commonwealth were in fact white - figuresprovided by the Registrar General showed that, of people over 18 with one parent born in the new Commonwealth, four out of five were white.Information no less accurate than would be obtained directly from aquestion about parents&apos; countries of birth could be securedindirectly by assigning young people in a household to the ethnic groupidentified by the country of birth of the adults in the household.    this method, though admittedly not wholly accurate - in particular
because it would not identify coloured adolescents who had beer born in this country but had left home - would be much less likely to causeoffence.    The Registrar General felt strongly that the use of thisindirect approach was preferable;  and considerable weight must begiven to his advice on technical matters of this kind.In discussion, it was argued that there was still a real danger thatthe inclusion of a question about parents&apos; countries of birth would cause offence and that, since reasonably accurate information couldbe secured by other means, it was not worth imperilling the successof the census as a whole by including it.    It was perhaps significant that in the Civil Service the Staff Side were strongly opposed to therecent decision that a count should be made of coloured employees.The case against inclusion was strengthened by the fact that therewould not be a corresponding question in the census in Scotland.As against this, it was argued that the decision by the Home AffairsCommittee had been taken after a full discussion and should stand.Points which had particularly weighed with the Committee were thatthe voluntary organisations active in the race relations field nowfavoured including the question, which supported the view that opinion had changed since 1971;  and that the omission of a questionwhich had appeared in the last census would lead to suspicions thatthe Government were seeking to conceal embarrassing information.Moreover, the seriousness of the opposition in 1971 could beoverstated - the failure of 3 per cent of people to respond to thequestion about parents&apos; countries of birth seemed in many cases tohave arisen from a simple misunderstanding of what was required,not from dislike of the question.    Furthermore, many of the complaints which had been made came not from the colouredcommunity but from white people one or both of whose parents hadbeen born overseas.    Policies calling for positive discrimination infavour of immigrant and other deprived gx-oups required informationmore accurate than would be produced by the indirect approachproposed by the Registrar General;  and informed opinion was increasingly abandoning the view that differences in colour should betreated as though they did not exist or did not matter, and instead wastending to hold that sensible policies were impossible unless based onobjective facts, and consequently on the collection of relevant andaccurate information.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing vip the discussion, said that theCabinet&apos;s discussion had shown that there were substantial argumentsboth for and against including in the 1976 census a question aboutparents&apos; countries of birth.    Like the Home Affairs Committee,however, the Cabinet had decided on balance that the question shouldbe included, and the Secretary of State for Social Services should inform the Registrar General accordingly.
iannelInnelference::(75) 2ndnclusions,nute 3The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2.       Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services toinform the Registrar General of the Cabinefs decision that,on balance, the question about parents  countries of birthshould be included in the 1976 census.4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTrecalled that the Cabinet at their previous meeting had agreed inprinciple that the present Channel Tunnel project must be regarded asabandoned, and the French Government so informed, subject to more detailed discussion by the Ministerial Committee on the ChannelTunnel Project.    Since then the Ministerial Committee had considered the matter and had come to the same conclusion.    Asregards giving effect to the decision, the only real alternatives in theCommittee &apos;s view were to undertake some months of negotiation withthe French Government on the possibility of going forward on some new basis, or else to close down the project while keeping open thepossibility, at modest expense, of taking it up again in five or tenyears&apos; time.    The balance of opinion on the Committee had been infavour of the second alternative, because the first seemed to themlikely to endager the equal sharing of charges between the twoGovernments, to prolong the planning blight connected with the high-speed rail link, and to involve the British Government negotiating inbad faith, a situation which would be evident to all concerned.    Evenin the context of the renegotiation of the terms for Britain&apos;s membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.), anattempt to prolong negotiations with the French Government would inhis view involve the risk of coming to the point of final decision onthe project at an even less propitious moment.    He had seen theFrench Ambassador the previous day and given him a message toM Cavaille, the French Minister of Transport;  he had circulated acopy of this to members of the Cabinet.    Predictably, the ambassador had indicated his distress about this development, and the french were sure to adopt an indignant posture in public.    As the cabinet were aware, he himself would greatly have preferred a year*s delay and a mature decision on the project, and he was still sure that atsome time we would need to have a fixed electric rail link between britain and France;  nevertheless the present project was clearlydead, and it was some consolation that it was the action of thecompanies which had provided the opportunity to make a clear-cutdecision.In discussion it was emphasised that this decision was bound to placeus in a very difficult position in relation to the French Government,not simply in the e.c. context but in terms of our diplomatic posturethroughout the woricl.    Experience showed that the French would takethe utmost advantage of any opportunity to damage us in the eyes of 
other countries, for instance in the Euro-Arab dialogue, and it was unfortunate to give them plausible pretexts for arguing that theBritish could not be trusted to persevere in difficult circumstances.The first reactions from the French Government to the decision onthe Channel Tunnel project suggested that they would certainly try toavoid paying their share of the charges arising from abandonment,and that they would do little to help in closing down the project inorderly fashion.    It might still be possible to lessen the damage ifwe were prepared to continue negotiations with the FrenchGovernment for a month or two, if necessary sending a seniorMinister to Paris for the purpose,,On the other hand, it was pointed out that the final decision had come about as a result of the companies&apos; action, and a statement of theBritish Government&apos;s position by 20 January was essential.    Thetwo Governments had equally been placed in an impossible position bythe action of the companies, and we had previously received the clearimpression that the French Government too would have preferred tohave postponed the full construction stage for a year or more, eventhough the Tunnel was a far better investment for them than for us.In these circumstances there was no alternative but to endorse thedecision reached by the Ministerial Committee, and the action takenby the Secretary of State for the Environment to inform the FrenchGovernment,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusion that the present Channel tunnel project must now be regarded as abandoned, and the decision that itshould be closed down in such a way as to keep open the possibility,at modest expense, of taking it up again in five or ten years&apos; time.They recognised that this was bound to put us in a difficult position inrelation to the French Government, but they endorsed the message which the Secretary of State for the Environment had sent to theFrench Minister of Transport;  every effort must now be made to closedown the project in an orderly fashion.    The Secretary of State forthe Environment should make a statement to Parliament on thefollowing Monday.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
