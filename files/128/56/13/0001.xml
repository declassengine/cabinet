IecrenegotiationItocktakingPreviousReference:fC(75) 12thConclusions,minute 1jeneral1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (C(75) 33) on the results of the renegotiation of the terms of British accession to the european economic Community (e.c.),THE PRIME MINISTER said that this meeting of the Cabinet was designed to elucidate the terms which had been renegotiated by theGovernment, considering them under the objectives forrenegotiation set out in the Labour party  s Manifesto for theGeneral Election in February 1974,    Later in the day he would discuss the renegotiated terms with members of the government not in the Cabinet and with the Parliamentary Lebour Party,    TheCabinet would resume its discussion on the following day when itshould try to decide whether or not to recommend continuingmembership.    They would then have to form a judgment, not onlyon the revised terms that had been negotiated, but also on the presentcharacter of the Community,    There was an important distinctionbetween its practical working, which was now more political inapproach, and its theoretical and legal basis.    If any minister could not support the Government recommendation, he would be free to say so:  and in this context guidelines for the &quot;agreement to differ&quot; would be circulated which would have regard to the need to preserve a united Cabinet on all other issues.    In particularpersonal attacks on or replies to colleagues must be avoided,although the media might try to promote their appearance.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled thatrenegotiation could not get seriously under way until the Governmenthad been returned with a majority in October 1974, by which time there were new Heads of Government in West Germany and inFrance,    In view of the referendum commitment the Governmenthad nevertheless decided that it should plan to conclude renegotiationby the early spring of 1975.    This had limited the period of effectiverenegotiation to about four months:  and it had clearly not beenpossible to achieve all the Governments objectives within thatperiod.    Some v/ould have to be pursued in continuing e.c. business.He would however like to make some general observations as aresult of twelve months&apos; experience of the e.c.,    First, it waschanging fast, under the pressure of world events as well as ofBritish influence.    The world food situation was radically different from that envisaged when we were considering applying for membership.    In particular the balance between primary producers and industrialised countries had moved more in favour of the former,a development which a Labour Government could not oppose;   and thiswould have to be taken into account in determining British food and agricultural policy whether we were members of the e.c. or not.The previous plans for progress towards economic and monetaryunion had been set aside, as had federalist concepts.    The
e.c. was now showing a much more open attitude to the rest of theworld.    Secondly, there were limits to the Commissions power:the real power resided in the Council of Ministers,    regular meetings of the Council, especially the newly introduced systemof regular meetings of Community Heads of Government, were giving co-ordinated political leadership to the Community,    TheCommission remained the guardian of the treaties, and as suchtended to be supported by the smaller members oi the community to protect themselves against undue dominance by West Germany,France and the United Kingdom.    Thirdly, the Community was much more sensitive to, and readier to meet, national interests of member states than might have appeared.In a short general discussion it was emphasised that any criticism of the renegotiated terms was not intended as a reflection on theskill and vigour of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary or ofother Ministers involved in renegotiation, who had promoted Britishinterests with ability.    The Cabinet then considered the varioustopics covered in the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;smemorandum.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the february Manifesto had called for &quot;major changes in the common agricultural Policy (CAP), so that it ceases to be a threat to world trade in food products, and so that low-cost producers outside europe can contimie to have access to the British food market&quot;.We had not challenged the basic principles of the policy - the objectives of which were similar to those of the British agricultural policy, from the Agriculture Act 1947 onwards - but we had sought to change it from withins    Moreover, in view of the changed world situation, an assured supply at relatively stable prices (which werefalling in real terms), as provided by the CAP, would be in our national interest.    The arrangements made for the import of sugarwere advantageous;  and the principles adopted for continuingimport of New Zealand dairy products were also helpful.    TheCommission^ review on which the stocktaking of the CAP wouldbe conducted was on balance favourable to our policy approach.In view of the changes which had already occurred, and those whichwould be made - if we were in a position to keep up pressure for reform from within - he considered the position reached on the cap to be acceptable.In discussion it was argued that there had been no change in thefundamental structure of the CAP - Community preference, variablelevies on imports, and support buying.    The stocktaking would takeplace outside the renegotiation timetable;  and, since the Commissionand several of the other member states would defend the present arrangements strongly, we could not say how much success would be2
achieved,,    Even if we could not alter the principles of the CAPfor the whole Community, we should have obtained a derogationfrom them for the United Kingdom;  and this had not been achieved.The arrangement whereby we could operate deficiency payments forbeef had been agreed for one year only and Mr Lardinois, theCommissioner concerned, had made plain his dislike of nationalaids.    Improved access for third country foodstuffs, apart fromsugar and New Zealand dairy products, had been left until the multilateral trade negotiations, which would take place outside the renegotiation period, where too it was uncertain what would beachieved.    It was doubtful whether there had been a fundamental change in world food factors:  events of the last two years mightconstitute only a temporary change.    North America had ampleresources for increased food production.    Already grain prices had fallen sufficiently far for the e.c. to reintroduce levies on imports.    The e.c. butter price was very high compared with theworld price, and there was still a general ban on imports of beef.It could thus be argued that the CAP remained a threat to world food trade and constituted a system of taxes on food.On the other hand, it was pointed out that CAP prices were nowbeing determined in accordance with criteria which economicallywere more soundly based.    As a result they were being brought down in real terms from their previous excessive levels, whileworld prices had risen.    Membership of the e.c. no longer caused the heavy increase in food prices that had been expected before our entry.    On balance the extra costs were approximately balancedby the benefits of the CAP, leaving our total food bill at about thesame level as it would have been if we were outside the Community.Although levies were now payable on cereal imports, they were more than offset by the e.c. systems of compensatory amounts,and we were therefore still obtaining cereals more cheaply than if wewere outside the e.c.;  and world cereal prices were now risingagain.    Dairy products remained the area where e.c. prices were relatively high; but the only other major supplier was New Zealand,which had not been able to supply the quantities provided for over thepast two years and could not give an assurance that she would do soin the coming years.    In any case the New Zealand Government,who had welcomed the agreement reached in the e.c. Heads ofGovernment meeting in Dublin on 10/11 March on the principles to govern continued access for New Zealand dairy products, had made it plain that they would seek appreciably higher prices for their exports.   Although future world food supplies and prices could notbe forecast, we could not base our policy on the expectation of a return to cheap food.    Specific approaches on this had been made during renegotiation to our traditional Commonwealth suppliers,who had made it plain that they did not wish to return to that system.If there were a return to heavy surpluses, we would in any case3
wish to take action, for broad political reasons, to safeguard theinterests of primary producers.    It was more probable, however,that demand for food from developing countries would keep world supplies tight.    We were likely to wish to expand our ownagriculture for import-saving reasons, and the CAP could assistthat,    The stocktaking of the CAP would be an important forum inwhich to pursue our objectives;  and it was unrealistic to expect usto have obtained a permanent change in the beef regime in advanceof this.    We should also pursue further improvements in accessfor third country foodstuffs of concern to us, such as hard wheat;but we had had success in reducing tariffs on a wide range of foodstuffs in a number of trade negotiations, and the overall impact of tariffs on foodstuffs was now small.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the february Manifesto had called for &quot;new and fairer methods of financing the Community budget.    Neither the taxes that formed theso-called &apos;own resources&apos; system of the Communities, nor thepurposes, mainly agricultural support, on which the funds are mainly to be spent, are acceptable to us.    We would be ready to contribute to Community finances only such sums as were fair in relation towhat is paid and what is received by other countries&quot;.    TheGovernment had decided not to seek to overturn the &quot;own resources&apos;system as such, but to correct its unfair impact.    Against strong opposition we had achieved considerable success.    We had obtained a correcting mechanism which would bring our gross contributionmore closely into line with our share of the Community&apos;s gross national product (GNP).    This mechanism was subject to a numberof qualifying conditions, only one of which was likely to bite;  andthere would be a ceiling on the potential refund available.    But theend result would be a worthwhile reduction in our contribution tothe Community budget.    We must expect to continue to be netcontributors since, among other reasons, some of the items of community expenditure - eg aid for developing countries - were those we wished to see extended.    The aim in the form set out inthe Manifesto had net been met, but renegotiation had resulted in anew Community arrangement which would bring a considerable financial improvement to us;  and he recommended the Cabinet toaccept it.In discussion the following points were made -i. The fact that in renegotiation we had not directlyattacked the &apos;own resources1 system did not mean that we accepted it.    In this context it was relevant that since twoof the three elements in &quot;own resources&apos; were agriculturallevies and import duties, the United Kingdom, as the majorworld trader in the Community, could not avoid being a heavy4
contributor;  and, since a high proportion of expenditurewent on agricultural support, inevitably our receipts were relatively low,ii. The limitations in the correcting mechanism meant that, in net terms, only about one-third of the gap between our contributory share of the budget and of the Community&apos;sGNP would be covered.    We should seek to improve ourposition by, in accordance with general Government policy,pursuing policies designed to increase our GNP, and also by aiming to increase our receipts from the community budget,iii. Forecasts of net contributions in the future were.                   very uncertain, as the considerable differences betweenforecasts and much lower out-turn for the past two yearsdemonstrated,iv. If we benefitted from the correcting mechanism forthree years in succession the Community would review theposition with us in order to consider what further action was required.    If we were lagging behind the convergingeconomies of the other members, this further action couldbe beneficial.    The Community might say that our pooreconomic performance in these circumstances was due toour following the wrong policies, just as other international organisations in this field could and did; but conditionscould not be imposed upon us which would affect ourbenefits from the correcting mechanism if we continued to qualify for a refund.Economic and THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the monetary Union        Manifesto commitment read:   &quot;We would reject any kind ofinternational agreement which compelled us to accepted increasedunemployment for the sake of maintaining a fixed parity .... Webelieve that the monetary problems of the European countries canbe resolved only within a world-wide framework&quot;.    There had however been a major change in the attitude of other member governments to the practicability of achieving economic and monetary union (EMU) by 1980.    The programme for advancing toEMU by stages had been tacitly abandoned.    EMU remained along-term Community goal, but we should be able to ensure thatour interests were fully protected by the veto if and when any proposals were made in that direction.    There was no prospect ofour coming under pressure to agree to an arrangement which wouldthreaten the level of unemployment in this country.    The &quot;world-wide framework&quot; referred to in the Manifesto had been used by theCommunity in recent months, at the instigation of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to consider monetary problems.5
In discussion it was argued that the communique of the ParisSummit in December 1974 had affirmed that the Community1 s will to make progress towards EMU had not weakened and that thiscommunique could be used in the future to push us in an unacceptabledirection.    On the other hand it was pointed out that EMU was along-term goal of the same character as general and complete disarmament;  desirable in principle but unattainable in practice.The reality was different from the visionary concept ofcommuniques.    There was increasing emphasis on co-operationbetween Member Governments of a kind which would make it less important to achieve the linked exchange rates which had beenprominent in previous thinking.    Progress along these lines wasin our interests.    The Governments White Paper on the outcome of renegotiation might make clear that the stages, adopted in 1971and 1972 for progress towards EMU, were tacitly discarded in the paris Communique of December 1974.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the manifesto objective was &quot;the retention by Parliament of those powers over the British economy needed to pursue effective regional,industrial and fiscal policies&quot;.    The regional aspect had beenconsidered by the Cabinet on 27 February, when a majority concluded that, subject to the overall judgment on the outcome of renegotiation,the Communication from the Commission met our requirements.That Communication established a hierarchy of assisted areas whichconformed with our own.    No forms of national aids were ruled outin principle, and there was no interference with our existingregional aids.    The Commission had acknowledged that national governments were the best judges of what was required in their own country and that urgent action by Governments should not be held upby Treaty procedures.   A derogation was being obtained for theassistance given by the Highlands and Islands Development Board.Parliament retained the power to vote money for regional assistance and to allocate this money in a way which was required to promoteeffective regional policies.    The Commissions powers werederived from the e.c. Treaty, which laid emphasis on the need toavoid assistance which gave unfair advantage to one Member Stateover another and he would circulate some reassuring supplementarycorrespondence with the Commission on the matter.In discussion it was argued that the Manifesto commitment had notbeen met since the legal power to grant regional assistance in thiscountry remained fettered by the Treaty and the powers of theCommission,    The Commissions Communication laid downprinciples which were valid for only three years and provided nosafeguards for future changes in our aids.    It was argued, on theother hand, that the Communication, and our experience of theoperation of the TreatyS provisions, demonstrated that we should
encounter difficulty in the Community only if we used a regionalaid to give an unfair competitive advantage to our industry over thatof another member state, or to outbid another member state by making special regional grants to secure an investment projectwhich would have otherwise gone elsewhere in the Community.The assisted areas in the United Kingdom could be assured thattheir position had been completely safeguarded.    If we withdrewfrom the Community, any free trade arrangement we were able tonegotiate would be bound to include competition provisions similarto the rules in the e.c. Treaty.    We should also still be bound byother international agreements of this kind.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that wehad not met with any serious difficulties from the e.c. in theconduct of industrial policy during the past year, and it wasincorrect to suggest that the Treaties and the Commission stood in the way of the policies to which the Government were committed.If we withdrew from the Community, the competition rules attachedto any free trade agreement would extend to industrialarrangements, as well as to regional assistance.    The proposals in the Industry Bill for the National Enterprise Board and for planning agreements were in no way incompatible with the EECTreaty, provided that powers were not exercised in a way whichdamaged the interests of other member states.    The e.c. Treatyspecifically permitted nationalisation.    The provision in theIndustry Bill for stopping foreign takeovers would of course haveto be exercised in a way which did not discriminate against EECfirms: but that limitation would have to be weighed in the overallassessment of the outcome of renegotiation.In discussion it was argued that the experience of the past year was,in the special cir cum stance sr an inadequate safeguard for thefuture, since power still resided with the Community institutions,rather than with Parliament.    The Manifesto commitment had not therefore been met.    On the other hand, our own system of planning agreements was partly based on the practice in Franceand other e.c. countries where it had not run into difficulties withthe Treaty or the Commission.    This illustrated how the Cabinetsoverall judgment would need to be based on how far the e.c., now and in the future, would operate in the pragmatic way which our experience had shown was to be expected, instead of juridicallyand with an over-strict regard for the letter of the Treaties.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had himself raised the questionof steel with the other Heads of Community Governments at their recent meeting in Dublin.    He had reminded them that neither theTreaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, nor any -rules and practices developed under the Treaty, derogated in any7
way from the right of Britain or of any other member country toextend the boundaries of public ownership or to take the whole steelindustry into public ownership.    When Britain joined the e.c. theConservative Government had repealed the statutog?y powers which gave the Government certain controls over private investment.This had meant that the Government could not deal adequately withthe problem of the mini-mills.    This position had to be put right,if necessary by amendment to the Treaty.    He had however told theother Heads of Government that he would be glad to learn from their experience in solving similar problems, to see whether ours couldbe resolved in a way compatible with the Treaty,    He had assuredthem that we should much prefer to avoid a Treaty amendment, butthat it was of vital importance to us that the problem should be solved.    It was not practicable to make progress on it before theend of renegotiation and it would fall to be dealt with in the futurework of the Community if we remained members after the referendum.In discussion it was pointed out that difficulties had also arisen inrelation to the acquisition of a private steel firm.    There were grounds for supposing, however, that the Commission^ reaction tothe original proposal may have been due to a failure to understandclearly what the Governments intentions were.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that noproblems had arisen in relation to fiscal policies.    certain measures had been proposed to harmonise the structure of someindirect taxes.    We should be able to block any proposals which we considered unacceptable.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the manifesto commitment was to prevent &quot;harmonisation of value-added tax (VAT) which would require us to tax necessities&quot;.    Theproposals now being discussed in the Community were concernedwith agreeing a uniform assessment base for VAT.    They providedfor our system of zero rating,    We should be ready to resist any proposals in this field which were unacceptable to us.In discussion it was pointed out that the need for a uniformassessment base for VAT arose because the budgetary resourcesof the Community under the &quot;own resources5 system would includesums corresponding to the yield of VAT charged at a rate of up to1 per cent on a uniform base.    Our system of zero rating was provided for in the uniform base which had been proposed.    all member states would find it difficult to agree on harmonisation ofthe actual rates of VAT.
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the february Manifesto read:  &quot;We need an agreement on capital movements which protects our balance of payments and full employment policies&quot;.    Last year the Government had been able,by using provisions in the e.c. Treaty about member states in balance of payments difficulties, to revert to what was broadly thesame exchange control regime as applied before accession.    action could continue to be taken under these provisions to protect our balance of payments.In discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet should have furtherinformation about the terms of the derogations we had been granted in respect of capital movements; these would be provided by theChancellor of the Exchequer.    The Treaty provisions under whichwe had acted provided for an investigation by the Commission of theposition of the member state which invoked them, but theCommission^ consequential recommendations would need to go before the Council of Ministers, where we should not agree to measures which were unacceptable to us,    The international monetary Fund regulations contained similar provision for an investigation in appropriate circumstances,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the february Manifesto read:  &quot;The economic interests of theCommonwealth and the developing countries must be safeguarded.This involves securing continued access to the British market and,more generally, the adoption by an enlarged Community of tradeand aid policies designed to benefit not just Associated overseas territories&apos; in Africa but developing countries throughout the world&quot;.Our membership of the e.c. had brought considerable benefits tothe Commonwealth both in opening up the Community market to themand in aid.    He had had conversations in the past few months withrepresentatives of many developed and developing members of theCommonwealth.    In all cases they had thought that their interests were better safeguarded by our being inside the e.c. rather than out.In addition to what had been achieved in respect of sugar andNew Zealand dairy products, there had been the importantachievement of the Lome Convention between the e.c. and46 developing countries, 22 of them in the Commonwealth, fromAfrica, the Caribbean and the Pacific,    This convention had beenhailed internationally as a major new development, and asestablishing a satisfactory basis for relations between the developed and the developing world.    The scheme for the stabilisation of export earnings from commodities was a new step of especial value.The Community&apos;s Generalised Scheme of Preferences had been greatly improved and extended to beyond 1980,    Aid to developing countries outside the Lome Convention had been agreed in principle,but no money had yet been forthcoming.    This was an issue which9
the Germans looked upon as affecting their national financial interest, and they were proving difficult about it.    On trade, a wide range of improvements had been made in a number of trade negotiations which would be of assistance to Commonwealth and developing countries.    In his view therefore the Manifestoobjective had been met.In discussion it was argued that the situation on aid to SouthernAsia required further consideration, and that the Minister of overseas Development had expressed her dissatisfaction on thispoint.    Although the countries concerned would benefit under theGeneralised Scheme of Preferences and from bilateral aid, weshould keep up our pressure on the Community to implement theprinciples for world-wide aid which it had accepted.    It should berecognised that our withdrawal from the Community would reducerather than increase the pressure for better treatment for southern Asia;  and the countries concerned understood this,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their discussion the following day, startingwith the general issue of Parliamentary sovereignty and moving onto an assessment of the overall package.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume on the following day their consideration of the outcome of renegotiation.10
:: &apos; :...rvLtionalisationIf theIrcraft andfelPBUILDlNGIdustries2. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that thevSecretary of State for Industry would be announcing later in theday the terms of compensation for nationalising the aircraft and shipbuilding industries,.    In accordance with precedent these hadbeen considered by a very small group of Ministers under his ownchairmanship:  and it remained of the utmost importance to avoid any leakage of information in advance of the Secretary of State5sstatement.    Nevertheless he thought members of the cabinet should see the statement in advance of it being made, and copieswere being made available to them accordingly.    The essence ofthe Governments proposals was that the precedent of the Iron andSteel Act 196? should be followed and that the Government shouldbuy shares rather than assets, mainly because assets are variouslyvalued in company books, often at prices inflated well beyond theirearning capacity.    Some shareholders would no doubt consider itharsh to base compensation on shares despite the recent recoveryon the Stock Exchange, but such criticism had been anticipated bychoosing a comparatively generous reference period^, namely the six months prior to the Election in February 1974, when thegeneral level of share prices was significantly higher than it was now.    No deduction would be made from compensation in respectof past aid given on settled terms, since it would be against allprecedent to alter such terms retrospectively but, equally ^ nocredit would be allowed for expectations of future aid0    provision would be made as usual for prices to be decided by arbitration ifthe Secretary of State for Industry could not agree them with thestockholders&apos; representative.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office17 March 197511
