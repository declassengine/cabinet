1, The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C(75) 32) reporting on the considerationgiven by the Legislation Committee to the role of Parliament in the context of the renegotiation objectives,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the legislation committee had thoroughly considered this matter at a series of meetings over the past 12 months.    The essential question was theextent to which membership of the Community entailed limitations onthe sovereignty of Parliament and how far any such limitations couldbe removed or lessened consistently with continued membership.This issue arose from the unique character of the Treaties of rome and Paris, which involved the acceptance of certain types of community in?trument as directly applicable law in the member statesParliament could undoubtedly exercise its ultimate sovereignty byrepealing the European Communities Act 1972, thereby taking us outof the Community,    Indeed the commitment to the referendumdemonstrated this.    The continuance of the direct applicability of community law in the United Kingdom depended ultimately, therefore,on the continuing assent of Parliament to our membership of theCommunity.    The Luxembourg Communique, on unanimity within theCouncil of Ministers in matters of vital rational Interest, provided a safe guard for the United Kingdom;  and it was for the Government todecide how far to allow its exercise of the veto to be subject toParliaments instructions.    The Legislation Committee were agreedthat it was essential not to obscure the fact that Parliaments controlof day-to-day legislation in some areas had been diminished byaccession to the Community.    This situation could be dealt with in oneof two main ways.    The first was to eliminate directly applicableCommunity legislation for the future by amendment of or derogationfrom the relevant Treaty provisions or by agreement within theCommunity that the use of these provisions should be renounced.    a minority in the Committee had felt that this objective should be pursued as a condition of continued membership.    The majority didnot favour this course since it would represent a major departure forthe Community from its established methods of working;  and itwould hinder the rapid and effective implementation of agreementsarrived at in the Council, jeopardising in certain cases the contin-continuance of common policies.    Moreover, to embark on this course atthis stage would amount to a new renegotiation demand which was likely to be considered by other member states as inconsistent withmembership.    The fact of directly applicable law as an essential partof the Community&apos;s operation should be made clear to the electoratebefore the referendum, thus in effect enabling a decision on this issue to be taken through the medium of the referendum.    The Committeewere agreed that, whatever the outcome on the main issue, theGovernment should strengthen the arrangements for Parliamentaryscrutiny and debate of legislative proposals before their adoption bythe Council.
The Legislation Committee were divided on the desirability ofenacting a statutory declaration of the ultimate sovereignty ofParliament.    The majority considered that such a declaration wouldbe a misleading nullity which would be contrary to normal constitu-tional practice and would give rise to suspicion in the Community andto misconception at home.    Another supplementary option was to tighten the conditions in Schedule 2 to the European Communities Actfor the use of subordinate legislation to implement non-directlyapplicable obligations, though Parliamentary time would then have tobe found for additional primary legislation.    A limited amendment ofthis kind would be peripheral to the main debate on sovereignty andwould not provide an amending Bill of any substance.    Finally, therewas the suggestion that the scrutiny procedures should be put into a statutory form.    In his view it would be unsound to attempt to frameParliamentary procedurss in a statutory form.In the circumstances he had come to the view that the right course wasto concentrate on improving the arrangements for Parliamentaryscrutiny of Community proposals and the arrangements for debates inParliament before the Government entered into decisions orcommitments in the Council of Ministers.    Work could be urgentlypursued to this endf though it would be necessary to have regard tothe recommendations of tne Select Committee on Procedure,In discussion it was argued that consideration of the issue ofParliamentary sovereignty should not have been separated from the handling of other renegotiation issues;  the Cabinet was only now considering fundamental questions which might otherwise have been raised with the Community at an early stage in the process.    Theright of the Community to impose directly applicable legislation and toimpose taxes under the &quot;own resources&quot; formula were the mostserious of all the changes involved for the United Kingdom inCommunity membership.    Directly applicable regulations were anobsolete feature of the Community related to a period when it was regarded as potentially a supranational organisation;  the directive,which allowed more scope for Parliamentary initiative, was the formof legislation more suited to the Community&apos;s modified aspirations.The system of directly applicable law, made by the Community, wasa gross infringement of sovereignty in the sense that politicalsovereignty rested in the power of a nation to make its own laws.The application of the veto was not relevant to the role of theCommission;  and we had had to accept the existing laws of theCommunity on entering into membership.    The transfer ofParliaments legislative powers to the Council of Ministers, and evenmore so to the Commission which was not elected and not accountable to the people of the United Kingdom, represented the most seriousattack on Parliamentary democracy with which this country was faced.The relationship botween Parliament and the Government in relation to
European Commiinity bufiness would result in a dismemberment ofthe authority of the House of Commons.    Moreover the threat toParliament from Community membership was compounded by theprospect of a directly elected European Assembly;  and it would be aggravated by the establishment of directly elected Assemblies inScotland and Wales.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the issue of sovereignty hadbeen considered by the Labour Cabinet in 1967 and that the implications of Community membership had been spelt out in detail inthe White Paper &quot;Legal and Constitutional Implications of UnitedKingdom Membership of the European Communities&quot; (Cmnd 3301).The renegotiation process had been conducted in full knowledge ofthese implications.    It had been essentially concerned with thej   revision of the terms on which we should be able to display our national sovereignty within the Community in dealing with the policy issues which concerned us.    Many of the changes secured weredirectly related to the protection of United Kingdom sovereignty in regional and industrial ma.matters.    The Commission had no power toimpose direct taxes outside the limits already laid down in the &quot;own resources&quot;&apos; system.   Despite the Treaties of Rome and Paris our power to make our own laws remained;  Parliament could, if at anytime it so wished, repudiate all our obligations under the Treaties andrecall the powers which it had delegated to the Communityinstitutions.    The exercise of sovereignty was a political rather thana juridical issue;  and, if Parliament was dissatisfied with the performance of the Government within the Community framework, itcould exercise its powers to criticise Ministers or even to enforce achange of Government.    It was desirable to allow the Parliamentaryprocedures for Community business to continue to be developed witha view to achieving a balance between the power of Ministers to actand the pov/er of Parliament to hold them to account.    This meantdeveloping arrangements which would enable Parliament to express itsview on the right issues, in the right form at the right time.    Forthis reason, and on wider grounds8 it might be desirable to intitiate a major review of the conduct of Parliamentary business in the earlyfuture.In further discussion there was criticism of the way in which theCommission had promoted unnecessary harmonisation in comparatively minor matters (though the Commission had recentlybehaved more sensibly in this respect).    These were not matters suitablefor the exercise of veto powers.    If we remained members of theCommunity, it was desirable to direct Community energies away fromthese channels.    We could also seek a number of other changes in the role and structure of the Commission, including a reduction in thenumber of Commissioners (and consequently in the activities of commission staff) and in the scale of Commission expenditure.Certain other member states had similar ideas.3
THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL, invited to reply to thediscussion, said it was clear that Parliament could not divest itselfultimately of its sovereignty and was in a position to bring the UnitedKingdom out of the Community at any time by repealing the european communities Act 1972.    His own view remained that, while we remained members, any proposal we might contemplate making inorder to change the concept of directly applicable Community lawcould not be expected to succeed since it would alter the essentialcharacter of the Community.    None of the other possible amendments of the European Communities Act would be satisfactory.    A statutorydeclaration of the sovereignty of Parliament would be seen to be purelycosmetic.    To restrict the power to implement Community directivesby subordinate legislation would not meet the real concern which hadbeen expressed and would unnecessarily involve the Government in finding time for additional primary legislation.    To embody the scrutiny procedures in statute would import an unsound and unnecessary rigidity Into Parliamentary arrangements.    If the referendum decision were to remain in the Community the Governmentshould however continue to strengthen the scrutiny procedures, and itmight shortly be desirable to give a reconstituted ProcedureCommittee of the House of Commons a wide-ranging remit whichwould cover the European Community field in the context of examining the whole of the arrangements for conducting Parliamentary business.The Cabinet -Took note, and agreed to take this discussion intoaccount in their consideration of the outcome of renegotiation as a whole.4
2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet must now reach a decision on the outcome of renegotiation.    His own recommendation,in which he was joined by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,was that the United Kingdom should remain a member of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.).    In their view the objectives for renegotiation of the terms of British accession to the e.c. as setout in the Labour Party&apos;s Manifesto for the General Election ofFebruary 1974 had substantially been met.    The decision whether ornot to remain members of the e.c. should however take into accountnot only the renegotiated terms, but changes which had occurred -and for which we could claim some of the credit - in the workingpractice of the Community.    It was now operating much more underthe political direction of the Governments of member states.    It wasalso very relevant that the Commonwealth countries, some of whom were diversifying their trading pattern in the light both of british entry to the e.c. and of other political factors, almost unanimouslybelieved that their interests were best served by the United Kingdomremaining a member of the e.c..    If we were to leave the Communitywe would obviously seek to negotiate a free trade arrangement with it but the experience of Sweden showed that onerous conditions wouldbe attached to it.    In our case, given the nature of our trade, theconditions might be more onerous and we should of course be in noposition to influence them from within.    We had great power tocontinue to change the Community, and in all the circumstances hehad come to the decision that it would be best for Britain, for Europe,for the third world and indeed for the whole world for the UnitedKingdom to remain a member of the e.c.,.In discussion it became evident that a large majority of the cabinet agreed that they should recommend that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the e.c..    They agreed that the ministers concerned had succeeded in securing marked improvements in theterms of our membership of the e.c..    &quot;While it was not claimed thatthe objectives set out in the Manifesto of February 1974 had been fullymet, there had been considerable and unexpected success in manyfields and further improvements could be pursued in the course of continuing e.c. business.    The improvements were in markedcontrast to the terms obtained by the previous Administration.    Thefundamental principles of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) hadnot been changed, but many improvements had been made in the wayit operated and the new arrangements for beef, though instituted only for the current year in accordance with Community practice,represented a considerable breakthrough.    The Government&apos;sobjectives on the import of sugar from the developing Commonwealthhad been met in full, and the improvement in the eec&apos;s attitude to theCommonwealth and the developing world had been one of the principalsuccesses of renegotiation.    Similarly the position was now much improved in relation to the Community budget, capital movements,5
and Value Added Tax,,    The Governments regional, industrial andfiscal policies were in general well safeguarded^ but the marker wehad put down on the control of private steel investment would need tobe followed up,The following reasons were also advanced in support of this view:-a. Although we wanted to strengthen the &quot;one world&quot;framework, we had to recognise that regional groupingsexisted.    We should use our membership of the e.c., and our influence on its policies, to move away from the sterileconfrontation which had been taking place in United Nationsbodies between the blocs of the developing and the developedworlds    Under our influence the e.c. had already become moreoutward looking, particularly towards North America and the developing world.b. The cohesion of Western. Europe might well bedisrupted if we were to leave the e.c.;  and the British peoplemight be misled into taking the view - which had bedevilledBritish policies for decades after the Second World War - thatwe remained a major world power in our own right.    The Unionof Soviet Socialist Republics, though it would not say sopublicly, did not consider our membership of the e.c. ahindrance to detente and probably judged that it would help to restrain any aggressive tendencies in West Germany.c. The Community was not now developing in a federalistdirection;  as long as we remained members we could prevent it developing in that way.    The written texts of the community had not kept pace with developments in practice.    Although the texts might indicate that the Community was based on freemarket concepts, this did not reflect reality,    A number of the member states had mixed economies and progressive socialpolicies which were at least as advanced as the UnitedKingdom^.    We were only now at the beginning of our ownrelationship with the Community and we could bring important influence to bear in its development,d. A decision to withdraw from the e.c. would be very different from a decision not to join in the first place.    Whilemembership of the Community could not be expected to solveour economic problems and it would not necessarily be disastrous if we were to leave, this would be a risky economiccourse.    Indeed it was argued that we might only survive insuch a situation by adopting policies for a siege economy.There was no alternative economic grouping available:previous suggestions that a Commonwealth economic bloc or
a North Atlantic free trade area could be formed would not now be practicable.    Great uncertainty would be causedduring the protracted negotiations for withdrawal from, and determination of a new relationship with, the Community;this would have particularly serious implications for invest-ment.e. The concept of directly applicable Community law,which was novel to the British constitution, had to beaccepted as essential for the operation of the Common Market.It would have been easier to have ensured that its structure and political philosophy were more consistent with theBritish political character and constitutional practice if wehad been involved in the Community from the beginning,,    Butthe powers of national Governments to restrain theCommission, and of national Parliaments to.influence theCommunity,, should not be underestimated.    For example,British and German objections to unwise proposals by theCommission on the harmonisation of standards had preventedthose proposals from making progress and the commission had had to adopt a different and more acceptable approach.Parliament retained considerable powers in these fields by its general political control of Ministers.    Neverthelessimprovements in procedures, as had been proposed, to enableParliament to exert more influence on Community legislation should be pursued urgently.    It would also be necessary toconsider, if we remained members, how best to curtail theunnecessary powers and enthusiasm of the Commission,A number of Ministers said that they would wish to dissent from aCabinet decision to recommend that the United Kingdom remain amember of the e.c..THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that he would notrepeat all the arguments which had been put forward in the discussionof individual items in the package.    The Cabinet could however be onthe verge of a tragic decision.    The objectives set out in the february 1974 Manifesto had not been achieved;  all the difficult pointshad been deferred until after renegotiation.    It was wrong to thinkthat Britain&apos;s economic problems could be solved within the e.c.;too pessimistic a view had been taken of Britain&apos;s prospects, and wewould be better placed to solve our problems outside the Community.The e.c. would inevitably develop in a federalist direction (though this was for the present being disguised) and the power of the british parliament and electorate had already been reduced.    He feared thatcontinued membership of the e.c. would lead to the break-up of theUnited Kingdom.    Moreover the Labour Party would be placed underconsiderable strain if the Cabinet were to go against the view of mostof the rest of the Labour and trade union movements.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hetoo did not consider that the Manifesto objectives had been achieved in several important respects.    The consequences of withdrawal from the eec had been exaggerated;  he did not accept that Britain&apos;s problemscould be solved only by our accepting an alien system, whoselegislative basis - the European Communities Act 1972 - it was not proposed to change.    Policies which had stood Britain in good stead,for example on agriculture and the Commonwealth, had already been destroyed by attempts over the last decade to join the e.c..Continued membership would lead to the dismembering of the UnitedKingdom, and of the authority of Parliament, which had already lostmuch of its power in e.c. affairs.    If we remained in the community the seat of power would lie in future in a permanent coalition inErussels.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he was notinflexibly opposed to Britain&apos;s membership of the e.c.;  heacknowledged the improvement in our terms of membership, inparticular as regards the Commonwealth.    Nevertheless too muchhad to be taken on trust, since the fundamental changes in theCommunity which we required had not been achieved in renegotiation.He was particularly concerned about the situation on energy.    north sea oil would be an asset of great value to us and would be aconsiderable help to our survival outside the Community; but therewere already moves to apply the e.c. Treaty to the Continental Shelf.If we remained a member, we should be exposed to pressure for community policies, for example on depletion.    While he would vote in the referendum against continued membership, and believed that britain could survive outside the Community, he would work for thesuccess of Community membership if that proved to be the referendum result.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he was opposedto continued membership of the e.c. because it was disadvantageousto us materially, to the powers of Parliament and the unity of theUnited Kingdom, and in relation to the kind of world we wished to see.The e.c. was not an effective regional grouping, as their failure in the energy crisis and the current French attitude towards theInternational Energy Agency had shown.    The British people did nothave the community of feeling with Continental Europe which would berequired to make a genuine Community, and our membership of it didnot assist the &quot;one world&quot; concept.    If we withdrew, there would beproblems though they should not be exaggerated;  we could stillprosper and make a better contribution to the world as a whole from outside the Community.
THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT saidthat the present occasion was the country&apos;s final opportunity for settling the issue of membership, and he would accept the outcome ofthe referendum.    But the logic of the e.c. pointed it towards thedestination of a federal structure for a United Europe.    The FebruaryManifesto set out only the minimum objectives in ths renegotiation;a significant element in them had not been met and had been left over for the continuing business of the Community if we remained members.He felt therefore that the country should decide to withdraw.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theLabour movement did not believe in the basic principles of the e.c..These could not be dismissed as mere theology.    We had accepted that we could not challenge these principles, for instance in relationto the CAP, and the Commissioner responsible had made it clear at a recent meeting of the Council of Ministers that national agriculturalregimes were outside the Treaty and could not be allowed.    The vetowas not something which could be exercised simply on the basis of theGovernments dislike of a particular proposal.    Experience had shownthat our whole bargaining position on current Council issues had to betaken into account.    The Council of Ministers was in effect aninstitutionalised system of coalition government, and the Labour Party-had always been united in its opposition to the notion of coalition government.    Our virility as a nation would be weakened if we remained a member of the Community.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR. SCOTLAND said that althoughcertain changes, some of which were temporary, had been agreed inthe operation of the CAP, it was clear that the basic principles of the cap had not been changed;  and the common fisheries policy wouldmean that other e.c. countries could eventually fish in our waters,notwithstanding the extension of fishing limits which it was expectedwould shortly be agreed internationally.    The renegotiation of ourbudgetary contributions had only been partially successful.    Althoughactive progress was not immediately being made towards economicand monetary union, the idea remained a long-term Community goal.The Community&apos;s regional policies involved some Community over-sight of our regional plans.    The position on steel was admitted to be unsatisfactory.    On the issue of sovereignty, the Government wouldbe accepting the permanent curtailment of the powers of Parliament ifthe European Communities Act were not amended, and the powers ofthe Commission could not be radically attacked within the presentTreaty framework,    This transfer of power from Parliament toBrussels would strengthen the internal pressures towards the break-up of the unity of the United Kingdom.    Thus we had failed to achieve the fundamental renegotiation to which the Government were committed.9
THE PRIME MINISTER then asked those members of the Cabinet whohad expressed views against the United Kingdom remaining a memberof the e.c. whether they would be ready to support the majority viewor if they wished to exercise their right - which had previously beenagreed in the unique circumstances of the referendum - to differ fromthe Government recommendation.    All the Ministers concerned saidthat they wished to exercise this right.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that by a significant majority the Cabinet agreed that the United Kingdom should remain a member of the e.c.,    This would therefore be theGovernment recommendation and he proposed to make a statement tothis effect in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would now be necessaryfor the Cabinet to consider the guidelines within which those membersof the Government who could not support the recommendation that theUnited Kingdom should remain in the e.c. should exercise their rightto differ from it.    Draft guidelines had been prepared for handinground, and they would be circulated for fuller consideration at thenext meeting of the Cabinet,In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that particular difficulty would arise in connection with the proposals about Ministersappearing on platforms either with Members of Parliament of adifferent political Party or with Labour Party supporters who took adifferent view on this issue.    It would be impossible to avoid an activedebate: what mattered was that members of the Government should conduct it in a comradely spirit with each other.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet could not reach conclusions on the proposed guidelines inthe time remaining.    They would be circulated for fuller consideration at their next meeting.    In the meantime members of the Governmentshould abide by the draft guidelines.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval,, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
