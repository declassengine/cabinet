IpARLlAMENTARY   13 The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thetfFAIRS House of Commons during the following week.    It would be wise to mention to the Opposition the possible implications of the sub judicerule for the Supply Day debate on postal ballots for trade unionappointments which was planned for 23 June, in view of the fact thatthe appeal period against an injunction recently granted by the courts in a specific case had not yet expired.    Apart from this however there seemed good grounds for discussing a matter which had given rise to considerable public interest.
FOREIGNAFFAIRSUgandaPreviousReference:CC(75) 27thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat there had so far been no formal reply from President Amin to hisoffer to visit Kampala for discussions if Mr Hills and the otherthreatened Briton were reprieved.    Meantime diplomatic actioncontinued.    It had been indicated to President Amin throughPresident Kenyatta that following a reprieve the spare partshe required would also be made available quickly.    Many other Headsof State   had intervened helpfully, although some did not wish their action to be known.    President Nimeiri of the Sudan, who feltparticularly incensed at the slur on Africa&apos;s image, had sent a minister to Kampala to deliver a personal message.    The PrimeMinister would shortly be sending a further message to president Amin.    In all these dealings with President Amin he hadreceived advice from a leading psychiatrist.    He had consideredasking the International Court of Justice to intervene but had decided not to do so, partly because it seemed unlikely that President Aminwould have regard to the Court and partly because it might reduce the impact of a message which The Queen might be sending to president Amin,    It would be quite wrong to send a British Ministerto Kampala in advance of clemency for Hills because such a surrender to blackmail would only encourage President Amin to moreextravagant demands of this kind and endanger the lives of other british nationals in Uganda,In discussion it was suggested that more use might be made of president Amin&apos;s eagerness to hold the Organisation of African Unity(OAU) Conference in Kampala: if African Heads of State refused to goto Uganda unless clemency were shown this might be an effective means of pressure.    On the other hand President Amin&apos;s anti-British attitude was not necessarily unpopular in parts of Africa and whatever their views on the Hills case it was unlikely that manyAfrican Heads of State would be willing to boycott a Kampala meeting.It was significant that many of those who were urging clemencyprivately on President Amin did not wish this to be publicly known.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that his forthcoming message to President Amin would make it clear thatexecutions would cause a tremendous reaction in the United Kingdomand would do major and lasting damage to our relations with Uganda,It did not seem possible to capitalise on President Amin&apos;s desire tohold the OAU meeting in Kampala,    He was still hopeful that the message already sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury might have some influence on him but it should not be forgotten that president Amin seemed to have a particular affection for Scottishinstitutions.    It was possible that a message from the Moderator ofthe Church of Scotland or the Colonel of a Scottish regiment wouldhave some effect: the Secretary of State for Scotland should consider this possibility urgently and let the Foreign and commonwealth secretary have his advice later that day.    Otherwise all practicableaction seemed to have been taken or put in hand.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
INDUSTRIALDEMOCRACYpreviousReference:CC(75) 24thConclusions,Minute 43. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Chancellor(C(75) 68) and the Secretary of State for Trade (C(75) 69) onemployee participation on company boards.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Ministerial Group under his chairmanship which had been invited to examine the question ofindustrial democracy had been deeply divided on the questionwhether the Governmenfs detailed proposals for the promotion ofindustrial democracy should be preceded by the appointment of anindependent, external committee of inquiry to review employeeparticipation on the boards of private companies or by an internalinquiry by officials.    Although a majority were in favour of an internal inquiry, the case for an external inquiry was stronglyargued, and he thought it fair to allow the Ministers principally concerned to put their case directly to Cabinet.    On a number ofsubsidiary matters the Ministerial Group had reached conclusions which, if approved by Cabinet, would stand whatever the decision about the proposed inquiry.    These conclusions were set forth inparagraph 6 of his paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that there werefar-reaching implications in the proposals for employee participationon company boards.    What the Trades Union Congress (TUC) wanted to achieve was joint control of the whole of the private sector ofindustry.    This would represent a major shift in power and responsibility, and would have far-reaching consequences for themanagement and planning of industry and on major financial decisions in the private sector affecting profits and investment.    It was the government&apos;s duty to ensure that these questions were thoroughlyexplored before proposals were formulated, and the most satisfactory way of doing this was to appoint an independent committee of inquirywhich could consider all aspects of the problems.    This would permit a free exchange of views and clarify difficulties that were likely to arise.    In so far as there was common ground between the tuc and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) this could be identified, and there would be less likelihood that the government&apos;s policy would have to be forced upon one side or the other.    Heconceded that there were differences of view on both sides,  but itwas as well that these should, so far as possible, be reconciled atthe earliest stages of discussion, before the Governmenfs own proposals were made public.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT agreed that thequestion of how workers might be represented on the boards ofprivate companies was of fundamental importance, but the choiceswhich the Government would have to make would be essentially of apolitical nature, and there was nothing to be gained by inviting anindependent inquiry to consider the range of options.    The TUC were
hostile to the whole idea of an external inquiry, and if this was how the Government proceeded, it would cause unnecessary difficulties with them.    The co-operation of the TUC was essential if theGovernment&apos;s proposals for industrial democracy were to be widely accepted by the trades union movement.    He urged that it would be preferable to appoint an internal inquiry into the legal and technical problems that would need to be resolved, and that this should befollowed by the publication of a Green Paper outlining theGovernment1 s own proposals.    After the Green Paper there would no doubt be wide consultation on the Governments proposals, andthere would be nothing to prevent a tripartite discussion thenbetween the Government, the TUC and the CBI, if this was thought desirable.    Furthermore, there was no certainty that Mr Radice&apos;industrial Democracy Bill would not come back to the floor of theHouse of Commons for its third reading on 11 July.    If this happened, steps would need to be taken to block the Bill, and thiswould create bad feeling: Mr Radice would be prepared to withdraw his Bill if he were given assurances that there would be an internalinquiry and a commitment to legislation.In discussion, it was argued in favour of an independent committeeof inquiry that it was most important, before the Government began to formulate its own proposals, that there should be widespreadpublic discussion of the issues involved.    It need not necessarily be supposed that the CBI and the TUC would take opposite views onall of these issues, nor that there would be a polarisation ofattitudes in the committee which would leave the independent members to make an impartial decision on points of controversy.It was much better that these matters should be thrashed out in thepublic forum of an independent inquiry, and the TUC would have animportant part to play in this discussion.    It had to be borne inmind that on many of the questions which an independent reviewwould be considering, there was no great degree of expertise in whitehall or in Westminster, and it would be valuable to theGovernment if the committee could include among its membershipa number of prominent authorities who could give authoritativeadvice on the difficulties that would need to be faced.    although there was no doubt that the TUC would have a crucial part to play inthe setting up and the work of an independent inquiry, it had to beremembered that the trades unions had, until recently, shown no great interest in industrial democracy.    Some unions had shown a great deal of reluctance when asked to serve on the boards of nationalised industries.    The TUC could therefore hardly expect tohave the final word on whether an external committee of inquiry should be appointed, nor should they be allowed to lay down theterms of reference of such an inquiry.    There might also be somesuspicion, amongst certain unions, of a study based upon work doneby Government officials.
On the other hand, the case for an internal inquiry by officials wasthat the Government would sooner or later have to make a politicaldecision on how to proceed and could not look to an independent committee of inquiry for guidance on this.    There was, moreover,a danger that the external inquiry would pre-empt political decisionsthat were the responsibility of the Government,    On the other handa study by officials could identify models which could be applied toa variety of industrial situations, and which would allow a more realistic discussion.    The terms of reference proposed wouldrestrict the external inquiry to a review of employee representation on the boards of directors; but the question went much beyond this.It would be a pity if the result of the inquiry were to lead to ahardening of attitudes on the part of the TUC and the CBI before theGovernments own proposals could be brought forward.    Therewere already several developments in worker participation, and itwas not necessary to appoint an independent inquiry to stimulatepublic discussion of the issues involved.    The main objectionhowever to an external inquiry was that it would alienate thesympathies of the TUC.    The suggestion that the inquiry should consider a wide range of options would be received with dismay bythe TUC,    It would, at the present time, be most unwise to run therisk of sacrificing the goodwill of the TUC.    Before any further decisions were taken, it was highly desirable that there should beinformal discussions, either with the TUC/Labour Party liason committee or with the TUC itself.In further discussion, it was argued that the terms of referencepresently proposed for the external committee of inquiry should be redrafted to permit the committee to consider employee participationbelow the level of representation on the boards of directors.    Therewas also an argument for studying employee participation in the CivilService including the Royal Ordnance Factories,    The decision onwho would chair the inquiry would have an important bearing on thecommittee&apos;s recommendations.    For a subject of this nature itwould hardly be appropriate to appoint a judge as chairman.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were predominantly in favour of the appointment of anexternal independent committee of inquiry.    The main function ofsuch a committee would be to consider how industrial democracycould be extended by the appointment of employees to the boards ofprivate companies; but fresh terms of reference should be drawnup by the Lord Chancellor^ Ministerial group to permit thecommittee to range over a wider field than was originally proposedby the Secretary of State for Trade.    The Government should not however make a final decision on the form of the inquiry until therehad been further informal discussion between the ministers concerned and the TUC: the aim should be to try and bring the TUCround to the Governments way of thinking6    The subject should notbe raised at the meeting of the TUC/Labour Party liason committee on 23 June but deferred to a later meeting.    The
Secretary of State for Employment would make a statement inParliament before 11 July about the Governments intention tointroduce legislation in the 1976-77 Session.    The Lord Chancellorsgroup of Ministers should also make proposals about theappointment of a chairman and members of a committee, and suggest a timetable to which the committee might work with a viewto permitting the Government to introduce a Bill in the parliamentary session 1976-77.    The question of an internal inquiry intoindustrial democracy in the nationalised industries and other bodiesfor which the Government was responsible could be reviewed in thelight of the group&apos;s further recommendations.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2. Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange forhis group of Ministers to draw up fresh terms ofreference for an independent committee of inquiry,after further informal consultation with the TUC;to make proposals about the appointment of a chairman and members of such a committee;and to propose a timetable to which it might work.3.        Invited the Secretary of State for employment, in consultation with the lord president of the Council, to prepare a statement to be made in Parliament before 11 July indicating that the Government proposed to set up anindependent committee of inquiry and to introduce legislation on industrial democracy in theParliamentary Session 1976-77.
4. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that inJanuary the Cabinet had taken decisions on action to tackle the abusesof the Lump in the construction industry.    A simpler procedure had now been proposed, and the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy had agreed that it should be recommended to the Cabinet.    Thedecision in January was that the Minister for Planning and LocalGovernment would draft a Bill whereby there would be a register of sub-contractors and a penal levy starting at 30 per cent (on top of a tax deduction rate of 30 per cent) on main contractors who usedunregistered labour;  and the Finance Bill would tighten up theexisting Inland Revenue scheme for securing tax deductions.Arrangements were to be worked out to ensure that a genuine self-employed tradesman did not have to pay the penal levy.    Accordingly,the two Departments went ahead with drafting the Bills.    The finance bill proposals had been welcomed by the Trades Union Congress (TUC),they safeguarded the genuine self-employed man, and indeed theywere now accepted by the Minister for Planning and Local government as meeting all the essential purposes of his own scheme, providedthree points were covered.    The first point was that a provision aboutinsurance should be incorporated into the Finance Bill;  this was accepted.    The second point was that there should be a construction industry Manpower Board to make sure that the problems of the Lumpdid not recur in the industry;  this too was accepted, on the under-standing that the Board would seek to monitor only the effects of the inland Revenue scheme and not its technical working.    The third point was concerned with the proposed levy.    The Minister^ Bill could nothave introduced a levy before next year; and it was too late for thisyear&apos;s Finance Bill to be amended to introduce such an important newprovision, except at the cost of pushing back the introduction of the newInland Revenue scheme from the spring of next year to the spring of1977.    The Economic Policy Committee had agreed that the right course was to say, at the Report Stage of the Finance Bill, that theGovernment intended to consider next year, in the light of the workingof the new Inland Revenue arrangements, whether there should be apenal levy in addition, and if so, at what rate it should start; it was relevant that the proposed tax deduction rate was now to be 35 per cent,and not 30 per cent as at the time of the previous discussion.    If theCabinet were content to accept this proposal, then some legislation would be saved, as well as several hundred extra posts which theDepartment of the Environment would have needed to administer the levy.    It would be necessary to explain the Governments intentionscarefully to the TUC, who were expecting a Bill;  in the light of theirreaction, it might be better to set up the Construction IndustryManpower Board by a new, short Bill, though it could be doneadministratively.    Departments would also need to consider in due course a point about the Treaty of Rome, namely the possibility that alevy linked to the Inland Revenue scheme might be regarded asdiscriminating against the nationals of other Member States; he felt sure that other members of the Community would be sympathetic to the government&apos;s aim of tackling the abuses of the Lump.8
THE MINISTER FOR PLANNING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTconfirmed that he was in agreement with the arrangements nowproposed;  in present circumstancess it would not be right to incur the extra cost of several hundred additional staff to apply amarginally greater degree of pressure to tackling the abuses ofthe Lump.    In his view, the TUC were mainly concerned to seethat the Construction Industry Manpower Board was set up, so thatthere would be a continuing watch to ensure that the abuses of the lump did not recur;  and legislation was not necessary, if the TUCwere prepared to accept that the Board should be set up by administrative action.In discussion, there was general agreement that the proposed new arrangements were acceptable on their merits.    It was howeverhighly unsatisfactory that they had been brought forward afterMinisters had been committed, both in Parliament and to the TUC,to bring forward certain legislation in the current Session.    Theyshould therefore be explained in advance to the TUC to ensure thatthey would be regarded as meeting the Governments commitment.Depending on the reactions of the TUC, it could be decided laterwhether the Construction Industry Manpower Board should be set upby a short Bill, or by administrative means.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were ready to agree to the revised proposals outlined by theChancellor of the Exchequer:  they regarded it as essential however that they should not be opposed by the TUC.    There should be aprivate meeting between Mr Murray, Mr Jones and other union leaders concerned with this problem, and a small group of Ministersincluding the Secretary of State for Employment, the Minister for planning and Local Government, and the Paymaster General.The outcome of the meeting should be reported by minute to theCabinet, but provided the TUC were content there would be no needfor the Cabinet to discuss the matter further.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister,9
5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT saidthat the negotiations between the British Railways Board (BRB)and the three railway unions had not yet reached any conclusion.Discussions were at a most delicate stage and it was possible thatthey could end in deadlock.    The Cabinet might need to considerthe matter further at their meeting at Chequers the following day.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Civil Contingencies Unit,under his chairmanship, had been keeping closely in touch with developments over recent weeks.    His assessment was that anational rail strike would not begin to bite hard on essential services during the first month or sc.    However, it would benecessary for the British Railways Board and the MetropolitanPolice to issue public statements about their contingency plans;and for the Department of Industry to establish regional contactpoints at which the effects of the strike on industry could bemonitored.    The Department would need to make public the telephone numbers to which enquiries should be directed.    He didnot think that the issue of publicity about these contingencymeasures need be provocative and he recommended that the BRB,the Metropolitan Police and the Department of Industry should go ahead as they proposed.    The Post Office would also need to tell the public that no further parcels would be received after a certaintime, and a statement would be issued to this effect.    It would benecessary to safeguard certain stocks of oil for priority users whowere supplied through rail-fed terminals, and he hoped that theCabinet would give their contingent approval to the issue of a direction by the Secretary of State for Energy to the companiesowning such terminals requiring them to reserve their stocks forsuch users.    Although his paper had invited the Cabinet to considerwhether any statement should be made in Parliament before the endof the week about the Governments contingency plans, he felt on further reflection that ouch a statement should not be made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet took note that public statements about their contingencyplans would be issued by the British Railways Board and theMetropolitan Police; by the Department of Industry about theirregional contact points;  and by the Post Office about the curtailment of the parcel service.    They agreed that the Secretaryof State for Energy should have authority to issue a Directionreserving the issue of stocks of oil from rail-fed terminals to priorityusers as soon as he judged that stocks should be safeguarded in thisway.    They agreed that there should be no public statement inParliament that week about the Governments contingency plans.
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office19 June 1975
