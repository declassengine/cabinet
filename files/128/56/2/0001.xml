1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported on his recent visit to Southern Africa.The Cabinet!s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat with the onset of winter the conditions in which the 8, 000 turkish cypriot refugees were living in the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area had become increasingly difficult and we were under very great pressure to permit their evacuation.    He therefore proposed to inform theTurkish authorities that as a humanitarian gesture we were preparedto allow the refugees to be evacuated from Akrotiri by Turkishaircraft at an agreed rate.    The refugees should, in the firstinstance, go to Turkey but there was little doubt that they would ultimately be resettled in the Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.&quot;While this decision would be unwelcome to the Greek Cypriots, itmight open the way for the Turks to make some reciprocal gesturethat would benefit the Greek Cypriot refugees.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTrecalled that the Cabinet had agreed last November to his proposal to seek the agreement of the French Government to postpone for at least a year a decision on whether to go ahead with the full constructionstage of the Channel Tunnel project.    The French Government, withsome reluctance, had agreed that this proposal should be put to the two companies, British and French; but the companies, to the surprise ofthe French Government, had rejected it.    Instead, they said that theywould claim that the project had been abandoned by the twoGovernments unless the British Government ratified the Treaty bymidnight on Monday 20 January and the two Governments entereddetailed discussions with the companies on possible new arrangements,including new financial arrangements, for the completion of the project.    In his view, the companies&apos; counter-proposal was completelyunacceptable and he was not prepared to recommend it to hiscolleagues.    Accordingly, in his own view and that of the Ministerfor Transport, negotiations &quot;with the companies should be carried nofurther, and the present project abandoned.    It might be worth
considering the project afresh in some years&apos; time, but this would bea completely new arrangement.    It was likely that the FrenchGovernment and the companies would be issuing statements thefollowing Monday about the abandonment of the project, and he must therefore make a statement in Parliament.    For the sake of courtesy,he should inform the French Government about his intention withoutdelay0    A meeting of the Ministerial Committee on the ChannelTunnel Project had been arranged for the evening of the same day,and provided that that Committee agreed he hoped that the cabinet would authorise him to inform the French Government the same evening, after which a report could be made to Cabinet the followingThursday.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet noted that the Ministerial Committee on the Channel tunnel project would be considering a proposal that the present ChannelTunnel project must be regarded as abandoned;  and they agreed that,provided that the Committee agreed, the Secretary of State for the environment should make a statement in Parliament the following monday, after informing the French Government of his intention.The abandonment of the project would result in some cost to theBritish Government including charges of some  20 million to redeemGovernment-guaranteed loans and to pay off shareholders, but theeffect of continuing the project on new terms would be much more costly.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister &apos;s summing up of their discussion,2, Invited the Secretary of State for the environment, subject to the agreement of the ministerial Committee on the Channel tunnel project, to inform the French Government thatthe British Government were not prepared to carrynegotiations with the companies any further, butaccepted that the present project had been abandoned,3, Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to make a report to the Cabinet at its next meeting and to make a statement to parliament on the following Monday.Cabinet Office14 January 1975
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT27COPY NOCABINETIHODESIAPreviousleference:X(74) 52ndConclusions,vlinute confidential annex cc(75) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 1Tuesday 14 January 1975 at 11.00 am the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thediscussions he had held during his recent visit to Africa had been largely concerned with the possibility of making progress towards asettlement in Rhodesia.    A number of factors had combined to change the situation in Southern Africa: the political changes in Mozambique;the growing extent and sophistication of guerrilla training andequipment; and the prospect that if a settlement were not reached,there would be violence on an increasing scale.    The Prime Ministerof South Africa, Mr Vorster, apprehensive of a threat to the stability of Southern Africa, had approached President Kaunda ofZambia with the object of agreeing on moves towards a settlement.President Kaunda sh&amp;red the South African concern, and inco-operation with President Nyerere of Tanzania andSir Seretse Khama, President of Botswana, had persuaded theleaders of the various African groups in Rhodesia to join togetherwithin the African National Council (ANC).    Discussions had thentaken place in Lusaka between the African leaders and therepresentatives of Mr Vorster and of Mr Smith, the leader of the illegal regime in Rhodesia.    A measure of agreement had beenreached on steps to improve the situation, although disputes had now arisen on the extent of this agreement.    President Kaunda and president Nyerere had urged that the British Government should nowjoin the discussion and that we should convene a constitutional conference without delay.    This was also the wish of the ANC.Mr Vorster, whom he had met at Port Elizabeth, believed that itwould be unwise to call a conference until discussions between theANC and Mr Smith showed that they were prepared to deal with eachother on a realistic basis, and that conditions existed for a successful conference.    It was also his own view that the hopes that were being placed by the Africans in the outcome of an earlyconference were exaggerated, and that some time should be given forpreliminary exchanges between the ANC and Mr Smith.President Kenyatta of Kenya agreed with him.    A fundamental issue was the question of majority rule.    Mr Vorster, who had made it:;-::!&apos;      -
clear that he would be prepared to put pressure on Mr Smith to reach a settlement,, claimed that he himself was not necessarily opposed tomajority African rule in Rhodesia but was concerned only that a standard of qualification should be laid down to determine the right tovote0    It seemed unlikely, however, that he would be prepared topress Mr Smith to accept arrangements which would lead to majority rule within the next one or two years.    President Kaunda and president Nyerere did not insist on the immediate introduction of one man one vote, and would accept a qualitative franchise, although theywould expect the required qualification to be such as to lead to immediate majority rule.    It could be assumed that this would not be acceptable to Mr Smith, and it was not possible to predict whether a compromise between these opposing views would be found.It was important to respond to the representations which the Africanleaders had made to him.    In the statement which he would be makingto Parliament later that day he proposed to say that he hoped to moveahead with consideration of, and preparations for, a constitutional conference, but that unless efforts in this direction were to be wastedit was necessary that early progress be made towards securingobservance of the agreement worked out at Lusaka between representatives of the African leaders, the South African Government,Mr Smith and the ANC, and that it would be valuable if directexploratory talks could begin between the ANC and Mr Smith.    he hoped his colleagues would agree in principle that he should convene a constitutional conference and that he should send messages toMr Smith and to the ANC which would seek to elicit their views on the holding of a conference, on the place where it was to be held, and onthe timing.    He would not wish to announce the calling of a conferenceuntil he had sufficient reason to believe that Mr Smith would attend it.The timing would need to be determined by the progress of the directtalks between Mr Smith and the ANC.    The conference could not takeplace in Salisbury; there were certain attractions in proposingLondon; but on balance it might be better for it to take place in southern Africa where Mr Smith and the ANC would come under more immediate pressure from Mr Vorster and the other african governments respectively.    In his message to Mr Smith he would propose to send a representative to Salisbury on a confidential basis for exploratory discussions, which might lead to the establishment in salisbury of a small group of officials from London who would act asobservers in the context of the preparations for a conference.    this last suggestion had been pressed upon him by the African leaders.In discussion it was suggested that since Mr Vorster represented theonly source of effective pressure on Mr Smith, we should give weight to his views on the timing of a conference.    The Africans might wellbe mistaken in seeking an early conference.    We should wait until we knew whether Mr Smith would be prepared to make the necessaryconcessions.    If the conference failed we would be blamed.    We
should seek to persuade the Africans that it should not be conveneduntil there was evidence that sufficient progress had been made in thepreparatory talks in Salisbury.    It was also argued, however, thatVinless we met African wishes we would be charged with failing to seize an opportunity of settling the Rhodesian problem.    This charge would receive substantial support in the United Nations, and it couldbecome a serious issue at the next meeting of Commonwealth Heads ofGovernment in April,    It was suggested that we should neverthelessavoid a firm commitment to a conference, or any indication of a proposed date, until we knew more about Mr Smith&apos;s attitude.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it wasagreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should make astatement in Parliament on the general lines suggested, and thatmessages should go to Mr Smith and the ANC which would indicate a readiness to hold a conference in due course after adequatepreliminary consultation had taken place in Salisbury.    It should however be made clear that the calling of the conference would be dependant on the implementation of the Lusaka agreement and onsufficient progress in the preliminary consultations.    The message toMr Smith would also propose that the Foreign and commonwealth secretary should send a representative to Salisbury for confidential discussions.    The position would be reassessed in the light ofMr smith s response to the message.    The discussion in Cabinet wasto be regarded as particularly confidential.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office15 January 1975
