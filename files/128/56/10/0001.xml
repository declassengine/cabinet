PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.    It would benecessary to maintain a running three-line Whip throughout theproceedings on the Report Stage of the Finance Bill, which would beoccupying the House from 3 to 6 March,    It was essential that theBill should reach the Statute Book not later than 14 March; but itwas uncertain how far the goodwill of the Opposition could now be relied on and therefore the timetable might prove very difficult.    Itwas reported that it would be desirable to find time for the Commonsconsideration of the Lords&apos; amendments to the Social security benefits Bill,    Until these had been dealt with it would not bepossible to finalise the Social Security Consolidation measurealthough this ought to be published in advance of the Second reading of the Better Pensions Bill, which, for operational reasons, shouldnot take place later than the week beginning 10 March.    The cabinet were however informed that there would be great difficulty in finding the necessary time during the following week; moreover, therewere signs that some rearrangement of the business tentativelyplanned for the week beginning 10 March might prove necessary.
2.        THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in theprevious year the Cabinet had agreed to the conclusion of anarrangement to reschedule Chile&apos;s debts for 1973 and 1974.    he proposed that we should refuse to follow a similar course this year.Inflation in Chile appeared recently to have been running at about600 per cent a year.    The Chilean regime were concerned aboutinternational views of their credit-worthiness.    If we could persuade some of the other Western creditors, particularlyGermany, to join us in refusing to enter into a reschedulingagreement this year, Chile&apos;s credit would be affected in the eyes of the World Bank and other international organisations.    this could provide us with a means of pressure on the Chilean regimeto amend their oppressive domestic policies.    The amount of moneywe would forgo in the current year would be only of the order of 1 million.    We would not be precluded from resuming reschedulingarrangements next year if this then seemed desirable,THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theUnited States was unlikely to join us in the policy we proposed;  andif Chilean hopes of a substantial loan from Iran were realised, theaction which it was proposed we should take would have little effecton Chile1s credit-worthiness.    He nevertheless supported theproposal and if it were approved he would encourage other Westerncreditors to take a similar line.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that we should not take part in reschedulingChile&apos;s debts in the current year, and that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would seek the support of other Westerncreditors.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
HUNTER- 3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that earlier in the week the3IFLATION Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had reviewed the?0LICY Governments counter-inflation policy and had agreed upon a newdrive to get down the rate of pay increases.    This posture, whichwas consistent with the freedom of collective bargaining implied bythe Social Contract, meant that the Government would have to give more leadership on pay, taking a rather bigger part of theresponsibility it already shared with the Trades Union Congress(TUC).    Ministers would need to make renewed reference in public speeches to the dangers of excessive pay increases for employment at home and competitiveness abroad.    The Government would haveto insist that the TUC guidelines should be honoured in the spiritas well as in the letter:  in particular the exceptions allowed by theguidelines should not be used to make nonsense of their mainprinciple that any general settlements, including thresholds, shouldbe sufficient only to cover the increase in the Retail Price Index inthe preceding 12 months.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, inagreement with the Secretary of State for Employment, was preparing background notes on which Ministers could draw fortheir speeches and would send these to the Lord President in good time for the weekend.    It was important however that, in speakingon this subject, Ministers should avoid any speculation as to whatthe Government would do if their appeal went unheeded andsettlements continued at too high a rate.    Suggestions wereappearing in the Press that some Ministers favoured an alternative policy: but no such alternative policy was in sight.    A statutorypolicy had been shown not to work and massive deflation was unacceptable.    There was also the fact that speculation aboutalternative fallback policies led inevitably to attempts to forestallthem.    This applied both to talk of a statutory incomes policywhich encouraged unions to put in large claims now and toarguments for import deposits which stimulated imports in the short run.    Ministers should therefore adhere strictly toemphasising the Governments existing policies and should notspeculate about alternative ones:  if any Minister wished to go further than the notes being provided by the Chancellor he shouldclear his speech with the latter.In discussion the following points were made -a. It would be helpful to the Governments new postureif it were pointed out that the breakdown of the social contract would lead inevitably to increased unemployment and a statutory policy.    On the other hand if this point weremade explicitly it would encourage speculation of the kindmentioned.    It should be possible to talk positively aboutthe problem of inflation and the Governments efforts to dealwith it without seeming to envisage alternative and unacceptable solutions.
b, There should be similar restraint from speculationabout the form which the Budget would take.    The lattercould raise major issues of economic strategy and ministers would have an opportunity of discussing themcollectively: but this discussion must be kept withinGovernment.c. in conducting their new drive to get down the rateof pay increases Ministers would need to avoid appearing to criticise the efforts which the TUC were making to secureadherence to the Social Contract.    The Government had infact recently had an excellent meeting with the TUC in theLiaison Committee:  and there was real evidence that some major union leaders were now actively lending their support to the General Secretary&apos;s efforts.do The distinction and the relationship betv/een the short-term problem of pay inflation and the longer term problem of insufficient investment had to be borne carefullyin mind:  and the role of the National Enterprise Boardcould be usefully stressed here.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the decision of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy and encouraged Ministers to speak publicly onthe need to get down the rate of pay increases subject to clearingwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer any points not covered in the notes which he was providing and to avoiding speculation about any alternative policies.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
 NEGOTIATIONwional Aids:i Steel;previous;ference:(74) 34th:n elusions4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C(75) 23) on the issues of regional aids and steel in the renegotiation of the terms of British membership of the european economic Community (e.c.).THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Committee on European CommunityStrategy (ECS) had reviewed the progress made in respect of regional aids and the steel industry in pursuing the Governmentsrenegotiation objective of &quot;the retention by Parliament of those powers over the British economy needed to pursue effectiveregional, industrial and fiscal policies&quot;.    The Cabinet had decided in September 1974 that Community rules for the co-ordination ofnational regional aids were in our interest, provided that they werecompatible with the need to be free to follow the regional policieswe required.    The Cabinet had laid down five specific principles which the Community rules should satisfy.    We had held intensivediscussions with the e.c. Commission on the new rules, and these had been adopted by the Commission on the previous day.    member governments would shortly be invited to record their agreement toa Communication setting out the rules, by passing a resolution inthe Council of Ministers,    The new rules met the five principles on which the Cabinet had agreed.    We must accept that the EECTreaty gave the Commission certain formal powers in respect of regional aid systems;  but in their Communication the Commissiondeclared that there would in practice be no interference with the regional policies the Government needed to pursue, and for these the Government would remain wholly answerable to Parliament.The political reality was that the member States in the Council ofMinisters could determine the effective substance of Communitycontrol over regional aids and other questions.    The majority ofECS accordingly took the view that the Manifesto aim had been met in relation to regional policies, and that the Commission^Communication should accordingly be accepted in the Council ofMinisters, subject to the need for prior Parliamentary debates,which should take place on &quot;take note&quot; motions.The issue of control over steel presented special difficulty, becausethe relevant Community rules rested almost entirely on theprovisions of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)Treaty, which gave to the Commission the role of acting as thecustodian of the Treaty provisions.    From the pragmatic angleour experience of the ECSC Treaty had been to some extentreassuring.    We had been able to influence the British steel corporation (BSC) over price increases.    We had also hadexperience of several cases involving the Commission^ consentunder the Treaty to merger cases in the steel industry, but judgment on the operation of the Treaty in the mergers field must be reserved until the current case of Johnson, Firth, Brown had been completed5
satisfactorily.    There was no doubt that the Community acceptedthe principle of nationalisation as such.    Control over investment in the public sector presented no problem, but it appeared that theTreaty would not permit us to reassume the powers which had beencontained in section 15 of the Iron and Steel Act 1967 to controlinvestment in the private sector.    The Government therefore didnot have the power, and nor had the Commission, to ban any privatesteel project which might be judged undesirable.    At the outset of renegotiation the Government had made clear that they would feelfree to propose Treaty amendments if it emerged that these were necessary.    It was clear that we needed an overhaul of the ECSCTreaty, going wider than the investment provisions.    We could not hope to reach agreement in the Community on revision of the Treatywithin the renegotiation time scale, and the other member governments would not be ready to commit themselves to this process until they knew that the United Kingdom was remaining inthe Community.    The majority of ECS had therefore concluded thatwe should give notice now to the other Governments that if, as aresult of the referendum, the United Kingdom stayed in the e.c.,we should press for an overhaul of the ECSC Treaty, particularlyin relation to the issue a which had concerned us.In discussion it was maintained that the new rules formulated bythe Commission would leave all existing forms and levels of aid inthe United Kingdom untouched, with the single exception of certainaids granted in Scotland by the Highlands and Islands development board for which the Commission had already undertaken to grant usa derogation.    The purpose of the new rules was not to prevent theUnited Kingdom or other Governments from granting assistancewhere required to their least favoured regions, but to control thelevel of subsidies granted in the more favoured areas of theCommunity and to prevent multinational companies from playing offone Government against another in order to obtain subsidies for investment.    The experience of the other member countries of theCommunity over the past 17 years was that they had been able tocontinue to follow their own chosen regional policies, and theLabour Party as an internationalist Party should welcome any arrangements which helped the economic development of anydisadvantaged area of the Community, such as southern Italy.     Ifthe United Kingdom left the Community, it was probable that, in any future trading agreement with the e.c., we should be obliged toaccept rules concerning the level of state aids, but that, so far from being able to influence these rules as we had been able to do as a community member, they would be imposed on us.    hi thecircumstances of the world today national sovereignty was no longerabsolute:  some surrender of sovereignty was inevitable within theCommunity, and there was nothing objectionable in itself in theenforce ability of common rules.    The decisive test was not what6
the text of the e.c. Treaty might say about the powers of theCommission, but the way in which the Community operated inpractice.    From that aspect we could be confident that effectivepower would continue to rest through the Council of Ministers withmember Governments, which would remain answerable to their national Parliaments.On the other hand, it was argued that it could not be maintained that we could disregard the text of the e.c. Treaty on the grounds that its rules and provisions were not in fact observed.    This wasnot the true situation, and the record of a recent conversation between the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs and a German Minister confirmed that we were at the mercy of theCommission whenever they chose to exercise their powers.    Underthe Treaty, any power of Parliamentary control over theCommission lay not with national Parliaments but with theEuropean Assembly.    The new rules, which were temporary in character, did not conflict with our present regional aid policies,but they did nothing to restore in this area the sovereignty ofParliament, which the Government had pledged themselves to regain in their February 1974 Manifesto.    This had seriousimplications for the continuation of democracy.    The issue at stake was whether Governments were to remain, not. the &quot;bestjudges&quot;, as the Commission^ document suggested but the supremejudges of the policies they needed to implement.    The new rulescould not be accepted as satisfactory unless it was established that both in substance and in law the last word did not remain with theCommission.In further discussion it was suggested that, while the new rules forthe co-ordination of regional aids raised questions of major importance in renegotiation, this was not the occasion for thegeneral discussion of the issue of sovereignty which the cabinet would be having in due course.    This issue was at present underconsideration by the Legislation Committee.    At the same timethe Cabinet could not decide whether the renegotiation issue of regional policy had been satisfactorily settled in advance of thegeneral consideration of whether renegotiation as a whole had been successful;  and the Parliamentary debates on the new co-ordinationrules should also be deferred.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary would be expected to take up a position in the Council ofMinisters, particularly because of the connection which some countries saw between the co-ordination rules and the provision ofmoney for the Regional Development Fund,    But a final decisions would not be taken by the Council of Ministers until their Aprilmeeting.
The discussion then turned to the issue of steel,    It was suggestedthat it was most unsatisfactory that this question had been leftunresolved until so late in the process of renegotiation.    the renegotiation of our terms of membership could not be regarded as complete until the problem of steel had been solved.    But it waspointed out that the issue of steel had been drawn specifically tothe attention of other e.c. Governments as a renegotiationobjective, for example by the Prime Minister at tne meeting of heads of Government in Paris in December 1974.    They were therefore already on notice that we had requirements.    Thegreatest difficulty concerned the power to control private sectorsteel investmentj and one solution would be for the Government toinform Parliament at an early date that they proposed to re-assumethrough legislation powers equivalent to those in section 15 of theIron and Steel Act 1967.    An alternative course might be for us toput the other e.c. Governments on notice, not that we should necessarily wish to amend the Treaty, but that we proposed tore-assume powers to control investment in the private sector.They might acknowledge that this would require amendment of theTreaty,   or they might be ready to find some alternative methodof meeting our wishes which would not require Treaty amendment,.Until this approach was made it was impossible to demonstrate thatan attempt had been made to secure the Manifesto objective.    OtherEEC Governments, for example, appeared to have been successful in preventing undesirable investment despite the Treaty.Consideration of the changes we might want in the Treaty should alsoextend to the basing point system for establishing steel prices;  atsome time in the future this could threaten the interests of those parts of the United Kingdom distant from steel manufacturing plants in the event of steel closures, for example in Scotland,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Council of Ministers would not be taking a final decision on regional aids at their next meeting.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary could indicate that he was content with the communication from the Commission as an element in the total renegotiationpackage on which the Government still had to take a decision.The same line would be taken at the meeting of the European council at Dublin on 10-11 March.    Following that meeting, the Cabinet would resume their consideration of regional aids in the context of ageneral stocktaking of renegotiation, together with the conclusions reached by the Legislation Committee on the general issue of the sovereignty of Parliament.    The co-ordination rules should not be debated until after this further Cabinet discussion, although the debates would have to take place before the April meeting of theCouncil of Ministers at which Governments would be expected togive their approval to the rules by a Council Resolution,    On steel,the Cabinet were agreed that action was needed to reassume powers8
to control private sector steel investment, and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should give further consideration in thelight of the discussion to the terms in which our requirements should be put before other e.c. Governments.    The Cabinet shouldalso return to this subject on the basis of a further report by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, when they reviewed the outcome of renegotiation after the Dublin meeting.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister?s summing up of their discussion.20 Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to be guided accordingly at the Councilof Ministers on the question of the co-ordinationof regional aids.
[atementI; theIfenceIriivlATES 19755, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence (C(75) 21) to which was attached a draft of theStatement on the Defence Estimates 1975aTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the white paper was longer than usual because of the need to give full coverageto the Defence Review in the light of the results of consultations with our allies and to give additional information about policy and strategic matters as had been recommended by the SelectCommittee on Expenditure,,    Subject to the approval of hiscolleagues he proposed to publish the Statement on 19 March.In discussion it was argued that many of the Government&apos;ssupporters were disappointed that greater savings were not beingmade in defence expenditure.    They would be critical of the implication in the White Paper that firm decisions had been taken onthe level of defence expenditure for the next 5 and even 10 years.The possibility of further reductions in public expenditure could notbe excluded and the White Paper should describe the Defence Budgetfigures as interim or provisional.    On the other hand it was strongly urged that the White Paper reflected decisions taken by the Cabinetin the context of the Defence ?.eview and of the Public expenditure survey.    All public expenditure programmes were, of course,liable to review but it would be wrong to single out the defence programme in this context.    If the Defence Review decisions were described as provisional it would be widely assumed that a further review was impending and this would have very damaging consequences for the confidence of the Services, of the defenceindustry, and of our allies who considered that our cuts had alreadygone too far.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had approved the Defence Review proposals subject to the outcome of international consultation; this consultation had not shown the need for any change.    The Review was therefore confirmed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had however reminded the Cabinetthat it might well become necessary at some point to require further substantial cuts in public expenditure, including defence expenditure.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that preparation for thepublication of the 1975 Statement on the Defence Estimates should proceed as proposed by the Secretary of State for Defence but before it was published further consideration should be given to the questionof how the defence expenditure figures should be expressed in thelight of the fact that the White Paper on Public Expenditure to1978-79 (Cmnd 5879) had noted that the figures for 1977-78 and1978-79 were provisional.
