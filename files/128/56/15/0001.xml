The first would rely on adaptations of existing arrangements, while the second would be an entirely new scheme.It would not be possible in the time available for the Cabinet toreach a decision.    Accordingly he would convene a meeting later that day of the Ministers immediately concerned to consider thereport by officials.    The conclusion they reached would be reflected in the Referendum Bill, which was due to be considered by theLegislation Committee on 25 March and published on the following day.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Lord President of the Council.2.

Ministers who differed from the Governmentsrecommendation should avoid answering questionsrelevant to renegotiation or the referendum campaign, and questions should be transferred as necessary to other ministers.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary wouldbe responsible for supervising the practical arrangements of thisuntil the guidelines could be formally adopted.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office20 March 19752
INDEXEDHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT35COPY no cabinet confidential annex cc(75) 15th Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 20 March 1975 at 10.30 amY OF THE The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord Privy1 CIVIL SERVICE Seal (C(75) 40) about the pay of the industrial Civil Service.I Previous THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the industrial civil servantsI Reference: were concerned about two issues.    One was their interim payCC(75) 12th claim;  the other was the basis on which their next mainConclusions settlement, due from 1 July 1975, would be made.    Within the lastMinutes 3 and 6 week strike action had been started by workers in the PropertyServices Agency, and in considering the pay questions someregard would have to be had to that fact - if only because itaffected the working of Parliament.    Even so, the strike onlyinvolved some 400 people out of the 180, 000 who comprised theindustrial Civil Service.To accede to the interim pay claim would be a plain breach of the12 month rule, and he was clear that it should be rejected.    Theunions had been promised a reply by the end of the week, and,subject to Cabinefs views, he would convey a reply in this sense.It would however be essential at the same time to say somethingabout the next main settlement and whether it would be based oncomparability.    There were three options: to make no commitment on the question of comparability;  to reaffirm theprinciple and accept it as the basis for the next settlement;  or tosteer a middle course.    He regarded the first of these asuntenable and the last as unlikely to cut any ice with the tradeunions.    He therefore favoured the second course, reaffirmingthe basis to which the Government was in any case already amplycommitted.    This did not mean of course that, subject to thatgeneral principle, there would not be room for hard and realisticbargaining when the time came.Turning to the question of the pay of the non-industrial CivilService, he said that he had met the Staff Side the previous day and explained to them the fears the Government entertained forthe economy generally if they agreed to the 34 per cent increase1CO iM ri Dii iNTi al
under consideration as a result of the Pay Agreement and theresult of the survey done by the Pay Research Unit.    He had met with an angry reaction from the Staff representatives, who saidthat they had withdrawn an interim pay demand on the strength ofan undertaking that the main settlement would be subject to normal principles;  that the Pay Agreement had been signed as recently as December, and should be honoured;  and that if no satisfactory offer were made in the following week, industrial action would be started immediately (indeed it had already begun in one or two provincial towns).    He proposed therefore that asmall group of Ministers, preferably under the chairmanship ofthe Prime Minister or the Lord President shoid.d consider thepossible composition of an offer to be made to the Staff Side thefollowing week, such an offer to be first reported to Cabinet.In discussion it was pointed out that if the Government confirmedto the unions acceptance of the principle of comparability for industrial civil servants, it would be extremely difficult not to concede it elsewhere.    Both the electricity workers, with whomdeadlock had been reached, and the railway workers, with whomnegotiations were just beginning, based their claims oncomparability with other groups of workers - notably the minersjand the TUC guidelines contained no provision for allowingincreases on such a basis.    In view of this, it would be best toadopt a middle course, indicating to the unions that theGovernment, like other employers, was expected to comply withthe social contract; pointing out that the principle that industrial civil servants should be paid fairly in relation to others had beenrepeatedly reaffirmed over the years;  and assuring the unionsthat it was against this background and in this spirit that theGovernment intended to conduct the negotiations for the nextannual settlement.    This would not exclude that comparabilitywas relevant, but would stop short of reaffirming it as a centralprinciple.    Against this it was argued that the industrial civilservants were not like the electricity or rail workers.    TheCivil Service had for a long time had their pay fixed by theprinciple of comparability.    This was not the case with theelectricity and railway workers, who were seeking to establishsomething new in their case.    On this basis there was no reason why the Lord Privy Seal should not be authorised to confirm theGovernments acceptance of comparability.In further discussion reference was made to the implications ofpublic sector pay settlements for public expenditure.    public expenditure was always discussed in constant price terms andthis tended to obscure the fact that the public sector was highlylabour intensive and that consequently its share of wage costswithin the total figure of public expenditure tended to rise faster2
than in the private seccor.    If pay settlements were not kept down,then it would be inevitable that some or all programmes wouldhave to be cut in order to offset the additional cost.    TheGovernment would be in a very difficult position with the nationalised industry chairmen, whom it was pressing to observe the guidelines, if they failed to hold down pay increases for theirown employees.    Indeed, it could be argued that if comparabilityfor the industrial Civil Service was confirmed, it would be evenmore difficult to handle the claims of the electricity and railway workers.    On the other hand, if it was clear that in the end theGovernment would have to concede comparability, there was muchto be said for doing so now and avoiding a charge of bad faith.Not to confirm it would be to run a serious risk of the presentstrike being made official, with all that this would imply.OF THE council the LORD PRESIDENT/, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet agreed that the question of the offer to be made to thenon-industrial Civil Service should be considered urgently by asmall group of Ministers under the Prime Minister, the irrecommendation to be reported to Cabinet the following weekbefore the offer was made to the Staff Side.    On the question ofthe industrial Civil Service, there was a general feeling that thereal difficulty lay in the absence from the guidelines of any provision which would admit the principle of comparability uponwhich Civil Service pay had for so long been based.    This was something which they should perhaps consider before the beginningof the next general pay round.    On the more immediate question,there was agreement that no interim pay claim should be conceded;and the balance of opinion on the issue of comparability was thatthe Lord Privy Seal should, in rejecting the interim pay claim,indicate confirmation of the Governments acceptance of theprinciple as the basis for the main settlement in the summer.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the Lord Presidentssumming up of their discussion.2, Invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly in repaying to the trade unions on theclaim by industrial civil servants.3.        Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor a small group of Ministers, as proposed by the lord privy Seal, to consider the offer to be made to thenon-industrial civil servants, such an offer to be firstreported to Cabinet.Cabinet Office20 March 1975 3
