PARLIAMENTARYliFFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.[Bicentenary of[American(independenceTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the previous administration had set up a Committee under the chairmanship ofLord Lothian to organise British participation in arrangements to mark the bicentenary of American independence.    One of their proposals was that Congress should be loaned a copy of Magna Cartain a presentation showcase;  and Mr Winston Churchill MP had suggested that the presentation might be made at a formal jointsession of Parliament and Congress in Westminster Hall.    Thiswould involve a good many practical difficulties, and the suggestionnow was that there should be a handing over ceremony in westminster Hall, attended by Members of Congress aud of bothHouses of Parliament, which would be followed by a banquet atLancaster House.     The next step would be for himself and the lord privy Seal to establish informally, through the usual channels, thatsuch a ceremony would be acceptable to Parliament and that thenecessary Resolutions of both Houses would have all-Party backing;and then for soundings to be taken to confirm that the proposals wouldbe welcome to the American authorities.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the statement by theLord President of the Council.
FOREIGNAFFAIRSugandareviousReference:CC(74) 44thConclusions,viinute 32, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat in considering the President of Uganda&apos;s threat to executeMr Hills, a 3ritish subject, unless six demands to rectify the alleged unfavourable depiction of Uganda by this country were met,and also his threat to another British subject, it was necessary to take into account the state of his mind.    The best tactic was probably the one normally employed with a terrorist who made unreasonabledemands, namely to try to keep a discussion going.    The PrimeMinister had therefore sent him a message which was emollientin tone but conceded nothing of substance.    MeanwhilePresident Kenyatta of Kenya, with whom we were in close touch,was doing his utmost to influence President Amin, as were theFederal German Chancellor, Herr Schmidt and General Gowon of nigeria.    He hoped President Sadat of Egypt might also bringinfluence to bear; and there was a possibility of Saudi Arabianintervention, which might be effective as their financial supportwas important to Uganda.     A great deal was therefore being donebehind the sceasa but it seemed best not to raise the level of thedispute.    The Opposition were being co-operative in this respect.In discussion it was suggested that if the execution did take place the Governmenfs reaction should be sharp and rapid, includingtotal British withdrawal from Uganda and suspension of Ugandafrom membership of the Commonwealth.    On the other hand it was argued that the 700 Britons still in Uganda included many missionaries,volunteers and traders who had ignored all advice to leave; as for commonwealth membership this was not a decision which britain could take in isolation as 32 other Heads of Government were involved.    A number of other suggestions were made, includingthe use of the Special Air Service (SAS), the offer of free publicity to Uganda in this country, the sending of an emissary to Uganda oreven an invitation to General Amin to visit London.    All howeverseemed open to some objection.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion, said that president Amin&apos;s evident mental instability made him unpredictableand it was right to consider unorthodox ways of dealing with thesituation.    The Cabinet agreed however that there was no alternativeat present to maintaining a dialogue in the hope that this, coupled with pressure from other countries behind the scenes, would resultin a favourable outcome.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisterTs summing up of their discussion.
[\iiddle East THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reporting onhis recent talks with the Egyptian Foreign Minister said thatIprsvious ^r Fahmy had been hopeful that an early United States initiativeIRaferen  ^ a comprej.18nsive approach to a Middle East settlement might bef&apos;^0&apos; . S successful.    The Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Rabin, with whom theKo^clusions, Prime Minister and he had also talked, had appeared to take the samejPnute view.    However he was himself not sure that the latest trend of american thinking still favoured a comprehensive approach of thiskind.    The alternative was to return to the step by step approach inan attempt to bridge the Egyptian offer of an undertaking on no recourse to force for an undefined period but until a further agreement, and the israeli demand that such an undertaking should be given for a specificperiod of 5 years.    There was not however much time remainingduring which the atmosphere for a settlement would be right, and theUnited States would soon be preparing for the 1976 Presidential election.It was therefore necessary to use all possible influence with the Israelisto persuade them that time was not on their side.    Egypt currentlywanted a settlement but the Israelis, if they were not more flexible,might find they had missed the tide.    Mr Fahmy had wanted to see amore active British role in efforts towards a settlement, but itwould be wrong for us to cross wires with the Americans.    Ourbilateral relations with Egypt continued to improve: new agreements on co-operation had just been signed and he was encouraging TradesUnion Congress leaders, including Mr Jack Jones, to be active infostering relations with Egypt.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the American administrationseemed to be moving away from their original intention of a comprehensive approach to  a Middle East settlement and were likely to revert to the step by step approach.    Israeli relations withthe White House were cooler than they had been and there was a danger that Israel might take a rigid attitude in the hope of getting a more sympathetic President after the elections.    But any changeof Administration in the United States in November 1976 would befollowed by a six months1 stalemate before the new Administrationcould be effective, and he doubted whether the Arabs would hold their hand so long.    It was satisfactory that the Russians were notplaying an active role in the situation at present, although it wasnoted that their attitude might change once they had secured theEuropean Security Summit in Helsinki.The Cabinet -2.    Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMr Ian Smith had agreed to a visit from the Minister of State lorForeign and Commonwealth Affairs (Mr Ennals).    The latter wouldalso have other important talks in Southern Africa.    But despite this encouraging development, he feared that the odds were stillagainst a Rhodesia settlement.The Cabinet -3.    Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.Thci-e was a short discussion on Chilean Debts.    It was confirmed that the Export Credit Guarantees Department (ECGD) was entering into no new commitments over trade with Chile and that any ECGDlosses referred to in the Press related to old transactions.    the cabinet&apos;s decision not to reschedule Chilean debts last year hadbeen taken on principle and in the knowledge that this would costsome millions of pounds: but given the number of other countrieswhich had agreed to rescheduling, it was questionable whether our decision had brought effective pressure on Chile.    Our policy could be more fully reassessed when a further decision onrescheduling became necessary.The Cabinet -4.    Took note.THE ECONOMIC    3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theSITUATION position of sterling was causing serious concern.    It had sufferedthe most severe attack, and the position, that morning was again bad.Despite rumours that the selling of sterling was inspired by a singlesource, there had in fact been heavy selling of the currencythroughout the world.    He was in close touch with the Governor of theBank of England on the technical management of the situation.    Itwas hoped to get this under control in the immediate future but our action would buy a temporary respite only.    Our will to tackle theproblem of inflation was doubted and with increasing loss of credibilityit would become more and more expensive to hold the exchange rate.The position had to some extent been aggravated by. the expectation,which the Government had not fulfilled, that immediately after the referendum they would take sweeping action on the economic front.All this was against a background where British wage settlementswere being made at four times the level of settlements in west germany, and where British inflation was likely to run at more thanRhodesiapreviousReference:CC(75) 8thConclusionsMinute 2The ChileanDebtsPreviousReference:CC(75) 10thConclusions,Minute 2
double the rate in our principal competitor countries.    There was an urgent need for a new incomes policy: the situation might not allow, as he had previously hoped, the deferment of this until themiddle of July.    Several of the leaders of the trade unions werebeing encouragingly realistic;  but the problems of ensuring compliance with a realistic policy remained unresolved.In discussion the seriousness of the position was noted.    On theother hand there were some more favourable features.There had been a sustained improvement in our balanceof payments - an improvement which now more than offset theincreased cost of our oil imports.    If the proposals for a newincomes policy under preparation were introduced and wereeffective, sterling could even be seen to be under-valued.    On theother hand the fall in the value of sterling had of itself increased costs particularly of such basic elements as food and fuel, making it more difficult to hold steady retail prices in those sectors, as thetrade unions were demanding.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet would have a thorough discussion of the economic situation the following week.    In the meantime all Ministers should avoid, if at all possible, making any speeches on the economic situation or theposition of sterling.    l  existing speaking engagements required anysuch reference, the relevant passages should be cleared with theChancellor of the Exchequer and, where appropriate, with theSecretary of State for Employment.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
&quot;TE 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the SecretaryipjUMENTATION of State for the Environment about late implementation of the HousingrTHE Finance Act (C(75) 65).OUSING3IANCE THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that aCT problem had arisen over the handling of clause 4 of the housing finance (Special Provisions) Bill, which had recently been given a-previous Second Reading in the House of Lords after completing all its stagesTerence: in the House of Commons,    Clause 4 gave effect to the Cabinet&apos;sC(74) 43rd earlier decision to remove from the local councillors concerned any^elusions, disqualification from civic office caused by a surcharge arising frominute 1 failure to implement the Housing Finance Act.    Ir practice thisprovision applied only to the Clay Cross councillors^    A new situation had now arisen because the Clay Cross councillors had beensurcharged for  50, 000 in relation to matters unconnected with theHousing Finance Act;  and since the period durisag which they were entitled to appeal had expired on 28 May without an appeal beingJodged, they were now disqualified.    The disqualification would runfor the normal period of five years.    Therefore, as a result of this additional disqualification, clause 4 had become otiose.    TheOpposition in the House of Lords were of course hostile to the clause in principle, and had put down a Committee Stage amendment deletingit which would no doubt be carried whatever attitude the Governmentadopted.    The Governments choice lay between indicating, either inadvance or during the Committee Stage debate, that they wereprepared to accept the amendment;  and fighting it - which couldinvolve seeking later restoration of the clause in the House of commons as well as resisting the Opposition amendment in the Lords.    Whilearguments of political consistency could be advanced in favour of thelatter course, the balance of advantage in his view clearly favouredacceptance of the amendment.In discussion, it was argued that the heat generated by resistingdeletion of the clause would make it more difficult to carry the other provisions of the Bill, to many of which it was clear that oppositioncould be expected in the Lords.    The Bill might in consequence be delayed, and could even be lost if there were a serious confrontationbetween Lords and Commons;  and this would jeopardise theposition of the 400 other councillors who stood to be surcharged anddisqualified in the absence of legislation.    Moreover there were many Labour Party supporters in Parliament and in the country whohad always had serious reservations about clause 4.    In thecircumstances created by the further disqualification of the ClayCross councillors, opposition to the deletion of the clause would be most unwelcome to them, and it was likely that some backbenchGovernment supporters in the Commons would refuse to vote for a motion for the restoration of the clause after it had been struck outby the Lords.    Moreover Government spokesmen would have6
considerable difficulty in presenting a convincing argument for theretention - still more for the restoration - of a provision which was clearly otiose.    It was, however, important that the parliamentary labour Party should be consulted in advance about the course to beadopted, though it could not be ignored that this would not be a convenient time for discussion of a matter about which there were strong feelings.    On the other hand, it was argued that, when in opposition, the Labour Party had given a clear commitment that theClay Cross councillors would be relieved of their disqualification;and this commitment had subsequently been confirmed by the Cabinet,It would be most damaging for the Government to renege on theundertaking, all the more so because they would appear to be actingat the behest of the Opposition in the Upper House.    Moreover, itmust be remembered that the actions of the Clay Cross councillorshad played a great part in awakening the public conscience to the evils of the Housing Finance Act.    The better course would thereforebe for the Government to stick to their guns and allow themselves tobe defeated, and thus preserve consistency of principle.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although, in the circumstances created by the further disqualificationof the Clay Cross councillors  or reasons unconnected with theHousing Finance Act, there were strong logical arguments for not seeking to retain clause 4, there were political and presentationalconsiderations which tended in the opposite direction.    The cabinet agreed that on balance the preferable course would be to resist theOpposition amendment in the House of Lords in the knowledge that theGovernment would be defeated.    The Government spokesman need not do more than offer a formal defence of the clause, and in particularshould say nothing which could heighten the political temperature inthe House of Lords and thus prejudice the prospects of the other provisions of the Bill or of the other contentious legislation whichwould be coming before that House during the remainder of the session,    The Parliamentary Labour Party should subsequently be consulted about the action to be taken when the Bill again came beforethe House of Commons, and it was to be hoped that they would agreethat in the circumstances it would not be appropriate for theGovernment to seek the restoration of the provisions at presentcontained in clause 4,The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office12 June 1975
