?AR LIA MEN TAR Y    1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inIFF AIRS the House of Commons during the following week.    At the requestof the Chairman of the Scrutiny Committee, it had been decided to devote a full day to discussion of European EconomicCommunitydocuments on energy policy.abortion It was reported that the Social Services Committee had recently(Amendment) discussed the tactics for handling the Private Member!s Bill seekinggill to amend the Abortion Act, which was due for its Second Reading on7 February,    The position was a difficult one:  it was inevitable thatthere should be a free vote, while the strength of feeling on theissue, cutting across Party lines, made it undesirable for theGovernment to commit themselves absolutely one way or another.But the Bill as it stood was unsatisfactory in a number of respects;and it was unlikely that the Government would be able to securethe necessary improvements at a later stage, should it receive aSecond Reading,    In these circumstances the Committee had decided that the best course would be to try to persuade the sponsorsof the Bill to withdraw it, on the understanding that arrangements would be made for establishing a Select Committee which, in thelight of the recommendations recently made by the Lane Committeeon the Abortion Act and of any evidence submitted to them byinterested organisations, would prepare detailed proposals for legislation.    There had been discussions with the sponsors of theBill, who had indicated that they would on this basis be prepared towithdraw it.    It was, however, still possible that there would be a vote at the end of the Second Reading debate, owing to opposition from those who did not wish to see any substantial change in thepresent law.1
9R.EIGN 2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that in the course of their visit[FAIRS to Washington from 29 to 31 January, he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had held long and useful discussions withrime Ministers      President Ford and the American Secretary of State, Dr Kissinger,isit to the They had quickly established an excellent rapport withlifted States President Ford who had impressed them both personally and by hisapproach to a wide range of international questions.    A review of world economic problems, including energy, had included a discussion of measures that might be taken to stabilise the priceof agricultural products and raw materials.    If the producers ofthese commodities were to be persuaded not to follow the example of the oil producers in seeking to establish cartels, with the consequent threat to the world economy, it was necessary to give them confidence for the future.    He found that the Americans, likeus, were considering the possibility of creating this confidencethrough some form of price indexation:  and he had given instructions for further work to be done on this. Discussion on theMiddle East revealed very close agreement between ourselves andthe Americans in our analysis of the situation and on the need to pursue Dr KissingerJs step by step approach.    The discussionsalso enabled us to inform the Americans of some of the questionswhich he and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would bepursuing with the Soviet leaders when they visited Moscow on13 February.    In particular they had discussed our intention to seek to persuade the Russians to sign a joint statement on theimportance of further progress to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons.    In addition to the meetings with President Fordand Dr Kissinger he and the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary had held a meeting with the Committees on Foreign Relations of theUnited States Senate and House of Representatives; he had addressedthe National Press Club in Washington;  and had given interviews inwhich he had taken the opportunity to explain our policies, includingour policy on Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.2
2UR0F.FANECONOMICCOMMUNITYREFERENDUMPreviousReference:CC(75) 5ihConclusions,Minute 63. The Cabinet had before thern a note by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C(75) 15) covering a report by the Home Office onthe feasibility of a centralised count in the referendum onmembership of the European Community.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the report showed that a centralcount would be feasible but somewhat hazardous.    A large staff would be needed, security could not be guaranteed, and the countwould take at least five working days, including polling day.    Butpolitical rather than technical considerations were paramount.Some supported a central count because the referendum was anational issue.    Others preferred a count and declaration byconstituencies.    Another course was to count and declare bycounties as a preliminary to the announcement of a national result.On balance, he preferred a central count.    A very early decision was needed to enable drafting of the relevant section of the &quot;white paper on referendum arrangements to proceed and to allow thenecessary planning, whether for a central count or for some otherarrangement, to be put in hand.In discussion it was argued that the real purpose of a central countwould be, and would be seen to be, to conceal from different partsof the United Kingdom knowledge of how they voted, because of thepolitical embarrassment which the voting results could create.But, even if the total Scottish vote, for example, went in the opposite direction to the vote of the United Kingdom as a whole,there would still be local variations within Scotland, as in otherparts of the United Kingdom,    To seek to suppress the voting inthe regions would be wrong in principle and would in practice be defeated by public opinion polls which could be held before andafter the referendum.    A decision in favour of a central countwould inflame opinion in Scotland and perhaps elsewhere and could make it more difficult to pass the necessary legislation through parliament,    There would also be serious practical difficulties in organising a central count, and these would be seen as demonstratingthe lengths to which the Government were going in order to preventthe results of regional and local voting from becoming known.    Theresults of the referendum could be aggregated and announced as anational total; but it should be conducted on lines as close aspossible to a General Election; while there was a case for countingby constituencies it would be preferable to count by counties orregions.Against this, the essentially national character of the referendumwas emphasised.    The question was whether the British people as a whole wished the United Kingdom to remain in the european community, and the counting and declaration of votes should reflectthis.    There was no logical or moral obligation to declare the total
votes of particular groups of electors, whether on a geographicalor on any other basis:  only the total United Kingdom result wouldbe significant,    The analogy of a General Election did not apply,since each Member of Parliament was elected on the result in an individual constituency.    If regional results were announced or knowntheir validity would be greater and of longer term significance than thoseof any unofficial polls.    Different results for different parts of theUnited Kingdom would sharpen the divisions within the UnitedKingdom and even within England.    The Governments policies ondevolution could be put at risk, and the nationalist parties wouldbe given a continuing grievance to exploit.    There was some evidence that Government supporters in the House of Commonswere in favour on balance of a central count.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were in favour of a central count.    plans should be carried forward on this basiss and possible ways of reducing the estimated time required for a central count should be carefully examined.    The White Paper on the referendumarrangements should reflect the Cabinet decision.    parliament would then have an opportunity to express its views and these couldbe taken into account by the Government.    There was always a risk that the renegotiation would not be completed, as was hoped, byEaster; but work should continue on the assumption that the referendum would be held in June,The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord President to prepare the relevant section of the White Paper accordingly.3, Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Lord President, to make plans for a central count.Cabinet Office6 February 1975
