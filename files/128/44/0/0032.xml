ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessPrinciples ofNationalHealth ServiceChargesCC32(69)secret. The Cabinet were informed Of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was agreed that the Prayer for the Annulment ofthe National Health Service (Charges for Appliances) regulations should be debated on Monday, 21st July.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that aconsiderable number of Government supporters might on this occasionvote against the Government, but it appeared that many of them were concerned less about the particular charges for dentures and spectacles,which could be readily defended, than with the general principle ofcharging in the health service, and in particular with charging forprescriptions. It would be important, therefore, to make clear the distinction between the Governmenfs policy towards charges suchas those for dentures and spectacles, which fell mainly on people whowere not sick, and their policy on prescription charges; and to saythat the Government intended to abolish the prescription charges assoon as the economic situation permitted. The Social services committee had recently considered whether it was necessary tointroduce an embossed card to be held by those entitled to exemption from the prescription charges; they had thought that to do so wouldbe unfortunate, since the capital expense involved ( 2 million) would create the impression that the Government regarded as permanent asystem which was unsatisfactory not only on grounds of principlebut also because of its failure to provide means of exempting the chronic sick from the charge. The Committee had concluded thatthere was at present no evidence that the existing arrangement whereby the person presenting the prescription signed a declaration ofentitlement to exemption from the charge, though in theory open toabuse, was in fact being abused on a significant scale; and they didnot consider that the expenditure involved in introducing and maintaining the embossed card system was justified.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Secretary of State for Social Services, after discussion withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, should circulate to the Cabinet attheir next meeting a paper on the principle of charging in the health service in order that the Cabinet might discuss the case to be madein the debate on the National Health Service Charges Regulations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, afterconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to circulate for consideration at their next meeting amemorandum on the principle of charges in the national health Service.10520
House ofCommons(redistribution of Seats)(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 31stConclusions,Minute 1)The Home Secretary said that if the House of Lords rejected theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill, as theymight, two courses would be open to him. He could comply withthe requirements of Section 2 (5) of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, by laying the 94 Orders requiredto give effect to the recommendations.of the Boundary Commissions,and the law did not appear to require him to move Motionsupon them. Alternatively, he could reintroduce the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill, which wouldbecome law under the Parliament Act thirteen months afterthe original Second Reading in the House of Commons, Le.,in August 1970. This would not bring the changes in theLondon constituency boundaries into effect in time for the greater london Council (GLC) elections due in April 1970, to take place underthe new arrangements, and this might put the GLC in some difficulty;but the necessary amendment would be made in the Bill at the later stages. The Cabinet might also wish to consider introducing a short bill to limit the powers of the House of Lords.The Attorney-General said that if it became necessary toreintroduce the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2)Bill under the Parliament Act there would be a risk of successfulproceedings for mandamus, or for a declaration requiring the HomeSecretary to lay Orders to give effect to the Boundary Commissions&apos;recommendations; but the courts would not be likely to challengeParliament lightly, and it was possible that a defence on the groundthat the Bill was before the House might succeed. If, however, theHome Secretary were ordered to comply with the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, while it was true that the law wassilent about any action beyond laying the Orders, there was nevertheless an implication that, haying laid them, the Home secretary should then move the necessary Resolutions. But as a matter of lawit seemed that the Home Secretary would have a good defence if helaid Orders and the Government then made time available for their discussion on a Private Member&apos;s Motion.In discussion it was suggested that if the House of Commons had passed the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Billthey might refuse to debate Orders laid in pursuance of the House ofCommons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, either by moving thatthey should be considered this day six months, or by means of aprocedural Motion. The Government, however, should not obstructdiscussion of the Orders, and if the Home Secretary were a party tosuch an attempt he would not be regarded as complying with theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949. the commons might, however, vote to reject the Orders. It wassuggested that, in order to discourage the House of Lords fromprovoking a disagreement with the House of Commons, the House
secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thesplit between the two wings of the Italian Socialist Party hadeffectively ended the coalition, though the Government remained in office on a &quot; caretaker &quot; basis. The breach had come partly throughpersonal rivalries, but considerations of the attitude to be adopted towards the Communists had also been involved. The Times had reported that day that Signor Piccoli of the Christian Democrat party was working for the reconstitution of a Left-Centre coalition, but of Lords should be given some indication of the tactics which theGovernment might pursue. This would disabuse them of the idea atpresent held by the Opposition, that if the House of Lords rejected the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill, Ordersimplementing the Boundary Commissions&apos; recommendations would inevitably take effect. Equally, the Government should have regardto the possibility that the House of Lords might take advantage of thedefect in the Parliament Act which left the situation uncertain whenthe House of Lords delayed the passage of a Bill without in termsrejecting it. It was agreed that if the House of Lords amended theBill the House of Commons should find time to consider the amendments and refuse to accept them.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat he would arrange for the Ministers principally concerned,including the Secretary of State for Scotland, to consider under his chairmanship the procedural problems that might arise, including any problems created by the House of Lords delaying rather thanrejecting or amending the Bill. The Ministerial Committee on thePowers of the House of Lords should consider whether it would bedesirable to introduce a Bill to limit the House of Lords&apos; powers andshould report to the Cabinet in September.The Cabinet-(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would call together theLord President, the Home Secretary, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and other Ministers concerned toconsider the procedural problems which might arise fromthe House of Lords rejecting, amending or delaying theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange, for the ministerial committee on Powers of the House of Lords to considerthe desirability of introducing a Bill to limit the House ofLords&apos; powers, and to report to the Cabinet in September.
Kenya :Assassinationof Mr. TomMboyaMr. GeraldBrooke(previous reference:CC (69) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)there had so far been no confirmation of this. Other possibilities were a minority Christian Democrat government or new elections. Thesplit would weaken Italian influence in Europe, which under the coalition government had on the whole been exerted in favour of our european policies. Another consequence might be the finaldisappearance from the Italian political scene of Signor Nenni.The Prime Minister said that during his visit to Stockholm hehad heard that differences over Italian Socialist representation on theSocialist International had been a contributing factor in the split.There was clearly a danger of an increase in Communist influence,which in turn raised the possibility of a Right-wing coup. But althoughthe British Labour Party had been instrumental in bringing the two italian Socialist parties together in 1963, there was little that couldbe done now to influence the course of events.The Cabinet (1) Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  ForeignCommonwealth Secretary and the Prime Minister.andThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there wasno evidence as yet to show whether the assassination of Mr. Mboya,the Kenyan Minister for Economic Planning and Development, was politically motivated or had been the result of a private vendetta.Mr. Mboya&apos;s fellow-tribesmen, the Luo, believed that the Kikuyuwere responsible; and, in such a situation, what was generally believed was as important politically as the actual facts. It would be important for the Kenya Government to show that they weregenuinely doing all they could to bring the murderer to justice. Therehad been some disturbances in Kenya, and there was a risk that tribalrivalries might come to the surface within the Kenya AfricanNational Union and other political parties; but so far there was no indication that the safety of British subjects was at risk.The Cabinet-(2) Took   note   of  the   statement   by   the   Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the SovietGovernment had been informed on the lines agreed by Ministers.The point had been made that in accepting the dates proposed by theSoviet authorities for the release of Mr. Brooke andMr. and Mrs. Kroger respectively, we had made a substantialconcession, and that we expected the Soviet authorities to meet us onthe subsidiary issues: for example, the outstanding cases involvingmarriages between British subjects and Soviet nationals, and thequestion of access by British consular officers to British subjects
Nigeria(previous reference :CC (69) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during theprevious weekend he and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Maurice Foley,had seen the Nigerian Commissioner for External Affairs, Mr. Arikpo,the Nigerian Commissioner for Information, Chief Enahoro, and the nigerian Acting High Commissioner in London. These discussions had resulted in acceptance by the Federal Military Government of nigeria (FMG) of daylight relief flights, subject to the inspection of cargoes by neutral observers, and to a meeting between Mr. Arikpoand M. Freymond of the International Red Cross (ICRC). As a resultof the latter meeting, contacts had been restored between the FMGand ICRC, and discussions between the two parties were now going on in Lagos. While the importance of these developments was notto be underrated, a number of points remained to be settled: forexample, whether the FMG would be prepared, as an interim measure,to allow relief flights by night to continue until arrangements for dayflights could be agreed. The question of relief flights direct to rebel-held territory would also have to be resolved. These and other issues were currently under discussion in Lagos. The attitude of the rebelleader, Colonel Ojukwu, was crucial to the whole question, and sofar he had shown no signs of flexibility.France :Contacts withthe newFrenchGovernment(previous reference:CC (69) 29thConclusions,Minute 4)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the newFrench Government was still formulating its policies in a number offields. It was therefore important that his colleagues should consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Office if they were contemplatingany contacts with any members of the French Government.detained by the Soviet authorities. Such access had been providedfor in the Anglo-Soviet Consular Convention, but the frequency of visits had not been laid down. A reply was now awaited from theSoviet authorities. If it was satisfactory, there would be an exchangeof letters, and Mr. and Mrs. Kroger would be informed by the PolishConsul of our intention to release them. There was some doubt whether agreement could now be reached in time for a statement tobe made in Parliament before it rose for the Recess. It would on thewhole be preferable if such a statement could be made, despite there actions which it would inevitably arouse.The Cabinet-(3) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.
OverseasRepresentationReport of theReviewCommitteeCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (C (69) 73) covering the report by the review Committee on Overseas Representation under thechairmanship of Sir Val Duncan.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary invited his colleagues to approve his proposal to lay the Report before Parliament, and to publish it, on 16th July, subject to the amendments indicated in the text which had been circulated to them and those set out in Annex Ato his memorandum. He also invited their approval of the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons on the same day (text at Annex B of C (69) 73). He emphasised that, while theGovernment welcomed the Committee&apos;s general approach, the implications of their conclusions would have to be examined furtherbefore these could be specifically endorsed. He drew attention to a central feature of the Report: namely the distinction which it drewbetween the &quot; area of concentration &quot; i.e., Europe and North-WestAmerica, in which our overseas interests now principally lay, on theone hand; and the rest of the world on the other. While thisdistinction was entirely appropriate in Britain&apos;s present position inthe world, it did not imply that the outer areas would be neglected.If the reports recommendations were implemented, they were likelyto result by the mid-70s in substantial net savings on overseas representation, though in the short term there would have to beincreases of expenditure on such items as increased training and compensation for premature retirement. He was opposed to suddenand drastic reductions, since these would make it impossible to achieve the long-term objectives to whose attainment the Report hadBermuda The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it had been known for some time that a Black Power Conference was to be heldin Bermuda. The matter had been discussed in the Defence and oversea Policy Committee which had decided against attempting toban the conference. The Committee had, however, recognised thatthe holding of the conference might lead to disorders beyond the capacity of the local authorities to contain with their own resources,and had accordingly approved the despatch to Bermuda of a detachment from 45 Royal Marine Commando. The conference would be opening that day, and would end on 16th July. It had been less well attended than its organisers had hoped, and so far there hadbeen no reports of any serious disorders.The Cabinet (4) Took  note  of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.
Bbeen directed. The proposals in the Report, if accepted, would inevitably involve some reduction in the scope of our overseas representation. In particular the flow of information from postsabroad would be reduced, and there might be some falling-off in thescale of the consular services which could be given to British subjectsabroad. This would have to be accepted in the interests of economy.In discussion there, was general agreement that the Committeehad produced an excellent report. Some misgivings were expressedover the effects which the application of the doctrine of an &quot; area of concentration &quot; might have on our contacts with commonwealth countries which were both important in themselves and in some caseshad a considerable &quot;nuisance value&quot; and with Eastern Europe.There were also some doubts of the wisdom of reducing broadcasting and information services to the extent advocated by the Committee.The point was made that the economies which were expected to result from the implementation of the Committee&apos;s proposals were verymodest in scale, and in fact amounted to less than might be achieved by one year&apos;s rigid economy. The official committee which was to study the report should be impressed with the urgency of their task,and invited to report by a set date; and the results of their studiesshould be examined further by Ministers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement that the Review Committee on overseas Representation had done an excellent job. The cabinet agreed that the Report should be laid before Parliament and published as amended. They also agreed to a statement in the House ofCommons by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in the terms proposed. The Report would be studied by officials, who shouldtake account of the points made in discussion, and report to Ministers,who would consider the matter further in the Defence and overseas policy Committee in September.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that the Report of the Review Committee on overseas representation, as amended in the text before them and in annex A to C (69) 73, should be laid before parliament and published.(3) Approved the terms of the proposed statement to be madeby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in the Houseof Commons on 16th July.
(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to arrangeas a matter of urgency for the Report to be studiedinterdepartmentally as indicated in paragraph 5 of his paper, with a view to the matter being examined furtherby the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee inSeptember.Prices andIncomesPolicyPay of theHigher CivilServiceCONFIDENTIAL4.* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal on the pay of the Higher Civil Service (C (69) 78).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meeting on 8th July the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes had agreedthat the first stage of the increases in the rates of pay for the higher civil Service recommended in the Ninth Report by the standing advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service (the plowden Committee) should be implemented from 1st July, 1969;and that at the same time orders should be laid before parliament for parallel increases in the pay of the Lower Judiciary. They had also agreed that the long-term objective should be to give the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) sole responsibility for advisingon pay in the public sector generally. The majority of the Committeehad supported the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s recommendations that theGovernment should announce forthwith its acceptance in principleof the rates of pay proposed in the Plowden Committee&apos;s report. Buta sizable minority considered that, while the first stage of the increasescould be implemented at once, the question of any further increases should be referred to the NBPI.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Plowden Committee had done a very thorough job. They had made their recommendations on theunderstanding that comparability was accepted by the government as the main basis for determining Civil Service pay in accordancewith principles laid down by the Royal Commission on the CivilService in 1955. They had taken full account of the NBPFs reporton top salaries in the private sector and nationalised industries(Cmnd. 3970). There were strong arguments against referring the plowden Committee&apos;s report to the NBPI for further advice. Thiswould inevitably lead to the resignation of Lord Plowden and hiscolleagues, and in any case the NBPI would almost certainly confirm
CC32(69)the Plowden Committee&apos;s recommendations and might indeedincrease them. There was a real danger that, if the salaries for theHigher Civil Service were not aligned more closely to rates of pay incomparable occupations, significant numbers of able people would go out into industry without any return movement. The right course was to follow the same procedure over the Plowden Committee&apos;srecommendations as had been adopted with the NBPFs report on top salaries in nationalised industries. Further consideration shouldbe given to the need for closer co-ordination of the arrangements for determing public sector pay; but it would be a mistake to deal withthis too explicitly in the statement about the Plowden Committee&apos;sreport which he hoped it would be possible to make on the following day.In discussion there was general agreement on the need to avoiddiscriminating against the Civil Service. The first stage of the plowden Committee&apos;s recommendations was fully consistent with prices and incomes policy and should be implemented forthwith. Itwas argued, however, that the case for further increases was notproven and should not be accepted until it had been examined further in the context of prices and incomes policy generally. The basis ofthe Committee&apos;s recommendations for substantial increases for theHigher Civil Service was of doubtful validity. Civil Service salarieswere compared with those in private industry but not, for example,with those of university teachers; and not enough account had beentaken of the fact that civil servants were not in general publiclyaccountable. It was in any case important to get away from theuncritical application of comparability. Special review bodies likethe Plowden Committee and the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Remuneration (the Kindersley Committee) should be abolished and arrangements made for the Government to receiveco-ordinated advice from the NBPI on the whole range of public sector salaries, including those of local authority staff, the judiciary,the Civil Service, Ministers and Members of Parliament. otherwise it would be impossible to secure the continued acceptance by wage earners of the need for restraint, and the prices and incomes policy would rapidly become a dead letter.On the other hand there was wide support for the view that, whileit might have been a mistake to ask the Plowden Committee to carryout the review in the first place, they had conscientiously dischargedthe remit given to them by the Government. It would be unjust andinexpedient to repudiate their findings now or to refer them to the nbpi on the grounds that their members, whom the Governmenthad appointed, were insufficiently representative. There was in any10S20
case no reason to suppose that the NBPI would recommend anylower rates of pay; the Plowden Committee had already scaled down their recommendations considerably, below what they considered tobe justified on grounds of strict comparability. Moreover, there wasfirm evidence that senior civil servants were being offered posts innationalised industries and other parts of the public sector atsalaries considerably higher than their present ones; and therewas a real risk that a refusal to accept the Plowden Committee&apos;srecommendations in principle would adversely affect the quality of recruitment.The strength of the case for obtaining co-ordinated advice onsalary questions in the public sector as a whole was generally recognised. But it was pointed out that there would need to be veryfull consultation before any changes were made. Moreover, the task of advising on such a wide range of salaries was a very large one;and if the NBPI were to be asked to undertake it, its composition and structure would need to be substantially modified.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the Government should accept inprinciple the rates of pay proposed for the Higher Civil Service bythe Plowden Committee, without reference to the NBPI. The first stage of these increases, together with a 5 per cent central pay increase for assistant secretaries, should be implemented from 1st July thisyear and at the same time orders should be laid before parliament for parallel increases in the pay of the Lower Judiciary. The increases proposed for the second and third stages would be considered in thelight of the development of incomes policy over the next two years.The Cabinet also agreed in principle that there should be closer -ordination of the arrangements for determining salaries in thepublic sector in its widest sense, including civil servants, local authoritystaff, the judiciary and in due course Members of Parliament. the aim should be to do away with separate review bodies such as the plowden and Kindersley Committees and to give the NBPI, whichwould need to be strengthened for the purpose, a more central role in the provision of advice on salaries in the public sector generally.Consultations to this end should begin as soon as possible. the government&apos;s decisions should be announced in Written Answersin both Houses of Parliament, and the Lord Privy Seal should agreethe terms of the announcement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the First Secretary of State and other Ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
CONFIDENTIALPublicExpenditure,1970-71(previous reference :CC (69) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)5.  The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to postpone consideration of this subject until thefollowing week.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whether he could circulate further information to the cabinet before their next meeting.CONFIDENTIALAdvice from 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HealthGroup on0^    Ministers (C (69) 75) on the advice received from the Advisory GroupTranspianta-    on Transplantation Problems,tion Problems(2) Agreed that the first stage of the increases in the rates of payproposed for the Higher Civil Service in the plowden committee&apos;s report should be implemented from 1st July,1969, together with a 5 per cent central pay increase forassistant secretaries.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the lord privy Seal, to arrange for orders to be laid beforeParliament for parallel increases in the pay of the LowerJudiciary.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to consider how closer co-ordination of the arrangements for determing salaries in the public sector, on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up, could best be effected.(5) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the First Secretary of Stateand other Ministers concerned, to arrange for the government&apos;s decisions on the Plowden Committee&apos;srecommendations, as indicated in the Prime Ministefssumming up, to be announced in Written Answers in bothHouses of Parliament on the following day.
The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the health ministers had set up the Group to advise on any problems in the field of transplantation which were of public concern, and had asked theminitially to advise on whether any amendments of the Human TissueAct, 1961, might be desirable. The Group had recommended certainsafeguards for the donor, particularly in respect of the certificationof death by two doctors unconnected with the relevant transplantteam. They had also agreed that the individuals right to decide whether his organs were to be used after death for transplant surgerymust be respected. Six out of eleven members of the Group had recommended that organs should be available for transplantationunless the individual had indicated a wish to the contrary, subject tothe existence of an absolutely effective mechanism for discovering andrecording the individual&apos;s view. The minority of five had recommended that organs should not be used unless the donor or hisrelatives had specifically agreed, and had proposed certain other amendments of the Act to make it clear that it should be the hospitalwhich was lawfully in possession of the body of a patient between his death and the claiming of the body by his next of kin or executors.The advice had been considered by the Social Services Committee,who had found the proposed safeguards for the donor acceptable,but had suggested that in publishing the advice the Government shouldalso publish the names of the majority and minority groups (to whichthe consent of those concerned had now been obtained) and should express their doubt of the wisdom of implementing the majorityrecommendation at present. It was proposed to publish the advice on Monday, 14th July, and to make the statement proposed by theSocial Services Committee by means of a Written Answer.In discussion it was suggested that the public would find therecommendation of the majority of the Advisory Group whollyunacceptable and would object to the proposal that the rights of thehospital over the body of a deceased patient should be clarified. Themembers of the Group were not of such independent standing as tocarry weight with the public, and it might be preferable to arrange a wholly independent inquiry. The subject was of great importancenot only to the confidence of the public in the hospitals, but to publicdecisions on the right use of both material resources and researchcapability as between on the one hand the improvement of transplantsurgery, and on the other the improvement of other forms of medical treatment and of measures which might prevent the untimely deathby accident of healthy people suitable to be regarded as donors. Theadvice of the Group should be published in a form which made it clearthat it was not a statement of Government policy, and the Governmentshould be dissociated from the recommendations. Alternatively, itwas suggested that it would be preferable to publish the advicewithout any statement upon it.
Land Tenurein Scotland a Plan forReformThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summing up thediscussion, said that the Cabinet were agreed that the advice shouldsimply be published, but not as a White Paper, and the preponderance of opinion was that there should be no statement or a reply to aninspired Question. The answer to Press enquiries should be that theGovernment had published the document in view of the need for thepublic to discuss the topics with which it dealt.The Cabinet-Agreed that the advice of the Advisory Group onTransplantation Problems should be published without aGovernment statement, and invited the Secretary of Statefor Social Services to arrange for publication.confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C (69) 74) to which was annexed a draft white paper on the reform of land tenure in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the draft white paper, which had already been generally approved by the HomeAffairs Committee, envisaged a complete transformation of thesystem of land tenure which had existed in Scotland for centuries.Feudal tenure, under which land was granted in perpetuity in exchange for a recurring annual payment (the feu duty) would be swept away,and all land would be held either in absolute ownership or on lease.As from a day to be appointed, vassals would become absolute owners of their property, although pending redemption of the feu (whichwould be compulsory on the first sale of the land) they would berequired to make annual payments to their former superiors equal in amount to the present feu duties. Redemption would be on fair and reasonable terms, but it would be premature at this stage to specifywhat the terms would be; in recent years the capitalised value of feuduties had been tending to fall. The proposals would be controversialsince superiorities were currently held as a form of financial investment by charities and others, but their general practicability had been testedin discussions with interested bodies and they could be presented as part of the Governmenfs forward-looking attempts to moderniseScotland&apos;s institutions.The Home Affairs Committee had expressed concern that thereshould be consultation between the Scottish Law Commission andthe Law Commission; this has now taken place. The Committee had also questioned the wisdom of the proposal in paragraph 43 of thedraft White Paper to limit leases of land for house building to 20 years.
The limitation had been intended to prevent the growth in Scotlandof the problems which had made leasehold enfranchisement necessaryin England and Wales; but on reflection he believed that it might cause difficulty and he now intended, with the concurrence of theLord Advocate, to substitute a paragraph saying that the government proposed that under the new system of land tenure the leasing of landfor the purpose of building dwelling-houses should cease or shouldbe allowed only in special circumstances and subject to the moststringent safeguards. Subject to this one change he invited theCabinet to approve the draft White Paper, which he planned to publish before the Summer Recess. It Would hot be possible to implement the main proposals during the present Parliament; therewere many complexities to explore, including the application of theproposals to Crown land which he would be discussing with the chief secretary, Treasury. But he planned to introduce a Bill next session to make the interim improvements mentioned in Part IV of the white paper; these did not touch the main principle.The Cabinet-Approved the publication of the draft White Paper annexed to C (69) 74, subject to amendment of paragraph 43 on thelines proposed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th July, 1969.
