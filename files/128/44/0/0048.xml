parliament house ofCommons(redistribution of Seats) (No. 2)Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 46lhConclusions,Minnie I)In effect the House of Lords would have to choose between aGeneral Election fought on the basis of the present scats or on thebasis of the partial reform embodied in the Redistribution of ScatsBill.The Greater London CounciPs (GLC) request for single member constituencies in London still stood and he therefore proposed at;a. later stage to discuss with the Opposition whether they would support him in introducing a new Order to implement the boundary commissions&apos; recommendations for London and to deal with the constituencies which straddled the GLC boundary. But he wouldnot mention this possibility in ihis statement. The question oflegislation could be left for subsequent decision; provision would benecessary to provide for a fresh review by the Boundary Commission.The Attorney-Genera/ said that he considered that the course proposed by the Home Secretary was the best that could be devised to meet the threat arising from the application in the High court for an order of mandamus, which was due to be heard on 20 October;if such a statement were made he might even be able to securethe withdrawal of the application. As to the Home Secrctary&apos;proposal that the Orders implementing the Boundary Commissions&apos;recommendations should be voted down, his duty was to lay them. The Lord President said that the Group of Ministers under his chairmanship had met earlier that: morning and had unanimously agreed to the Home Secretary^ proposals for dealing with theParliamentary situation which now confronted the Government inconnection with the House of Commons (Redistribution of Scats)(No. 2) Bill.The Home Secretary said that, in the Debate on the Motionstabled by the Government on the consideration of the Lords&apos;amendments to (he Bill, he proposed to argue on the following lines.The proposed amendments would reactivate the Boundary Coin-missions in 1972, which was the appropriate time given the probabletimetable for legislation on local government reorganisation. TheBill, amended as proposed by the Government, would also enablethe next General Election to be fought in London on the basis ofthe constituencies proposed by the Boundary Commission and wouldprovide more adequate representation for electors in the very largestconstituencies elsewhere in the country. These were sensibleproposals which if was to be hoped the House of Lords would accept.But, if the House of Lords rejected the Bill in the form which theGovernment proposed, as had been threatened, he intended to laydraft Orders in Council implementing the recommendations of the boundary Commissions, though he would not feel able to advise theHouse to approve I hem. The resulting position would be that the lords would have rejected the Redistribution of Scats Bill and the commons would have rejected the Orders redistributing the scats,and the next General Election would therefore have to be conducted on the basis of the present Parliamentary scats.
and did not extend to ensuring that they were approved. Heinterpreted the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act,1949 to mean that four Orders would be required, one for therecommendations of each Boundary Commission.In discussion there was general approval of the course theHome Secretary proposed, which would put the Government in astrong position. Careful thought should, however, be given to the wisdom of proceeding, after the Orders had been voted down, witha new Order to deal with London and the straddling constituencies.There was now little time for the party organisations to prepare for the GLC election in April, 1970 and if the proposal were mootedit would cause great uncertainty. However it seemed that the glc would prefer to have the election on the new basis if this were possible. The best course might be not to mention the proposalnow but to consider it again at the start of the new Session and tobear in mind that, if it were to be proceeded with, this should bedone at the earliest practicable moment. On the timetable for thelocal government reorganisation, which was relevant to the government&apos;s proposed amendment to the Redistribution of SeatsBill, the Home Secretary should evade any reference to the timing of the initial White Paper and say only that the Government was working towards legislation in 1972.The Cabinet then considered the implications of the reportof the Wheatley Commission on Local Government in Scotland forthe recommendations of the Scottish Boundary Commission.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had concluded that the pattern of Parliamentary constituencies recommended bythe Boundary Commission could not be reconciled with any pattern of local government likely to emerge from consideration of theWheatley Report. He was likely to be questioned on this after he had made his statement on the Wheatley Report that afternoonbut before the Debate on the Redistribution of Seats Bill. Hisdifficulty was that the Government amendments proposed to retainin the Bill the option enabling him to implement the ScottishBoundary Commission^ proposals and he would have preferredtherefore to delay any announcement of his conclusion that he wouldnot now exercise this option.In discussion of this point, it was suggested that the ScottishSecretary should answer any questions about the implications of his statement for Parliamentary boundaries by saying that this aspectwould be covered in the ensuing Debate on the Redistribution of seats Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the course of action proposed by the HomeSecretary, namely, that he should stress the reasonableness of the redistribution of Seats Bill, amended as the Government proposedbut should also give clear warning that, if the House of Lordsrejected it, he would lay draft Orders implementing the Boundary
Commissions&apos; recommendations and advise the House not to approvethem. The possibility of introducing a Second Order to deal with london and the straddling constituencies should be kept open but should preferably not be raised at present. The Scottish secretary should agree with the Home Secretary a form of words for use inanswering any questions about the implications of the WheatleyReport for the Scottish Boundary Commission^ recommendations.The Lord Presidents Group of Ministers should meet again afterthe House of Lords had considered the Redistribution of Seats Billon Thursday, 16 October, and should make a further report to theCabinet.The Cabinet (1) Approved the course of action proposed by the HomeSecretary, subject to the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Scottish Secretary to consult with the HomeSecretary on the form of words to be used in answeringany questions arising on his statement on the report ofthe Wheatley Commission which touched on the implications for Parliamentary boundaries.(3) Invited the Lord President to arrange for his Group of Minis-ters to meet again and to report further to the Cabinet inthe light of the reaction by the House of Lords on Thurs-day, 16 October, to the Home Secretary&apos;s statement on theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill.NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 46thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet heard an oral report from the Home secretary on his recent visit to Northern Ireland; the conclusions reached wereseparately recorded and circulated only to The Queen, the PrimeMinister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.IndustrialAHairsDustmen&apos;strike(previous reference:CC(69) 47thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet were given the latest information about thestrike of dustmen and other municipal workers in London and someother towns. The position was confused; there had been a returnto work in some boroughs and elsewhere meetings were being held to discuss a return. So far there was no sign of any serious healthhazard; and it seemed unlikely that there would be any need for theGovernment to take emergency action. The strikes remainedunofficial and would, it was hoped, peter out; intervention by theGovernment would be likely only to exacerbate the situation.
The Cabinet (1) Took note of the situation.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning to arrange for the Official Committeeon Emergencies to keep the situation under close review.secret the Qucen&apos;s 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord PresidentSpeech on the (c (69) 138) to which was attached a draft of The QueeiTs Speech on opening of     tjie Opening of Parliament.parliament the Lord President said that the draft had been consideredby the Ministerial Committee on The QueeiTs Speeches; he had subsequently revised it to take account of the decisions reached in cabinet on 7 and 9 October. The revised draft ran to about 990words compared with the normal 1,000 words, so that any furtheradditions would need to be matched by deletions.In discussion a number of amendments were made to the draft,and the following main points were made (a) The reference to a possible international agreement on tariff preferences for the developing countries, at present in paragraph 21,should be incorporated in paragraph 2.(h) The possibility should be examined of including a reference in paragraph 5 to chemical as well as biological methods of warfare.(c) Paragraph 6 should refer to &quot; Nigeria and Vietnam &quot;.(d) The paragraph on Northern Ireland should include a reference to the proposed legislation; a final decision on the wording of the paragraph should be taken at the last possible moment.(e) Paragraphs 17 and 19, which referred to proposals for controlling the development of labour-only sub-contracting in theconstruction industry and for giving effect to recommendations ofthe Committee of Enquiry into Civil Transport, should stand, eventhough it might not in the end prove possible to introduce thelegislation during the Session.(/) Policy on the Atomic Energy Authority had yet to be finalisedand paragraph 24 should refer to &quot; proposals &quot;.(g) The proposals referred to in paragraph 27 for requiringlocal education authorities to prepare plans for reorganising secondary education on comprehensive lines should be brought before cabinet as soon as possible. Meanwhile the paragraph should stand; butit should not be expanded to refer to the projected White paper on the reform of the law on education.(/7) A final decision on the proposed reference to legislation for continuing certain powers of rent control (paragraph 32) could notbe taken until the policy was settled, probably later in the week.
(/) Paragraph 37, which referred to the Report of the RoyalCommission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions, should be deleted.The policy issues should be considered by the appropriate ministers and a suitable statement made during the Debate on the Address.(/) Subject to a decision yet to be taken by the Cabinet, it wouldbe appropriate to add a reference to the proposed Coal Bill.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to consider further the point raised at (b), and if appropriate to submit a revised passage to the Lord President.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the defence secretary, to submit a revised passage on Northern ireland to the Lord President.(3) Subject to (1) and (2) and to the points agreed in discussion,approved the draft Speech annexed to C (69) 138.Cabinet Office,14 October, 1969.
