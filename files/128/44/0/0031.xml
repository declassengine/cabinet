The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was explained that there was some reason to suppose that the Opposition intended to delay the passage of theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill by tablingnumerous amendments; it would not be clear, however, until after theSecond Reading on Tuesday, 8th July, whether deliberately delayingtactics were to be employed. It might become necessary to put down a Timetable Motion on Tuesday evening for debate on the following day, business for which had been selected which could be interruptedwithout damage to the Governments programme. If a TimetableMotion became necessary it would be designed to secure that thediscussion of the Bill could be completed on Monday, 14th July.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Lord President to table a Timetable motion on the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)(No. 2) Bill if, in the light of developments on SecondReading and after consultation with the ministers concerned, he considered it necessary to do so.(2) Agreed that in the meantime the Governments intentionswith regard to a Timetable Motion should not be disclosed.The Lord Privy Seal reported that the House of Lords had giventhe Divorce Law Reform Bill a Second Reading by a large majority.In consequence it would be incumbent on the Government to ensurethat adequate time was available to enable the proceedings on theBill to be completed.In connection with the Parliamentary timetable for the remainder of the Session, the question was raised whether it was intended topass legislation on shipbuilding investment grants before the Recess.The Cabinet were informed that preparatory work on the drafting ofa Bill was in progress, but that the Parliamentary timetable appearedat present to offer no possibility of securing the passage of such a Billunless Parliament was required to sit until the middle of August.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Lord Privy Seal, the chief secretary, Treasury, and other Ministers concerned with legislation before Parliament, to consider whether it wouldbe possible to proceed with legislation on shipbuildinginvestment grants during the present Session.10407A 2
SECRETPublicExpenditure,1970-71 and1971-722*. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, largely becausean adequate reserve had been provided for contingencies, the general position on public expenditure in 1969-70 was reasonably satisfactory and although strict control would still have to be maintained he wasnot proposing any cuts. While there was an element of uncertainty about any economic forecasts, recent information suggested that theprospects for the balance of payments and the economy generally werenot unpromising. There was reason to hope that we should be in balance on current account in the first half of 1969 and there were good prospects of continued improvement in the second half,accompanied by an acceleration in the growth of the domesticeconomy. Success in switching resources to the balance of payments would bring its own problems. If the current balance improved, ashe hoped, the economy would begin to show signs of strain in theearly part of next year and there would be a risk that without strongcorrective action in the Budget the surplus would soon disappear.The Government would then have to choose between threeunpalatable alternatives. They could put through a crash exerciseto cut public expenditure and so avoid increasing taxation in the1970 Budget; this would be politically damaging and would notnecessarily be effective. Alternatively they could ignore the developing pressure on resources and take no corrective action; the dangers of this course would at once be apparent to their creditorsand others and there would be a grave risk of a run on sterling.Finally, they could decide to raise around  350 million in taxation;in his view this would not be practicable, given the increases alreadyimposed in the Budgets introduced by his predecessor and himself,without the most damaging political and economic consequences.The need to choose between these three alternatives could, however,be avoided if they took decisions now which would hold back public expenditure in 1970-71 far enough to leave room for the necessaryswitch of resources into the balance of payments. If the balance ofpayments developed less satisfactorily than was assumed, they mighthave to consider a radical change of economic strategy; but thiswould be unattractive both politically and economically, and wouldin any case involve a sharp reduction in public expenditure. Theestimates of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) for1970-71 (SEP (69) 64) exceeded the target set in the White paper on public expenditure (Cmnd. 3936) by a net amount of  160 million,and he judged that to allow for a neutral Budget in 1970 they wouldhave to cut expenditure for the year by a further  240 million, makinga total of  400 million. This figure was based on the need to correct* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
an imbalance of  250 million shown in the more optimistic of thetwo &quot;basic cases&quot; set out in the report by the Medium TermAssessment Committee (SEP (69) 66). When converted fromresource to public expenditure terms, this amounted to some 350 million, and he had added a margin of  50 million to allow forthe possibility of a rather less favourable outcome.It might be possible to achieve savings of  150 million by reductions in the defence budget and in the investment programmes of nationalised industries. To secure the balance would involve anaverage reduction of a little over 2 per cent spread over the maincivil programmes. If his colleagues would co-operate by deferringsome new projects and by slowing down the growth of expenditurewherever possible, the necessary savings could in his view be made without any reversals of policy. He considered that this would inany case be the right approach to adopt in a situation where therewas no question of any public expenditure crisis but simply of making such reductions as were necessary to obviate the need for unacceptabletax increases in the last financial year of the current Parliament. he hoped that the Cabinet would endorse his general approach andauthorise him to make detailed proposals to secure the requiredsavings and to enter into bilateral discussions to that end with theMinisters concerned.In discussion it was pointed out that the level of public expenditure in 1970-71, which had been agreed only last autumn,allowed for a modest increase of 3 per cent over 1969-70. Why was this level now considered excessive? Ministers had been told thatit was because the balance of payments had not improved as rapidly as had been forecast. But this answer appeared to be inconsistent with the contention that a substantial reduction in public expenditure was now needed in order to make room for the necessary shift of resources required for future improvements in the balance ofpayments. In any event, the slow improvement in the balanceof payments since devaluation had been due to a very substantial andunforecast increase in imports. A change in economic strategy was now overdue. Direct control of imports and more extensive controlof capital outflows were now required in order to avoid theunpalatable alternatives of higher taxation or lower public expenditure. If, none the less, it were decided to maintain the existingstrategy, the appropriate level of public expenditure in 1970-71could not be decided without further information about the assumptions on which the Chancellor was working and the implications of his proposals in particular the size of the balanceof payments surplus, unemployment, economic growth and industrial
investment in 1970-71. It would be desirable to defer decisions untilthe situation could be examined in the light of the short-term economic forecast which would shortly become available. On theother hand, it was argued that the economic strategy which had been followed since devaluation was proving successful and, even if itwere desirable, it would be impossible to abandon a successful strategy for the direct controls which had been suggested. Direct controls on imports imposed when our balance of payments position was improving quite rapidly would certainly lead to retaliation against our exports, and would be inconsistent with the terms of the recentLetter of Intent to the International Monetary Fund, on which weshould continue to depend for a considerable period for financialassistance. Import controls would not avoid the need for reducingthe pressure of demand on resources by reducing public expenditureor increasing taxation on the contrary, they would increase the pressures and therefore the size of the reductions required. Thefailure of prices and incomes policy to operate as successfully on incomes as on prices had contributed substantially to the excessivedemand on resources which now had to be tackled. In deciding theextent of the reductions required in public expenditure in 1970-71,it would be necessary to form a judgment about the restraint whichcould be exercised over incomes in the future. Unless public expenditure in 1970-71 was reduced on the scale suggested by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Government would have no freedomof manoeuvre, either in next Aprifs Budget or subsequently.In further discussion, it was pointed out that the level of public expenditure and taxation as a proportion of the gross national productwas relatively low compared with that in other developed countries.While the level of taxation ought not to be significantly increased innext year&apos;s Budget, some increase would be acceptable and could be presented as an inevitable consequence of over-generous wage and salary increases. The public reaction to an increase in taxation shouldnot be exaggerated. Moreover, revenue could be raised by otherthan budgetary measures. More of the cost of services provided bythe Government could be met by increased contributions and levies;and in particular consideration should be given to the possibility of raising the employers&apos; contribution to the social security fund. If this were done, employers might be less prepared to concede extravagantwage demands and more concerned to improve labour productivity.Such an increase would also bring the level of employers&apos; contributionscloser to those pertaining in the European Economic Community(e.c.) and could therefore be regarded as a necessary adjustmentlooking to our eventual membership of the e.c.. It was difficult tosee how the Government could secure any further reductions in localauthority expenditure in 1970-71 below the level now set unlessthe Government failed to honour undertakings already given about ,
the future level of the rate support grant. Thus virtually all of thesqueeze on public expenditure would be applied to expenditure bythe central Government. The practical consequences of such asqueeze could be much more severe than had been suggested. As aresult of previous Government decisions, a great deal of public expenditure was already being postponed by local authorities and government Departments alike, and there was little scope in mostsectors for further postponement of this kind. In practice, quite smallreductions could result in insufficient funds being available to coverrevenue expenditure, for example on hospitals and schools, and resultin a lack of jobs and possibly even in closures. On the other hand,it was argued that any significant increase in taxation next Aprilcoming after a long series of previous increases would have a most damaging effect. While the possibility of raising revenue by increasingemployers&apos; contributions to the social security fund could be examined, it would directly affect industrial costs and therefore our competitive position. It was difficult to accept that in the crucialyear 1970-71 it was not possible for the Government to effectpostponement of the marginal proportions of total public expenditurerequired to solve the problem.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was grateful forthe appreciation which had been shown in the discussion of thepolitical and economic constraints which underlay his proposals. he recognised that if the balance of payments deteriorated they mightbe forced to adopt a very different and in his view unattractive-economic strategy. There could however be no question of imposingquantitative restrictions on imports at a time when the situation was improving; and there was in any case no guarantee that such restrictions would improve the balance of payments, especially in the crucial period with which they were concerned. He kept the positionof capital outflow under constant review; but it must be recognisedthat in the 12 months up to April 1969 the private, capital accounthad been in exact balance. Moreover, the imposition of furthersevere controls on the outward movement of capital would inevitably lead to a sharp reduction in the level of inward investment withadverse consequences for employment, especially in the development areas. In framing his proposals on public expenditure he had assumed that investment, which was now running at a very high level, would continue to grow. He would not expect the level of employment to change much over the rest of 1969; but if the balance of paymentsdeveloped favourably it might fall slightly during 1970. The rate of growth of the economy should improve significantly in the second half of 1969 and the improvement could be expected to continue into1970 giving a rate of growth of around 3 per cent a year. He would
consider the points which had been made in the discussion aboutgreater reliance on employers&apos; contributions as a means of financing the social services; but he saw considerable difficulties in making such a change a central feature of the 1970 Budget, and the risk ofadverse consequences on investment and exports must be borne inmind.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that public expenditure in 1970-71 must be reducedby at least  160 million below the total shown in the PESC reportin order to bring the total back into line with the figure published in February in Cmnd. 3936. The Cabinet further agreed that theChancellor of the Exchequer could now proceed in preparingdetailed proposals for further consideration by Ministers collectivelyand in his discussions with individual Ministers on the basis thatthe aim should be to secure a reduction of  400 million in public expenditure, including investment by the nationalised industries, in1970-71 below the total shown in SEP (69) 64. The Cabinet wouldtake a final decision on the size of the reduction to be made in public expenditure in 1970-71 When they had considered the implications of the specific reductions required to achieve a saving of  400 million.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that public expenditure in 1970-71 should be reducedby at least  160 million below the total shown inSEP (69) 64.(2) Invited the Chancellor the Exchequer to circulate, fordiscussion as necessary with the Ministers concerned,proposals for savings in public expenditure on the basis that the aim should be to secure a reduction in that expenditure, including investment by the nationalised industries, in 1970-71 of  400 million below the totalshown in SEP (69) 64.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the two main aspects of recent developments in Nigeria were relationsbetween the Federal Military Government (FMG) and the reliefagencies, and the problem of getting food and medical supplies intothe rebel-held areas. As regards the first point, the FMG had recently announced that they would be taking over the co-ordinating function in regard to the distribution of relief supplies which had hitherto been performed by the International Committee of the Red Cross
10407b(ICRC). The FMG&apos;s action was in accordance with the geneva convention; but the decision had in fact arisen as a result of difficultiesbetween themselves and the ICRC. According to the SwissAmbassador in Lagos, the ICRC had been tactless in their handling of the FMG, and had failed to keep in adequate touch with them.The FMG had held a conference with the relief organisations atwhich all of them, with the exception of the ICRC, had expressed their readiness to co-operate in the proposed new arrangements. TheICRC representative, M. Marcel Naville, had merely said that he hadno mandate to do so. In their statement on their proposals the nigerian Government, though they had criticised the ICRCs allegedinvolvement in politics, had praised the work it had done and expressed the hope that a phased and orderly hand-over would bepossible. M. Naville, however, in an intemperate public statement,had threatened an immediate cessation of ICRC operations. In thesecircumstances the ICRC in Geneva had appealed to us to help themto extricate themselves from the difficult situation in which the actions of their local representative had placed them; and the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Mr. Maurice Foley, had visited Geneva with an official from theForeign and Commonwealth Office. A senior official from the headquarters of the ICRC in Geneva would shortly be visiting Lagos.It seemed likely that the difficulties over relief activities in Federalterritory would be resolved; but this did not dispose of the secondmajor problem, of the delivery of food and medical supplies intorebel-held territory. The FMG had agreed to deliveries through theso-called &quot; mercy corridors &quot;. They had also agreed to daylightflights, provided that the aircraft landed, and were inspected, inFederal territory. This seemed a reasonable proviso and wasmoreover in accordance with the Geneva Convention. We had urged the Nigerian Government to adopt a flexible attitude and to ensurethat inspection would not entail long delays. We had also encouragedthem to consider the United States project for ferrying supplies via the Cross River, to which they were at present objecting for reasons of &quot; security &quot; which they had so far failed to specify. Concurrently,the Pope had suggested that relief supplies should be flown directinto rebel-held territory from Rome, and that cargoes should beinspected by Vatican officials there. Reports so far received on the nigerian response to this proposal were conflicting. As regards nightflights, the difficulty was that Colonel Ojukwu was still insisting onnight flights to the exclusion of day flights (the air strip at Uli towhich relief aircraft operated was in fact being rendered unusableby day) as he wanted relief flights to act as cover for deliveries ofarms, and to force the FMG into the dilemma of either tolerating
arms flights or running the risk of shooting down relief aircraft. the swiss Ambassador had said that he thought that if the relieforganisations built up a stock of supplies at Federal airports, itwould be difficult for Colonel Ojukwu to resist pressure for theirdelivery. It was clearly urgent to reach a solution on relief flightswhich would be acceptable to all parties; but the fact remained thatthe most effective method of delivery was by land.In conclusion, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary saidthat in view of the strong interest in the matter expressed in theHouse of Commons he thought it would be right for him to make astatement on Monday, 7th July, even though there would be a debate on the following Thursday. It would be helpful if the Lord Presidentwere to mention this in his statement to the House on parliamentary business. The Nigerian question was also likely to be raised at themeeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party to be held that evening,though he did not intend at that meeting to anticipate his statement to the House.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In addition to the proposals for inspection mentioned above,consideration might be given to the possibility that the inspectionprocedures might be carried out in Federal territory, but by nationals of a neutral country such as Canada.(b) The possibility of sending Lord Hunt out again to Nigeriashould be borne in mind. Meanwhile, the Cabinet noted that the newHigh Commissioner, Sir Leslie Glass, had now taken up post.(c) At the time of the Prime Minister^ visit to Nigeria inApril 1969 our own military experts had discounted the likelihood ofan early military victory for the Federal Government. On the otherhand the fact that guerilla activity in the areas already reconqueredhad been minimal was an encouraging sign, in that it suggested thatclandestine resistance was unlikely to continue on any scale if Federalmilitary control could be extended over the remainder of the areastill in rebel hands.(d) The public relations effort of the rebel regime, in contrast tothat of the Federal Government, had been both skilful and effective.The Federal Government had failed to exploit the lasting resentmentthe rebels had caused by their treatment of the inhabitants of theeastern and southern areas from which they had now been expelled,or the fact that large numbers of Ibos were now living peacefullyunder Federal rule. So far as our own information activities were concerned, more could be done to publicise the achievements ofBritish youth services in Nigeria.
(e) Swedish public opinion had been strongly pro-&quot; Biafran &quot;.It would be useful if advantage could be taken of the Prime Minister^forthcoming visit to Stockholm to inform the Swedish Governmentof the realities of the situation. It might be possible to induce theSwedish Prime Minister, Herr Erlander, to associate himself withsome form of joint statement.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toprepare a draft for a joint Anglo-Swedish statement onNigeria, suitable for issue, if the Swedish Prime minister agreed to this, on the occasion of the Prime Minister^visit to Sweden.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd July, 1969.
