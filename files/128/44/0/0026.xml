The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that attheir meeting on 22nd May the Cabinet had approved in principlehis proposal to dynamise the graduated pensions from 1972 onwards,and had invited Ministers responsible for public sector pension schemes to discuss the proposal urgently with representatives of thestaff concerned, with a view to a statement of the governments intention in this matter being made at the time of publication of theBill. The Ministerial Committee on Social Services had met that morning to consider the results of the consultations with staffinterests, and had agreed that, though the promise of dynamismwould present considerable difficulties in the case of the power andtransport industries, the difficulties were not so serious as to requireeither reconsideration of the decision to dynamise or postponement of the announcement of the Governments intention. He therefore proposed to publish the Bill on Tuesday, 10th June, and to make astatement the same day. It was planned to take Second Reading on18th June and to complete consideration in Standing Committee intime to take the remaining stages in the week beginning 7th July.In discussion some doubt was expressed as to whether thistimetable would enable the House of Lords to complete considerationof the Bill before the summer recess. But it was essential to economise in time on the floor of the House of Commons, the more so if there was to be a Bill arising from the reports of the boundary commission.The Cabinet-industrial disputes:Strike atHer Majesty&apos;sStationeryOfficeWarehouse(previous reference:CC(69) 24thConclusions,Minute 1)Agreed that the National Insurance (No. 2) Bill should bepublished on 10th June and that a statement of theGovernments intention to dynamise&quot; graduated pensions should be made on the same day.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, reported that the strike in H.M.Stationery Office distribution warehouse had been settled that morning by direct negotiation.10389
IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelationsBill(previous reference:CC (69) 24thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet to which was attached the text of a statement issued bythe Department of Employment and Productivity on 5th June,together with a letter which the First Secretary of State had sent tothe Acting General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC),Mr. Victor Feather, on 3rd June (circulated to the Cabinet as c (69) 62).The Prime Minister said that he and the First Secretary had net the  General Council of the TUC that morning. The atmospherehad been friendly and it seemed clear that the members of theGeneral Council, who reported on the outcome of the SpecialCongress held at Croydon on 5th June, did not want to come intoconflict with the Government. The gap between the Governmentand the TUC was, however, wide. The tuc&apos;s proposals for dealingwith inter-union disputes were on the whole satisfactory; their proposals for dealing with unconstitutional stoppages involvingdisputes with employers were not, however, adequate. He had suggested to the General Council that, after he had reported the outcome of the meeting to the Cabinet, they should have furtherintensive consultations to see whether by strengthening their proposals or in some other way the TUC could satisfy theGovernment that they would be able to deal effectively with theproblem of unconstitutional stoppages. It was very important thatif all at possible the Government and the TUC should reach agreement on these matters and it was essential, while efforts to thisend were being made, to avoid any impression of divided counselswithin the Cabinet. He had made it clear to the General Council thatthe Government would be prepared to continue their consultations with the TUC up to and beyond the introduction of the interimBill on industrial relations; and that it would be possible to amendor repeal provisions of the interim Bill during the passage of thesecond Industrial Relations Bill which it was proposed to introduce in the next Parliamentary session. If at the end of the day the TUCrejected their proposals, the Governments duty would in his view be clear. But he would not ask the Cabinet to take any decisions atthis stage.In discussion, tribute was paid to the substantial progress whichhad been made as a result of the negotiations which had been conducted by the Prime Minister and the First Secretary of state with the TUC. The effectiveness of the proposed TUC arrangements must be compared very carefully with the likely effectiveness of theGovernments own proposals for statutory provisions. TheGovernment must not throw away the substance of effective
CC26(69)arrangements for their shadow. Every effort should continue to bemade to persuade the TUC to improve their proposals for dealingwith unconstitutional strikes. The General Council would not havethe necessary powers formally to make substantive changes before this autumn&apos;s Congress, but an undertaking by the Council to request such changes from Congress should be accepted. If in theend the TUC refused to offer any improvements, the Governmentwould have to decide whether the reforms now proposed were adequate to enable the &quot; penal clauses &quot; to be dropped, at least forthe time being. In this connection it would be helpful to have a considered assessment of the likely effect of the numerous changes which the TUC had agreed to introduce since the publication of theWhite Paper &quot; In Place of Strife &quot; (Cmnd. 3888) in January 1969.If the TUC arrangements proved in practice ineffective, then theGovernment could introduce statutory provisions later. the government&apos;s position would be fully defensible if they decided to drop the &quot; penal clauses &quot; now. They would have done so becausethe trade union movement had itself been spurred to make thenecessary reforms. It would, however, be very difficult for theGovernment to defend their position if they decided to proceed now with the &quot; penal clauses &quot;; if in consequence the TUC abandonedtheir own arrangements, as they had repeatedly threatened; and then the legislation proved ineffective.On the other hand, it was argued that the present TUC proposals were unsatisfactory in themselves and because of the motivesunderlying their adoption by some prominent trade union leaders.The weakness in the present proposals was the difference betweenthe treatment of inter-union disputes, which was satisfactory, andof unconstitutional stoppages involving disputes with employers.The First Secretary of State had pointed out this difference in herletter of 3rd June to the Acting General Secretary of the TUC.Where an inter-union dispute led to a stoppage of work, there wouldbe an obligation on the unions concerned to obtain a resumption ofwork. Where an unconstitutional strike occurred as a result of a dispute with an employer, on the other hand, the unions concerned would be required only to satisfy the TUC that they had done allthat could be reasonably expected to secure compliance with a TUCrecommendation or award. This difference in treatment wasdeliberate. The major unions were prepared to surrender sovereigntyto the TUC to the extent required to settle inter-union disputes, butnot unconstitutional strikes arising from disputes with employers.Some union leaders regarded the latter as a necessary part of theirarmoury, and had only supported the proposals for dealing with
them-in paragraph 42 of the TUC report &quot; Programme for Action &quot; as a tactical manoeuvre to end the threat of the &quot; penal clauses &quot;.Thus there was good reason to believe that the TUC could andwould deal effectively with inter-union disputes, but it remainedextremely doubtful whether they had the will or, the means to dealwith other unconstitutional disputes. The TUC considered that their role in unconstitutional disputes with employers was as much to conciliate between the men and employers concerned as to secure an immediate resumption of work. Hitherto the TUC had refusedto give a clear and final answer to suggestions that they should impose the same obligations and sanctions in the case of unconstitutional strikes as in inter-union disputes. If at the end of the day the TUCrefused to treat both types of dispute similarly, the Governmentcould hardly accept the tuc&apos;s proposals as a satisfactory substitute for the &quot; penal clauses &quot;. The TUC had been informed that ifparagraph 42 of &quot; Programme for Action &quot; were strengthened to dealadequately with unconstitutional strikes, the Government woulddrop the &quot; penal clauses&quot;. They had also been told that theGovernment recognised some validity in the criticism that theGovernment were only proposing to take power to enforce a returnto the status quo which existed before a dispute after that disputehad begun.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that no decisions were required at this meeting. The crucial question was whether the TUC would be prepared to strengthen their procedures for dealing with unconstitutional strikes as set out in paragraph 42of &quot; Programme for Action &quot;. It might prove possible to work outvarious means of improving these procedures, including for exampleproviding statutory backing of some kind for the tuc&apos;s own arrangements. These possibilities must be urgently examined withthe TUC. It did not appear that it would be helpful to reintroduceStatutory Instrument 1376, to which reference was made inparagraph 32 of &quot; Programme for Action &quot;, but the First Secretaryof State should circulate a brief memorandum to the Cabinet about this. If they could reach agreement with the TUC on acceptablealternatives, then the &quot; penal clauses &quot; could be dropped. It wouldbe too optimistic to suggest that this was at present a real possibility.Another approach would be to include the &quot; penal clauses&quot; in the interim Bill but provide that they could not be invoked until after a stated period had elapsed. This would enable discussions between the Government and the TUC about satisfactoryalternatives to continue over a longer period. But the TUC were wholly opposed to the inclusion of the &quot; penal clauses &quot; in legislation in any form. He sincerely hoped that it would prove possible toavoid a direct confrontation with the TUC on these issues, but this
OverseaAffairsWesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC (69) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therecent Meeting of the Council of the Western European Union(WEU) at The Hague had not been attended by the French. Allother member States, with the exception of Italy, had been represented by their Foreign Ministers. There had been a majordiscussion on political collaboration in Europe, during which theGerman, Dutch and Italian representatives had all strongly supported our early entry into the European Economic Community(e.c.). The German Foreign Minister had proposed a summit meeting of the e.c. countries plus the United Kingdom later thisyear. This would be welcome to us on the assumption that it waspreceded by an agreement to open negotiations on our applicationto join the e.c.. The subject of Greece had been discussed inrestricted session. It had been agreed that all WEU memberspresent should individually make representations to the GreekGovernment pointing out the risk that Greece, if she continued her present policies, might be expelled from the Council of Europe by december or earlier. The arrangements for these representationswould be concerted by our permanent WEU representatives so thatthe Greek Government should be in no doubt that they originatedfrom a collective decision of all WEU countries except France.The decision reached in this matter reflected one of the benefits ofFrench absence since the French, had they been represented, wouldin all probability have vetoed any such proposal.There had also been some discussion on Rhodesia, duringwhich the other WEU representatives had agreed with our viewson the importance of maintaining sanctions after the proposeddepended on the outcome of the further talks which had beenarranged with them. A decision could not be delayed for very much longer, but it would be possible to postpone the introduction of theBill for a few more days in the hope of being able to reach asatisfactory conclusion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate amemorandum to the Cabinet about the possiblereintroduction of Statutory Instrument No. 1376 of1951.
referendum, and of not according recognition to the regime. Ingeneral we had obtained a more sympathetic hearing than previouslyfor our views on Rhodesia. Throughout the meeting the Dutch hadbeen particularly helpful despite the difficulties we were currentlygoing through with them over, for example, our cheese and butterimports and civil aviation. Dutch support was important to us inEurope. It would be a pity if the troubles to which he had referredwere allowed to spoil the atmosphere; and he might have to ask theCabinet in the near future to consider the whole subject of anglo-Dutch relations.In a brief discussion of the Greek problem, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary said he would like to consider further thepossible advantages and disadvantages of publicising our representations^ taking into account on the one hand the beneficial effect of such publicity at home and on the other the possible effecton the Greek Government^ attitude.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toconsider the advisability of making a public statement onrepresentations . by WEU members to the GreekGovernment.
CentrifugeCollaboration(previous reference:CC (69) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the tripartite Meeting being held that day in Bonn, at which the Ministerof Technology and the Minister of State, Foreign and commonwealth office (Mr. Mulley), were our representatives, was expected to resolvemost of the outstanding points of difference between us and ourDutch, and German partners, and to clear the way for the signature of an Agreement. There was, however, an outstanding problembetween ourselves and the United States Government in regard tothe release of information restricted under the Anglo-United StatesAtomic Energy Agreement. This problem was still under discussion between HM Ambassador and the United States Secretary of state on the political level and between Sir Solly Zuckerman and theUnited States Atomic Energy Commission at the technical level. Itwas impossible yet to forecast the outcome; but the possibility of difficulties with the United States on this point could not be discounted, and the Cabinet would be kept informed. meanwhile the Nuclear Policy Committee would keep the matter under review.The Cabinet (5) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(6) Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear policy would consider further the Anglo-United Statesdiscussions on restricted centrifuge information, and thatthe Cabinet would be kept informed of any major development.10389
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (69) 24thConclusions,Minute 4)ParliamentReport ofthe RoyalCommissionon LocalGovernmentin EnglandCONFIDENTIAL5. The Minister without Portfolio said that, in view of thesettlement of the strike in HM Stationery Office warehouse, theReport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England(the Redcliffe-Maud Report) would receive reasonably normaldistribution, although some delay might occur. The ministerial committee on Local Government Reorganisation had met that morning and reached agreement on the terms of a statement whichthe Prime Minister proposed to make on Wednesday, 11th June.The statement accepted the main principles behind the RoyalCommission^ central recommendations the reduction in the number4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (C (69) 61.) on Rhodesia.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wishedto draw the attention of his colleagues to the conclusions reached bythe Ministerial Group on Rhodesia as set out in Annex A to C (69) 61.Though it would clearly not be possible to reach a final decision on several of the conclusions until after the Rhodesian regime had heldtheir referendum, he wished to secure his colleagues&apos; approval of theconclusions. With regard to the public speech on Rhodesia whichhe would be making on 10th June and which was referred to inparagraphs 4 and 5 of C (69) 61, the text he had proposed for inclusion in it which was given in Annex B of the paper had been drafted with the intention of being as helpful as we properly could to the Rhodesian Centre Party. While he realised that a statement on these lines might expose us to the risk of a further rebuff fromthe regime, especially if as seemed likely the referendum wentdecisively in favour of Mr. Smith and his colleagues, it was importantparticularly from the point of view of opinion in this country to demonstrate that we had not been unreasonable and that we had notneglected any possibility of securing a settlement. It had also to beborne in mind that the Governor of Rhodesia had strongly advocatedthat a statement in this sense should be made.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the conclusions reached by the ministerial group, which should arrange for their detailed implementation.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
of local government units and thie-temoval of the distinction betweenurban and rural authorities. Its purpose was to strike the key-notefor the consultation^ which would now be initiated.In discussion it was suggested that the reorganisation of localgovernment areas, which would necessitate a great deal of work andbe likely to draw on the Government much complaint from local interests, was not worth undertaking unless they believed that thequality of local government would be improved as a result. Theproposed statement would not, however, prejudice the considerationof the Report in the light of consultations with the local authorities.Consultations would no doubt be concerned with, among other things, means of raising local revenue so as to lessen the dependence of the new and larger units on the central government; the meansof achieving greater decentralisation from central government tothe new authorities, and the problem of paying at least those membersof the authorities who carried the greatest responsibility.In the meantime it was important that Ministers who had accepted invitations to address meetings of local authorities in thenear future should say as little as possible about the Report andfollow closely the lines of the Prime Ministers statement. Theyshould clear with the Minister without Portfolio the text of anyspeech which they proposed to make.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister without portfolio.(2) Invited the Ministers intending to make speeches in a localgovernment context in the near future to show the draft to the Minister without Portfolio.Cabinet Office, SWA,10th June, 1969.
