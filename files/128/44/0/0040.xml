Broadcasting(previous reference :CC (69) 34thConclusions,Minute 1)CC (40) 69SECRET1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (69) 103) and the Postmaster-General (C (69) 99)on Broadcasting and BBC Radio Finance. They also had beforethem the papers considered by the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting (circulated with C (69) 101).The Lord President said that the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting had considered four matters: the future of the nationalradio services; local sound radio; hours of television broadcasting,and finance. As to the first of these, the plan put forward by theBritish Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) &quot; Broadcasting in theSeventies &quot; proposed to reorganise radio services on a generic basis with one programme devoted to popular music (pop), one to lightmusic, one to serious music and drama and one to speech; Radio 3 the serious music and drama programme would be broadcast onlyon VHF, which only about one-third of listeners could receive. Atthe same time the BBC were proposing to reduce sharply the numberof their orchestras, which they claimed to be substantially in excessof their requirements; this feature of the proposals had been widelycondemned, but it was estimated to save over  5 million by 1974 andthe BBCs plan was not viable without this economy. On localsound radio the BBC had proposed a string of 40 stations in England,with local broadcasting councils to ensure that local opinion was notoverlooked; these stations would cost about  16 million over theperiod to 1974, but the BBC were in no position to find the money.The Committee agreed with the BBC and the Postmaster-general that the present eight local radio stations had been a success and thata permanent system of local broadcasting should be established onthe lines proposed by the BBC, though with three of the 40 stationslocated in Scotland and three in Wales; it was important to establishlocal radio as a public service before the Election, and in theCommittee&apos;s view it would be right to increase the licence fee fromthe beginning of next year to pay for it. If the fee were increasedby 10s. this should provide enough money over the period to March,1974, to pay for the development of local radio and reprieve theorchestras, and also allow for some limited extension of television broadcasting hours. At the same time the sound radio licence mightbe abolished; it produced only about  3 million a year, was expensiveto collect and evasion was almost impossible to check. Such achange would reduce the burden on the poorest section of thecommunity.On hours of television broadcasting, the majority of the ministerial Committee on Broadcasting favoured a limited extensionon the lines proposed in the Report by Professor Wedell and Mr. Brian10639A 2
Blake. His own view was that it might be better to stand on theposition enunciated in paragraph 47 of the 1966 White Paper and allow no extension at all, but he was content to accept the view ofthe majority. The main questions for decision, however, werewhether the Cabinet approved the proposals for local sound radio and for an increase of 10s. in the combined licence fee from thebeginning of 1970, coupled with abolishing the sound licence. If thesetwo proposals were approved, the Postmaster-General might beauthorised to tell the BBC in confidence that they could go ahead with the development of local radio.The Postmaster-General said that an early decision on localsound radio was essential if substantial progress was to be made insetting up a chain of stations before the general election; if suchprogress were not made, commercial radio would undoubtedly bean election issue. He himself believed that the experiment had been justified by the results, and this was also the view of the Membersof Parliament concerned; the stations had improved the sense of local community. He was convinced that commercial local broadcastingwould mean a lowering of standards, but if this were to be avoidedthey had to find the necessary money from other sources and inpractice this meant the licence fee. If the combined licence fee were increased by 10s. from the beginning of next year and the soundlicence fee abolished at the same time, this would yield additional revenue (including savings of administrative costs) of about 27^ million over the period to March 1974; and this would be enough to cover the proposed local radio services ( 16 million),reprieve the orchestras ( 5 million), and after allowing for extra costsleave  4 million to finance a limited extension of hours. The BBCestimated the cost of the proposed extension of hours at  10 million over the four years rather than  4 million, but he believed that thecost could be kept down by use of less expensive programmes, andthat it was in any case desirable to keep the BBC under pressure to economise; the difference between their estimates and his was hardlysignificant in terms of an income of  400 million over the four years.Taken as a whole this group of proposals would in his view be popularwith both broadcasters and the public, and would make it difficult for the Conservative Party, if returned to power, to implement their proposals for local commercial radio.In discussion there was agreement that transmission of theserious music programme on Radio 3 should not at this stage be restricted to VHF, which could only be received by one-third oflisteners, even though in the longer run such a restriction might bedesirable. It was understood that it was technically possible to retain the transmission on medium wave, and that the BBC were considering this.
CC (40) 69On the proposal to cut the orchestras, varying views were expressed. It was argued that the BBC could not be expected toretain orchestras for which they had no use and should not be urged to yield to pressure from the Musicians&apos; Union; if there was a case for retaining so many orchestras and an inquiry might be desirableto ascertain this assistance should be given through the arts council. But the general feeling was that the BBC had a duty ofpatronage, and that some at least of the orchestras should be saved;the decision was however for the BBC to take, and it might not beto the Governmenfs advantage to be seen to share the responsibility.On hours of television broadcasting, there was some support forthe view that restrictions on hours of broadcasting were outmodedand inconsistent with the independence of the BBC and theIndependent Television Authority; and it was argued that anextension of hours would give more scope for creative talent and enable programmes to be produced for the benefit of housewives,shift workers and others at home during the daytime. But most members of the Cabinet considered that there was little demand forany extension of hours and that its financial consequences would be embarrassing. If, to save money, programmes were restricted torepeats and other low-cost programmes, the extension would not provide more opportunity for the production of serious programmes.It was however the future of local sound radio which was thecentral issue, as it was also the most expensive part of the proposals.The point was made that with a chain of only 40 stations the areascovered by each would be too large for them to be genuinely local,and that it would be preferable to have stations that were locallyowned and locally financed. In the event of a change of Government,locally owned stations would be much more difficult to sweep awaythan a chain of BBC stations which would not have had time tobecome properly established. On the other hand it was pointed outthat the local stations&apos; areas would not be so very different in sizefrom the local government areas proposed by the Royal Commissionon Local Government; and that these local stations should be ableto play an important role in strengthening the sense of local community and participation. Most of those present agreed that the experimental stations had been a success and that the proposals fora chain of BBC stations were worthy of approval. It was certainly not possible to preserve the status quo, for the experiment would shortly collapse, but the pace of advance must depend on what money was available.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the question offinance. There were only two ways in which extra money could befound: accepting advertisements and raising the licence fee.   The
time might be coming for a reappraisal of the pros and cons of advertising; some of the arguments used against it now lookedthreadbare, and it was difficult to see how the quality of programmessuch as BBC 1 could be damaged by allowing advertisements. Butto raise the issue now would cause a storm in the Labour Party, andadvertising therefore provided no answer to the present problem; itwas thus an increase in the licence fee or nothing.There was considerable support for the view that the public would accept an increased licence fee as providing value for money,particularly when accompanied by abolition of the sound licence.But most members of the Cabinet considered that it would be politically damaging to increase the licence fee again next year, andthat plans should be made on the basis that there would be no increase before 1971. It was the balance of income and expenditure over the next two years, rather than the next four, which mattered;and the BBC might feel able to run a limited deficit in the next twoyears in anticipation of an increase in 1971 or 1972, although thiswould have the disadvantage of adding to public expenditure. the bbc should be encouraged to review their plans on this basis andthen go ahead with the development of local sound radio as fast asthey felt able.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet were against any increase in broadcasting hours. They considered that a further increase in the licence feenext year would be resented by the electorate and exploited by theOpposition, but the BBC should be given the prospect of an increasein 1971 or 1972. The Postmaster-General should negotiate with the bbc on this basis, without commitment. He should invite them toconsider what progress could .be made with local sound radio; and make it clear that the Government expected at least the majority ofthe orchestras to be reprieved and that Radio 3 transmissions shouldnot be confined to VHF. As a first step he should prepare and circulate to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the members of the ministerial Committee on Broadcasting and the Prime Minister amemorandum setting out revised proposals covering the next twoyears, giving estimates of costs and income.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to prepare revised proposalsfor the next two years in the light of their discussion andto circulate these to the Prime Minister, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and members of the ministerial committee on Broadcasting.
CC (40) 69CONFIDENTIALPrices and 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ChancellorIncomes Policy of the Exchequer (C (69) 100) on consultation with Local AuthorityIt Local0ntr0i Associations and tne Greater London Council about the future controlAuthority Rent of local authority rent increases.increases the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Future PolicySub-Committee of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomeshad considered the effects of the present statutory powers, which had operated since mid-1968 and would lapse at the end of 1969. Thepowers had been used to hold rent increases for local authoritydwellings in any twelve-month period to an average of 7s. 6d. aweek and a maximum of 10s. for any one dwelling, and to permitan increase within these limits only where otherwise a larger than usual rate fund contribution would have been required. The effecthad been to keep the average rent increase in England and Wales toIs. lOd. a week (as compared with 3s. Id. and 4s. in the two precedingyears) and in Scotland to 2s. 4d. a week (as compared with 8d. andIs. lid.). This restriction had been achieved mainly by running down the housing balances; restriction in future would mean an increasein rates, with a consequent rise in public expenditure at a time whenthe Government were trying to limit it.In view of the likely conflict between rent increases and charges for rates, there had been consultation with Transport House and theParliamentary Labour Party about the possibility of extending thepresent statutory powers. This had led to no decisive support either for extending the powers or for a voluntary system to replace them.However, since the Housing Ministers were agreed that a voluntary system was preferable, a majority of the members of the future policy Sub-Committee had agreed to recommend an attempt tosecure a voluntary system, under which in any twelve month periodno local authority would make a rent increase above the currentceiling figures; this&apos; would be supported by statutory powers in reserve, permitting Government control of rent increases above the ceiling, to be brought into effect by Ministerial direction if the voluntary agreement were broken. The proposal was thatconsultations should take place with the Local Authority associations and the Greater London Council (GLC) to see if they would agreeto a voluntary system on these lines, with a view to a final decision by Ministers later in the year.In discussion, it was argued that the ceiling figures proposed were too high. Conservative-controlled local authorities, like the glc, would make year by year increases at the maximum allowed,and on the basis proposed there would be no Governmentexamination (as there was at present) of the justification for an
increase which was below the ceiling. The hostile reaction of manytenants to the current GLC programme of rent increases, and the trouble which seemed likely to follow from their refusal to pay thehigher amounts, illustrated what would happen more widely. For a voluntary system on the lines proposed, the ceiling figures should beno more than 6s. a week average and 7s. 6d. for any one dwelling.On the other hand it was argued that lower figures could not be negotiated with the Local Authority Associations for use in a voluntary system, since a rise in rates would be required to offset thedifference.In further discussion, it was emphasised that the reserve statutory powers accompanying a voluntary system would provide forGovernmental control only over increases above the ceiling, but thatif the proposed voluntary system were rejected, the Governmentwould be free to consider a compulsory system on the lines of thepresent arrangements, with an examination of all rent increases proposed by local authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Local Authority Associations and the GLCshould be consulted about the possibility of a voluntary system ofcontrol on local authority rent increases after the end of 1969, to be accompanied by statutory powers in reserve, as proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer, with a ceiling in any twelve-month period of 7s. 6d. a week average and 10s. for any one dwelling. the outcome of these consultations should be reported back so that, ifa voluntary system on these lines was not likely to emerge, the cabinet could consider afresh what statutory powers the Government shouldtake.The Cabinet Invited the Minister for Planning and Land, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretaryof State for Wales, to arrange for consultation with theLocal Authority Associations and the Greater london council, on the lines proposed in paragraphs 13 and 14 ofC (69) 100, and to report on the outcome.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.31st July, 1969.
