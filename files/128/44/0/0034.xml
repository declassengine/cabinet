ParliamentaryAffairsFill ureBusinessHouse ofCommons(redistribution of Seals)(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1)Broadcasting(previous reference:CC (66) 65thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Consideration ofany Lords amendments received would take place on Thursday,24th July, and be continued on Friday, 25th, and Monday, 28th July.The Lord President would not announce the date of the recess, but would say that he hoped to make an announcement next week. Thiswould enable the Government to keep a decision open until afterthe debate in the House of Lords on the Committee Stage of theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill.The Prime Minister said that a group of Ministers concerned withthe progress of the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)(No. 2) Bill were meeting under his chairmanship. They were notyet in a position to make a statement to the Cabinet because some ofthe complicated issues which arose needed to be explored further;but they intended to meet again on 21st July and hoped to report tothe Cabinet on 22nd July.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.The Lord President said that there would be pressure on thePostmaster-General during the debate on Tuesday to state theGovernments policy on the plan published by the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC) &quot; Broadcasting in the Seventies &quot;,the more so since a statement on local radio has been promisedbefore the end of July. The Ministerial Committee on Broadcastinghad now reached provisional conclusions on the main issues beforethem, but there had been no time to bring the matter before theCabinet. They approved the BBCs proposal for a chain of 40 local stations, subject to adequate provision being made for Scotland andWales. They agreed that there was a case for some relaxation of therestrictions on hours of television transmission. But these proposals could not be implemented without more revenue and to provide this they agreed to an increase in the combined annual television andradio licence fee from  6 to  6 10s. Od. from the beginning of nextyear. It was proposed at the same time to abolish the separatesound radio licence fee, which was expensive to collect and almost impossible to enforce, and to intensify the campaign againstevasion by users of television sets. The increase in the combinedlicence fee would provide a margin which would make it possibleto dispense with some of the more painful economies proposed bythe BBC. The proposals formed a package which must be announcedas a whole if it was to make the right impact.
In discussion, opinion differed on the wisdom of making astatement of Government policy during the debate. It was arguedon the one hand that if the Postmaster-General could not give any indication of Government policy he would be unable to counter theOpposition case effectively, and that little credit would be gained bya belated statement of policy, however soundly based. Moreoveran early decision was essential if real progress was to be made withbuilding a chain of local stations before the end of the present parliament. On the other hand it was argued that the Governmentshould not be stampeded into a premature decision by theOpposition^ choice of a subject for debate, and that the issues involved were of such political importance as to warrant full consideration by the Cabinet. More thought should be given to thepossibility of allowing a measure of advertising as an alternative toraising the licence fee, and the possibility of further administrative economies in the BBC should be explored. The BBCs plan had only very recently been published and the Government could reasonablysay that they were still considering it.In further discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in the Postmaster-General discussing the arguments forand against various possible courses of action, but the general feeling was that it would be unwise to go beyond stating the points forconsideration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould endeavour to arrange for the subject to be fully consideredby the Cabinet before the Recess on the basis of papers circulated for that purpose. In the debate on Tuesday the Postmaster-general should merely say that the various issues raised by the BBCs planwere still under consideration, and should give no indication of the likely outcome; his most effective line might be to concentrate onattacking the broadcasting policy of the Opposition, and those whoadvocated it. It was important that no reports should appear in thePress attributing views to individual members of the Government.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, and invited the Postmaster-general to be guided by it in replying to the debate.(3) Invited the Lord President to submit a memorandumreporting on the discussions in the Ministerial Committeeon Broadcasting, and to arrange for papers consideredby that Committee to be circulated to the Cabinet.
public expenditure,1970-71(previous reference:CC(69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5)CC 34 (69)secret* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer about public expenditure in 1970-71 (C (69) 82).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at their meeting on 3rd July (CC (69) 31st Conclusions, Minute 2), the Cabinet had agreed that public expenditure in 1970-71 should be reduced by atleast  160 million below the level shown in the report by the public expenditure Committee (PESO; and that the aim should be tosecure a reduction of  400 million in public sector expenditure,including investment by the nationalised industries. A reductionof  400 million in public sector expenditure would reduce demand by about  300 million, and was needed in order to make possible a neutral budget in 1970. In bilateral discussions with Ministers of spending Departments he had reached provisional agreement by14th July on reductions totalling about  215 million, as shown inC (69) 82. He considered it practicable to add a saving of about 75 million on nationalised industries&apos; investment, making a totalof about  290 million, which would be equivalent to a reduction in public sector demand of about  240 million, or 80 per cent of the 300 million required. Since 14th July, additional provisional savings of about  20 million had been identified in further discussions, buton the other hand it now seemed that it would not be possible toensure the reduction of  5 million in current spending on roads bylocal authorities which had previously been included. The currentposition, shown in a revised Table II to C (69) 82 which he would now circulate, was that provisional agreement had been reached onreducing public expenditure in 1970-71 by between  232 million and  244 million; and he had further bilateral discussions tocomplete. He proposed that they should now consider the specificreductions proposed in the revised Table II. In the following week,they might consider the bids for increases shown in Table II, as wellas the size of the nationalised industries&apos; investment programme.Final decisions could then be taken for 1970-71. Officials might beasked to prepare the necessary papers so that decisions about1971-72 could be taken in September, in time for the promisedWhite Paper on Public Expenditure.The Prime Minister said that they should now consider the reductions proposed in column 3 of the revised Table II. If theCabinet agreed the reductions there proposed, it would be on a provisional basis and subject to final decisions on their economic strategy for 1970-71, which they should aim to take in the following week.
DefenceBudgetOverseas aid and OtherOverseasServicesRoads andPublicLighting, andTransportThe Secretary of State for Defence said that he had agreed to areduction of  75 million in the defence budget, subject to hisconfirming one point to the Chancellor within the next week or so.In addition, he had agreed to absorb  25 million of extra costs,including those of improved service pay, which would normally havebeen regarded as a price change and would not increase the constant price defence budget for 1970-71. The reductions had been secured by spreading out and postponing present programmes; further major policy changes could not be contemplated.The Cabinet (1) Approved, on the provisional basis indicated by the PrimeMinister, a reduction of  75 million in the defence budget for 1970-71.The Minister of Overseas Development said that although hewas not being asked for a direct reduction he wished to point outthat, unlike other programmes, the overseas aid programme was fixed at current prices and, as a result of cost increases, theprogramme in 1970-71 would in fact be reduced by about 2-6 percent, i.e., about  6 million.The Cabinet (2) Provisionally approved a reduction of  2 million in expenditure in 1970-71 on other overseas services.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after consultationwith the Minister of Housing and Local Government, he accepted that it would not be possible to ensure that local authorities would reduce current expenditure on roads by  5 million in 1970-71,although every possible pressure would be applied to persuade themto do so. In the circumstances this amount could not be includedin the total of firm reductions shown in column 3 of the revisedTable II.The Minister of Transport said that provision for transport asa whole in 1970-71 would be inadequate if the Cabinet continuedto look separately at the various elements of this provision roads,infrastructure programme, and investment by nationalised transport industries.The Cabinet (3) Provisionally approved a reduction of  15-4 million in expenditure on roads in Great Britain in 1970-71.(4) Agreed that, as previously, the Secretaries of State forScotland and Wales had authority, in agreement withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to change the incidencebetween their various programmes of the total reductions in public expenditure in 1970-71 agreed for Scotlandand Wales.
CG 34(69)TechnologicalServicesOtherAssistance toEmploymentand IndustryResearchCouncils, etc.(5) Provisionally approved a reduction of  6-8 million in thetransport programme for 1970-71.The Minister of Technology said that he had agreed for a total reduction of  7 million in 1970-71. He wished for further time toconsider how much of this reduction should be found fromCategory I of his programme, and how much by reducing theunallocated provision of  18 million in Category II for projects notyet identified. Any reduction in the unallocated provision in category II would be a genuine and not a book-keeping operation,and would necessarily involve the application of stricter criteria in considering projects for approval.The Cabinet (6) Provisionally approved a reduction of  7 millionexpenditure on technological services in 1970-71.inThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had earlier beenagreed that expenditure by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation(1958-59) should be limited to  80 million in the two years ending April1970. He had now agreed with the Secretary of State for economic affairs that 1958-59 expenditure in the two years ending April 1971should also be restricted to  80 million. This should provide areduction of  6 million. If the 1958-59 subsequently made a strong case for further expenditure in 1970-71, this could be considered withother claims on the contingency reserve. The proposed reductionunder this general head included the net savings arising from the government&apos;s proposals for the Intermediate Areas. The Presidentof the Board of Trade now estimated that expenditure on investment grants in 1970-71 would be about  18 million less than expected.This reduction was not included in the total shown in column 3, since it was already allowed for in the  50 million shortfall in expenditureshown in column 1 of the revised Table II.In discussion it was suggested that, before final decisions were taken about reductions under this head, the Cabinet should considerthe report by officials on expenditure on assistance to industry.The Cabinet (7) Provisionally approved a reduction of  16-5 million in expenditure on other assistance to employment andindustry in 1970-71.The Cabinet (8) Provisionally approved a reduction of  1  millionexpenditure by Research Councils, etc., in 1970-71.in
Agriculture,Fisheries andForestryHousingand LocalEnvironmentalServicesThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essential thatthe Ministry of Housing and Local Government should make some further contribution towards the shortfall; but, subject to this point,he would be prepared to discuss the matter further with the Ministerfor Planning and Land.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that officials should report in September on the relative effects,pound for pound, in stimulating house building, of increasing localauthority mortgage loans and of direct expenditure on public housing. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should have further discussions with the Minister for Planning and Land about theproblem of a shortfall to which the latter had drawn attention.The Cabinet-(10) Invited the Minister for Planning and Land to arrange fora paper to be prepared on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.(9) Provisionally approved a reduction of  1-4 million in expenditure on agriculture, fisheries and forestry in1970-71.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had provisionallyagreed with the Minister of Housing and Local Government that, ifthe latter would find a saving of  47 million under these two heads,he would be ready to agree that the level of mortgage lending bylocal authorities should be restored to  55 million in 1969-70. this level could be changed relatively quickly, and probably had a mor significant impact on the level of housing construction, at least inthe short term, than changes in the public housing programme. TheCabinet might consider further the appropriate level for this lendingin 1970-71, taking into account the public expenditure position andthe outlook for housing construction.The Minister for Planning and Land, Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, said that the Minister of Housing aimed to find areduction of  17 million in expenditure in 1970-71 on localenvironmental services, although this would involve painful decisions,including for example no further loan sanctions for art or sport in1970-71. It would be possible to reduce expenditure on housinginvestment in England in 1970-71 by about  30 million without too much difficulty, because local authorities were scaling down theirbuilding. But he could not accept the further reduction shown inTable III in the form of a shortfall in housing investment.
Law andOrderCC34(69)(11) Provisionally agreed a reduction of  55-7 million in expenditure on housing and local environmental services in Great Britain in 1970-71, subject to the outcome offurther discussions between the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister for Planning and Landabout shortfall and to any further consideration of theappropriate local authority mortgage level in 1970-71 inthe light of (10) above.The Home Secretary said that, despite the problems involved,he had provisionally agreed to a reduction of  6-4 million in expenditure in 1970-71. He would, however, like to re-open thepossibility of restricting this to  6 million, in order to provide 0-4 million for a modest programme for improvement of prisons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the addition forprison improvement might be found by reductions elsewhere, forexample by postponing the proposed computer installation for carlicences.education and LocalLibrariesThe Cabinet (12) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of transport to consider with the Chancellor of the Exchequer thepossibility of making savings by delaying installation ofthe computer for car licences in order to pay for a modestprogramme of prison improvement.(13) Provisionally approved a reduction of  6-4 million in expenditure on law and order in 1970-71.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that it was essential to avoid any further cuts in the education service. Therewas already a prospect of substantial unemployment among teachersas a result of previous cuts, and if more reductions were made thiswould reach very serious proportions. The proposals shown inTable III of C (69) 82 represented the only way in which savings could be made without cutting the education service, though theproposal to cut minor works by deferring starts could have an adverse effect on the employment of teachers.In discussion strong objections were expressed to any increasein school meals and transport charges. These were equivalent to taxation, and in combination they would have a serious impact onthe poorest section of the community. This would be wrong inprinciple and damaging politically. On the other hand it was pointedout that the question of school meal charges had been exhaustively
examined in the last round of discussions on public expenditure. a firm decision had already been taken to increase the charge for school meals by 3d. in April 1970, in order to avoid the need for anincrease in further education fees, which the Secretary of State for education and Science regarded as open to even stronger objection.The effect of school meal charges became less burdensome asearnings rose, and there was a good case for raising them to 2s. 3d.in April 1970. An increase in school transport charges on the otherhand would involve legislation, which would be very controversial.Legislation would also be required if charges were to be imposed onborrowing from local libraries.The Cabinet (14) Agreed to defer a decision on savings in expenditure on education and local libraries.Health and The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he wasWelfare prepared to meet the increase in expenditure shown in Table III ofC (69) 82 by making offsetting reductions in hospital expenditure.It might be possible also to make savings of rather more than 20 million by postponing building starts, charging for hospital treatment in all car accident cases and reducing local authority expenditure on welfare services. He himself did not consider itdesirable to reduce total public expenditure by as much as 400 million; but if this were required, a cut of the order of 20 million in health and welfare expenditure would represent a fairproportion of the total. He doubted, however, whether it would be practicable to secure the whole of this. Moreover, the decision to defer hospital building starts would have to be announced; and theproposal relating to accident charges would be very controversial.In discussion there was general agreement that a decision to postpone hospital building starts need not be announced. the implications of the proposal to charge for treatment in car accidentcases would need further study before firm conclusions on itspracticability could be reached.The Cabinet (15) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to examine further, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Transport, the practicability of securing a saving of  9 million in 1970-71 by means of charges for hospital treatment in all car accident cases.   -(16) Provisionally approved a net reduction of  20-3 million in expenditure on health and welfare in England in 1970-71,subject to (15) above, and corresponding reductions inScotland and Wales.
SocialServicesPrinciples ofNationalHealthServiceCharges(previous reference:CC(69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C (69) 83) and the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (69) 84) about charges in the national health service.The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that theCabinet had invited him to circulate a memorandum on the principleof charging in the national health service. The 25 per cent increasein charges for dentures and spectacles, against which a Prayer wasto be moved in the House of Commons in the following week, wasa minor adjustment of charges to meet rising costs. In contrast toan earlier 50 per cent increase in charges for dental treatment, it hadaroused deep-seated emotions among the Governmenfs back-benchsupporters. This might have been due partly to maladroit timing ofthe announcement, but in his view the opposition stemmed largely from a belief that charges were being gradually built into the national health service system of finance, in breach of the principle, whichwas felt particularly keenly in relation to the prescription charge,that the health service should be paid for by the healthy and be freefor the sick. If this analysis was correct, there would be advantage in reviewing, in the coming debate, the whole question of the part which charges should play in financing the health service.It was particularly unfortunate that it had proved impossibleto operate the prescription charges in the way originally intended.The only authentication of the claim for exemption from the chargesCommon The Cabinet-Services and miscellaneous (17) Approved reductions of  1-7 million and  0-6 million in services expenditure  in   1970-71   on  common  services   and miscellaneous services respectively.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer would circulate a paper to the Cabineton the results of their discussion so far and on any further talks with ministers responsible for particular programmes. They could then consider the proposals for increases shown in the revised Table II ofC (69) 82 and resume their discussion on the proposals for reductions in expenditure on education and local libraries.The Cabinet (18) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
was at present the patienfs signature on the claim form on the backof the prescription. This was open to abuse and, although checkshad shown that losses amounted to no more than some 2 per cent ofthe cost of prescriptions, the Government were open to criticism from the Public Accounts Committee in allowing the system to persist without stronger safeguards. The issue of an embossed card-to every person exempt from the charge had proved to be impossible,however, partly because of the refusal of the chemists to operate thesystem and partly because of the cost of its introduction. Theprincipal weakness of the present arrangement was, however, itsfailure to protect the chronic sick from the new charges owing tothe doctors&apos; unwillingness to certify chronic sickness except in respectof a few conditions requiring permanent medication. For these reasons, therefore, he believed that the prescription charges shouldnot be accepted as a permanent feature of the health service, and he proposed to indicate as much in the forthcoming debate. Sincecirculating his memorandum, however, he had become aware of aletter which the Prime Minister had sent to Mr. L. Pavitt, m p, on 6th March, 1968, in which he had said:&quot; It would be wrong for you to assume that these charges,reluctantly introduced to meet a serious economic situation,carry the implication of a permanent change of the Government^policy or of its approach to health service financing. When theeconomic situation improves sufficiently for substantial extrasums (beyond normal annual growth) to be made available tothe National Health Service they would, of course, be allocatedaccording to the priorities determined by the Minister and theGovernment at that time.&quot;This seemed to be the appropriate line to take in the debate.The Chancellor of the Exchequer deprecated any statement thatmight reopen the whole issue of health service charges. They had never been unpopular with the public as a whole; and a pledge to abolish them, however guarded, was liable to be exploited by theOpposition to the embarrassment of the Government. If theSecretary of State for Social Services found it necessary to mentionprescription charges at all he should indicate that if the Governmentwere in a position in which they would contemplate forgoing anyof the health service charges they would give priority to the abolitionof prescription charges rather than the abolition of the charge onteeth and spectacles. It would be important, however, not to refer to prescription charges or to the Prime Ministers letter to Mr. Pavittin a way which drew particular attention to this aspect of the problem.In discussion the point was made that among some sections ofthe public there was lively interest in charges in the health service,
and it would not be possible to avoid some reference to theprescription charge. It should be possible, however, to deal with thematter without opening the way to further controversy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Social Services should make the point thatdental and optical charges were normally paid by people who were at work and earning, whereas the prescription charge was normallypaid by the sick. It should not therefore be regarded as a permanent feature of the national health service. He should then quote theletter of 6th March, 1968, making it clear that there had been nochange in the Governmenfs policy.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to be guided in his handling of the debate on the National health service (Charges for Appliances) Regulations by the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th July, 1969.
