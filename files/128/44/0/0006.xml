CC 6 (69)secret parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Report of theParliamentaryCommitteeCommonwealthImmigration(previous reference :CC (69) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)NorthernIreland(previous reference :CC (69) 5thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet the proceedingsof the last meeting of the Parliamentary Committee.The Committee had considered the Governments response tothe speech on Commonwealth immigration which had recently beenmade by Mr. Heath, the Leader of the Opposition, at Walsall. Asa result, both the Home Secretary and he himself had found occasionsto make it publicly clear that Mr. Heath&apos;s speech had created a verymisleading impression of the nature and scale of the real issues involved and that the Government had no intention of allowingthemselves to be stampeded into premature legislation on this subject.The Committee had agreed that, despite the continuation of civildisturbances in Ulster, the Government should refrain from overtintervention but should continue to assure the Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland (Captain 0&apos;Neill) that they would give him all thesupport which they properly could, provided that he was seen topress forward as rapidly as possible with his programme of reforms.At the same time it would be expedient to consider what measures the Government might have to adopt if the situation deterioratedfurther; and the necessary arrangements for this purpose werein train.In this connection, The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat the Government of Northern Ireland had decided to establish a Parliamentary Commissioner on the model of the office which hadbeen created in Great Britain; and they had indicated that theywould be glad if Sir Edmund Compton, the present parliamentary commissioner for Great Britain, could assume the correspondingresponsibility in Northern Ireland for an initial period until a suitableUlster appointment could be made. Consultation with theOpposition in the House of Commons had established that thisarrangement would be acceptable to the Imperial Parliament,provided that the powers to be given to the Northern IrelandParliamentary Commissioner would be comparable with those whichhe enjoyed in relation to Great Britain; and, since it had beenestablished that this proviso would be satisfied by the legislation tobe introduced in the Parliament at Stormont, the way was now clearfor Sir Edmund Compton&apos;s appointment in respect of NorthernIreland to be announced in the near future.9901a 2
SpecialistSelectCommittees(previous reference :CC(68) 12thConclusions,Minute 1)The Parliamentary Committee had also considered the futureof specialist Select Committees. They had agreed that a new SelectCommittee on Overseas Aid should be appointed when the SelectCommittee on Agriculture finished its work at the end of Februarybut that the experiment represented by specialist Select committees should terminate with the present Parliament and that a group ofMinisters under the chairmanship of the Lord President should examine the main lessons to be learned from this experiment andshould consider whether it should be repeated in the next Parliament.The Committee had also reaffirmed the view that the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries should not be prevented fromconsidering the work of the Bank of England but should be debarred from examining the Bank in its capacity as a banker to other banksand private clients or as an adviser to the Government on financialand monetary policy. The reasons for this decision would be explained by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord president to an early meeting of the Governmenfs supporters in the House ofCommons.In discussion of the Prime Ministers report of the proceedingsof the Parliamentary Committee it was suggested that, as regards the specialist Select Committees, the experiment would in any eventterminate at the end of the current Parliament; and the Governmentshould not, therefore, make any announcement to this effect whichmight imply that they thought that the Committees had failed intheir purpose or represented a procedural innovation which shouldnot be repeated in future Parliaments. Indeed, it might be preferable to make no announcement at all; and, before reaching a decisionon this issue, the Parliamentary Committee and the Cabinet would need to consider the report from the group of Ministers under thechairmanship of the Lord President, which should consider the futureof the specialist Select Committees in the wider context of the reform of Parliamentary business as a whole.ParliamentPrivateMembers&apos;Bills(previous reference :CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Prime Minister said that the Parliamentary Committeehad discussed on 27th January in connection with the Freedom of publication (Protection) Bill the handling of Private Members&apos; Billsgenerally and, in particular, the question whether it was appropriate to issue a Whip confined to Ministers in order to ensure the defeat of a defective Bill at Second Reading. He proposed that the group of Ministers under the Lord President, who would consider select committees, should also examine the political implications of the government&apos;s handling of Private Members&apos; Bills, and he had asked the Paymaster General to bring the matter before the group. Inthe meantime, it was necessary to decide what line should be taken
on the Freedom of Publication (Protection) Bill, which was down for Second Reading on Friday, 31st January. The legislation committee had decided that the Bill should not be allowed to reach the Statute Book, and had invited the Lord President to consider,with the Chief Whip and the Attorney-General, how best this couldbe ensured. It had subsequently been agreed that the Attorney-General should explain the defects of the Bill, and this again raised the question whether and, if so, by what means, Ministers shouldbe asked to attend and vote. He accordingly thought it right tobring the matter before the Cabinet.The Lord Chancellor said that the Freedom of Publication(Protection) Bill was based on a report produced by a Working Partybrought together by Lord Shawcross. The recommendations of theWorking Party had been heavily criticised and Bills based upon themin succeeding Sessions had been blocked. The present Bill relaxedin certain respects the law relating to contempt of court, official secrets, and libel, and went somewhat beyond the earlier proposals.It was defective in law, and, although it had been warmly welcomed by the Press, he thought that it should be opposed at Second Reading.Whatever line the Government adopted, however, they should adoptovertly.In discussion, it was suggested that if the Bill was seriouslydefective the defects should be explained to the House, but theGovernment spokesman would be in some embarrassment if hethought it right to oppose a Second Reading but was not supportedby his colleagues. The Bill was not wholly contrary to government policy, however, except in relation to the Official Secrets Acts, andthere was reason to suppose that if the Government shortlyannounced their intention to review the application of these Acts, as recommended by the Committee on the Civil Service (the FultonCommittee), the sponsors of the Bill would be prepared to drop the relevant clause. In that event, it might be possible to amend theremaining provisions of the Bill satisfactorily in Committee, and theGovernment would not necessarily wish to see it defeated. It might,therefore, be appropriate for the Attorney-General in the SecondReading debate to explain the defects in the Bill, and to indicatethat the Government would not seek to influence the vote but that ifthe House gave the Bill a Second Reading they would seek to have it amended in Committee and reserved the right, if the Bill were notsatisfactorily amended, to reconsider their position at a later stage.In this event, the House might well not divide.on the Second Reading.It should be recognised, however, that a long Committee stage wouldgive the Press an opportunity to campaign in favour of the Bill, and
it would be necessary for the Government to stand firmnotwithstanding this if the Bill were still unacceptable when it leftCommittee.In further discussion, it was suggested that while the Freedomof Publication (Protection) Bill was not incurably defective, there might be other Private Members&apos; Bills, such as the National Insurance(Further Provisions) Bill, which were wholly contrary to government policy. If Bills of this nature secured a high place in the ballotfor Private Members&apos; Bills, they could not be blocked by the recognised means and could be defeated only by an adverse vote.On these occasions it would be justifiable for the Chief Whip to seek to mobilise Ministers to vote against the Bill. In order toavoid a formal Whip addressed only to Ministers, the Chief Whipshould arrange for a telephone message asking Ministers not committed to appointments out of London to attend and vote.Ministers should give instructions that any such message was to bebrought to their own personal attention and to that of junior ministers in the Department, and that the Whips&apos; Office was to beinformed whether the Ministers would be available.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasagreed that the Attorney-General should intervene in the SecondReading debate on the Freedom of Publication (Protection) Bill toexplain the defects in the Bill. He should say that, while theGovernment did not propose to influence the vote, if the House sawfit to give the Bill a Second Reading they would press for itsamendment in Committee and reserve the right to consider their position afresh if the Bill were still defective in form when it returnedto the House. An attempt should be made to persuade the promoters of the Bill to abandon the clause on the Official secrets acts in the light of the Governments intention to institute a reviewof the Acts. The Cabinet should have a further opportunity of considering the Bill at the Report Stage. Where a Private Member&apos;bill was not merely defective in form but in conflict with theGovernments own proposals for legislation, Ministers should beasked, by means of a telephone message to the Minister^ PrivateOffice, to vote against its Second Reading, and Ministers should ensure, on the lines suggested in discussion, that these messages were brought to their notice and an appropriate reply sent to the Whips&apos;Office.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed to consider the Freedom of Publication (Protection)Bill further in the light of the amendments made inStanding Committee.
oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference :CC (69) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)Iraq(previous reference :CC (68) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the paris discussions on Vietnam the first meeting on matters of substancehad taken place. It had lasted (with translations) for six and a halfhours and had been devoted mainly to prepared statements.Discussion would come later.The United States were pressing for a return to respect for the demilitarised zone and the integrity of Cambodia; and for the observance of the Geneva agreements on Laos. The other side wereopposing this.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the present government of Iraq, whether we regarded it from the point of viewof its internal policies or from that of its relations with the UnitedKingdom, was one of the worst in the Middle East. We (as well as other Governments and the Pope) had made appeals for clemencyfor the accused in the recent spy trials. No publicity had been givento these appeals, as it had been thought that this might be counter-productive. The appeals might have had some effect, since six ofthe accused were eventually acquitted. He had received a deputation from the Board of Deputies of British Jews. He also intended to approach other Arab Governments, who had not shared Iraq&apos;sgloating reaction to the executions which had taken place, on thebasis that the action taken by Iraq could only discredit the Arabcause. If other Arab States could be induced to protest, this mightcarry more weight with the Iraqis than protests from the West. Hewould also try to get Members of Parliament with an interest in middle Eastern affairs and who were or were reputed to be Arab sympathisers to send appropriate messages to the Governmentof Iraq. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary drew attentionto the very confidential nature of these two latter points.Turning to the demonstrations which had taken place outsidethe Iraqi Embassy in London, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary said that the demonstration had on the whole beennon-violent, though one or two windows had been broken and the israeli flag had been hoisted over the Embassy. It had been reportedthat in the course of the latter operation one of the individuals concerned had received a flesh wound from a stab with a knife andThe Prime Minister took occasion to refer to unfounded press reports, in connection with the Matrimonial Property Bill, that theChief Whip had been the subject of criticism by other Ministers. he wished to make it clear that the Chief Whip retained his complete confidence.
that Iraqi officials had discharged firearms. The Iraqi ambassador had telephoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to protest against the demonstration, adding that he could not answer, in thecircumstances, for what might follow in Iraq. The Foreign and commonwealth Office had expressed regret for the material damage done, but had pointed out that in the United Kingdom the right of peaceful and Orderly demonstration was accepted, and that the BritishGovernment held the Iraqi Government responsible for theprotection of British lives and property in Iraq. In any further communication there might be with the Iraqis on this subject, full account would be taken of the allegations, if they were verified, that members of the Iraqi Embassy staff had threatened demonstratorsin London or used violence towards them.In discussion, attention was drawn to the tactless behaviour of the British Broadcasting Corporation television reporting unit,which had set up an elaborate outside broadcast organisation outsidethe Iraqi Embassy with powerful arc lights. The commissioner of Police of the Metropolis had reported that the police had beendazzled by these lights and hampered in their task of restoring order.There had been similar complaints from Northern Ireland, wherethere was reason to believe that television producers had induceddemonstrators to stage prearranged clashes with the police for thebenefit of their programmes. The situation gave cause for concernand it was for consideration what action could usefully be taken.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with other ministers as appropriate, to consider what action couldbe taken to restrain the undesirable activities of televisionreporters and producers referred to in discussion.industrial affairs pay ofOverseasTelegraphOperatorsin the PostOfficeCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal on the pay of overseas telegraph operators in the Post Office(C (69) 15). &quot; uThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meeting on27th January the Parliamentary Committee had invited theLord Privy Seal, together with the Postmaster-General and the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of employment and Productivity (Mr. Hattersley), to meet the Union of Post office workers (UPW) in order to make it clear that the reports of ministerial disagreement which had appeared in the Press were
9901Bunfounded and to explore whether there was any scope for further discussions on productivity. The Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes had considered the outcome of this meeting, whichhad resulted in deadlock, and had concluded that it would be wrong to contemplate any last-minute concession to persuade the UPWto call off their strike. It had emerged at the Committee&apos;s meeting that the reintroduction of the overseas tape relay unit (OTRU) wouldresult, on average, in a significant loss of take-home pay for the operators. The Committee were unable to assess the significance ofthis point, which had not previously been brought to their attention,but they considered that it deserved further examination.The Lord Privy Seal said that at their meeting with the UPWthe Governments representatives had had little room for manoeuvre.They had clarified the Governments attitude towards the costing ofcertain productivity improvements and had put forward modifiedproposals on arbitration. They had however made no progress onthe introduction of OTRU; and the UPW had made it clear thatthey regarded productivity agreements as a matter for negotiation and were not prepared to submit them to arbitration in any form.For the Government to concede this would have serious implications for other parts of the Civil. Service, and for this reason the disputehad an importance out of all proportion to the numbers involved.The Postmaster-General said that following the UPWs ballotin favour of strike action the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes had rejected his proposal to offer 5 per cent only, leavingproductivity to be negotiated later. At a subsequent meeting on23rd January he had proposed to renew the offer of 5 per cent, witha further 2 per cent productivity increase, but to reserve the position on OTRU for further discussion. The Committee decided against this because it would mean giving in to a threat of industrial action.The loss of take-home pay resulting from the reintroduction ofOTRU was not a new factor. Officials of the Civil service department and the Department of Employment and Productivityhad known about it for several months and he had referred to itexplicitly in a letter which he had sent the Lord Privy Seal inNovember. It had been implicit in the proposals he had put to theCommittee on Prices and Incomes, though he had not brought it out explicitly because it was not at that time a key issue in thenegotiations. Subsequently the General Secretary of the UPW had decided to lay great emphasis on it in an attempt to drive a wedgebetween his colleagues and himself. While it was desirable to try tofind a formula for resuming negotiations, it would be damaging tothe Post Office and other employers to concede the union&apos;s argument
on take-home pay. It was, moreover, important that the conduct ofthe negotiations should remain with the Postmaster-General.In discussion there was agreement that the reduction of take-home pay resulting from the reintroduction of OTRU must beregarded as a new factor since it had not been set out in terms in the papers submitted to the Committee on Prices and Incomes or in discussion there. It appeared that the reintroduction of OTRUwould mean on average a loss of 7s. Od. a week for most overseastelegraph operators and 10s. Od. a week for others. It was unrealistic to expect the unions to regard this as a satisfactory basis for negotiating a productivity agreement. On the other hand there wassupport for the view that the reduction of take-home pay could notbe advanced as the reason for making a concession now since theUPW would know that the Postmaster-General had been aware ofthe point from the beginning.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that officials of the Departments concerned should be asked to prepare,for consideration by the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes on the following day, a formula which might provide thebasis for resumed negotiations with the UPW. Subject to theCommittee&apos;s approval of a formula and to any other conditions theymight require, the Postmaster-General should conduct the resumednegotiations, with the assistance on productivity questions of a minister from the Department of Employment and Productivity.Departments with responsibility for wage negotiations in the public sector should in future consult the Department of Employment and productivity at an early stage and, where appropriate, seek theassistance of its manpower and productivity service.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to prepare, for consideration by the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes the following day, a formula which might provide the basis for resumednegotiations with the Union of Post Office Workers.Prices andIncomesComparabilityin public sector Pay(previous reference:CC(69) 5thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meetingon 23rd January the Cabinet had decided that a statement should bemade that the Government intended to work out new arrangements to co-ordinate advice on pay in the public sector, including advice on the use of comparability as a criterion and had asked himto arrange for the preparation of such a statement. Furtherconsideration had led him to feel some concern about the possible
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C (69) 14) covering the draft statement on theDefence Estimates, 1969.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the draft white paper incorporated amendments which had been agreed at a meetingof the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee in the previous week.The White Paper was due to be published on 20th February. Itshowed that, at constant prices, the defence budget for 1969-70 wasabout  100 million below the target set in the Statement on public expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70 of January 1968 (Cmnd. 3515)and that, for the first time since 1958-59, it was lower than that forthe immediately preceding year. Recruiting to the forces was,however, poor, and in 1968-69 it was expected that only 28,000 men would be recruited against a requirement of 38,000 for all threerepercussions of a statement in precisely this form. It was clearly desirable to press on with the interdepartmental examination of comparability and the co-ordination of advice on pay in the public sector. But to announce publicly the Governments intention of doing so in this particular manner, before anything could be said about what system would replace it, would in his view subject theGovernment to serious and unnecessary public criticism. Afterconsultation with the Secretary of State for Social Services, the first secretary of State and the Lord Privy Seal, he had come to theconclusion that there would be advantage in awaiting the reaction to the Governments announcement of their acceptance of therecommendations of the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Remuneration before finally deciding what, if any, public statement should be made about comparability. If the reaction to the statement about the Review Body&apos;s recommendations was fairly mild it mightbe better not to make a statement at all. If, on the other hand,preliminary reactions suggested that there might be mountingcriticism, then he would favour making a slightly modified statement,the terms of which he would propose to agree with the ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet Agreed that a statement about the co-ordination of advice on pay in the public sector should not be made unlesspublic reaction to the Governments acceptance of therecommendations of the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Remuneration indicated that one was necessary.
CONFIDENTIALServices. The first chapter of the White Paper had been draftedwith the aim of giving confidence to the forces about their future.After the forthcoming interim report of the National Board for prices and Incomes on forces&apos; pay was available, he expected tomake proposals to his colleagues about this.In discussion, certain amendments to the draft White paper were agreed, including the omission, from paragraph 2 on page 117of C (69) 14, of the Statement that the Armed Forces would needabout 44,000 male entrants in 1969-70. It was suggested that thesection of Chapter 1 of the draft which dealt with the Defence ofEurope might, with advantage, be shortened somewhat. ministers were invited to inform the Defence Secretary quickly of any furtherdrafting suggestions.The Cabinet Approved the draft Statement on the Defence Estimates,1969, subject to the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th January, 1969.
