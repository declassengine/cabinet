ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. There would be a debate on foreign affairs on 8th and 9th December. It had beensuggested that on the first day the debate should concentrate onVietnam and on the second, which was a Supply Day, on Biafra.The general view, however, was that the opening speech on behalfof the Government on the first day should cover the whole field offoreign affairs and that the winding-up speech on the second day should be similarly wide-ranging. Discussions could take placethrough the usual channels to ascertain whether it would be convenient to the House to indicate that Members wishing to speak on Biafra should do so on the second day. .london docks(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 3)There would be wide concern in Parliament about the Londondockers&apos; decision to maintain their ban on the use of the newcontainer terminal at Tilbury. The failure of the Trades UnionCongress and the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union to take effective action on this issue was much to be deplored, particularlyin the light of the undertakings given to the Government during thediscussions on the Industrial Relations Bill in June. It was important that the Government should make an early statement on thesituation, which would include a reference to current and prospectivediscussions with the trade union leaders concerned.Continuance ofthe Murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act, 1965(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to make a statement tothe House of Commons later in the day on the situation at Tilbury.The Home Secretary said that the Opposition spokesman on home affairs, Mr. Quintin Hogg, had asked to see him on 24thNovember to discuss capital punishment. Mr. Hogg had said thatthere Would be great opposition within the Conservative Party to anyproposal to make the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act, 1965(the Act of 1965) permanent before the five-year period came to anend in July 1970. He thought that they would vote against anyresolutions to make the Act permanent before Christmas and urgedthat the Government should introduce a short Bill to extend thefive-year period by, say, a further 18 months, in order to bring theperiod to an end at a time well clear of the next General election and so prevent capital punishment from becoming an election issue.Mr. Hogg had gone on to propose that there should be an earlydebate on a general motion at the end of which no decisions wouldbe taken; and he said that in such a debate he would make clear11471-2A 2
his own view that the only choice was between making the Act of1965 permanent and enacting new legislation providing for a death penalty in a different form from that in the Homicide Act, 1957.The Home Secretary said that he had told Mr. Hogg that his suggestion for a temporising Bill would not be attractive to theParliamentary Labour Party; and he had challenged his statement that such a Bill would prevent capital punishment from becomingan election issue. He had put it to Mr. Hogg that in the last resortthe issue must be one of personal conscience and that temporisingmeasures were likely to lead to greater confusion and greaterawkwardness for candidates in the General Election. To thisMr. Hogg had replied that in the absence of a temporising measurehe would feel obliged to say openly that the Government had actedwrongly. The Home Secretary had told Mr. Hogg that he would report his arguments fully to the Cabinet. Since their conversation,the Opposition had tabled a motion calling on the Government to honour the principle in the Act of 1965 of a review after five years;and in the period before that review became due in July 1970 toprovide Parliament with a detailed and impartial assessment of allthe statistics, including the 1969 figures.In discussion there was general agreement that the Cabinet would wish to consider the terms of the Opposition motion before taking afinal decision about the introduction of resolutions to make the act of 1965 permanent. This might most conveniently be done at ameeting on Monday, 8th December. This could, however, give riseto difficulties in the House of Lords since if, at their meeting on 8th December, the Cabinet were to reaffirm their previous decisionto introduce the resolutions on that day and to debate them in bothHouses on 17th December, it would no longer be possible to givethe House of Lords the customary two weeks&apos; notice of the debate.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume their discussion of the continuance of the murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act, 1965 on 8th December.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Lord President of the Council, toconsider further the arrangements for giving the Houseof Lords advance notice of any debate on capital punishment and to report on them at their next meeting.Beer Prices The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on 25th november the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes had considered areport by the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on beerprices. The Committee considered it important that when the report
CC57(69)was published on 28th November the Government should state theirattitude to the Board&apos;s recommendation that there should be an overall increase of 2d. a pint in public bar prices. They agreed thatthe recommendation should be accepted; but the Minister ofAgriculture should try to persuade the brewers to agree to a voluntary standstill on further increases for another year once theBoard&apos;s recommendations had been implemented. It would also be helpful if the industry would agree to defer putting the price increaseinto effect until the New Year, though this was a less importantobjective. The Committee had accordingly agreed that the Ministerof Agriculture should announce the Governmenfs acceptance of therecommendations in the report; and that in his discussions with theindustry, which would begin that day, he should have discretion toreach the best settlement he could on the timing of the increase andon a further standstill.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that when the report was published theMinister of Agriculture should announce the Governmenfsacceptance of its conclusions; but that, unless he had by thennegotiated a satisfactory agreement with the brewers, he shouldmake it clear that discussions with them would continue about the timing of the increase and the question of a further standstill. Heshould press the brewers to agree to a standstill for a further year;and if he secured their agreement he need not press them to deferputting the price increases into effect until the New Year. Otherwisehe should consult the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomesbefore concluding a settlement with them.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to announce the government&apos;s acceptance of the conclusions of the NBPFsreport on beer prices; and to be guided in his negotiationswith the brewers by the Prime Ministers summing upof their discussion.The Prime Minister said that, following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 24th July, Departments had been asked to provide material fora review of the Governmenfs achievements since taking office. the response had not been satisfactory and he would shortly be writing to all Ministers in charge of Departments asking for their co-operation in the preparation of a comprehensive survey for whichthe Minister without Portfolio would be responsible. He would indicate the scope and nature of the material required none ofwhich would be confidential-and the form in which it would be most convenient to provide it.   He would be grateful if senior
Ministers concerned would take personal responsibility for their departments contributions, though they would doubtless find ithelpful to arrange for a junior Minister to supervise theirpreparation.The Cabinet (5) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Nigeria(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary (C (69) 160) examining thepossibilities of improving the flow of relief supplies to the civilpopulation of Biafra.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the reliefproblem had to be considered in the context of our whole policy towards the civil war in Nigeria. In summary, the principles whichhad determined the Governmenfs policy were that we ought notto support attempts to divide Nigeria; that we should do everything possible to bring about a settlement; and that we should do all wecould to maintain a flow of relief supplies. This policy had exposedus to misrepresentation and attack; but so would any alternative policy. The Federal Military Government (FMG) was supportedby most of the worlcfs Governments. Particularly noteworthy wasa statement on 14th November by the Canadian Prime Minister inwhich he firmly fixed the blame for starvation in Biafra on colonel ojukwu. The main support for the Biafran cause came from france, South Africa, Portugal and Rhodesia, whose motives werein all cases suspect. Opponents here of the Governmenfs policy forthe most part favoured an embargo on arms supplies to the FMGrather than outright support for Colonel Ojukwu. But an embargowould tend to prolong the war and strengthen secessionist pressuresin Nigeria. It would endanger our interests in the greater part of nigeria, which was under the control of the FMG; and would strengthen the Soviet Union Y influence in the country; and would destroy any chance that the FMG might accept us as a mediator inthe dispute. The Swiss Government, which was considering aproposal for mediation, had expressed the hope that they would receive our support if they attempted the task. If a new attempt atmediation succeeded (and it should be recalled that past attempts,particularly that at Kampala which had been frustrated by a speechby General de Gaulle, had come near to doing so) it would be partof our task, once the Biafrans accepted the principle of a unitedNigeria, to obtain satisfactory guarantees for the Ibos.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was against this background that the Cabinet would wish to consider his paper describing the steps we had taken to maintain the flow of relief supplies to Biafra in face of an almost unremitting attitude ofnon-co-operation on the part of Colonel Ojukwu and hisrepresentatives. The most recent proposals to begin daylight reliefflights to Uli under Red Cross auspices had been rejected by theBiafrans, evidently because daylight flights would deprive them ofthe cover for arms flights provided by the existing night airlift of relief supplies. The present Biafran policy was undoubtedlycausing much distress in Biafra; and he proposed two measures tohelp relieve the situation. In the first place, we might make cashcontributions to OXFAM and the relief fund operated by the british council of Churches. These organisations operated both in Biafranand Federal territory, whereas the Red Cross, which had in the past been our principal channel for relief aid, would tend in face of thelatest Biafran moves to be more and more restricted in its work inBiafra. Secondly, we might seek the agreement of the FMG to oursending a non-political emissary, possibly Lord Hunt, to discussrelief matters. The FMG had indicated that they would be happy to discuss the proposal with a British Minister in Lagos in the nearfuture. They would not want him to come immediately for theunderstandable reason that they were considering making a further concession on the relief question; and they would not wish theannouncement of such a concession to be linked in the public mindwith a visit by a British Minister.The ensuing discussion stressed the concern felt in parliament and in the country at large at the continuance of civil war in a country of the Commonwealth. As suppliers of arms to the legalGovernment of Nigeria, we had a certain moral responsibility; andwe should use the influence which our position gave us. Concernin Britain at the situation was not confined to pressure groups witha special interest in favour of one side or the other but waswidespread and deeply felt. The issue of starvation and measuresto relieve it had come to overshadow in the public mind thefundamental issue of a political settlement. It was suggested thatthe FMG having failed to secure a clear-cut military decision, had now settled down to try to starve their opponents out. This created a dilemma for us. We appeared to have based our policy onprognostications of an early military victory for the FMG which had proved to be erroneous. We wanted the slaughter and the starvationto cease: but the Federal victory which we still appeared to regard as the, desirable solution could not now-or so it seemed beachieved without their continuation. A position might therefore bereached in which we should have to choose between the attainment
of the political objectives which we regarded as right and effective Emeasures to end mass starvation. One of the main arguments whichhad been advanced in favour of our policy had been that a descent Iinto tribalism threatened the very existence of Nigeria and otherAfrican States.  But it was possible that as in other cases in thepast we had mistaken the nature of the conflict and that what we Iwere witnessing was not an attempt to disrupt a State but the birth Iof a nation.   If it was right for the FMG to use starvation as a Iweapon of war, the rebel leader, Colonel Ojukwu, could hardly be Iblamed for refusing to co-operate in relief measures which, in his 1judgment, would put him at a military disadvantage.   Moreover,while there was force in the arguments which had been deployedagainst an arms embargo, there might nevertheless be advantage inmaking a further approach to the arms-supplying countries, inparticular the Soviet Union and France, which had so far refusedto co-operate.   If it succeeded, it would be a major factor in bringing hostilities to an end. If as was admittedly more likely it failed, it would at least be clear where the blame lay.As against this, it was pointed out that the rebel case had been presented to public opinion much more skilfully and persuasivelythan the case for the FMG and indeed for our own policies. though there was greater understanding in the country of. the government&apos;s policy than there had been 18 months or a year ago, a vigorous public relations effort was still needed; and we should rebut energeticallyany accusations that our policy was inhumane. But, whatever theposition might be in Britain, the fact remained that support for the!FMG was almost unanimous in Africa itself, and very widespread \elsewhere. The danger to African States of a disintegration intotribalism and the sort of conditions which had prevailed in Africabefore the colonial era was a real one; and African States were keenlyaware of it. The analogies which had been drawn between our policies in Nigeria and our efforts elsewhere to maintain the unity of a Statelong after it had ceased to be realistic to attempt to do so could notbe sustained. The rebellion was essentially a tribal movement, basedon Ibo domination. A Biafran State could not be viable withoutthe inclusion in it of large numbers of non-Ibos who detested Iborule. The Ibos were conducting a skilful propaganda campaignabout Federal Oppression (though they had themselves been far fromguiltless in the past) and had made great play with their fears fortheir safety under a Federal regime. But our own experience, whichwas borne out by that of international observers, suggested thatthere had been no victimisation of Ibos in the areas regained fromrebel dominance; and large numbers of Ibos were living peacefullyin other areas of Federal Nigeria. Both sides had been charged withusing starvation as a weapon Of war, although the FMG hadrepeatedly declared their willingness to co-operate in relief measures
PublicExpenditureDraft white paper(previous reference:CC (69) 56thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a note by theChancellor of the Exchequer, to which was attached a draft white paper on Public Expenditure (C(69) 159), and considered a furthernote by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (69) 161), to which were attached revised drafts of parts of the White Paper.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Annex I to C (69) 161was a redraft of paragraphs 32 and 33 of Part I of the draft white paper, revised to take account of the points raised in their previous discussion. The passage in the revised paragraph 33 had been agreed with the Defence Secretary. The reference to expenditure on &quot; other assistance to employment and industry &quot; had been changed in orderto give the Government greater freedom in relation to the future policy of investment grants. A footnote had now been provided to Table 1.6 explaining the status of the figures for 1972-73 andand had allowed the passage of large quantities of supplies to feedtheir enemies. But such charges and counter charges wereunprofitable. It was more important to secure effective measures of relief which would not prejudice our general policy. when considering the question of a political settlement, due weight shouldbe given to African fears of disintegration through tribalism. Itshould also be borne in mind that Federal attachment to theprinciple of one Nigeria was at least as strong as Biafran pressure forsecession. The Swiss proposal for mediation should be supported,if it came to fruition; and there was considerable support for theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposals for the despatchof a non-political emissary to discuss relief matters and also for thatof a visit to Lagos by a junior Minister. With regard to the latter,it was for consideration whether the proposed visit should be at ahigher level.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hehad returned from his own visit to Nigeria in March convinced thatour policy was the lesser of two evils. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would wish to give further thought to thepoints which had been made; and he would no doubt report again to the Cabinet at an early meeting.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
1973-74. The level of expenditure on health and welfare shown inTable 1.6 had been increased by  10 million as a result of the cabinet&apos;s decision at their meeting on 20th November not to proceedwith the scheme for recovering the full costs of treating roadcasualties in hospital. Annex II to C (69) 161 was a footnote toTable 1.3 explaining the basis for the rate of interest assumed inprojecting expenditure on debt interest.In discussion, the following amendments were agreed:(a) &quot; Fully &quot; should be deleted from the last line but two ofparagraph 30 of Part I of the draft.(b) The sentence in the revised text of paragraph 33 attachedto C (69) 161, referring to the Technological Services programme,should be amended as follows :&quot; The Technological Services programme cannot be settleduntil much nearer the time. . . .&quot;(c) Table 1.6 should have a footnote explaining the status ofthe defence budget for 1972-73 and 1973-74 by reference to the revised paragraph 33 of Part I of the text of the White Paper. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should consider whether it would bedesirable also to add a footnote to Table 1.6 about the status of thefigures of expenditure on education.(d) At the beginning of paragraph 3 on page 44 of the draft white Paper, the following should be deleted:&quot; These estimates are on the basis that approvals of newhouse building in the public sector in Great Britain will continue at or about their present level but with &quot;and should be replaced by:&quot;There will be . . .&quot;The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatconcern had been expressed at the relatively low level within whicha number of important public expenditure programmes would haveto be contained over the next few years if the increase in the total ofpublic expenditure were limited, as the Chancellor of the exchequer proposed, to 3J per cent in 1972-73 and 1973-74 and taking accountof the restrictions imposed on total expenditure in previous years.In this connection, however, it should be recalled that at their meetingon 22nd October, 1968, the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy had previously agreed that if, during the course of1970-71, the economic situation developed more favourably than expected, there would be an opportunity to decide whether such animprovement should lead to a reduction in the level of taxation oran increase in the planned level of public expenditure. There would
Productivity,Prices andIncomesPolicyDraft WhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary ofState and Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity(C (69) 158) covering a draft White Paper on Productivity, prices and Incomes Policy.The Prime Minister said that the First Secretary of State wasnot at this stage seeking the formal approval of the Cabinet for publication of the draft White Paper, but their agreement that itmight be circulated to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)and Trades Union Congress (TUC) as a basis for the informalconsultations which she was about to hold with them. It would notaccordingly be necessary at this stage to do more than settle any differences on important points of substance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial sub-Committee on Future Prices and Incomes Policy (PI (F)) had considered the draft White Paper on the previous day. In hisopinion, the only issue which needed to be resolved before the draft was circulated informally to the CBI and TUC was the drafting of be a similar opportunity in respect of the years after 1970-71. TheCabinet accordingly approved the White Paper on public expenditure attached to C (69) 159, subject to the amendments whichhad been agreed at their previous meeting and in the discussion atthis meeting (including the revised texts circulated in the Annexattached to C (69) 161, as amended at this meeting). The Chancellorof the Exchequer should circulate a final revised version of theWhite Paper to the Cabinet as soon as possible and should arrangefor its publication on Tuesday, 2nd December.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (a) to revise the draft White Paper on Public Expenditure,1968-69 to 1973-74, as indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up;(b) to circulate the revised version to the Cabinet as soonas possible;(c) to arrange for publication of the White Paper, sorevised, on Tuesday, 2nd December.
the section on low-paid employees. Since that meeting, the first secretary of State and the Lord Privy Seal had agreed upon a revised draft, which they had not been able in the time available to circulate to the Cabinet. He thought that the revised draft wouldbroadly meet the doubts expressed in PI (F) about the text ofSection E.4 of the draft attached to C (69) 158. He considered,however, that the revised draft remained unsatisfactory in onerespect; and he would propose an amendment for consideration bythe First Secretary.In discussion, it was agreed that the following amendment should be made before the text was circulated to the CBI and the tuc:Paragraph 1 of Section B. The last three sentences of thisparagraph should be amended to avoid the suggestion thatdevaluation had been caused by the rate of increase in earnings.This section of the paper should confine itself to theconsequences of devaluation and should not seek to explain itscauses.The Minister of Technology wished to consider further, before publication of the White Paper, the reference in paragraph 7 onpage D/3 to efficiency studies of the nationalised industries. It wasagreed that the following amendments should be made before theWhite Paper was published:(a) The first sentence of the White Paper relating to theDeclaration of Intent should be transferred to the end ofparagraph 1; and the Declaration should not be described as&quot; making history &quot;.(b) Page A.2, paragraph 5, line 3. Substitute &quot; long-term &quot; for&quot; permanent&quot;.(c) E.711, paragraph 2, line 3. For the present phrase In brackets, substitute &quot; (e.g. teachers, doctors and nurses)&quot;.id) E.711, paragraph 3, line 4. Maintain the reference to thepolice.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft attached to C (69) 158 as a basis for the informal consultations which the First Secretary was about to holdwith the CBI and TUC, subject to the amendment of paragraph 1of Section B as agreed in discussion. The draft would be further considered in the course of the following week by PI (F); and a revised version, in the form intended for publication, should be circulated to the Cabinet by the First Secretary not later than Friday,
5th December. The Cabinet would aim to consider the white paper on 8th December, with the intention of publishing it onWednesday, 10th December. The Orders activating Part II of thePrices and Incomes Act, 1966 should be laid very shortly before publication of the White Paper; and the First Secretary of state should finalise the arrangements for doing so in consultation withthe Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State (a) to circulate the draft attached to C (69) 158 to the cbi and the TUC as a basis for her informalconsultations with them, with paragraph 1 ofSection B amended as agreed in discussion;(b) to circulate a revised version of the White Paper inthe form in which it was proposed to publish it tothe Cabinet not later than Friday, 5th December;(c) in consultation with the Lord President, the lord privy Seal and the Chief Whip, to make arrangements on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up for the laying ofOrders activating Part II of the Prices and incomes act, 1966.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th November, 1969.
