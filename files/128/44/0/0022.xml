TheGovernmentand theParliamentaryLabour PartyCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet discussed relations between the Governmentand the Parliamentary Labour Party; the conclusions reached wereseparately recorded and copies were circulated only to The queen and the Prime Minister. A copy is kept in the standard file of theSecretary of the Cabinet.ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessIndustrialDisputes:House ofCommonsPapersCONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President informed the Cabinet that a strike among members of the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades (SOGAT)employed by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office was interfering withthe supply of Parliamentary papers to the House of Commons.Regular supplies were being obtained direct from the printers, butadditional copies could be obtained only from a warehouse whichwas closed by the strike. The Bills concerned were the Finance Bill,the Steel Bill, the Divorce Bill, and the Ponies Bill. Mr. Speaker hadruled that no contempt was involved, and, with his agreement,photocopying machines were being installed in the House ofCommons to augment supplies. The House was receiving a sufficient number of copies of Hansard, Order Papers and Amendments toBills, but none were available to the public at large.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that at present there was no prospect of an early end to the strike; and the fact that the official report and other Parliamentary papers were not generally availablewas giving rise to increasing public dissatisfaction. He proposed tomake a purely factual statement in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Lord President.(2) Agreed that the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should make afactual statementafternoon.in the House of Commons that10370A 2
confidential. The Prime Minister said that the Joint Meeting of theCabinet and the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party(NEC) on the following day would provide an opportunity for ministers to explain to members of the NEC their plans for dealingwith the practical issues of policy with which they were concerned.On departmental questions and on broader issues of policy for which members of the Cabinet bore collective responsibility, it would be convenient to leave the discussion to the Minister primarily concerned. The First Secretary of State would deal with any questions on the proposed legislation on industrial relations.Members of the Cabinet would, however, be free to express their individual views on relations between the Government and the partyas a whole. At a later date it might be useful to arrange a meetingof the Cabinet at which the Governments political strategy could besurveyed as a whole. The new Management Committee of theCabinet would also be particularly concerned with the management of the Governments business in the political context. TheCommittee would not take major decisions of policy or replaceexisting Cabinet Committees for this purpose; and its conclusionswould be periodically reported to Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.secret. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C (69) 44),covering the text of the latest message received from the Rhodesianregime, together with the text of our proposed reply, and a note bythe Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(C (69) 46), to which was attached the texts of previous exchanges.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that amemorandum had been received from the Rhodesian regime dated16th April. This made no attempt to bridge the gap between thetwo sides. Its object was manifestly to place the blame for an eventual breakdown on us; and it had evidently been drafted witha view to subsequent publication. A proposed reply to the Rhodesianmemorandum had been drafted and had been circulated for theconsideration of his colleagues (Annex B to C (69) 44). This draftmight also have to be published in due course. He. was also considering the publication of a White Paper or Blue Book giving a detailed account of the course of our discussions with the Rhodesianregime since the conclusion of ther talks in HMS Tiger. Material for
10370CC 22 (69)this was being collected: but it was not necessary to take a decisionimmediately. The Prime Minister had already suggested certaindrafting amendments to the draft reply primarily in order not topresent the regime&apos;s case in too favourable a light and to make itclear that we were not appealing to the regime to meet us. He had also two drafting amendments to propose himself. The object ofthese was to make it clear that our willingness to consider a variantof the referendum procedure proposed to the regime by the minister without Portfolio in Salisbury last November or, alternatively, aproposal that the entrenched clauses of the Constitution should beunamendable for a period of years, was contingent on agreement being reached on the other outstanding points of disagreement.Throughout the discussion, Mr. Smith, the leader of the Rhodesianregime, had been very ready to say what he could not accept, butunwilling to say what he could agree to. If the offer was to be made it would be essential to establish that he would accept our desiderataon the outstanding points in order to forestall any Rhodesian attemptto equivocate on them. Since the reply would probably have to bepublished, and might well constitute the final breaking point, it was important to make it clear on the one hand that we had stood firm on the Six Principles, and that on the other we had done everything possible, consistent with this, to achieve a settlement. We had todefend ourselves on both flanks not only from the suggestion that wehad abandoned the Six Principles but also from the charge of unnecessary intransigence on what might be represented as the secondary and unessential issue of a second, external safeguard.The Opposition in this country had made considerable play withthis latter point. It was important to carry them with us in orderto avoid giving the Rhodesian regime the impression that they need only wait until there was a Conservative Government in order toobtain a settlement.So far as the substance of the two proposals in the draft reply was concerned, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that,as he had pointed out on 1st May, the dropping of the &quot;sieving&quot;role of the Privy Council actually strengthened the second safeguardin that the requirement for a referendum would become automatic.The Prime Minister said that the proposed draft reply was notaimed at achieving a settlement on Fearless lines. Such a settlement was in any case ruled out by the terms of Mr. Smith&apos;s speech onthe previous day, in which for the first time Mr. Smith had publiclyadmitted that the proposed &quot; constitution &quot; would permanently rule out any prospect of majority rule in Rhodesia. The objective wasto forestall any allegations by the regime that the breakdown of thedialogue had been due to our intransigence and in particular to our
insistence on a second safeguard. He had stated in the House ofCommons that we were prepared to consider a second safeguardwhich would be purely internal to Rhodesia, and this remained theposition. This would meet the first of the two objections which mr. Smith had made during the Fearless talks, namely that a safe guard in which the Privy Council played a role would be external,though what we now intended to propose would not of course meethis second objection, namely that he could not accept a safeguardwhich was external to the Rhodesian Parliament and overrode its authority. The alternative proposal to rule out amendments to theentrenched clauses of the Constitution for a period of years hadoriginated with the South African Government. There was accordingly some merit in being able to tell the South Africans thatwe had put it to Mr. Smith and that he had rejected it; and this might influence the South African attitude towards the regime.Rumours had been current in this country that the British Governmentwere contemplating a &quot; sell-out&quot; on Rhodesia and even that he himself was intending to fly out to Salisbury to talk to Mr. Smith.It was important to counter these and to make our position clearpublicly. By doing so, we should both embarrass Mr. Smith andhearten the opposition in Rhodesia. In previous discussions it hadbeen suggested that the safeguards now proposed would be ineffectiveif the regime chose to ignore them: but this was equally true of previous proposals. If the regime, having agreed to a settlement andan independence constitution, decided to go back on its undertakings,there was no way in which it could be forced to observe them, though no doubt the matter could be taken to the United Nations andsanctions re-enforced. In any case, the question was academic, since mr. Smith was clearly not prepared to contemplate a settlement onany terms we could accept.In discussion it was argued that Mr. Smith&apos;s speech on theprevious day had demonstrated the impossibility of reaching agreement with the regime. If he had any serious intention of negotiating with us there might be some purpose in discussing withhim the points of detail raised in the Annex to the draft and inmaking the proposals in regard to the second safeguard set out inthe main body of the reply: but this was clearly no longer the case.While it was certainly desirable to carry the Opposition along with government policy to the extent possible, account had also to betaken of feeling in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Opinionsurveys after the talks in HMS Fearless had shown that there waswidespread agreement in the country at large that the Governmenthad gone as far as they could reasonably go to meet Mr. Smith, andthat they should go no further. While it was accepted that theproposals made in the draft reply did not in fact betoken a departure from the Six Principles, it was pointed out that in the Parliamentary
LegislationLeaseholdReform(previous reference:CC(67) 35thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (69) 47) about proposals for amending the leasehold reform Act, 1967.The Lord Chancellor said that the Home Affairs Committee had considered the cases for and against amending the provisions of the leasehold Reform Act, 1967, in the; light of two decisions by the lands Tribunal in which they had held that the price payable byan enfranchising leaseholder to his landlord should take account ofthe fact that the leaseholder was present in the market as a bidder.The significance of this was that only the leaseholder was in a positionto realise any value resulting from the marriage of the freehold andleasehold interests; consequently he might be prepared to pay a labour Party and elsewhere there was a general feeling that we had gone to the limit of concession. Misgivings would be increased ifwe were to say publicly that we were prepared to consider theabandonment of the last vestige of an external British safeguard,largely symbolic though it might be, which was represented by theprocedure for reference to the Privy Council. What was requirednow was a short and dignified reply regretting the absence of constructive proposals from the Rhodesian regime, rebutting anyRhodesian attempts to put the British Government in the wrong,and urging the regime to reflect seriously before taking the action they proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theproposed reply would clearly require revision. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should prepare a redraft in the light ofMr. Smith&apos;s speech and the points made in discussion, and circulateit as soon as possible to his colleagues for their comments. Thedraft should make the point for the record that we had been preparedto consider alternative proposals for a second safeguard, but shouldalso make it clear that this was not the only remaining point of disagreement.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to circulate to the Cabinet for comments a revised draft reply on the line indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
higher price than any other bidder. Both the ministerial committee on Legislation on Rent, Land Commission and leasehold enfranchisement (-11) and the Cabinet had clearly intended thatthe leaseholder should pay for the &quot; marriage value &quot;, and both theAct and the Lands Tribunals decisions had given effect to thatintention. The question now was whether to reverse that intention.The report stage of the Housing Bill, which was to be taken on19th May, would afford an early opportunity. The majority of theHome Affairs Committee considered that the Government would bein danger of forfeiting the political advantage gained by leasehold reform if they did not take this opportunity. As this would involvereversing the CabinetS earlier decision, he had brought the matter to them. In his view, the problem could best be solved by leaving the law as it stood, but by ensuring that legal aid was available inLands Tribunal cases about leasehold enfranchisement. At the bestrough estimate available this would cost only about  10,000 a year,and it would remove the only grievance of substance: that landownerswere extracting unjust prices from tenants, knowing that they were unlikely to face the expense of going to the Tribunal.In discussion it was pointed out that there was now considerable anxiety, in and out of Parliament, that the Act did not conform tothe Governments declared intentions on leasehold reform. The twodecided cases had induced landlords to hold out for higher prices,and there was evidence that leaseholders were being deterred from taking cases to the Lands Tribunal because they could not get legal aid. When the reform was introduced, the basic intention had been to ensure that the enfranchised leaseholder should pay for the valueof the land only and nothing for the bricks and mortar. assessing the price of enfranchisement by inclusion of the &quot; marriage value &quot;meant that some element of the value of the bricks and mortar wouldbe included. If this were not put right, the electoral consequences would be grave. On the other hand, the experience of only two cases in the Lands Tribunal, both in London where land values wereexceptionally high, gave no guide to the effect of the proposed change.We should, therefore, be legislating in the dark if the amendmentwas made in the Housing Bill, with possibly damaging repercussionsshould the expectations of the amendment not be fulfilled. It mightbe better to set up a working party to make sure that this time theamendment should be absolutely right, and if necessary to effect it by a separate Bill next Session. Furthermore, unless legal aid were provided, amendment would not remove the disincentive toleaseholders to see equitable valuations from the Lands Tribunal iflandlords still held out for excessive prices. The possibility of granting legal aid in these cases would need careful consideration,not so much on grounds of cost, but rather because of the questionsof principle involved.
CC22(69)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the majority view of the Home Affairs Committeethat the operation of leasehold reform should be changed to the moreapparent advantage of the leaseholder. The Home Affairs Committeeshould decide whether this should be done at once, by inserting an amendment in the Housing Bill, or whether after fuller examination by a working party, with a view to separate legislation, if legislation were deemed necessary, in the next Session, when it would have themaximum electoral impact. The Lord Chancellor should discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer the possibility of granting legal aid in enfranchisement cases before the Lands Tribunal and, if they agreed that this could be done, this fact should be taken into account in any detailed examination aimed at separate legislation, bearing that mind that it might obviate the need for a legislative remedy.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor(i) to arrange for the Home Affairs Committee to considerthe issue stated in the Prime Minister^ summing up;(ii) to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer on thepossibility of making legal aid available in casesbefore the Lands Tribunal concerned with leasehold enfranchisement.CabinetThe Releaseof official information(previous reference:CC(69) 12thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C (69) 43) about the release of official information.The Lord Privy Seal said that, following the Cabinefs briefdiscussion on 12th March of a memorandum by the Prime Minister(C (69) 21) about the release of official information, the parliamentary committee had considered it further and had invited him to indicatewhat might be included in a White Paper. A decision was needed,before the Report Stage of the Freedom of Publication (Protection)Bill on 16th May, on whether to publish a White Paper on the linesof the draft attached to C (69) 43 (the course he himself advocated),to make an oral statement of policy on similar lines, or to establish an outside inquiry either into the whole question of the release ofinformation and the working of the Official Secrets Acts or into thelatter alone; bearing in mind that an inquiry of either sort could well have an embarrassing outcome. In any event, the distinctionbetween the scope of authorised disclosures, and the consequences of unauthorised disclosure which alone were the concern of theOfficial Secrets Acts, should be made clear/
In discussion it was argued that, while there was some publicpressure for a public inquiry into the Official Secrets Acts, thepractical decision before the Cabinet was whether to make astatement or to issue a White Paper. The draft appended to C (69) 43made the Governments position clear, and it should carry greaterconviction than a relatively brief statement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a White Paper should be published on the linesof the draft annexed to C (69) 43. Any comments on the draft textshould be sent to the Lord Privy Seal for consideration. Thereshould be no outside inquiry into the working of the Official secrets acts.The Cabinet Approved the publication of a White Paper on the lines ofthe draft annexed to C (69) 43.AircraftIndustryThe EuropeanProject for a multi-roleCombatAircraft(previous reference:CC (69) 14thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET7. The Secretary of State for Defence said that at a meetingearlier in the day the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had agreed that we should proceed to the next stage of the Europeanproject for a multi-role combat aircraft. This stage, known as the project definition stage, would involve expenditure of  7 million overthe next two years; provision had already been made in defence estimates. The present commitment was to the project definitionstage only; and our further participation in the project would besubject to stringent and continuous scrutiny.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Defence.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th May, 1969.
