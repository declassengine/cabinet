The Cabinet resumed their discussion on industrial relations.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he and the first secretary of State had just come from the resumed discussion withthe General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) where,in accordance with the Cabinefs discussion on the previous evening,they had warned the Council that they judged that, if it proved impossible to reach a satisfactory agreement about the means by which the TUC themselves would deal effectively withunconstitutional strikes, the Government would have no alternative but to introduce legislation embodying &quot; penal clauses &quot;. They hadrefrained from implying that the Cabinet had necessarily taken afinal decision to this effect; nor had they specified any particular form which the &quot; penal clauses&quot; might take. But they had made it clear that they were not prepared to accept a document merelyinterpreting Rule 11 on the lines which the TUC had proposed; andthey had finally taken the initiative in suggesting that the General-Council should agree to a procedure whereby they would give asolemn and binding undertaking, subject to ratification by congress in the autumn, which in its wording would be the virtual equivalent of the more stringent formulation of Rule 11 proposed by theGovernment at an earlier stage, would thenceforward govern theGeneral CounciPs operation of Rule 11 in the form in which it hadbeen endorsed at the Special Congress on 5th June, and would havethe same binding force as the tuc&apos;s Bridlington principles and regulations. In return the Government would abandon their intention to introduce interim legislation in the current Session ofParliament and would not include &quot; penal clauses&quot; in any legislationintroduced during the present Parliament unless the autumnCongress failed to ratify the General Councils undertaking, in which event the Government would, of course, be free to reconsider their position.The General Council had unanimously agreed to give the required undertaking; and it was now for the,Cabinet to decide whether, for their part, they were prepared to endorse it as anadequate solution of the problem on the basis that he himself,together with the First Secretary of State, had already accepted it;The Cabinet would realise that this agreement, which was in effect the equivalent of the amendment of Rule 11 which had been their original objective, would not have been achieved unless the TUChad been allowed to understand very clearly that the only alternative was legislation incorporating &quot; penal clauses&quot;.    In the event,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex10405a 2
however, good sense had prevailed; and the final outcome could beregarded as a very significant advance in industrial relations. Itwas essential that it should be so presented to public opinion and that neither side should claim that its views had prevailed over those ofthe other.In discussion Ministers paid tribute to the skill with which thePrime Minister and the First Secretary of State had conducted thenegotiations and tendered warm congratulations to them on sosuccessful an outcome, which the Cabinet unanimously endorsed.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister, and endorsed the agreement which he and theFirst Secretary of State had reached with the general council of the TUC.ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessUpper ClydeShipbuildersLimited(previous reference:CC (69) 28thConclusions,Minute 2)OverseaAffairsSoviet-ChineseRelationsConference ofCommunistPartiesCONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.3. The Minister of Technology reported that the Board ofUpper Clyde Shipbuilders Limited had that morning accepted theterms on which the Shipbuilding Industry Board had offered to advance  5 million. It still remained, however, to obtain satisfactory assurances from the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Technology.4. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he hadreceived a call from the Soviet Ambassador, Mr. Smirnovsky, whohad informed him that the Soviet Government had proposednegotiations with the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of Chinaon the boundary dispute between them. The Soviet Governmenthad felt compelled to reject the Chinese Governmenfs contention that the boundary treaties were unequal or invalid; but they were willing to negotiate on the basis of the wishes of the inhabitants inthe disputed area. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hadtaken the occasion to remark that in the case of Gibraltar, her majesty&apos;s Government also stood by the relevant treaties andregarded the wishes of the inhabitants as the determining factor.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Sovietobjective at the recent Conference of Communist Parties in Moscowhad been to secure a condemnation of Chinese actions and policies.
In the event there had been no formal condemnation by theConference as such; but a number of individual speakers had beenhighly critical of the Chinese Communist Party. The SovietCommunist Party had been able to avoid acrimony in the debateabout Soviet policies towards Czechoslovakia; they had been assisted by the Czech Prime Minister, Mr. Husak, who had spoken in supportof Soviet policies. It had become clear that, while the new CzechGovernment would not yield further to Soviet pressure than theyhad to, they had already gone a long way towards meeting Sovietdemands and might find it necessary to go further. Taking theConference as a whole, Mr. Brezhnev, the General Secretary of theCommunist Party of the Soviet Union, had emerged from it with increased stature.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that M^Pompidou had been elected President of France with a substantial majority. He was a liberal Gaullist and a capable politician. It was probable that, while M. Pompidou was in office, the Presidency would continue to exercise the leading role in French affairs. We couldnot expect a rapid reversal of French attitudes towards UnitedKingdom membership of the European Economic Community(e.c.); and M. Pompidou was likely to prove a formidablenegotiator. Nevertheless, there were grounds for hope that his election would open the way to a new phase in our relations withthe Community. As regards other matters it might be difficult forM. Pompidou to maintain the previous Governments line onEast-West relations; and in the context of the Middle East disputehe was not personally pro-Arab. The British Ambassadors to the member countries of the e.c. were assembling in London shortly toreport their impressions of the new situation following M. Pompidou&apos;selection; and he would subsequently inform the Cabinet of the outcome.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary commented brieflyon the preliminary discussions which had taken place with the soviet ambassador about the possibility of the release of Mr. GeraldBrooke by the Soviet authorities in exchange for the release of Mr.and Mrs. Kroger from imprisonment in this country. He undertook to make a fuller report in due course.The Cabinet-Took note of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th June, 1969.
