OverseaAffairsGibraltar(previous reference:CC (69) 30lhConclusions,Minnie 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that six.Spanish warships were now concentrated in the vicinity of disputedterritorial waters near Gibraltar. Similar concentrations, though noton such a large scale, had occurred before. The Spanish action was probably intended as a response to the relatively large number of visits paid by British warships to Gibraltar recently.FederalRepublicof germany the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said i( now seemed likely that Heir Brandt would take office as Chancellor of the federal republic of Germany, with Herr Scheel as Foreign Minister. Thechange of Government would probably be reflected in greaterGerman enthusiasm for our entry into the European economic community; and in a more determined search for a betterrelationship between the Federal Republic and the Soviet Union.The new Government might also try to persuade the Powersoccupying West Berlin that the West Berlin representatives shouldbe given voting rights in the Bundestag in Bonn. Such a requestcould raise difficult political issues.middle east(previous reference:CC (69) 45 th conclusions,Minute 4)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the bilateraltalks between the United States and the Soviet Union on the content of a possible Arab/Israeli settlement had made only limited progress.It was likely that the Four-Power talks, which had been in abeyancewhile the bilateral talks were proceeding, would be resumed at aboutthe end of the month. The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee,at its meeting on 8th October, had agreed upon the guidelines to begiven to Lord Caradon, our representative at the United Nations, in preparation for the resumption of the Four-Power talks. Before we put forward any suggestions in the Four-Power discussions, therewould be consultation with the French and Americans.Mr. AnthonyGrey(previous reference:CC(69) 33rdConclusions,Minute I)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Mr. Grey,who had now been released by the Chinese, was now on his way toKarachi from Peking. From that point arrangements for hismovements would be in the hands of Reuters, his employers. Therewere still 12 British subjects detained in China, about whom we were making continuing representations to the Chinese authorities.10644The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.A 2
Defence and oversea PolicySupplyof WaspHelicoptersto SouthAfricaSECRET2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C (69) 124) about the supply ofWasp helicopters to South Africa.The Secretary of State for Local Government and Regionq(Planning said that, as President of the Board of Trade, he had been invited by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee to submit thepresent paper to the Cabinet. The Committee had considered thatthe issues raised by the proposal put forward by the official committee on Strategic Exports stemmed directly from the cabinets decision, taken on 18th December, 1967 (CC (67) 72nd Conclusions),on policy governing the supply of arms to South Africa, and couldbe resolved only by the Cabinet. The South African Government had asked us to supply Wasp helicopters to replace three of the tenhelicopters which had been supplied in 1964 and 1965 and to equipfurther British-supplied frigates in an anti-submarine role. the precedents were not clear. We had informed the South african government in May 1965 that we would be willing to consider the replacement of Wasp helicopters lost in accidents or throughmechanical defects; and some Wasp helicopters were in fact supplied in November of that year. On the other hand, Wasps had been included in the South African &quot; shopping list&quot; for maritime defence equipment which we had turned down in 1967.In discussion, it was pointed out that to turn down the requestmight be regarded by the South African Government as inconsistent with our previous practice of allowing the replacements necessary tothe maintenance of their maritime forces to be supplied. Moreover,the helicopters in question were designed and equipped for the anti-submarine role and could not, except at great expense, be adapted forpurposes (e.g. riot control) which would be repugnant to publicopinion in this country. If the South Africans required helicopters forsuch purposes they had large numbers of French machines available.On the other hand, it was argued that a decision to accept the ordermight be regarded as a partial reversal of the policy announced inDecember 1967, to which many Government supporters attached greatimportance. Such a decision would moreover be difficult to justify tothe United Nations, where the question of South Africa was likely to attract fresh attention in the near future.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet, while recognising the arguments on both sides, consideredthat on balance the proposal to supply Wasp helicopters to SouthAfrica should be rejected. To accede to it might create difficulties forour foreign policy in the United Nations and possibly elsewhere; itcould also cast doubts domestically on the firmness of our adherence to the policy on arms supply which we had announced in December1967.
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.SECRETIndustrialAffairsLondonDustmen&apos;strike(previous reference Terence:CC (69) 46thConclusions,Minnie 2)3. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in thestrike of London dustmen and other municipal workers. The localauthorities appeared to be dealing with the situation without too much difficulty and had still not sought assistance from the Government.There continued to be no evidence of any serious risk to public healthat this stage. On the other hand the forthcoming meeting between theemployers and the local authority manual workers to discuss thelatter&apos;s pay claim was unlikely to resolve the dispute; and in that casethe Transport and General Workers1 Union would probably seek tomake the strike official. At that point it might be necessary for theDepartment of Employment and Productivity to intervene; and theywere ready to offer their good offices.In these circumstances the Official Committee on Emergencieshad advised that there was no present need for the Government to take any overt action or to invoke emergency powers (the validity of whichin relation to the clearance of rubbish was in any case open to question). But they had suggested that it should be discreetlyascertained whether the Armed Forces could, if necessary, provideassistance.In discussion there was general agreement with these recom-mendations, on the understanding that enquiries about the extent towhich Service personnel and vehicles could be made available wouldbe conducted with great circumspection in order to prevent any premature disclosure that troops might have to be used. In particular,individual units should not be alerted or given any reason to suppose that they might be deployed. It might also be advisable for an official statement to be made to.reassure public opinion that there was nocurrent danger to health, provided that this could be done on the basisof adequate professional authority. At the same time the government must avoid any appearance of complacency in the face of a potentiallyserious challenge to the life of the community.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning to arrange for the Official Committee on emergencies to keep the situation under close review andto take such further precautionary measures as were required in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.
(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to arrangefor an official statement to be made in order to reassurepublic opinion about the alleged risk to health.IndustrialPolicyv previous reference:CC (69) 45thConclusions,Minute 5)IndustrialPolicySECRET4. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandum(C (69) 123) by the First Secretary of State concerning (a) industrial policy and (h) an Industrial Relations Bill. They also had before thema further memorandum by the First Secretary of State about an industrial Relations Bill (C (69) 135); and a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (69) 133), to which was attached a memorandum by officials dealing with certain issues arising from the Cabinefs previousconsideration of industrial policy.The First Secretary of State recalled that at their previous discussion there had been general support for the proposal to mergethe Monopolies Commission and the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI), subject to two important reservations: first, thatthere should be no derogation from the existing powers and responsibilities of sponsoring Ministers in relation to their industries;and second, that the existing arrangements for determining pay insensitive areas of the public sector would need to continue until new ones had been worked out in consultation with those affected. Onthe first point, she hoped that the note by officials attached loC (69) 133 made clear that the proposed merger would not in any wayderogate from, or indeed change, the existing powers and responsibilities of sponsoring Ministers. References to the proposed new Commission would be made jointly by the Minister responsiblefor it and the production Minister concerned; and responsibilityfor follow-up action on reports of the new Commission would be shared with the production Department in the private sector andwould rest solely with the sponsor Department, in the public sector.As regards the arrangements for determining pay in the sensitive areasof the public sector, the proposed merger did not affect the situation.The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Future Prices and Incomes policy was considering how greater co-ordination might be achieved here, buta decision to merge the Monopolies Commission and NBPI would notprejudge in any way future arrangements for determining pay. Thenew Commission resulting from the merger of the monopolies commission and the NBPI would not merely take over the existingactivities of each of these organisations but would expand them.There would be short-term enquiries lasting, say, three to four months into proposed mergers; specific price increases resultingfrom an apparent abuse of market power; and specific pay settlementswhich were in apparent defiance of the guidelines for incomes policy laid down by the Government. There would also be enquiries lasting,
say, six to nine months into, foe example, specific pay structures and price-fixing arrangements. More lengthy enquiries would beundertaken on the lines of those now carried out by the monopolies commission into monopoly situations, possibly including follow-upenquiries into previous major mergers; and there would also beefficiency studies of the nationalised industries on the lines of those for which the NBPI was at present responsible.In discussion, there was general agreement thai sonicrationalisation of the present functions of the Monopolies Commissionand of the NBPI was desirable. It was, however, suggested that thepresent proposals were deficient in some respects and in any event hadnot been adequately considered by Ministers. It would make no senseto divide responsibility for company law, /or industry andthe Industrial Reorganisation Corporation and for a new Commissiondealing with mergers and the public accountability of industrybetween three different Departments. There were other possible methods of rationalisation: the prices side of the N1JPI might, forexample, be transferred to the Monopolies Commission and the incomes side to an enlarged Commission lor Industrial Relations.Inadequate collective consideration had been given to Ihe proposedfunctions and powers of the new Commission. The case for hasteninga decision to proceed with the proposed merger appeared to be founded on the view thai it would greatly ease the transition from existing prices and incomes legislation to a new prices and incomes policy on the lines indicated by the First Secretary of State in hermemorandum It was clearly essential to reactivate Part II of thePrices and Incomes Act 1966 at I he end of this year, not only becauseof the Governmenfs commitment to the International monetary fund, but also because the Government could not retreat further fromtheir declared policies in face of trade union pressures. If was,however, unnecessary to pay a high price in order to secure Ihereactivation of Part II of the Act; and it was suggested that too higha price would have been paid if a hastily devised arrangement were now pressed through without full and detailed consideration being given by Ministers to the proposed functions and powers of the new commission and to the allocation of responsibilities between theDepartments concerned. As to future prices and incomes policy,Part. II of the 1966 Act should in any event remain in force throughout.1970; and the asymmetrical proposals by the First; Secretary of Statefor the period thereafter required further careful consideration. Asto presentation of any new Commission, it would be important tomake clear that the public accountability of industry was not in future to be the special preserve of a new Commission rather than ofproduction and sponsor Departments, if a reasonable degree of price stability particularly of food were to be secured over the next
12 months, it would be important to avoid any suggestion that during1970 prices but not incomes would be subject to continuing effective control. It must also be made clear that the existing arrangements for determing pay in sensitive areas of the public sector-for example of doctors- would continue unchanged unless and until new ones hadbeen worked out in consultation with those affected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that legislation should be introduced in the next session to merge the Monopolies Commission and the NBPI and that thereshould be a reference to this in fairly general terms in The Queen&apos;sSpeech. The merger would not affect the existing arrangements for determing pay in sensitive areas of the public sector; these would continue unless and until new arrangements had been worked out, inconsultation with those affected, in accordance with the Governmentsannouncement on 11th July, 1969. In presenting the merger, thedifference between the existing roles of the two bodies should be emphasised; and it should be made clear that there would be noderogation from the existing powers and responsibilities of sponsoringMinisters. The Ministerial Sub-Committee on Future Prices and incomes Policy should consider, in the light of their decision, the futured development of prices and incomes policy, including the relationship between the powers proposed for incomes and prices, and thetreatment of rents. The Official Working Party on Industrial Policyand the Monopolies Commission should prepare a report on thescope and content of the proposed legislation for consideration by theMinisters concerned.SThe Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the next session to merge the Monopolies Commission and theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the First Secretaryof State and the President of the Board of Trade, toprepare for the consideration of the Cabinet a draftpassage on (2) above for inclusion in The Queen&apos;s Speech.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Sub-Committee on Future Prices and incomes policy to consider the future development of prices and incomes policy and the treatment of rents on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.
B(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theOfficial Working Party on Industrial Policy and the monopolies Commission to prepare a report forconsideration by the Ministers concerned on the scope and content of the proposed legislation at (2) above.The First Secretary of State said that in C (69) 123 she had setout four alternative courses which were open to the Government inthe forthcoming Session (i) To introduce a Bill giving effect broadly to all those proposals in the White Paper &quot; In Place of Strife &quot; (Cmnd. 3888)which were not clearly ruled out by the 18th June agreement with theTrades Union Congress (TUC) (including- the proposals for compulsory registration and an independent review body).(ii) To introduce a Bill as in (i) but excluding the latter two proposals to which the TUC were strongly opposed.(iii) To introduce a more selective Bill which would be limitedto extending the protection afforded the individual employee in hisrelationship with his employer and his trade union, but which wouldomit proposals designed to strengthen trade union rights andbargaining powers (e.g. on trade union recognition and on the disclosure of information to trade unions by management).(iv) To have no Bill at all.Course (i) had certain advantages. But while the Governmentunderstood the agreement reached between the Prime Minister andthe TUC on 18th June as excluding the introduction during the life ofthe present Parliament of any legislation to impose penal sanctionsin the sort of circumstances which had been under discussion unofficial strikes and inter-union disputes-the TUC maintained thatit ruled out any legislation providing new statutory sanctions againsttrade unions or their members. In particular they claimed that theundertaking precluded the introduction of compulsory registration oftrade unions and of the independent review body to hear appeals bymembers against unfair or arbitrary action by their trade unions. Toproceed with these two proposals, therefore, would lead to charges ofbreach of faith and another direct confrontation with the TUC.While she had at first been attracted to course (iii), she had been advised that a limited Bill would be open to amendments at largefrom both sides of the House and so place the Government ina difficult and embarrassing situation. Failure to introduce a bill would be damaging politically and to the prospects of improving themachinery for collective bargaining.
She had therefore concluded that course (ii) was the right one in the circumstances. This might be represented as providing a charter for the trade unions without imposing any obligations on them and would be attacked on these grounds by the Opposition andby the Confederation of British Industry. But it would include anumber of valuable measures, notably the placing of the Commissionon Industrial Relations on a statutory basis, to which the trade unions were indifferent or opposed. Moreover, such a Bill would include allthe proposals in the White Paper except those for whichresponsibility had been devolved upon the trade unions themselvesunder the June agreement on their &quot; Programme for Action &quot;.In discussion it was suggested that course (i) was preferable. Thearguments for an increase in the accountability of the managers ofindustry which had been deployed in discussion of the proposed new industrial Commission applied equally to trade unions, who alsowielded considerable power in the economy and over individuals.Moreover, the genuine doubts which had earlier been expressed aboutthe enforceability of legal sanctions in the case of unofficial strikes and inter-union disputes did not apply to registration of unions or tothe independent review body. Moreover, it would be embarrassingif a Bill were introduced on the lines recommended by the first secretary of State and it then became clear that the TUC could motor would not carry out their undertaking to deal effectively withunofficial and inter-union disputes. If the difficulties of introducing a comprehensive Bill were considered insuperable, it might be preferable to have no Bill at all in the coming Session. Of the donovan recommendations which had attracted most public attention, the long-term improvement of machinery for collective bargaining was being pursued through the Commission on industrial relations; and immediate measures to deal with unofficial strikes and inter--union disputes were now the responsibility of the TUC.Moreover, amendments might well be carried in the House of lords to impose penal sanctions in certain cases; as the Bill could not beready for introduction for some months, there might be difficulties in finding the necessary Parliamentary time to re-amend the Bill in the commons.On the other hand, it was argued that the Government had announced their intention to introduce a Bill, and that it would bedifficult to defend not doing so, and so delay reforms which were already overdue. Courses (i) and (iii) were unacceptable for thereasons indicated by the First Secretary of State. If the trade unions were able in practice to implement the June agreement, course (ii)would be clearly defensible. If, however, it became clear in thecourse of the next few months that they could not do so, or if casesof unfair or high-handed treatment of members by their unions
secret. The Secretary of State for Social Services, reporting on theprogress of his negotiations with the pension interests on the termsof abatement to be included in the National Superannuation Bill, saidthat he had seen representatives of the pension funds, the Life Offices&apos;Association, the nationalised industries and the local authorities, aswell as the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI). The Bill would have to specify in respect ofthose contracted out of the State scheme both the amount by whichpensions should be abated and the amount by which contributionsshould be abated. There was agreement by all concerned, except the nationalised industries, that the measure of abatement of pensions should be 1 per cent. On the measure of abatement of contributions,the general view of the pension interests was that the figure shouldbe at least 1 - 5 per cent, compared with the 1 - 25 per cent which hehad offered; but nothing that had been said invalidated the argumentsSECRET10644 cNationalSuperannuationArrangementsfor contracting out of the earnings-RelatedPensionScheme(previous reference:CC(69) 44thConclusions,Minute 2)attracted public attention, it might be appropriate to add provisions to the Bill placing obligations on or regulating the conduct of tradeunions, for example by the establishment of an independent review body.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that an Industrial Relations Bill should beintroduced in the coming Session. There was general agreement thatthis should be a reasonably comprehensive Bill on the lines ofcourse (ii), as described by the First Secretary of State, though theywould have a further opportunity to consider whether it should befurther extended on the lines of course (i). They should, in any event,be prepared for the possibility that the TUC might demonstrablyhave failed to carry out their undertaking to deal with unofficial and inter--union disputes. It would be desirable, therefore, to have in reserve clauses placing obligations on or regulating the conduct oftrade unions. These reserve clauses could be introduced during thepassage of the Bill if the industrial and trade union situation at thetime made it seem desirable.The Cabinet (6) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.(7) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for theCommittee on Industrial Relations to consider the contents of an Industrial Relations Bill, together withreserve clauses, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up; and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.
of the Government Actuary, which would be set out in the proposed white Paper, that abatement by 1-25 per cent would be enough tomake contracting out possible, taking the field as a whole, though itwould provide no margin for profit. There were, however, two validarguments for adopting a higher figure. The first was that theprofitability of a scheme was much affected by the age structure ofits members; and a higher figure than 1-25 per cent would benecessary to prevent loss in the case of schemes, such as that of the mineworkers, which had an above average proportion of older members. The second reason for adopting a higher figure was thatthe expenses of medium and small schemes were inevitably higherthan those of large schemes, so that a figure above 1-25 per cent would make it possible for some of the smaller schemes to contract out their members. The Cabinet at their meeting on 11th Septemberhad authorised him to increase the measure of abatement ofcontributions to 1 - 3 per cent if necessary. He was convinced, aftertalking to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that this was the rightfigure to adopt; it should be high enough to attract a significantnumber of the smaller schemes. He felt bound, however, to warnhis colleagues that there would be widespread opposition to thedecision not to adopt a higher measure of abatement and that theinterests concerned would do their best to mobilise their membersagainst the Government; the CBI would very likely oppose theproposals as a whole. But he thought that it would be wrong toadopt a higher figure, even though this would reduce the opposition,because, as the TUC had pointed out, the effect of this would be total those subscribing to the State scheme in order to induce others to contract out of it. It would be necessary to set out in detail in theproposed White Paper the exact terms of abatement. He hoped tosubmit the White Paper to the Cabinet during the following week;there would be no previous intimation of the Governments decisionto those concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet took note of what the Social Services Secretary had said.They were agreed that the pensions of persons contracted out shouldbe reduced by 1 per cent and their contributions by 1 - 3 per cent.The Secretary of State should submit the proposed White Paper tothe Cabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.(2) Invited the Social Services Secretary to bring the draft of theWhite Paper on terms of abatement before the Cabinet assoon as possible.
LegislativeProgramme1969-70(previous reference:CC(69) 19thConclusions,Minute 5)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (69) 132) on the legislative programme forthe Session 1969-70.The Lord President said that the Ministerial Committee on future Legislation had reviewed the legislative programme for1969-70 provisionally approved by the Cabinet in April. TheCommittee had recognised that drafting capacity rather thanParliamentary time was likely to be the limiting factor next Session;and subsequent developments had aggravated the position. TheCommittee had recommended the dropping of some Bills from theprogramme and the addition of others urgently required, includingEqual Pay and Investment Grants for Ships. But if room was to befound for major Bills such as Industrial Commission in theprogramme, it would be impossible to proceed with others (e.g. LocalGovernment Reorganisation (Wales)). There were a number of bills in the programme on which substantial work remained to be done;and others on which no instructions had been submitted. He did not expect difficulty in keeping both Houses occupied until Christmas,but pressure on the draftsmen during the winter months would be extremely heavy; he was confirmed in that view by a talk the previous day with First Parliamentary Counsel. He hoped, however, that ata later stage it might be possible to accommodate some shorter Bills,such as Civil Aviation and perhaps Registration of Employers and self-Employed in the Construction Industry, the drafting of whichpresented less of a problem.In discussion, the following main points were made (a) As it was impossible to say when the Election would be held,it would be reasonable for The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament to promise rather more legislation than could be passed in a Session of normal length.(b) There was a strong political case for Civil Aviation and for registration of Employers and Self-Employed in the construction industry.(c) A Bill would be necessary to implement the cabinets decision to recover the full cost of hospital treatment in road trafficaccident cases from the insurance companies, though it wouldprobably be better not to mention this in The Queen&apos;s Speech.(d) The limit on guarantees under the Shipbuilding Industry Act1967 would have to be raised if this facility was to continue.(e) Public Service Superannuation would have to be the subjectof a separate Bill.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals of the Lord President subject to thedecisions which had already been taken about Industrial relations and Industrial Commission and to Public Sector Superannuation and road Traffic Act 1960 (Amendment) being included in the main programme; a decision on Local Government Reorganisation (Wales)would be taken when the urgent review of policy now under way was complete. The Cabinet took note that the Lord President hoped tofind time at a later stage for some shorter Bills such as Civil aviation and Registration of Employers and Self-Employed in theConstruction Industry; and the Ministers concerned should ensurethat outstanding policy issues were settled as soon as possible and instructions prepared. The Lord President should review theprogress of Bills in the main programme at frequent intervals toensure that full use was made of any drafting resources and parliamentary time which might become available. He should alsoarrange to revise the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament in the light of their discussion and submit it to theCabinet.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (69) 132, subject to the points mentioned in the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President to keep the progress of theprogramme under review in the light of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th October, 1969.
