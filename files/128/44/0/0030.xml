CC 30 (69)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Chief Whip said that the choice by the Opposition of thecharges for dentures and spectacles as a topic for debate on Tuesday,1st July, was contrary to an understanding reached with theOpposition Chief Whip that, in view of the national importance ofthe Investiture of the Prince of Wales in Caernarvon Castle on that day and the subsequent absence of a number of members of theHouse, the Opposition would choose a non-controversial subject fordiscussion. The Chief Whip was in touch with the Opposition chief whip about this and it was possible that a different topic would be chosen.The Prime Minister said that he would take part himself in the debate on industrial relations to be initiated by the Opposition on 3rd July; and when the Opposition motion had been put down would consider, in consultation with the First Secretary of State, the lord president and the Chief Whip, whether the Government should movean amendment.The Prime Minister said that the arrangement of business in theweek beginning 7th July would require some care to ensure both thatthe Finance Bill reached the House of Lords a month before the recess, as was customary, and that the Representation of the People(Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill passed through the House ofCommons early enough to reach the Statute Book before the Recess.The Lord President and the Chief Whip should discuss thearrangements with the Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary,Treasury.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had decided,after consultation with the Paymaster General, to create a new post of Chief Information Adviser to the Government, and to appointMr. Trevor Lloyd-Hughes, at present Press Secretary at 10 downing street, to fill it. Mr. Lloyd-Hughes would be in the Cabinet Officeand would be succeeded as Press Secretary by Mr. J. T. W. Haines.The Ministerial Committee on Home Publicity, under theChairmanship of the Paymaster General would continue tobe responsible for the presentation of the Governments long-termdomestic policies, but would be assisted by a new Official committee consisting of the Chief Information Officers of the majorDepartments, under the Chairmanship of the Chief InformationAdviser. The Chief Information Adviser would also be Chairman of
the Official Committee on Government publicity which undertookthe short-term planning and co-ordination of Government announce-ments. The Chief Information Adviser would work in close contact with the Paymaster General and would have direct access to thePrime Minister. He would be available to any Minister who wishedto consult him on long-term aspects of Government publicity. Inhis new capacity, he would retain the responsibility for advising onradio and television appearances which he previously had as PressSecretary. Day-to-day business would be handled as at present bythe Press Secretary.In discussion reference was made to the report in The Times that morning that relations between the Prime Minister and the chief whip were strained as a result of the part the Chief Whip had playedin the Cabinefs discussion of industrial relations. Damaging material of this kind continued to appear in the Press and yet Ministers wereinhibited by the restraints within which they worked from giving thepublic information creditable to the Government, for example aboutthe thorough manner in which important issues were consideredthrough the system of Cabinet Committees. They might usefullydiscuss whether enough information was disseminated about theworking of Government; and whether restraints on Ministerialappearances at by-elections or on television were necessary.The Prime Minister agreed that it might be useful to consider some of these issues further. The Cabinet had invited the paymaster general on 12th November, 1968 (CC (68) 46th Conclusions,Minute 1), to arrange for the Home Publicity Committee to examine whether any further guidance should be given to Ministers aboutparticipation in broadcast programmes, and their recommendations would be coming forward shortly. As to the report in The Timesthat morning about the part played by the Chief Whip in their discussions on industrial relations, the Chief Whip had already issued a denial. He himself had been much disturbed by the briefing of thePress which had continued during and after his discussions with theGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). The outcome of the discussions had afforded an opportunity for members of theCabinet to defend the settlement as a Government achievement; butthe opportunity had not been taken and the Press had been assisted by continued systematic briefing to present the outcome asa Government surrender. He did not intend to activate the leakprocedure on this occasion, however, since the information availableto him from a number of sources enabled him to deal with the matterhimself.
OverseaAffairsMr. GeraldBrooke(previous reference:CC (69) 29thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET*2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed hiscolleagues of recent developments in regard to Mr. Gerald Brooke.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as he hadalready informed his colleagues, the Soviet Government had beencontemplating bringing further charges against Mr. Gerald Brooke,the British lecturer arrested in April 1965, and sentenced to one year&apos;simprisonment and four years&apos; detention in a labour colony. Whenhe had learnt of this he had caused the Soviet Ambassador in london to be informed that, should Mr. Brooke be subjected to a further trial and sentence, there would be no possibility of the release before 1974of Mr. and Mrs. Kroger, the two Soviet agents sentenced to 20 years&apos;imprisonment in 1961 for their part in the Portland spy case. If,however, it were agreed that Mr. Brooke would be released at the endof his current sentence, we would be prepared to discuss the matterof the Krogers further. The way had thus at any rate by implicationbeen opened to discussion of an exchange of Mr. Brooke forthe Krogers. Subsequently, the Russians had taken this up and had asked for clarification in terms of dates. Mr. Brooke&apos;s currentsentence would expire in April 1970, by which time the Krogers wouldhave served nine years of their sentences, and might be considered fora remission of the remainder. We had accordingly proposed to theSoviet authorities that if they would release Mr. Brooke on or about1st September, 1969, we should release the Krogers on or about1st April, 1970. The Soviets had refused this on the grounds that therelease date for the Krogers was too late and the gap between the twoproposed releases too long. They had then proposed the release ofMr. Brooke on 1st July, 1969, and that of the Krogers on 1st October,1969.In his view there was a convincing case for accepting the Sovietoffer. Humanitarian considerations, on which a .decision to accept it would have primarily to be based, argued strongly in favour of acceptance: Mr. Brooke&apos;s health was bad. The Soviets seemed fullydetermined to bring him to trial again if we did not accept, and acceptance of the Soviet proposal offered in his judgment the only practical means of securing the release of Mr. Brooke and avoiding the genuine hardship and the public outcry which would result if mr. Brooke were to receive a further sentence, as he almost certainlywould if he were tried again, In view of the Press leakages whichhad occurred, it would be easy for the Soviets if we refused their offer to attribute the prolongation of Mr. Brooke&apos;s ordeal to Britishobduracy. Account had also to be taken of possible repercussions on10406A 3
Anglo-Soviet relations, though it would be inadvisable to make too much of them in our public presentation of the case. If the soviet authorities retried Mr. Brooke for alleged violation of prisonregulations and sentenced him to a further term of imprisonment ordetention, we could not let this pass, and we might be forced to takeretaliatory measures. These would have an adverse effecton Anglo-Soviet relations at a juncture when it was important for usto be able to play a full and effective part in the dialogue between Eastand West, for example in the context of the forthcoming discussions between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic armslimitation; of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation^ considerationof the Budapest Declaration by the Warsaw Pact Powers on european security; and of the Four-Power talks between the United States, theUnited Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union on the Arab-Israelproblem. In making his recommendation, he had taken full accountof the Home Secretary&apos;s earlier view that it would be difficult toexplain to public opinion why the Krogers should be released before they had served a reasonable proportion of their sentence. He had also given careful consideration to the argument that in accepting theSoviet offer we might be held to be yielding to blackmail andpresenting the Soviets with the opportunity of securing the release ofany of their agents whom we might arrest in future, since they wouldin that event only have to arrest some innocuous British visitor tothe Soviet Union, charge him with some trivial offence, and offer totrade the innocent against the genuinely guilty. But the &quot; hostage &quot;technique was a well-established Soviet practice, and it was unlikelythat the Soviets would abandon it, even if we held out overMr. Brooke. Repugnant though it was to yield to pressures of this nature, both we and others for example the United States in thecase of the USS Pueblo had been forced for humanitarian reasons to do so. We had indeed kept the United States informed of developments in the present case, and they had indicated that theywere content to leave us to judge how best to proceed.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary added that if it were agreed in principle that he should seek an arrangement on the basisof the Soviet offer, he would attempt, as a makeweight, to secure agreement also on a number of subsidiary matters, for example, the detention of two British subjects on charges of drug smuggling andthe grant of visas to two British subjects who wished to marry Sovietgirls.In conclusion, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarypointed out that if the decision to release Mr. Brooke and the Krogerson the lines proposed were taken and publicly announced, this mightwell lead to renewed pressure for the release of Mr. Anthony Grey,the British journalist at present held under house arrest by the
Chinese authorities in Peking. Here too, there was an element ofexchange, in that it was now probable that Mr. Grey would be freedas soon as the Chinese journalists under detention in Hong Kongwere released. The sentences imposed on the latter had been reducedso far as legal procedures permitted. The Chinese journalists would all be released in September, with the exception of one who would be released early in October. The Governor, whose judgment inthis matter had proved to be sound and should be accepted, was anxious, both for legal reasons and for reasons of security, not tobring the release date further forward, and it would be unfortunate if he were subjected to pressure which he would be bound to resist.In discussion, it was pointed out that while full weight had to begiven to humanitarian considerations and to Mr. Brooke&apos;s state ofhealth, we should by agreeing to the Soviet proposal, be yielding toblackmail. If the Soviets could recover two valuable agents in exhange for a British subject who had committed no real offencethey would score, and would be seen to have scored, a notable success.Moreover, an exchange of this kind would lay British visitors opento the sort of dangers to which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had alluded. Another time, it might not be possible tojustify an exchange on the ground that, as in the present case, theSoviet agents had already served a substantial part of their sentence.It was conceivable that the Soviet authorities, who must realise thatthe usefulness of the Krogers as agents was at an end, might, if weadopted a firmer attitude, be less adamant in insisting on the earlyreturn of the Krogers. With regard to the misgivings expressed bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in the context of Anglo-Soviet relations, it was pointed out that in other instances, for examplethat of the Spanish campaign of harassment of Gibraltar, wehad considered taking counter-action, but had been restrained from doing so by the danger of damaging broader political relations andworsening the position of those we were trying to help. similar considerations might apply in this case. If the Krogers (who werePolish nationals) were released after serving only part of theirsentence, it might become necessary to consider the position of Britishsubjects, for example Vassall and Miss Gee, who had been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for similar offences. In thisconnection, it was pointed out that in recent years sentences in theBritish courts for offences involving espionage had tended to becomeheavier. It might also become necessary to review the position ofthose who had been given very long sentences for other offences, forinstance those involved in the mail train robbery of 1963.On the other hand, support was expressed for the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s view that the &quot; hostage &quot; technique wasa well-established Soviet device. It was unlikely that by standing out
against it in this particular instance we should succeed in inducing the soviets to abandon it. While there was force in the argument thatthe danger of the arrest of British visitors to the Soviet Union whowere innocent or had committed offences which were trivial byWestern standards might be increased, this could be met by warningsto intending visitors to the Soviet Union or by imposing restrictionson such visits. Though the Soviet insistence on the early release ofthe Krogers might be a bluff, such evidence as we had indicated thecontrary, and that the Soviet authorities genuinely intended to bringMr. Brooke to a fresh trial. If we had to engage in reprisals we should get the worst of both worlds, in that damage would be done to Anglo-Soviet relations at a crucial juncture without in any way advancingour prospects of securing Mr. BrookeS release. In view of what had become publicly known about our discussions with the Soviets itwould be difficult to withdraw from the discussions or to counter thecharges of British obduracy which might be made on the linesreferred to by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.Further discussion turned on the means by which the Krogersshould be released. It appeared, from recent reports of their stateof health, that there was no basis for releasing them on medical grounds. Release on parole would not be appropriate since theywould leave the country; and a free pardon would not be appropriate,nor, with its implications that they were not guilty of the offences ofwhich they were convicted, would it be acceptable to public opinion.A recommendation that the remainder of the sentence be remittedby the exercise of. the Royal prerogative might be the most suitablecourse.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,although there was clearly a division of opinion, the majorityappeared to be in favour of proceeding on the lines advocated bythe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and accepting the soviet proposal. As regards the form of the Krogers1 release, it was clearly desirable to avoid any implication that they had been wrongfullyimprisoned. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theHome Secretary should agree on an appropriate procedure, andshould also concert the terms of a statement in the House ofCommons, which should not be made until Mr. Brooke had returnedto this country.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theHome Secretary to take the action indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC(69) 15thConclusions,Minute 5)Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (69) 27thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wouldprobably be answering a Private Notice Question that afternoon onthe closure of the Algeciras ferry.The Cabinet-(3) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th June, 1969.The Cabinet discussed the situation in Nigeria.It was noted that the relief situation in the rebel-held area was again giving cause for concern. Although some deliveries of suppliesby air were taking place, the key to the problem lay in opening up aland route. The Federal Governments attitude to the relief problemhad inevitably been influenced by the recent activities of Swedish-manned aircraft operating on the rebel side. It might at some stage be desirable to consider asking Lord Hunt to visit Nigeria again and advise on how best to ensure the relief supplies continued to How.
