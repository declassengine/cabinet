ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusiness -MatrimonialProperty BillNorthernIrelandCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Attention was drawn to the embarrassment which might beoccasioned by the debate on the Second Reading of the MatrimonialProperty Bill on the following day. The Bill, which had been introduced by a Private Member, had been widely welcomed as a means of protecting the interests of wives, particularly thosedivorced under the new Divorce Reform Bill; but the legislation committee had agreed that it should not be allowed to receive aSecond Reading. The Bill appeared to be consonant with government policy, and it.would be helpful if the Chief Whip, in asking Ministers to be available in case of a vote, would draw their attention to the reasons why such a Bill could not be accepted.The Bill was in fact so defective that it could not be amended in committee; and a reform of the law on married womens property was already the subject of consideration by the Law Commissionwho were likely to produce legislation which could be introduced in a later session. The grounds for opposing the present Bill wereconvincing, and it was important that they should receive publicitysufficient to persuade those who might otherwise misunderstand theGovernments refusal to accept the Private Member&apos;s Bill.In further discussion it was suggested that there might be pressure in the House of Commons for a debate on the situationin Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,Captain Terence 0&apos;Neill, had, however, recently announced hisGovernments intention to advise the Governor to appoint anindependent commission on the recent disorders in NorthernIreland, and it was important both to his Governments positionand to the work of the commission that there should be no suggestionthat either was acting under pressure from Westminster. In thesecircumstances, it would be preferable to defer a debate until thecommission had completed their work, which was expected to be in three or four months&apos; time.oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference :CC (69) 4thConclusions,Minute I)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theprocedural arguments at the Paris meetings on Vietnam had been settled, thus opening the way for substantive discussions to begin.He had learnt in confidence from Mr. Averell Harriman, the formerUnited States representative at the talks, that the Soviet ambassador in Paris had told Mr. Harriman that he had been exerting strong
middle east(previous reference :CC (69) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)pressure on the North- Vietnamese to reach agreement on procedure and seating arrangements before Mr. Cabot Lodge, PresidentNixon&apos;s nominee as United States representative, took over. TheNorth Vietnamese were now trying to spread the idea that there could be no progress until a &quot; peace cabinet&quot; had been formed in Saigon. This was probably an attempt to put a strain on UnitedStates-South Vietnamese solidarity. The talks were likely to beprotracted, and the pattern of continuing deadlocks suddenlyresolved, as in this instance, was likely to continue. Meanwhilethere had been no major change in the military situation in Vietnamitself.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatcommunications had been received from both the Soviet Union andFrance setting out proposals for a further attempt to resolve theArab/Israel problem. The Russians had in fact put forward two documents: one giving an analysis of the situation which was heavilybiased against Israel, and another putting forward concrete proposals.He had told the Soviet Ambassador that we did not accept the implications of the Soviet analysis. He would be giving the SovietEmbassy a considered reply to the Soviet proposals later that day.This would be on the lines that Her Majesty&apos;s Government consideredthat the Soviet proposals contained constructive elements but that further clarification was required on some of the proposals. Inparticular, the British Government would wish to know more aboutthe form and status of the document which it was intended shouldemerge from the discussions proposed by the Soviets. The Sovietproposals also mentioned free passage through the Gulf of Aqabaand the Straits of Tiran. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryintended to tell the Soviet Embassy that, in the light of the security council Resolution, he assumed that the same principle would applyto the Suez Canal also. The Soviet proposals represented a more serious attempt at a constructive solution than had ever before beenmade by the Soviet Government; and they should be looked at inthat light.The French proposal was for a four-Power conference at thelevel of Permanent Representatives to the United Nations. It was his intention to suggest that Dr. Jarring, the Special Representativeof the United Nations Secretary-General, should also be invited toany such meeting, since it was important to avoid any implication that the four major Powers were attempting to take the Arab/Israelproblem out of the hands of the United Nations. He would be discussing the matter urgently with the United States Government.Shortly before leaving office, Mr. Dean Rusk, the former UnitedStates Secretary of State, had indicated that in his view there wasno harm in the French proposal, but it was not yet known what theattitude of the new Administration would be.
nuclear energy :CivilApplications :Gas CentrifugeDevelopmentandCollaboration(previous reference :CC (68) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary added that therehad been a number of reports that Israel was planning further majorattacks on her neighbours. There was no evidence that these reports were accurate, though if Israel herself were attacked there was nodoubt that she would retaliate very vigorously. It was possible thatthe stories were being spread by the Iraqis or by Soviet diplomatic missions in the Middle East.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary recalled that at their meeting on 10th December, 1968, the Cabinet had approved the agreed Minutes of a meeting which had taken place at The Hagueon 25th November between Dutch, German and British Ministersabout gas centrifuge collaboration, with the qualifications that wewere prepared to collaborate only in arrangements that werecommercially viable and that we must remain free, if we wished, toset up a gas centrifuge plant in this country to meet our own requirements. There had subsequently been a tripartite meetingof officials in Bonn on I9th-20th December at which a number ofworking parties had been set up, and there would be a further meeting of officials in the following week. Thereafter, and before a tripartite Ministerial meeting which was planned for late February,a full report on the results of the official talks would be made to theCabinet.In discussion, the Cabinet were informed that, althoughinsufficient information was yet available on which to reach decisions on the proposed collaboration, it was clear that we needed enricheduranium earlier than the Germans, who did not therefore wish toproceed as rapidly as we did with a centrifuge programme.Preliminary indications on the technical side were that the Dutchwere broadly at the same stage of development as ourselves andthat the Germans were not as far advanced. The Dutch might therefore be the natural partners for us technically. As regardsclassification of information about centrifuges, we had given theAmerican authorities a memorandum setting out our views. Theyhad indicated that they were unlikely to give us a reply before theend of February and the proposed tripartite Ministerial meeting might therefore have to be postponed. Attention was drawn to anarticle which had appeared that day in The Times dealing with thepolitical and military implications of the gas centrifuge process.Although the article&quot; did not add to the information which had alreadyappeared in technical publications, it was desirable that a suitable opportunity should now be found to make an authoritative statementof Government policy on the gas centrifuge.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
IndustrialAffairs(previous reference :CC (68) 46thConclusions,Minute 3)Inter-UnionDispute withinthe BritishSteelCorporationCONFIDENTIAL3. The First Secretary of State said that the inter-union disputewithin the British Steel Corporation (BSC) had been considered onthe previous day by the Trades Union Congress (TUC), which had invited the unions involved to suspend the industrial action proposeduntil the TUC had had an opportunity to discuss the problem further with the unions and to make proposals. The Finance and general purposes Committee of the TUC would be seeing the clerical andthe manual workers&apos; unions separately, the latter on the afternoon of Friday, 24th January. Mr. Dai Davies, Secretary of the Iron andSteel Trades Confederation, had not dissented from the TUC decisionto issue this invitation, but would give no assurance of its acceptance by the manual Workers&apos; unions. If the invitation were refused on24th January, this would leave very little time for intervention beforeindustrial action was due to begin at midnight on Saturday,25th January, but she would in those circumstances meet the union representatives involved during the course of 25th January. It wasnot possible at this stage to predict the outcome.The Prime Minister said that the Secretary of State for economic affairs had been asked to co-ordinate inter-departmental contingency planning to deal with the industrial consequences of a strike.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the First Secretary of Stateand by the Prime Minister.Prices andIncomesPay of doctors and Dentistsand of Teachers(previous reference :CC(66) 21stConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (69) 8) about proposed increases in the pay of doctors and dentists and of school-teachers, and by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C (69) 13) on the pay of school-teachers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the recommendationsof the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration werewithin the ceiling set by the incomes policy but they were based upon general comparability with other salaries and thus ran counter tothe recent recommendations by the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) on the pay of university teachers, in which this principle had been rejected. The proposal for a pay awardamounting to 7 -1 per cent for school-teachers did not fall within the incomes policy ceiling, since the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes had not accepted the argument that 1 per cent of this proposed award, which would pay for more senior posts in primary schools, should not be counted for the purpose of calculating the size of the increase.   The principal argument for agreeing to
CC5(69)7*1 per cent was the need for reaching agreement within the burnham Committee. The recent upward trend of wage and salary increases underlined the continuing need for great restraint.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the review body&apos;s recommendations were within the incomes policy ceiling, andthe issue was the basis upon which the award was recommended.For dentists, there were very careful costings of the fees for services which, in effect, amounted to payment by relation to work done.For doctors, the basis taken was comparability with other professionsand with wages and salaries generally. Rejection of the principleof comparability would not be acceptable to those concerned unless a satisfactory alternative principle for determining pay for doctors and others in the public sector were substituted; however, none had yet been found. In any event, comparability seemed a particularlyacceptable criterion to use in determining the pay of those like the doctors, but unlike university teachers who were not being recruitedor retained in adequate numbers. There had been no assurance tothe medical profession that the Review Body&apos;s recommendations would not be referred to the NBPI, but the profession had been assured that any such reference would be preceded by consultationwith the Review Body and the profession.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that ifthe Burnham Committee agreed upon an award for teachers&apos; pay,the Government were obliged to implement it; if there wasdisagreement, arbitration followed and an arbitration award couldbe set aside only by an affirmative resolution of both Houses ofParliament. The wide difference between the teachers&apos; initial claim and the maximum of 6J per cent permissible within the incomes policy ceiling had been reduced to the 1 per cent which was at issue.This could properly be regarded as regrading for increasedresponsibility which within any other part of the public or private sectors would be regarded as a decision by management aboutstructure and not as an element of a pay settlement requiring to be confined within incomes policy limits. It would not be possible, ashe had previously thought, to persuade the teachers&apos; representatives on the Burnham Committee to accept a five months&apos; postponement of the operative date for the 1 per cent and thus bring it within the incomes policy ceiling. It was desirable to achieve a settlement onthis occasion rather than to force the issue to arbitration. nothing would be achieved by a reference at this stage to the NBPI.Doctors and Dentists. In discussion of doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay, it was argued thatthe principle of comparability had not hitherto been examined insufficient depth and that it was applied differently by the various
bodies concerned with pay in the public sector. The arrangementsfor co-ordinating advice on pay in the public sector needed to be improved and the present recommendations from the Review Bodyoffered an opportunity for doing so. Acceptance of the review body&apos;s recommendations should be accompanied by a statement thatthis would be the last time that there would be unco-ordinatedarrangements for settling public sector pay.On the other hand, it was argued that any public statementimplying a total re-shaping of the present arrangements governingpublic sector pay would provoke widespread anxiety among those concerned. Before making any such statement the Departmentsconcerned, with the assistance of the NBPI, should make a thoroughconfidential investigation of the principle of comparability and possible alternative criteria for assessing public sector pay.Alternatively, or subsequently, it might be desirable to establish a public inquiry. One consequence of accepting the Review Body&apos;srecommendations would be the need to include within the scope ofthe NBPFs current examination of armed forces&apos; pay the pay of doctors and dentists in the Services, who were already being paidless than civilian doctors.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet approved the recommendations of the review body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration. They also agreedthat, within a week of the announcement of the Governmenfsacceptance of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations, but afteradvance notification to those concerned, including the Review Bodyitself, a further statement should be made that the government intended to work out new arrangements to co-ordinate advice on pay in the relevant area of the public sector. This advice would cover the use of comparability as a criterion.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations of the Review Body onDoctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, to arrange for(a) consideration to be given to the form of the new arrangements required to co-ordinate advice on payin the public sector;(b) preparation of a statement about the governments intentions as indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up, and its prior communication to the bodies concerned.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the currentreview by the NBPI of pay in the Armed Forces to dealwith the pay of Service doctors and dentists.
reorganisation of the PortsDraft white paper(previous reference :CC (68) 31stConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (69) 12) to which was attached a draft White Paper onthe reorganisation of the ports.The Minister of Transport said that the proposals in the draft white Paper had been approved by the Parliamentary Committee.The scope of the proposals had been limited by the need to avoid a hybrid Bill. The proposals for compensation, which had not been circulated, had been agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The White Paper indicated, inter alia, that unification of all pilotagewas desirable, and he would be consulting Trinity House and theother interests involved about proposals to this end, which wouldbe the subject of separate legislation from that required togive effect to the other proposals in the White Paper.   He nowTeachersIn discussion of the proposals for teachers&apos; pay, it was generally agreed that the complementing of senior staff in primary schoolsshould be regarded as a normal management function not to be takeninto account in determining whether a pay settlement fell within the incomes policy ceiling. . However, the proposals for providing additional senior posts in primary schools should be carefully considered in order to ensure that they were not simply concealedincreases in pay for carrying out the same work. There would,however, be difficulty in ensuring that an agreement in the burnham committee to a 7-1 per cent pay increase was not wrongly taken as signalling the Government&apos;s willingness to find a pretext forapproving pay increases outside the incomes policy ceiling.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet approved the proposal to increase the offer made within the Burnham Committee to 7-1 per cent including theincreased responsibility payments in primary schools. The questionof a possible reference to the NBPI of the structure of teachers&apos; paycould be explored in due course.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science to seek agreement within the Burnham Committee on apay increase for school-teachers of 7-1 per cent from 1st April, 1969: this increase would include the costof additional payments for posts carrying special responsibility in primary schools.
proposed to publish the White Paper on 29th January in order toavoid a clash with the White Paper on National Superannuation and social Insurance which would be published on 28th January.In discussion, it was suggested that there should be a longerinterval than one day between the publication of the two white papers. On the other hand, there were objections to publication on30th and 31st January and later.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the White Paper. The Lord President should agree, if possible, with the Minister of Transport and the Secretaryof State for Social Services a suitable date for publication of thatWhite Paper; and would refer the issue back to him if he were unsuccessful.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft White Paper on Reorganisation of the ports attached to C (69) 12.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the Ministerof Transport and the Secretary of State for social services, to arrange a suitable date for the publicationof the White Paper.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd January, 1969.
