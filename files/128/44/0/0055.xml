ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessOverseas AidPolice BillContinuanceof the Murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act 1965(previous reference :CC (69) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)CC 55 (69)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The line to be taken in the debate on a Private Member&apos;s motion on overseas aid on Friday, 28th November, would be considered inthe light of the discussion in the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy on the aid programme on Monday, 24th November.There might be advantage in tabling a Government amendment to the Police Bill to make it clear that police officers from forces inGreat Britain serving with the Royal Ulster Constabulary would notbe required to enforce the powers provided by the Northern IrelandSpecial Powers Act. The implications for the position of the Army,which already carried out operations under the Act, would, however,need to be carefully considered.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider with the defence secretary the desirability of tabling an amendment to thePolice Bill on the lines indicated in discussion and toreport to the Cabinet at their next meeting if they were unable to agree.It was proposed to table a Motion in the House of commons on the abolition of the death penalty on 8th December and to debateit on the 17th. It was important that the subject should also be debated in the House of Lords before the Christmas Recess. Therewas no reason why the debates should not take place in both Houseson the same day; but in accordance with accepted practice it wouldbe necessary to give the Upper House at least two weeks&apos; noticeof the debate.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to give notice in the House ofLords on 4th December that the House would debate theabolition of the death penalty on or about 17th December.
SECRETOverseaAffairsThe falkland islands(previous reference:CC (68) 51stConclusions)Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 1)Operations ofthe BritishPetroleumCompany in theUnited States2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theArgentine Government had agreed that the annual letters whichthe two Governments address to the Secretary-General of the united nations, reporting progress in their discussions on the problem ofthe Falkland Islands, should this year contain a reference to separatetalks on the improvement of communications between the islands and the Argentine. This was an advance, from our point of view,since the Argentines had hitherto refused to discuss this issue in isolation from that of sovereignty. The Governor of the falkland islands had informed his Executive Council, whose reaction had been favourable. Since it was not possible for local reasons to delaypublication in the Islands any further, a public statement would bemade there about midnight London time on Friday, 21st November;and it had also been intended that the Argentine Government shouldmake a statement on 21st November and that the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should make one in the House of commons on Monday, 24th November. But in the meantime a premature disclosure had occurred in Buenos Aires; and in view of theParliamentary and Press concern, he had agreed with the lord president that he should make an interim statement in the Houseof Commons that afternoon, in which he would promise a full statement on 24th November, but would also make it clear that british policy remained based on the principle that there would be notransfer of sovereignty without the consent of the inhabitants of the islands.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Britishand Spanish Governments had now secured the deletion of the gibraltar item from the agenda of the United Nations FourthCommittee. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had helduseful discussions last week with our Ambassador in Madrid andwith the Governor of Gibraltar, who had been called home for consultations; and the Ambassador and the Spanish Foreign minister were now engaged in general discussions on Anglo-Spanish relations.In the discussions, it would be made clear that our pledges to Gibraltarremained unaltered; and a main objective would be to secure a relaxation of the harassments to which Gibraltar was being subjected.Unless the Spaniards were prepared to make a substantial gesture inthis direction, it was unlikely that progress would be made.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that followinghis discussions with the State Department on his last visit to theUnited States, the British Petroleum Company (BP) had reached anagreement with the United States Department of Justice which wouldenable BP to set up an effective marketing organisation in the UnitedStates for the sale of the products of its concession in Alaska.
Strategic ArmsLimitationTalks(previous reference:CC(69) 45thConclusions,Minute 4)CentrifugeCollaboration(previous reference:CC (69) 27thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that talks between the United States and Soviet Governments on the limitationof strategic armaments had begun in Helsinki on 17th November.These talks, if successful, might bring major benefits to the economiesnot only of the two countries principally concerned, but of the world as a whole. The United States would keep in touch with their allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation about progress.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that negotiationswith the German and Dutch Governments on the tripartite project for the production of low-enriched uranium by the centrifuge processhad made good progress; and all the major outstanding difficulties hadbeen resolved. The Dutch had now accepted that there should beno restrictions on the use for our own defence purposes of the outputof the enrichment plant to be established in the United Kingdom.They had also agreed that the headquarters of the TripartiteEnrichment Organisation should be located in this country and not,as they were earlier insisting, in Holland. The discussions with theUnited States Government on the release of information restrictedunder the Anglo-United States Agreement on the civil uses of atomic energy had also been brought to a successful conclusion. officials of the three participating countries would meet on 24th november to prepare a final version, which would be ad referendum to governments, of the tripartite agreement. After this the Germanand Dutch Governments would refer the agreement to the Councilof EURATOM, as they were required to do under the EURATOMTreaty. The agreement would not only be useful to us in its own right; it would also provide a tangible example, at the time when the six were holding their Summit meeting, of the benefits of technologicalcollaboration with this country.Visit to The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he hadFareTnand ^ visited Bonn fr0m 13th to 14th November and had nad useful talksCommonwealth w*tn tne German Chancellor, Herr Brandt and the German foreign secretary Minister, Herr Scheel. To the latter he had made it clear that ifwe were to return 6 Brigade to Germany there must be 100 per centoffset; and that the offset must be of a nature fully acceptable to us.Herr ScheeFs reaction had not been forthcoming; and there wouldhave to be further discussions at official level. In discussing Britain&apos;application for membership of the European Economic Community,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had emphasised that in discussions between the six present members of the Community on agricultural policy, it was important that nothing should be said whichmight prejudice the success of eventual negotiations for British entry
into the Community. In his talks with the German Chancellor,Herr Brandt had agreed that it was desirable that the western european Powers should discuss the harmonisation of their foreignpolicies; that Britain should take part in such discussions; and thatthe appropriate forum for them was the Western European Union.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had also discussed with Herr Scheel Greece&apos;s membership of the Council of Europe.He had pointed out that the Greek Government had so far given no signs that they intended to take any action in the sense desired bythe Council. If it was their intention to persist in their present attitude towards human rights and civil liberties it might be better,in order to avoid acrimony in the Council, for them to withdraw oftheir own accord. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretarysuggested that the German Government should speak to the Greekson these lines. The Germans had said that they would do so; butthey observed that they had already made similar representations tothe Greeks without effect. In general, the German attitude towardsthe Greek problem seemed to be one of indecision; and it was not even certain, if it came to a vote on the question of Greekmembership, how their vote would be cast. Our own attitude wasthat if it came to the point, we should vote for the suspension of greece. This, under Council of Europe procedure, would affordGreece a further period of grace during which she could mend herways and avoid expulsion. We would not, however, take any initiative, but would leave the Scandinavian members of the Councilto make the running.In regard to East-West relations, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary said that the German Government were beginning talks with the Soviet Union next week with a view to a joint declaration by the two countries which would renounce the use of force in their mutual relations. There would also be discussions with Poland.Since the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s return from Bonn,the Soviet Ambassador in London had indicated in relation to the warsaw Pact countries&apos; proposal for a conference on european security, that the Soviet Union would have no objection to participation by the United States and Canada, provided that the&quot; German Democratic Republic &quot; were admitted to the conference onthe same footing as the other participants. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary was currently seeking the views of theFederal Republic of Germany on this matter.The Cabinet-(1) Took  note  of  the   statements  by   the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (69) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2)IndustrialAffairsPayNegotiationsin the london docks(previous reference:CC (69) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that the London dockershad turned down the pay and productivity proposals made by thePort employers under Stage II of the modernisation programmerecommended by the Devlin Committee &quot;on the Port transport industry. Her Department, acting in consultation with the Ministryof Transport, would be in touch with the employers about thepossibility of making minor modifications to the proposals in orderto make them more acceptable to the dockers.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.Teachers&apos; Payin England andWalesThe Secretary of State for Education and Science said that earlier in the year a two-year agreement had been negotiated under whichteachers in England and Wales would receive increases in salary of just over 7 per cent overall from 1st April, 1969. The Conferenceof the National Union of Teachers had subsequently decided to seek a further increase of  135 a year from 1st April, 1970; and they werelater joined in this by all the other teachers&apos; associations. TheManagement Panel of the Burnham Committee had agreed to considerthe claim and on 10th November they had offered a flat rate increaseof  50 a year. The unions had rejected as derisory this offer, which represented an increase of 3 per cent; and there had since been aseries of one-day and half-day strikes in different parts of the country.The local authority members of the Burnham Committee were considering whether they could increase their offer. He would beinformed of their conclusions in the following week and would reportthe outcome to the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes assoon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for education and Science.The Cabinet, after a short discussion,(2) agreed that it would be desirable to have a general discussion on British policy towards Nigeria.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to circulate a paper as a basis for their discussion.
Prices and incomes PolicyDraft white paper:Low-paidWorkers4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity covering a draft passage about low-paid workers in theforthcoming White Paper on Prices and Incomes (C (69) 154).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meetingearlier this week the Sub-Committee on Future Policy of the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes had considered aproposal by the First Secretary that the incomes norm after 1969should be expressed as a range of 1\ to 5 per cent. Widely differingviews about this had been expressed in the Committee. A fewthought that there should be no norm at all. Some considered thatthe norm should remain at 1\ per cent. Others either agreed withthe First Secretary&apos;s proposal or suggested alternative ranges. in attempting, as Chairman, to find a compromise to meet these differingviews, he had suggested to the Sub-Committee two alternatives 4 per cent, or a range of 3 to A\ per cent. While neither of these was wholly satisfactory, they were both approved by the Sub-committee as acceptable alternatives.The First Secretary of State said that, before putting forwardher proposal for a range of 2\ to 5 per cent, she had considered and rejected a number of alternatives including those which had been putforward in the Sub-Committee. Since the meeting of the latter, she had reconsidered the position; and she remained convinced that heroriginal proposal was the best. She was strongly opposed to thesuggestion that no norm should be set for the period after 1969.Discussions with both the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had shown without any doubtthat both these organisations and public opinion as a whole would regard the absence of any norm as signifying the abandonmentby the Government of an incomes policy. It would, moreover, put the Government in the indefensible position of making Ordersproviding statutory powers relating to future income settlementswithout being able to indicate what level of settlement would beregarded as acceptable. She had also reached the conclusion thatit would be unrealistic to seek to maintain the present 3^ per centnorm. Since the fourth quarter of 1968, the average pay settlementhad been rather more than 5 per cent, and in the last two or threemonths much higher. Pay settlements reached in September and october 1969 had involved average increases of 1\ and %\ per cent respectively. There was a real danger that the normal rate of settlement over the next few months would stay at 7 to 8 per cent;and there was no prospect whatever that any significant settlementswould be negotiated at 1\ per cent in the coming months. Nor would
a norm of 4 per cent have any chance of general acceptance for futurepay settlements. It had to be borne in mind that the Governmenfsalready inadequate statutory powers would be withdrawn altogetherin the course of 1970. In any event, the adoption of a single figurenorm had the disadvantage that it could only be made to work atany level if it was understood that exceptions would be made inparticular circumstances, such as productivity agreements, the low paid, etc. Accordingly, she had reached the conclusion that the best chance of containing future pay settlements would be to set as thenorm a range of 2\ to 5 per cent, within which the Government would expect future pay settlements to be made. She recognised that even with such a range it would be most unlikely that any significantsettlements would be made below the figure of 5 per cent, which hadin fact been the underlying trend of &quot;settlements over the last18 months. But such a norm could be expected to exert an influence which would prevent too many settlements above 5 per cent. If a range of, say, 3 to A\ per cent were adopted, as the Sub-Committee on future Prices and Incomes had suggested, many more settlementswould be likely to exceed the norm and such a norm would accordingly come to exert no practical restraining influence on wage settlements. In the light of practical experience she remainedconvinced that a norm of 2\ to 5 per cent, or 3 to 5 per cent, would prove less inflationary than either a range up to A\ per cent or a singlenorm of 4 per cent.In discussion, it was argued that the only norm which couldbe respectably defended was Z\ per cent, because this was the expectedfuture rate of increase in productivity. If the Government endorseda norm higher than 1\ per cent, they would be openly endorsinginflation. Pay settlements would in practice always be made at or above the norm: if the norm were presented as a range, thensettlements would be at or above the upper limit of it. A normof 2\ to 5 per cent would encourage claimants generally to insist proportionate least 5 per cent. The economic consequences of settlements far inexcess of the increase in productivity would be a deterioration in thebalance of payments and higher taxation in the next Budget. Therenewed fears of inflation illustrated by the recent behaviour of the equity and gilt-edged markets would be strongly reinforced if theGovernment now endorsed a norm as high as 5 per cent, whether ornot it was part of a range. Moreover, the Governmenfs presentation of future incomes policy must take account of its weakened statutory powers. The White Paper should accordingly firmly set the normat 1\ per cent; and should explain why it was necessary still to doso and the consequences for everyone if pay settlements were generallyabove this level. The role of the White Paper should be increasingly
to educate and influence public opinion, rather than seek to imposedirections which would be increasingly unenforceable. If the problemof presentation were tackled in this way, an &quot; indicative &quot; norm of3^ per cent would be both credible and realistic. The Governmentcould not of course ignore such a norm in their negotiations with theirown employees; but provided that it was made clearly subject to exceptions as at present including an exception for the low paid this would provide sufficient flexibility for satisfactory public service pay negotiations in 1970.On the other hand, it was pointed out that from recent experienceit was evident that the Government would be unable to negotiatesettlements in the public service throughout 1970 within a 3% per centnorm, even if the latter were made subject to liberal exceptions. Ifthe Government first explained that pay settlements in excess of 3^- percent would have serious economic consequences for the country andthen proceeded to settle as the largest employer in the country their own negotiations on a significantly higher level, the Governmenfsgeneral policy and the norm itself would soon become completelydiscredited. In view of the level of pay settlements over many monthspast, a norm of 4-J or 5 per cent was the lowest which could beexpected to have any influence on future pay settlements. If, however,such a figure were made the top of a range, some employers at leastwould be encouraged to start negotiations within the range andconclude them at the top of it: a single figure norm of 4  per cent or per cent, on the other hand, would inevitably be the starting pointof negotiations, which could then be expected to end above this figure.Moreover, there would be presentational advantages in describing thenew norm as a range centred round the existing norm of Z\ per centrather than as a straight increase.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that in future the Governmenfs influence on pay settlements would increasingly depend on persuasion and education. The forthcoming White Paper should therefore explainfully the economic consequences of unrestrained pay increases. Thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the norm should be expressed asa symmetrical range round the present norm of 3^ per cent.The Cabinet Agreed that the norm for the average rate of annual increaseof pay rates should be expressed in the forthcoming white paper on Prices and Incomes as a range of 2\ to A\ per cent.
CC 55 (69)CONFIDENTIALContributions 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of under the New State for Social Services (C (69) 152) on contributions under the newpension scheme.pensions scheme(previous references:CC (69) 35thConclusions,Minute 6 and cc (69) 38thConclusions)The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the proposals put forward in his memorandum were designed to find the additionalmoney necessary to meet the increase in the estimated cost of social insurance benefits without increasing employees&apos; total contributions;and to make it unnecessary to pursue the proposed saving of 10 million a year on the treatment of road casualties in hospitals.In the White Paper &quot; National Superannuation and Social Insurance &quot;published in January (Cmnd. 3883), the Government had proposedthat both employers and employees should pay a contribution of6f per cent of earnings, of which A\ per cent in the case of the employer and 4f per cent in the case of the employee would be for national superannuation; 2 per cent in each case for social insurance benefits; and \ per cent in the case of employers for the RedundancyFund. Later calculations by the Government Actuary showed that though the contributions then proposed for national superannuationwere adequate, a contribution of 1 - 7 per cent from each side wouldbe needed for social insurance; allowing for a reduction in the contribution required to the Redundancy Fund, the result was that employers would need to contribute 6-4 per cent of earnings and employees 6 - 45 per cent without taking account of any contributionto the Health Service. In the White Paper the Government had assumed a contribution for this purpose of 0-&apos;5 per cent from each side; and on this basis the total rate of contribution, if no changes were made, would, be 6 - 9 per cent for employers and 6 - 95 per cent for employees. He was extremely reluctant to increase the totalemployees&apos; contributions above the 6-75 per cent which had beenforecast. He therefore proposed that the total Health Serviceelement in the contribution should be reduced to 0 - 9 per cent (whichwould still produce more than present rates of contribution); and that,of this element, two-thirds should be paid by the employer andone-third by the employee, giving total contributions of 7 per cent for the former and 6-75 per cent for the latter. All countries inthe European Economic Community placed more of the cost of social security and health insurance on the shoulders of employers than we did; if this proposal were accepted, it would represent a first step towards bringing our scheme more nearly into line with theirs. Thecost to employers would not be very great: about  35 million morethan if the liability had been split evenly, out of a total contribution
income of about  2,700 million. But no doubt the proposal would be strongly resisted by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI),whom he would feel bound to inform in advance of the proposed changes.If this proposal were accepted for the new scheme, he wouldalso propose that the Government should take a first step in the samedirection by increasing the National Health Service contributions paidby employers under the existing scheme; at present the employers&apos;contribution was only 8d. a week, compared with the employees&apos;3s. 2d. An increase of 6d. in the employers&apos; contribution would yield rather more than  25 million in a full year, and an increase ofIs. more than  50 million; and an increase in this range could be imposed without increasing the yield of the present contributionsabove that of the 0-9 per cent of earnings proposed for the new scheme. Either increase in contributions would make it possible to dispense with the saving of  10 million in net expenditure on hospitalson which they had decided last July and which it was now clear couldnot sensibly be achieved by recovering the cost of treating roadcasualties.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that both the long-term and the interim proposals made by the Secretary of State for social services would have some adverse economic effect. The interim increase in employers&apos; contributions might cost the balance ofpayments about  10 million a year; and in addition it would reducethe scope for further company taxation. Moreover, the reductionfrom 1 per cent to 0-9 per cent in the Health Service element in contributions under the new scheme would mean that an additional 22 million a year would have to be found from taxation.Nevertheless, weighing these disadvantages against the advantages of avoiding any increase in employees&apos; contributions under the new scheme and of not having to pursue further proposals for a levy on road accident cases (which would be both inefficient and unpopular)he was disposed to accept the proposals put forward by the social services Secretary. Since any increase in employers&apos; National health service contributions would be resisted, almost irrespective of theamount, he thought that the increase should be the full Is. per week.Allowing for the loss of the  10 million expected from the roadaccident levy, this would produce a net revenue of about  40 million;but he must make it clear that this could not be taken as providingany sort of justification for increased expenditure on the national health Service.In discussion it was confirmed that there would be lower ratesof contribution for members of the Armed Forces under the new scheme, as under the present one.
secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Employment and Productivity (C (69) 153) onthe Abuse of Social Security.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that there was growing public concern about abuses of the social security system,some of the more common forms of which were listed in paragraph 2of the joint memorandum. Moreover the forthcoming national superannuation Bill would include provisions, already approvedby the Cabinet, abolishing the present disqualification fromunemployment benefit and supplementary benefit of persons&quot; financing &quot; a strike or belonging to the same grade or class as personsdirectly involved. These provisions might be attacked as encouragingstrikes and further increase public unease. He had therefore been considering with the First Secretary of State what could be done,over and above the considerable effort being made already, to checkabuses and to reassure the public. Their proposals fell into fourparts (i) an approach to the Supplementary Benefits CommissionAbuse ofSocialSecurityThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendations in the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum. They agreed that legislation should be introduced to increase employer^ contributions by Is. a week. This wouldobviate the need to reduce net expenditure on hospitals by  10 million a year from 1970-71; the fact that the increase in employers&apos;contributions would produce additional revenue of more than this amount would not, however, be relevant to the consideration of futurepublic expenditure programmes.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 14 of C (69) 152.(3) Agreed that a Bill be introduced to increase the national health Service contributions of employers by Is. a week.(4) Agreed that, contrary to their decision of 29th July, 1969,no attempt should be made to recover the full costs of treating road casualties in hospital.(5) Invited the Social Services Secretary to inform the CBI of theproposed increases in employers&apos; contributions.
with a view to further tightening up of administrative procedures;(ii) increasing the deductions made from the supplementary benefitpayable to persons discharged for industrial misconduct, who might at present find themselves better off than if they were eligible forunemployment benefit; (iii) calculating the supplementary benefitpayable to strikers&apos; families after a return to work on the same basis as during the strike, instead of allowing the striker himself to qualify;and (iv) imposing a requalification test on occupational pensionersover 60 with pensions of more than  25 a week who soughtunemployment benefit and reducing the benefit payable to those withpensions of  15 or more. Of these, (ii) and (iii) would involve theaddition of clauses to the National Superannuation Bill; and (iv) couldbe effected by regulations.In framing their proposals the First Secretary of State and hehad sought to reconcile the desirability of checking abuses andreassuring the public with the need to avoid a head-on collision withthe trade union movement. But for this factor he would himself have preferred to go further. In particular he had found it very difficultto defend the practice, which they were now having to validate by wayof legislation, of disregarding income tax refunds and strike pay upto the level of  4 a week received by persons disqualified forunemployment benefit as a result of a strike, when determining theamount of benefit payable for a strikers family; the effect was thata striker who paid sufficient tax was financially in as good a positionas if he had not himself been disqualified from benefit. But thepractice dated back to the Second World War; and it was clearthat it would be extremely difficult to discontinue it now, especially since the Government had failed to do so when they first discoveredthat there was no statutory basis for it. He therefore sought theagreement of his colleagues to the proposals set out in thememorandum, which he suggested should be announced as a packagewhen the National Superannuation Bill was published, together withany changes in procedure which the Supplementary BenefitsCommission were prepared to introduce. It would be necessary togive the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) advance notice of the proposals.The First Secretary of State said that she concurred in the viewthat the proposals in the memorandum were as far as they could go inpresent circumstances. The practice of disregarding tax refunds andstrike pay was bad in principle and meant that workers had less to lose financially by going on strike; but it was impossible to changeit now. A second anomaly which encouraged strikes was that although a worker who lost his employment had to wait some weeksfor a refund of income tax, strikers received refunds through their
employers very much more quickly; she hoped that it might be found possible to find means of slowing down the making of refunds insuch cases.In discussion there was general agreement on the need to allay the growing anxiety among both the public and the governments supporters at the evidence of abuse; and there was agreement also on the specific measures proposed by the two Secretaries of State.Stronger measures might be desirable-the disregarding of tax refundsseemed wholly indefensible but it was important not to provoke a collision with the TUC; further inquiry should however be made into Press allegations that strikes were being financed by drawingsick pay. The specific proposals in the memorandum did not coverall the abuses specified in paragraph 2 because the remainder could be countered by changes in the administrative procedures of the supplementary Benefits Commission; these would be the subject ofinformal approaches to the Commission. Some anxiety was expressed lest the tightening up of procedures might result in tooinquisitorial an approach on the part of the Commission^ local officers; but the general feeling was that the members of theCommission could be relied on to see that a humane manner wasadopted.The presentation of the proposed changes was important if theywere to make the maximum impact. They should be announced asa package at the same time as the National Superannuation Bill was published. It would be unwise to rely on an oral statement during a press conference; there should be a prepared statement which could be handed to the Press and made generally available.In further discussion it was pointed out that the proposals hadimplications in the fields of public expenditure and manpower.Relaxing the conditions which occupational pensioners must satisfybefore drawing unemployment benefit would reduce the savingexpected from this source and compensating savings would have tobe found elsewhere. The manpower requirements of social securitywere already growing; and there could be no guarantee that additional staff necessary to check abuses could be found.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals set out in the memorandum and agreed that the TUC and CBI should be informed of them before any announcement was made. The proposals should be announcedwhen the National Superannuation Bill was published; and the social services Secretary should ensure that a comprehensive statementexplaining them was made available to the Press.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (69) 153.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Minister without Portfolio, toprepare a statement for release to the Press when theNational Superannuation Bill was published.Services and facilities  or members ofParliament(previous reference:CC (69) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*7. The Lord President said that in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion on 13th November he had considered further the procedure under which Members of Parliament would claim the proposedsecretarial allowance. He now suggested that the allowance shouldbe payable against a declaration that the MP concerned was incurringexpenses for secretarial assistance of the amount claimed, up to the approved limit. In addition each MP would then have tosubstantiate to the Inland Revenue, as at present, his claim fordeducting this sum and his other expenses as an MP from his taxableremuneration. As regards the amount of the allowance, his enquiriesindicated that the cost of a full-time secretary in central Londonvaried from  1,000 to  1,500 a year; and in his view there was a powerful case for fixing the upper limit of the allowance at  750 ayear.The Ministerial Committee on Secretarial Assistance for members of Parliament had agreed that in parallel with the creationof a secretarial allowance for MPs it would be appropriate toincrease the expense allowance for Members of the House of Lords.At present Peers could claim up to A\ guineas a day tax free againsttravel and other expenses for attendance at the House of Lords; he proposed that this should now be increased to  6 10s. Od. a day. Onthe question of a car allowance for MPs and Peers the Cabinet had agreed on 22nd July that the allowance should be increased to theaverage cost of first-class travel by rail, which was estimated at:3 pence a mile. The majority of the Ministerial committee considered that the allowance should be rounded up to 6d. a mile,though it had been strongly argued that this would be too generous,in contrast with the Governmenfs attempts in other directions to restrain increases in remuneration, and that the figure should be 5^d.He accordingly proposed that, when announcing the decision on thesecretarial allowance for MPs and the Peers&apos; expense allowance, theGovernment should also announce an increase to 6d. a mile in the rateof car allowance for both MPs and Peers.
The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet recognised that the arguments for fixing the upper limit of the secretarial allowance for MPs at  500 or  750 a year werefinely balanced; and they recognised the force of the Lord President^contention that the lower figure might not be well received by parliamentary opinion. They were not disposed, however, to reopentheir earlier decision to adopt the  500 limit. The allowance should begin to be payable in respect of expenses incurred in the threemonths ending 31st December, 1969. In announcing the procedure for claiming the allowance care should be taken to avoid saying thatit would be payable against a declaration. The announcement should state that MPs would be able to claim a secretarial allowance up toa limit of  500 a year on expenses actually incurred on secretarial assistance during the period in question. The Cabinet agreed thatan increase in the expense allowance for Members of the House ofLords to  6 10s. Od. a day should be announced at the same time.They recognised that the arrangement whereby the car allowance was linked to the cost of first-class rail travel could be argued to beanomalous; but they agreed that it would not be appropriate to alter the basis of the allowance until the proposed review of the remuneration of MPs by the National Board for Prices and Incomeshad been completed. On balance they agreed that the new allowance should be fixed at 6d. a mile.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Reaffirmed their decision that a secretarial allowance forMPs up to a maximum of  500 a year should be provided -on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.(3) Agreed that the expense allowance for Members of the Houseof Lords and the car allowance for Members of bothHouses should be increased to  6 10s. Od. a day and 6d.a mile respectively.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the minister without Portfolio and the Lord Privy Seal, to arrange for parliament to be informed of their decisions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st November, 1969.
