FogartySubjectPublic Expenditure 1970-71
PublicExpenditure1970-71(previous reference:CC (69) 37thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET* The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer on the general situation (C (69) 104); and memoranda on specific issues relating to public expenditure in 1970-71 by theLord President, the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, the LordChancellor, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the President of the Boardof Trade and the Minister for Planning and Land (C (69) 89, 91, 76,90, 95, 105 and 106).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, on the basis of decisions which had been provisionally taken, reductions in public sector expenditure amounting to  303 - 4 million could be secured in1970-71. These reductions included  5 million on expenditure bythe local authorities on roads which, as had previously been explained,could not be guaranteed, and so the provisional reduction amountedto  298 - 4 million. Although he must warn his colleagues that areduction of less than  400 million in public sector expenditure wouldinvolve substantial risks, in the light of the views expressed inbilateral and collective discussions he would now settle for aminimum saving of  300 million. Such a reduction would leave theExchequer  60 million short of the reduction required to allow a&quot; neutral &quot; budget in 1970. But because of the erosion of the real valueof income tax allowances by inflation, a so-called &quot; neutral &quot; budgetwould bring within the scope of income tax a large number ofpersons at present excluded. It would cost  40 million in the nextbudget to prevent this extension and a further  90 million to restore the erosion of income tax allowances for existing taxpayers. Thus a&quot; neutral&quot; budget would, in effect, raise taxation by  130 million.He had also to take into account the probability that the forthcomingReddaway report on the Selective Employment Tax would recommendconcessions which might cost as much as  50 million. Overall,therefore, if public sector expenditure could be reduced by  300million, he might still be faced with the need to increase taxation byas much as  280 million next year. Apart from the political consequences of such a step, it would be difficult in practice to devisemeans of raising further substantial sums in taxation after the verylarge increases of recent years.Leaving aside the possibility of an additional saving of  10 million from the electricity investment programme (without deferment of a power station), which at this stage appeared most unpromising, theyhad reserved for further consideration a number of sensitivereductions totalling  20-8 million. Of these, he accepted that theproposal to impose charges for school transport should be dropped,as well as that for increasing the charge of school meals in April, 1970,beyond Is. 9d.  This would limit the possible further reductions to10633A 2
 5 - 6 million. If in due course it proved possible to find some savings from the electricity investment programme or to introduce an airportpassenger tax, these would provide a small but welcome relief to the taxation problem in the next budget. Against the possibility offurther reductions of  5-6 million of which  4-6 million would come from deferring hospital starts in Great Britain they were faced with requests for increases which totalled  17-8 million. these calculations included, of course, the original provision of  150 million for unforeseen contingencies in 1970-71; and all experience haddemonstrated the necessity of preserving such a contingencyallowance for use during 1970-71. While it was tempting to thinkthat their problems might be solved by a little more flexibility in the size of the reduction required in 1970-71, his colleagues well knew that flexibility here was a euphemism for accepting a higher level ofpublic expenditure.In discussion, it was pointed out that the  4-6 million whichthe Chancellor had proposed should be saved by additionaldeferments of hospital starts in Great Britain would cause thedifficulties of a public announcement which had previously been explained. The alternative suggestion that  4-6 million might be saved by deferring the start of some other new health and welfareexpenditure (for which offsetting savings, from the health programme had already been found) was unreasonable. On the other hand itwas argued that, if the Social Services Secretary was prepared onlyto save  5 million instead of  9 million by deferring hospital starts,it was not unreasonable to ask him to find the balance by reducing expenditure on certain new health programmes in 1970-71 while making in full the &quot; offsetting savings &quot; which he had identified.Unless an additional  4 million or  5 million could be saved on the health programme, there would be no scope for providing for anyof the increases in public expenditure which they would be laterconsidering.In further discussion, it was suggested that the defence budgetshould be examined in detail by the Cabinet, as had the programmes of most other Departments. Additional savings might well be found from defence, as well as from raising the financial objective for PostOffice telecommunications and by deferring or cancelling the concorde project. On the other hand, it was pointed out that agreement on the reductions in the defence budget had only beenreached after exhaustive bilateral discussions. The defence secretary had originally offered a reduction of  50 million, but thiswould have been offset as to  25 million by the cost of increasing the pay of the Armed Forces next year. In the event, the defence secretary had increased his original offer of  50 million to  75 million,and had agreed in addition to absorb the whole of the cost of the pay increases. No more could be obtained from the defence budget,
which was already contracting, without major changes in defence policy. The majority of Departmental spending programmes hadbeen settled bilaterally in the same way as the defence budget, andit was only where there had been disagreement that part of someDepartmental programmes had been subjected to scrutiny by theCabinet. Officials had already been requested to examine thepossibility of an increase in the financial objective for Post Officetelecommunications, and the Government would be considering thefuture of Concorde at the end of the year. They could not, however,count at this stage on savings from either of these sources: if theyproduced savings, they would help to close the remaining taxationgap.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat a decision on the proposed additional savings of  1 million for school building and  4-6 million for hospital building should be deferred until they had considered the position as a whole, includingthe bids for increases and the possible other sources of savings suchas the airport tax. It was the general view that it would be desirableto examine the defence budget and savings in 1970-71 in more detail in September. He would consider, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Defence Secretary, how this might best be arranged. If further defence savings could be found,they would fall within the scope of the general decision which theCabinet had previously taken, that if the economy and the level ofpublic expenditure developed more satisfactorily than was at presentexpected they would be presented with a choice between a lower level of taxation in the next budget or increasing public expenditure.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.The Cabinet then considered a number of specific issues inrelation to public expenditure in 1970-71.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C (69) 90) about expenditure by the Land Commission on land acquisition.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the expenditure of theLand Commission on land acquisition depended on the policies and priorities it adopted and on its priority in relation to other expenditure programmes. If all the policies and expenditureproposed by the Minister for Planning and Land were agreed, totalexpenditure in 1970-71 would reach  27-7 million,  10-1 millionabove the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) ceiling of
 17-6 million. If purchases were restricted to land for earlydevelopment in the areas where there was pressure on land for housing, it would be possible to save some  2 million below thepresent PESC figure. He saw no need at this time for the purchaseof land for early development outside the pressure areas, nor for theacquisition of &quot; white land &quot; for longer-term holding.The Minister for Planning and Land said that the  17-6 millionceiling had been fixed on unrealistic assumptions before the land commission started work. Acquisition had built up more slowlythan expected, with the result that by 1970-71 offsetting sales wouldbe lower that had been expected. No allowance had been made for price increases since 1967. To restrict acquisition to land in pressureareas only would involve closing down the Land Commission^operations and offices over much of the country, including Wales.It would also involve breaking off negotiations already entered into.A viable programme was not possible at the level proposed by theChief Secretary. He was, however, prepared to agree that thepurchase of &quot; white land &quot; should be deferred for the present andthat the land acquisition programme for 1970-71 should be limitedto  20 million, i.e.,  2-4 million above the present PESC figure.In discussion it was argued that it was important for the land commission to maintain a viable programme of land acquisition inthe next few years. Cutting out purchases of &quot; white land &quot; and reducing those in the non-pressure areas would reduce the acreagebought more than proportionately to the savings because of high prices in the pressure areas. Moreover, there would be very great difficulties in breaking off negotiations where the process of acquisition was already in train. On the other hand, even a reducedprogramme of land purchases outside the pressure areas would need to be considered carefully in relation to other priorities.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that expenditure by the Land Commission in 1970-71should be increased from  17-6 million to  20 million.National Film The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofFinance State for Econorrijc Affairs on the National Film Finance CorporationCorporation     (jyfppQ (C (69) 91).The President of the Board of Trade said that the Corporation,which was established in 1949 to remedy a serious shortage of finance for film production, had done a valuable job. Excluding the loss of 2 million on the loan to British Lion, the Corporation^ losses hadbeen  3 million spread over 20 years. The Corporation could provide invaluable expertise in mobilising resources for film production if American finance were withdrawn; and it was thegeneral view in the film industry, which made a substantial
NationalConsultancyGrantsSchemecontribution to employment, national prestige and the balance ofpayments, that it should continue in being. The industrial reorganisation Corporation considered that if the NFFC pursueda more active and commercial policy it might, with strengthenedmanagement, break even over the years. He proposed that it shouldbe continued until 1980 and refinanced by the injection of a further 5 million, on the strict understanding that this was not a grant but a loan which would have to be repaid.  1 million of this would berequired for 1970-71, but the expenditure of part of that sum couldif necessary be brought forward to 1969-70.In discussion it was argued that although the Corporation had done useful work in the past the situation had changed and therewas now a strong case on merit for terminating its existence. IfUnited States finance were withdrawn from the industry it would bebecause there was no longer a market for its products in the UnitedStates and in these circumstances the NFFC could not hope to save the industry. As against this it was argued that the NFFC shouldbe able to make a profit in the future and that its operations,particularly in relation to low-budget productions, could do muchto encourage creative talent and increase the prestige of London asa cultural centre.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed that additional finance of  5 million should be madeavailable to the National Film Finance Corporation,which should be continued until 1980 by extension of the expiring legislation.(4) Agreed that  1 million of this additional finance shouldbe made available to the Corporation for expenditurein 1970-71, subject to consultation between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade about bringing forward&quot; part into 1969-70.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade about a national consultancy grants scheme(C (69) 95).The President of the Board of Trade said that following the firstNational Productivity Conference there had been considerable support for the idea of providing more expert advice to small businesses. He had introduced a pilot scheme of grants to small businesses for. consultancy projects in Bristol and Glasgow. these had been successful and proved that there was a substantial demandfor such services. Officials had now agreed that a national schemewas desirable, but had not been able to agree on its priority in relationto other forms of assistance.   Small firms were important to the
economy, but in general the calibre of management was low and difficult to improve. Whatever the outcome of current studies onthe reorganisation of business advisory services as a whole, and these would not be submitted to Ministers for some time, the nationalconsultancy grants scheme could be fitted in. There was space forthe necessary Bill in the legislative programme for 1969-70. Draftingauthority was now needed, together with approval of the expenditureof  2 million in 1970-71.In discussion it was argued, on the one hand, that consultancygrants could make a substantial contribution to the improvement of productivity. Moreover, following the success of the pilot schemes,there was increasing pressure for a national scheme. On the otherhand, it was suggested that it would be wrong to commit funds nowto a scheme costing between  10 million and  15 million over fiveyears. It had not been considered by Ministers in detail, nor inrelation to the other advisory services and to assistance to industryin general.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion on this point,said that before decisions were taken on the proposed national scheme it should be considered by the Ministerial Committee on industrial Policy in the context of the business advisory services asa whole. It might well be appropriate to produce a White Paper onthe subject in 1970, and perhaps to introduce a Bill; a Bill shouldnot, however, be introduced early in the 1969-70 Session. ThePresident of the Board of Trade might, however, maintain the momentum by extending pilot schemes to certain new areas; heshould consider with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, what funds would be needed for this purpose and whether they could be found.The Cabinet (5) Decided that a national consultancy grants scheme shouldnot at present be authorised, and that the relatedProductivity Consultants Bill should not be introducedearly in the 1969-70 Session.(6) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider anextension of the pilot consultancy grants scheme to other areas.(7) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange for the Ministerial Committee on industrial policy to consider as soon as possible the Governmenfsbusiness advisory services as a whole.Law and The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord ChancellorOrder, and     Qn public expencjiture on law and order (C (69) 76).Legal and the  Lord Chancellor said that because he had no Vote of hisown and many of the services for which he was responsible were
Police andPrisonsResearch andDevelopment10633largely financed by fees charged to the users, he was unable to adjusthis expenditure so as to save on one service the additional sumsrequired by another. Consequently legal aid in civil cases, whichwas properly regarded as a social service, had not been adjusted, ashad other social services, to compensate for the fall in the value ofmoney; and he was unable to find the modest sums required toextend legal aid to proceedings before tribunals or to reorganise thecivil and criminal courts. He hoped that he would at least be permitted to adjust the level of entitlement to legal aid, which hadnot been altered since 1960.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion on this point,said that the Lord Chancellor had established a case for considerationwhere his services had failed to keep pace with the decline in thevalue of money. The possibility of adjusting the level of entitlement to legal aid, and of making improvements in the provision of legal aid, should be examined by the appropriate Ministerial Committee.In the meantime, the Lord Chancellor was not being asked to makeany contribution to the savings required in 1970-71.The Cabinet (8) Invited the Lord Chancellor, with other Ministers mostconcerned, to examine the possibility of improvingarrangements for the provision of legal aid.The Home Secretary said that he was being asked for a saving of  300,000, which he could achieve by postponing the introductionof a new computer required for the use of the police. The computerwas also required however for the Minister of Transport^ newvehicle licensing scheme and unless this requirement also could be postponed he would be compelled to find the necessary saving fromthe money allocated to improvements to older prisons.The Cabinet (9) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theHome Secretary and the Minister of Transport thepossibility of finding the necessary saving by postponing the introduction of the police computer.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council on resources for transfer to new civil research anddevelopment, to which was attached a note by the Chief scientific adviser to the Government on national priorities in science and technology (C (69) 89).The Lord President said that at their meeting on 12th May the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy accepted savings on research and development (R and D) in defence, aerospace and
civil nuclear technology; and at the same time asked for a statementof priorities in relation to proposed new civil R and D projects towhich some of the savings might be transferred. After consultationwith the Central Advisory Council for Science and Technology andwith Departments, the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Governmenthad drawn up a list of priorities in which the proposed civil R and Dprojects were divided into three categories. Although he consideredthat there was a strong case for supporting most of the proposedprojects, in the circumstances of the present review of public expenditure he was prepared to recommend only those of the veryhighest priority. These were listed in Table A of the Chief scientific adviser&apos;s note and the finance required for them in 1970-71 was 2-55 million.In discussion it was argued that a higher proportion of the savings resulting from cuts in defence R and D should be devoted to new civil R and D projects for which there was an urgent need.Moreover, expenditure on defence R and D was still too high andfurther efforts should be made to reduce it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the priority to be given to expenditure on marine bore-holes by the institute of Geological Sciences should be reconsidered in the lightof the Governments recent decisions on the issue of licenses for the exploration of the continental shelf. Subject to this, the cabinet approved the recommendations in the Lord Presidents memorandum.The Cabinet (10) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, theMinister of Power and the Chief Scientific Adviser to theGovernment, to reconsider the priority to be given to expenditure on marine bore-holes on the lines indicatedin the Prime Minister^ summing up.(11) Subject to (10) above, approved the proposals in C(69)89for additional expenditure of  2-55 million in 1970-71on civil research and development.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade on passenger service charges at United Kingdomairports (C (69) 105).The President of the Board of Trade said that he had assumed that there was no intention of introducing legislation to levy a tax onall passengers leaving United Kingdom airports on internationalservices. The simplest and cheapest way to introduce a charge onpassenger services would be to require the British Airports Authority(BAA) to increase its landing charges for international services so asto produce whatever additional revenue was required.   Another
method would be for the BAA to devise a scheme for making adirect charge on passengers travelling on international services. Bothmethods would be strongly criticised by the international airlines andwould give rise to serious administrative problems. He was very doubtful whether it would be practicable to levy a charge by eithermethod, but he was quite content that the problem should be examined further.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the problem should be further studied, with aview to imposing a passenger service charge (as distinct from a tax)at United Kingdom airports as soon as possible if a satisfactory scheme could be devised. Revenue which would accrue from such ascheme could not however be taken into account in the present public expenditure exercise. If, as a result of further examination, charges were introduced, the additional revenue would provide some welcomeflexibility at the time of the next Budget.The Cabinet (12) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(13) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to arrange for thepossibility of introducing passenger service charges at united Kingdom airports to be further examined on thelines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up.Housing The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister forProspects       planning and Land on housing prospects (C (69) 106).The Minister for Planning and Land said that, on the basis of figures available at the end of June, housing starts and completions in 1970 were forecast to be 405,000 and 380,000 respectively. Thefigure for starts included an estimate of 210,000 for the public sectorbut information now becoming available suggested that this figuremight be too high. In these circumstances it was important that everything possible should be done to stimulate building in the private sector and he hoped that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would beable to agree to the industry&apos;s recent request that they should be given priority for bank advances.In discussion it was pointed out that it would not be practicable to give the building industry higher priority than, for example, export industries. Moreover, banks were already authorised to give priority to bridging loans for house purchase. The crucial point was tomaintain the sums available for mortgages. As a result of higherinterest rates the building societies were now attracting substantialSECRET10633 c
funds, and the restoration of the cut in funds for local authoritymortgages in 1969-70 would ease the position further.In further discussion it was pointed out that there was nothing which the Government could now do to affect completions in 1970,which might well fall significantly below the forecast figure of380,000. In public discussion of the housing problem more emphasis should be put on the action taken by the Government to assist the modernisation of old houses.The Cabinet (14) Took note of C (69) 106 and invited the Minister for planning and Land to be guided by the points made in discussion.Post Office The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meeting on24th July (CC (69) 36th Conclusions, Minute 4) it had been agreed that officials should examine the possibility of raising the financial objective for telecommunications to % per cent or even higher. this examination would take time and it would be quite wrong to thinkthat it would provide certain and substantial savings which couldjustifiably be taken into account in the present public expenditureexercise. Raising the objective was not expected to lead to a significant cut in investment; and it would ease the budgetaryproblem only if it were accompanied by higher telephone charges andrentals. In the light of undertakings given after a previousinvestigation by the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI),it would not be easy to increase these charges, which in any casecould not be worked out in detail until the new Post OfficeCorporation came into existence in October.The Postmaster General said that demand was rising rapidly inthe field of telecommunications and he was accordingly in favour ofincreasing the financial objective, but this would not lead to short-term savings. The new Corporation would have to be consulted,and it might well be necessary to refer proposals for increased charges to the NBPI. It should be possible to implement a decision to raisethe financial objective on 1st October, 1970; and if the new figurewere 9\ per cent, savings amounting to  12-5 million could beachieved in 1970-71. This would however involve raising rental aswell as installation charges and the political and social implicationswould need to be carefully considered before decisions were taken.The Cabinet (15) Took note of the statements by the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Postmaster General.The Cabinet then reviewed public expenditure in 1970-71 asa whole.In discussion it was argued that, although the outcome appearednow to produce a net saving of rather less than  300 million, theGeneralSituation1970-71
shortfall was no more than  7 million or  8 million at most. Itwould be folly to attempt to find this small extra saving from the highly sensitive items listed for further consideration in C (69) 104.Such a course would have damaging consequences out of all proportion to the effect on the overall public expenditure position.Since devaluation, by a series of substantial reductions in public expenditure, the Government had already seriously departed fromtheir declared policies of increasing public expenditure to improvesocial services and the quality of life. It was impossible to estimate thecourse of the economy with sufficient precision to calculate that a saving of  300 million on a total expenditure of about  17,000 million in 1970-71 would just suffice, but that a saving of  292 million wouldnot. The Secretary of State for Education and Science should notbe asked to make the further saving of  1 million on school buildingshown in C (69) 104, nor authorised to spend an additional  J million on special schools. Otherwise, the reductions provisionally decidedshould stand as shown in C (69) 104.On the other hand, it was argued that a reduction of  300 millioninstead of  400 million would present the Government with seriousbudgetary problems. Some of the increases in expenditure to whichthey had just agreed were unjustified in the circumstances. The levelof taxation was already the cause of serious complaint by thoseearning average industrial wages, and an increase in taxation in1970-71 would be far more damaging than some further, relatively small, reduction in public expenditure, which had expanded very rapidly in the early years of the present Administration and was onlynow levelling off.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that over the past fiveyears there had been a substantial increase in the allocation of resources to the public sector in accordance with the Governmenfsdeclared policies. There was no question now of reducing total public expenditure or of reversing those policies. - He had had toincrease the level of taxation very substantially since devaluation. Ithad proved very difficult to find additional sources of revenue in thelast budget. Even a reduction of  400 million (which had been based with a small safety margin on the more favourable case in the medium-term forecast) would not enable him to make good theerosion of the present income tax allowances next year. The savingsso far provisionally agreed were inevitably the sum of a large numberof small savings, since the aim had been to avoid major policy decisions and announcements. If they had proceeded throughouton the basis now advanced, that difficult small savings made moretrouble than they were worth, there would have been no savings atall. If the Cabinet now decided that an overall saving of  292 million was all that could be achieved, he must emphasise that a saving on
this scale would not provide the basis for a &quot; neutral&quot; budget in1970. On the contrary, there would be a real risk that further public expenditure cuts might prove to be inevitable at the turn of the year.In these circumstances, he must ask that if further savings for 1970-71could somehow be found over the next few months for example, by raising the financial objective for telecommunications, imposing an airport service charge these should be added to the savings already secured in order to reduce the risks; and should not be dissipated on additional expenditure.The Prime Minister, summing up their discussion, said that itwas the general view that all the reductions in expenditure in 1970-71which had been provisionally agreed and which were listed inC (69) 104 should now be formally approved. The Secretary of Statefor Education and Science should not be asked to save the further 1 million on school buildings shown in C (69) 104 as reserved forfurther consideration. But any additional expenditure on special schools, as proposed by the Secretary of State for Education and science must be fully offset by reduction in expenditure on otherschool building. If any of the reductions or increases in expenditure which had now been agreed called for announcements, these shouldbe cleared with himself, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the lord president and the Paymaster General. In the light of reductions and increases agreed for 1970-71, officials should now proceed with workon public expenditure in 1971-72, with a view to decisions on termstaken in September.The Cabinet (16) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(17) Confirmed the reductions in public expenditure in 1970-71which were listed in C (69) 104 as provisionally decided.(18) Agreed that any further savings for 1970-71 arising fromthe further consideration of specific issues discussedshould be used to reduce total public expenditure in thatyear.(19) Invited the Ministers concerned to clear with the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the lord president and the Paymaster General any announcementsrelating to public expenditure in 1970-71.(20) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrangefor work on public expenditure in 1971-72 to be carried forward on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.30th July, 1969.
