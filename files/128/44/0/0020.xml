Insurance(Employers&apos;Liability) bill the Secretary of State for Social Services drew attention to theInsurance (Employers&apos; Liability) Bill introduced by a Private member for the purpose of compelling employers to insure against claims for damages by an employee injured in an industrial accident. TheBill had the strong support of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)and had received an unopposed Second Reading. The Bill was not,however, clearly the responsibility of any particular GovernmentDepartment, and the issues of policy raised by it had not beenconsidered by an appropriate committee. The Legislation Committeehad decided that the Bill should not be allowed to reach the statute book, and that for this purpose the proceedings in Committee shouldbe prolonged; but in his view it was desirable that the matter shouldbe considered by the Home Affairs Committee.In discussion it was pointed out that in the present situation itwas important to refrain from giving gratuitous offence to the TUCor to the Governments own supporters. It was understood,however, that arrangements were being made for the questions ofpolicy raised by the Bill to be considered in the near future bythe Home Affairs Committee.secret parliamentary        1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs t^e House of Commons in the following week.FutureBusinessSelect The  Attorney-General suggested that urgent considerationCommittees should be given to the conduct of meetings of Select Committeesoutside Westminster. Except in the Palace of Westminster or anyother premises under Parliamentary control, a Select Committee hadno special powers to ensure that its proceedings were respected: itwas in the position of an ordinary public meeting. The recentincidents at Essex University and at the London School of economics, when proceedings of the Select Committee on education and Science and of one of its Sub-Committees were disrupted bymilitant students, had demonstrated that there was a risk of theproceedings of Parliamentary bodies being brought into ridicule. Itmight be appropriate for the Committee of Privileges, which wasinvestigating the incident at Essex University, or some other body to consider the wider question of whether Select Committees should sit away from the House.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to consider the matter further in the light of the deliberations of the Committee of Privileges.
NorthernIrelandIndustrialRelationsBill(previous reference:CC (69) 19thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, as Chairman of the HomeAffairs Committee, to arrange for the Insurance(Employers&apos; Liability) Bill to be considered as a matterof urgency.The Home Secretary said that a successor to Captain 0&apos;Neillas Leader of the Unionist Party and Prime Minister of NorthernIreland was being selected that morning, and the Group of ministers primarily concerned with Northern Ireland would be meeting on thefollowing day to consider the situation in the light of the choice ofthe new Prime Minister. In the meantime he had no further developments to report. Ministers continued to adhere to their decision that any further use of British troops would be permittedonly on a request conveyed by the Government of Northern ireland to that of the United Kingdom, and there was at present no questionof troops being used on duties other than those they were alreadyperforming.In discussion the importance of the issues that might arise inNorthern Ireland was emphasised, and it was suggested that theCabinet should have an opportunity to discuss the problem ofNorthern Ireland before decisions had to be taken urgently on thequestions which might arise out of the new situation created by captain 0&apos;NeiU&apos;s resignation. The Foreign and commonwealth secretary undertook to convey to the Prime Minister the Cabinefswish to discuss Northern Ireland in the near future.The Paymaster General said that on 28th April the Committeeon Home Publicity had considered the draft of a popular guide tothe White Paper &quot; In Place of Strife &quot;. The Committee had expressedgrave doubts about the propriety of publishing a popular guide andhad proposed instead that a short new White Paper should beproduced to accompany the first Industrial Relations Bill. Thiswould concentrate on the measures contained in the Bill and ifprepared in a readily readable form and backed by adequatebackground material would serve as a basis on which a popularpublicity effort could be mounted. She had undertaken to reportthe Committee&apos;s views to the Parliamentary Committee or theCabinet and a decision on whether a guide or White Paper shouldbe published was now needed fairly urgently if the document wereto be ready before the conference to be held by the Trades UnionCongress on 5th June.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he would arrange for this matter to be considered further by the ministers concerned.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.
OverseaAffairsFrance and europe(previous reference:CC (69) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatMonsieur Pompidou appeared to be the most likely successor toGeneral de Gaulle as President of the French Republic. He wouldcertainly enjoy the support of at least the 47 per cent of Frenchelectors who voted in favour of General de Gaulle in the referendum.During the campaign, it would be important for us to avoid any action suggesting that we were attempting to influence the outcome of the election. Sudden changes in French policy were unlikely, butchanges would nevertheless come. The whole concept of general de Gaulle&apos;s policies, which had placed France in self-imposedisolation, was so contrary to the general trend in Europe and indeedto France&apos;s own best interests, that it was unlikely that they couldbe continued by any political figure who did not enjoy the General&apos;special position and exceptional hold over public opinion. It wastherefore to be expected that within a reasonable time Europeanaffairs and the question of the entry of Britain and other candidates for membership of the European Economic Community would cometo the fore again. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office werelooking again at the statement which the then Foreign Secretary,Mr. George Brown, had made at The Hague at the time of Britain&apos;application for membership. Meanwhile, the Anglo-ItalianDeclaration issued on the occasion of the State Visit to London ofthe President of Italy, Signor Saragat, taken in conjunction with theAnglo-German Declaration issued by the Prime Minister and theGerman Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, in connection with the former&apos;visit to Bonn, betokened a real quickening of the movement towardsfurther integration in Western Europe.The Cabinet-(1) Took   note  of   the   statement  by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as had been indicated in replies to Parliamentary Questions, a reply had beenreceived from the Rhodesian regime to our last memorandum of11th March. This in no way constituted a plan for a settlement;nor did it represent a serious attempt to bridge the gap between thetwo sides. However, it required an answer, and this should not be unduly delayed, in order to avoid criticism in this country and elsewhere that the British Government were being unreasonable or that they had neglected any chances of reaching agreement. a proposed reply had been considered by the Ministerial Group on rhodesia.   The reply would emphasise the desire of the British
Government to reach agreement on the basis of the Six principles and point out the respects in which the regime&apos;s proposals fell short of these. On one point the reply would go a little further than what had previously been said to the regime.   The Minister without portfolio, in his discussions with the regime in Salisbury, had offered a second safeguard under which an amendment to an entrenchedprovision of the independence constitution would be subject to a two-thirds majority in a referendum of the &quot; A &quot; Roll and &quot; B &quot; Rollelectors voting separately, the latter on a wider franchise than thepresent one.  The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would,under this proposal, have had the task of deciding whether a proposed amendment to the constitution was of such a kind that the secondsafeguard should be brought into operation, and the question would come before the Judicial Committee only on an initiative either byan agreed number of members of the Rhodesian Parliament or bythe Constitutional Council in Rhodesia.   The Minister without portfolio had been authorised, if satisfactory progress had been madeon other outstanding points, and if the question of reference to the privy Council were the only remaining obstacle to a settlement, torefer to his colleagues with a view to this requirement being dropped;but this situation had not arisen, and the offer had not been made.It was now proposed that if agreement could be reached on the other outstanding points the regime should be informed that we wereprepared to consider a variant of the referendum proposals putforward by the Minister without Portfolio in Salisbury last november in which the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council would playno part.   When we had made our reply, the South African andPortuguese Governments would be informed of its terms, as wouldbe the Governments of the United States and certain commonwealth countries, and in due course, a White Paper or similar documentwould be published setting out the various exchanges which hadtaken place. With the conclusion of the discussions in HMS Fearless,a position had been reached in which the great majority of opinion in Britain felt that the proposals we had made were right and thatwe should not go beyond them. Publication of the documents would help to reinforce this conviction.    The Ministerial Group had suggested   that   at   an   appropriate   time   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary should make a well-publicised speechsetting out the broad issues involved, not by way of detailed referenceto the specific proposals made at successive meetings with the regime,but in the context of the Six Principles. The Group were also givingdetailed consideration to possible courses of action assuming that,as seemed likely, the regime held the proposed referendum and thata &quot; republic &quot; was proclaimed and a new &quot; constitution &quot; adopted.The United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the united nations, Lord Caradon, would be consulted on these.
In discussion, the point was made that as a result of the meetings in HMS Fearless and the visit of the Minister without Portfolio to salisbury the Rhodesian problem had been removed from the areaof party controversy. The reply proposed, which would certainlybecome known, even if the exchanges with the regime were supposed to be confidential, would undo all the good that had been done.Opposition to the external safeguard constituted by reference tothe Judicial Committee of the Privy Council had been a major factor in the rejection by the regime of the Fearless proposals. To abandon the role of the Privy Council would be a major concession, for whichthere was no justification, and which would cause widespreadmisgiving in the Parliamentary Labour Party at a difficult moment.It had now been clearly established that there was no possibility ofa settlement with Mr. Smith and his regime, and we should not actin a way suggesting that we thought otherwise. In any case, the issues involved, both domestic and foreign, were too serious and far-reaching to be discussed on the basis of an oral report. TheCabinet should deal with them in greater depth, and fulldocumentation should be made available.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the abandonment of the role of the Privy Council was a less important issue than atfirst sight it might appear. It was certainly not one of which we ought to make a sticking point if at any time we could obtainsatisfaction on the other outstanding issues. Moreover the formulation in the proposed reply did not commit us to more thansaying to the regime that we were prepared to consider something which we had already said in Parliament we were prepared toconsider. Under the proposals put forward by the Minister without portfolio in Salisbury last November, the function of the privy council had been the restricted one of deciding whether a givenamendment was of such a nature as to justify the bringing intooperation of the referendum procedure. Paradoxically, the effectof removing it would be to strengthen the &quot; second safeguard&quot;,since, without it, all proposed amendments would be automaticallysubjected to a referendum. Although there was admittedly no serious prospect that the present exchanges with Mr. Smith would lead to a settlement, a reply to the regime&apos;s latest memorandum was necessary if only because we must be able to demonstrateconvincingly to public opinion, not merely that we had maintainedour allegiance to the Six Principles, but that we had also doneeverything possible to achieve agreement.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summing up thediscussion, said that while he hoped that his colleagues would agreeto a reply on the lines he had suggested, it was clear that the general
feeling was in favour of further discussion in Cabinet. He felt thatthis was likely to show that the issue of the role of the Privy council as an external safeguard was a less important one than the courseof the present discussion had tended to suggest. The Cabinet would resume discussion at an early date on the basis of a paper which hewould prepare, and to which would be annexed the relevantdocuments, including the text of the proposed reply to the Rhodesianmemorandum of 16th April: the Ministerial Group would continue their examination, to which he had referred earlier, of possible courses of action after the referendum.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toprepare a paper on the lines indicated in his summing up as a basis for a resumed discussion at an early date.(4) Invited the Ministerial Group on Rhodesia to continue their examination of possible courses of action after the referendum.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe had received fromthe Consultative Assembly a recommendation recalling the views which the Assembly had on various occasions expressed regardingthe situation in Greece and inviting the Committee of Ministers totake appropriate action within a specific period. The recommendationleft for decision by the Committee of Ministers both the nature ofthe action to be taken and the definition of the specific period. Hehad sought the views of other Governments on this recommendation.The Scandinavian Governments had suggested that the Committeeof Ministers, after an exchange of views, should await the reportof the Council&apos;s Human Rights Commission, and meanwhile retain the item on their agenda. This procedure seemed a rather leisurelyone and he had suggested that the Human Rights Commission mightbe invited to report as soon as possible. During the State Visit toLondon of the President of Italy, Signor Saragat, the Italian ForeignMinister, Signor Nenni, had suggested that there should be a special meeting of the Committee of Ministers to consider the matter assoon as the Human Rights Commission reported. We should beprepared to accept this, provided that the Human RightsCommission^ report was likely to be ready without undue delay.There would be an exchange of views in the forthcoming meetingof the Committee of Ministers in which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary hoped there would be general agreementwith the views expressed by the Consultative Assembly. It was important that there should be unanimity in the Committee of
Greece:Sale ofNuclearPowerStationMr. GeraldBrooke(previous reference:CC(69) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)Ministers, as failure to achieve this would be likely to consolidate the hold of the present regime in Greece and encourage it in itspresent courses.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that a Protocolhad recently been signed for the sale of a British nuclear reactor to greece and the parallel purchase of Greek tobacco for the UnitedKingdom market. The arrangement was a purely commercial one with no political overtones. We were prepared to sell reactors ofthe type involved to any country and had, indeed, been consideringsuch sales to other countries, including Rumania. The sale of thereactor would be a substantial advantage to our balance ofpayments, while the purchase of tobacco would have no adverse effecton it since it would not result in an increase in the total consumptionof tobacco in the United Kingdom. The Greek Government had pressed for an early announcement, and he had agreed to this beingmade later that day. In doing so, he had had in mind that theCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe would be meetingon 5th-6th May, and if the announcement had been postponed until after that we might have laid ourselves open to charges of attempting to conceal the sale during the meeting.The Cabinet-(5) Took  note   of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed hiscolleagues of recent developments in regard to Mr. Gerald Brooke.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said, for hiscolleagues&apos; very confidential information, that the Soviet embassy had recently told the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that theSoviet Government intended to put Mr. Gerald Brooke, the Britishlecturer imprisoned in the Soviet Union on charges of espionage,on trial again on charges based on his alleged conduct while in prison. The Soviet Ambassador would be told that if Mr. Brookewere put on trial and received a further sentence, there would beno prospect of the release of the Soviet agents, Mr. and Mrs. Kroger,who are at present serving prison sentences in the United Kingdom,before the earliest date at which they would in the normal course be released if they earned maximum remission, i.e., 191 A; but thatthe matter might be reconsidered if it were agreed that Mr. Brookewould be released without further trial and on the completion ofhis current term of imprisonment. If Mr. Brooke were subjected to a further trial, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would askfor the removal of a number of members of the Soviet Embassy* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
North Korea(previous reference:CC (69) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)staff who were known to be engaged in intelligence activities. if mr. Brooke were to be put on trial again this would represent a victory of the KGB (Soviet intelligence service) over the soviet foreign Ministry. Although he could not be optimistic about the outcome, there was a possibility that if the Soviet intelligence serviceknew that a further trial of Mr. Brooke would result in the expulsionfrom Britain of a number of their agents, this would help the soviet foreign Ministry to bring pressure to bear on the KGB to modify their attitude.In discussion, the point was made that Mr. Brooke was being held in the Soviet Union largely as a bargaining counter to securethe release of the Krogers, who were important Soviet agents.Mr. Brooke would probably be freed if we offered to exchange him for the Krogers. As against this, it was pointed out that if theKrogers were released this would raise difficult problems inconnection with the continued detention of other prisoners servingsentences for espionage. The KGB attached great importance to securing the return of its agents, and the fact that these two keyagents had been caught and imprisoned was a considerable blow to their morale and prestige. The position of British subjects residing in the Soviet Union, who were constantly at risk, had also to beconsidered. Any public indication that we were prepared to release the Krogers in return for Mr. Brooke might be highly prejudicial to our interests, and Ministers should be careful to avoid any mention of the subject in speeches or private conversation. The point wasalso made that the Minister of Technology, on present plans, wouldbe going to the Soviet Union in about a fortnights time, on a visitwhich had been postponed as a result of the Czechoslovak crisis.If the Soviet Union decided to put Mr. Brooke on trial again, the visit would have to be reconsidered and the political factors involvedcarefully weighed against the possible damage to our economic interests which would result from a cancellation.The Cabinet-(6) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement and of the points made in discussion.(7) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theMinister of Technology to consider in the light of developments whether the latter should visit the soviet union as planned.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theAmerican Presidents Assistant for National Security Affairs,Dr. Henry Kissinger, had informed our Ambassador in Washingtonthat the United States Administration had received indications,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
Common-wealthImmigrationCompulsoryEntryCertificatesfor Settlement(previous reference:CC (69) 7thConclusions,Minute 2)which they were taking very seriously, of a possible further attackon United States naval craft by North Korean forces. A strongwarning had been conveyed to the North Koreans, and the UnitedStates Administration hoped that it would be heeded. However,they wished the British Government to know that should there be such an attack it would be followed by immediate and drastic measures and the United States Administration would be gratefulif the British Government would publicly signify their approval ofUnited States action should the necessity arise. The british ambassador had been instructed to find out the nature of themeasures which were contemplated, and to make it clear to theAmerican Administration that our public reaction would necessarily depend on this.The Cabinet-(8) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (69) 42), proposing that entry certificates for the dependants of Commonwealth immigrants should be madecompulsory instead of optional.The Home Secretary said that the Committee on immigration and Community Relations under his chairmanship had recently approved a proposal that we should introduce an amendment to the immigration Appeals Bill (at present awaiting consideration in committee in the House of Lords) to require the dependants of commonwealth immigrants to obtain entry certificates before coming here for settlement. The Prime Minister had asked that thematter be brought to the notice of the Cabinet before any public statement was made.The system which he now proposed to make universal was already widely used, notably by West Indian immigrants, and had proved successful. The object of his proposal was primarilyhumanitarian. The present system entailed the detention of largenumbers of dependants in highly unsatisfactory conditions at london airport and elsewhere while their claims were checked byImmigration Officers. The system had resulted in widespreadcriticism of the Home Office, which had however been powerlessto improve it. Under the arrangements now proposed, facilities would be available for Indian and Pakistani dependants to obtaincertificates of entry from Home Office Immigration Officialsstationed in India and Pakistan. In order to avoid any suspicion of unfairness, he proposed to set up an interim appeal system in
advance of the establishment of the Immigration Appeals Tribunalunder the new Bill.  Appeals would be heard in this country.He had been invited by the Committee on Immigration and community Relations to explain his proposals privately to a numberof outside bodies. During the last few days he had seen Mr. Rose,Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party&apos;s Home AffairsCommittee, Dr. David Pitt, Deputy Chairman of the community relations Commission (Mr. Cousins, the Chairman, being out ofthe country) and Mr. Arthur Bottomley, Chairman of the SelectCommittee on Immigration and Race Relations. Mr. Bonham-Carter,Chairman of the Race Relations Board, Mr. Jeremy Thorpe, leader of the Liberal Party, and Miss Joan Lestor, mp, had also been consulted. All had stated that they were in favour of the proposed change while Mr. Quintin Hogg, the Opposition spokesman on homeaffairs, was already on record in the same sense. In order to avoid any accusations of racial discrimination in his proposals, which hewas confident would be widely welcomed, he intended that the samerules should be applied to aliens.In discussion, the following points were made:(a) Although there would be arrangements under which overseaapplicants for entry certificates could appeal against decisions notto allow entry, rejected applicants would not under present arrangements be able to appear personally before the AppealsTribunal. This was not, however, a new problem; it could arise under the present system and arrangements were made for theappellant to be represented.(b) Some further thought might have to be given to the financial effect of the new arrangements on the airline companies.(c) If the changes were to be incorporated in the immigration appeals Bill, it would be desirable to make an early statement inthe House of Commons.In further discussion, there was general agreement with theHome Secretary&apos;s proposals, which it was noted had been welcomed by all the main outside bodies concerned with problems of immigration.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C (69] 42.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the introductionof the necessary amendments to the Immigration AppealsBill and to make an early statement in the House ofCommons.
CC 20 (69)CONFIDENTIALMalta 4.  The Cabinet considered the question of the terms of financialFinancial assistance to the Malta Government during the second of theAssistance      five-year periods of aid provided for in the 1964 Financial Agreement.Previous Ministerial consideration of the problem was recorded inmemoranda circulated to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee(OPD(69)21, 22 and 23) which had now also been circulated tothe Cabinet.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that under theAgreement concluded in 1964 by the previous Administration, wehad agreed that the Malta Government should be given financialassistance over a 10-year period. It had been agreed that for thefirst five-year period, which had ended on 31st March, 1969, this assistance should be in the ratio of 75 per cent grant: 25 per centloan. The ratio for the second five-year period was left for laterdiscussion. In January of this year Ministers had decided to offerassistance on the basis of a 50:50 ratio of grant to loan. The Maltesehad rejected this offer but, following further consideration by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee in March, it had beendecided to reaffirm it. The Committee had directed, however, thatthe matter could be raised again if it became clear that, in the absenceof an offer better than 50:50, the Malta Government were preparedto take steps that would damage our own interests sufficiently to warrant a further concession on our part. The Malta Governmenthad duly been informed that we were not prepared to improve onour January offer, and had replied in an aide-memoire dated 1st April refusing the offer and requesting revision of the 1964Defence and Financial Agreements. The Maltese Governmentsreply had been considered at a meeting of Ministers under his chairmanship on 25th April, held at the Prime Minister^ direction.The majority of those present had been of the &quot;view that we should offer to reopen financial negotiations and should be prepared in thelast resort to improve our earlier offer up to a 75:25 ratio of grant to loan, but others thought that the issues raised by a further concession to the Maltese were such as to require reference to theCabinet.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the considerations which weighed with him in advocating an offer tocontinue negotiations were the potentially high cost, in both economicand political terms, of the harassment which the Malta Governmentwould be likely to engage in if we refused to negotiate further. he accepted that there was no economic case for aid on the scale whichthe Malta Government were seeking.
The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that both the chancellor and he were strongly of the opinion that we should not go beyondthe 50:50 offer. It was common ground that there was no economiccase for any assistance, since Malta&apos;s economy was booming and itsreserves were proportionately far higher than our own. To surrender to what amounted to blackmail would only store up trouble for ourselves in the future. He suspected that, in the last resort, the maltese threats would prove to be largely empty.In discussion it was argued, on the one hand, that previous experience had shown that the Maltese were prepared to engage inharassing measures which were costly and unpleasant for us, eventhough they themselves suffered in the process. It was also argued that the potential costs of a breakdown in Malta both costs in the island and the cost of providing facilities elsewhere greatlyexceeded the costs of making even the full concession of a 75:25grant to loan ratio. As against this it was pointed out that it wouldbe wrong to surrender to threats; that the material interest ofthe Maltese was heavily weighted in favour of reaching someaccommodation with us; and that it was unlikely that they would act so irrationally as to cause us to leave the island.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summing up thediscussion, said that the view of the Cabinet, on balance, was thatwe should stand firm on the offer of a 50:50 ratio of grant to loanwhich we had made in January and reiterated in March. He would arrange for the Maltese Government to be informed accordingly.The Cabinet-Took   note,   with   approval,   of   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion.SelectCommitteeonNationalisedIndustriesReport onMinisterialControlof theNationalisedIndustriesCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (69) 41) to which was attached a note by officialscovering a draft White Paper in reply to the Report, by the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries, on Ministerial Control of the nationalised Industries.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that at their meeting on 4th March the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic policy had considered a draft reply to the Select Committee&apos;s Report. this had been amended in the light of the Committee&apos;s discussion andof comments made by the Chairmen of the Nationalised Industries.If the Cabinet approved the revised text the reply would be published as a White Paper and presented to Parliament by the Prime Minister.He would discuss the timing of publication with the Lord President,
CC 20 (69)and copies of the confidential final revise would be sent to theChairman of the Select Committee and to the Chairmen of the nationalised Industries 48 hours before publication.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the text of the draft White Paper attached toC(69)41.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for publication in consultation with the Lord President onthe timing.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st May, 1969.
