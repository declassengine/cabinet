The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet at their previous meeting had invited him, in consultation with the Lord President, theChief Whip and other Ministers concerned, to consider the proposal that the remainder of the Committee Stage of the Parliament (No. 2)Bill should be taken in Standing Committee (CC (69) 10thConclusions, Minute 2). Their examination had shown that thiscourse offered little advantage and they could not recommend it totheir colleagues; time on the floor of the House would have to befound not merely for the necessary motion but also for the report stage of the Bill, which would not be needed if Committee Stagewere completed on the floor; there was a risk that the motion wouldnot be carried; it would be extremely difficult to keep a majority inthe Committee; and the Committee Stage would not be completedearly enough to send the Bill to the House of Lords in good time.If this view were accepted and withdrawal of the Bill was out of thequestion, the choice seemed to lie between continuing on the present basis and imposing a timetable. The Bill embodied proposals whichhad been virtually agreed between the Parties, but it had receivedvery little support from the Opposition Front Bench, and attempts to arrange a formal meeting to clarify the attitude of the opposition had been met with evasions. Opposition among their ownbackbenchers was confined to a small minority, but if they continued with the Bill they could not rely on all-night sittings to speed progressbecause their supporters would not be willing to attend in sufficient strength to enforce the closure. In the circumstances they had concluded that the best course would be to table a timetable motion;there were a number of precedents for guillotining majorconstitutional measures. The motion should allot four more days forthe completion of the Committee Stage, leaving it to the business committee under Standing Order 43 to work out the detailedtimetable. He Understood that the Shadow Cabinet had decidedthat any such motion Would be met with a three-line whip, but thisWould help to rally the Governments supporters and he thought10348SECRET1. The Cabinet noted with satisfaction that, for the fifth year in succession, their annual Statement on Defence had been approvedby the House of Commons.
that some of those opposed to the Bill would be prepared to supportthe motion in order to save the rest of the Governments legislative programme.The Chief Whip said that when at the previous meeting he gaveas his view that the Government could have no certainty of carrying a timetable motion, he had been assuming that the conservative party would not press their opposition very hard. It was now clearthat this was a false assumption and that not merely would athree-line whip be issued, but opponents of the Bill would be activeto see that it was observed; only about 50 Conservative Memberssupported the Bill, whereas about 120 were hostile to it and another70 mildly so. He now estimated that the motion would be lost bybetween 30 and 35 votes.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould reconsider their attitude to the Parliament Bill. They had sought to arrive at an agreed solution, and in making concessions to the Opposition had included in the Bill provisions which were most unwelcome to some of their own supporters. They had expectedto rely on substantial support from the Opposition, but this was not forthcoming, whether because the Front Bench were unable tocontrol their backbenchers or because they took pleasure in theGovernments difficulties. They were entitled to ask the Oppositionwhere they stood in this matter and if they were unwilling to come toany accommodation the Government could not be regarded as bound by the previous consultations and would be free to introduce a bill of their own devising which would be more acceptable to their supporters.On the other hand the Government could not allow their policy to be dictated by a minority of their own supporters; they had otherlegislative proposals which were bitterly opposed by some of their supporters and if they gave way in the present case the dissidentswould be encouraged and the prospects of the Industrial relations bill, in particular, would be prejudiced. It was therefore out of thequestion to abandon the Parliament Bill. It might be somewhat lessdamaging to the Governments authority to withdraw it and substitute a more radical measure, but any such Bill would have tobe passed under the Parliament Act and the price would be the disruption of the Governments legislative plans for what wouldprobably be the last Session of the present Parliament.On the suggestion that a timetable motion be tabled, most members of the Cabinet accepted the Chief Whip&apos;s assessment ofthe position, and there was general agreement that for theGovernment to fail to carry the motion would be a major defeat.Even if the motion could be carried there was good reason to think
that, if the Government imposed a timetable, the House of lords would reject the Bill; but, if the Bill passed the Commons in theusual way, they could hope for more co-operation from theOpposition in the House of Lords. It might be necessary to make concessions on the date of operation of the changes, but there was agood chance that the Bill could be carried in its present form.In further discussion emphasis was laid on the importance ofthe Governmenfs maintaining a united and determined front. Therewas a feeling abroad that they were half-hearted about the Bill andmany of their difficulties were due to this fact. It was essential forthe Government to re-establish their authority within the party; themajority of loyal Labour Members were increasingly resentful of theactivities of a minority of dissidents who opposed the Governmenfspolicies on issue after issue, and the time had come to arrest the fallin morale by strengthening discipline. As a first step a party meeting should be summoned to emphasise the need for loyalty and cohesion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed on the need to reappraise the Governmenfsattitude to the Bill. They were also agreed on the need for theGovernment to show a resolute and united front and Ministers mustbe careful to avoid voicing in private opinions, whether on this orother issues, which might give the impression that the Governmentwere divided or half-hearted in their support of their policies. Thegeneral feeling was that they could not afford to withdraw the Bill,and most members of the Cabinet felt that the risks associated witha timetable motion were too great to be acceptable; but no firm decisions were being taken at this stage. The first essential was to clarify the attitude of the Opposition. The Chief Whip should seek a meeting with the Opposition, at which the Lord President and theHome Secretary should be present, to discuss the question of atimetable for the Bill; if the Opposition would not accept a timetablemotion, they might, as on other occasions, be prepared to agree toa voluntary timetable. If the Opposition were not prepared toco-operate in any form, the Government must arrange its policiesaccordingly and it might be desirable to put the issues before a partymeeting. The Cabinet would consider the matter further in thelight of the Opposition reaction, and in the meantime the ministerial committee on the House of Lords should meet as soon as possibleto examine the alternatives open to the Government. If the lord president were challenged, on the Business Statement, about the government&apos;s intentions on the Bill, he should maintain their determination to secure its passage and explain that the failure to allocate time was due to the pressure of defence business.
The Cabinet-(I) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to seek to arrange a formal meeting with the Opposition with a view to agreeing a timetable for the remainder of the Committee Stage of the parliament Bill.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the ministerial committee on the House of Lords to meet as soon aspossible to explore further the alternatives open to theGovernment, if the Opposition declined to co-operate.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.CONFIDENTIALOverseaAffairsVisit toEuropeof thePresidentof theUnitedStates2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that president Nixon&apos;s conversations with the Federal german chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, had concentrated on East/West relations and the Common Market. With regard to the former, PresidentNixon had confirmed that he had no intention of entering into discussions with the Soviet Union without consulting his allies andin isolation from them. On the latter point both Governments had agreed that it was not possible to conceive of any real future for europe without Britain. In France the atmosphere of the talks withthe French President, General de Gaulle, had been cordial; but itappeared that both Governments had stated their positions on theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Europe without change andwithout reaching agreement. President Nixon had, however, formed the impression that the French would not regard bilateral talks between the United States and the Soviet Union on strategic armslimitation as a &quot; new Yalta &quot;; that the French attitude on the middle east had become somewhat less rigid; and that in the talks on thissubject which were to take place between the representatives on theUnited Nations Security Council of the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, France and the Soviet Union, France would not necessarilyadopt the same attitude as the Soviet Union on every issue. It didnot appear that in the conversations with the French government there had been any mention of nuclear matters or of the provisionof nuclear information by the United States to France.In general, President Nixon&apos;s visit could be Said to have achieved its primary object of helping the President to get to know the United States&apos; European allies and raising the latter&apos;s morale.
Germany(PreviousKiiforonco:CC(69) 8lhConclusions.Minnie 3)Angmlla(previous reference:CC (67) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Anguilla,a small West Indian island with a population of 6,000, had hitherto been part of the &quot; Associated State &quot; of which the other members were St. Kilts and Nevis. Anguilla had felt neglected by the centralauthority, and had announced its intention of seceding from theAssociation. It would be undesirable for the British Government toget more involved than necessary; on the other hand, we had certainresponsibilities in this matter and there might be repercussions inthe United Nations. If Anguilla seceded from the Association, therewas a. danger that elements from the underworld in the United states might move in. He proposed, as a first step, to send to AnguillaMr. Lee, a former colonial civil servant who was well known in the island and had long experience of its problems. Depending on howMr. Lee was received, he would consider instructing the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Common-wealth Affairs, Mr. Whitlock, who was at present in the Caribbeanarea, to visit the island.The Cabinet (1) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.Nigeria(previous reference:CC(69)7thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had recently seen the Nigerian High Commissioner in London and had raised with him the question of the bombing of civilian targets bythe Federal Nigerian Air Force. A similar approach had been madeby the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Lagos to GeneralGowon, the Head of the Federal Military Government. GeneralGowon had shown the High Commissioner the orders issued toFederal Nigerian pilots, which contained strict instructions to avoidsuch targets; but both the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary andThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as theCabinet would be aware, the Social Democratic candidate, Dr. GustavHeinemann, had been elected President of the Federal Republic ofGermany, albeit by a small majority. So far the holding of the presidential election in West Berlin had not resulted in any serious incident, though there was still a possibility that the Soviet or east german forces might harass the departure of members of the federal assembly. The East German authorities had rejected attempts bythe Federal German Republic and the West Berlin Senate to cometo an arrangement whereby the holding of the Presidential elections in Berlin would have been abandoned in exchange for concessionsallowing greater freedom of movement between the Soviet Sector of berlin and the Western Sectors.
the United Kingdom High Commissioner had pointed out to theNigerians that whether through disobedience or incompetence, the pilots were not in fact complying with their instructions. When urged to agree to the international observers now operating in Federalterritory to operate also in rebel-occupied territory, General Gowontold the United Kingdom High Commissioner that he wanted tothink this over. The Nigerian High Commissioner in London,however, had said that he thought his Government would be preparedto agree; and this was being pursued further.In discussion the point was made that the situation in Nigeriawas arousing increasing public and Parliamentary interest and that many members of the Parliamentary Labour Party had misgivingsabout the Governments policy. It was for consideration whether there should not be a debate in which the Government could make clear their attitude, and in particular their abhorrence of theindiscriminate bombing in which the Federal forces had beenindulging, and could bring into the open the efforts which britain had been making to secure a cease-fire. It was pointed out, however,that the Biafrans also had bombed civilian targets in Federal territory,and that that there had been no reaction from us. The federal government could accuse us of bias if they were now singled out for condemnation. The Federal Government appeared to be makinga genuine effort to ensure that their forces obeyed orders, and hadindeed executed a number of officers who had been charged withatrocities. While there were certainly misgivings about government policy in the Parliamentary Labour Party, it was difficult to tell howwidespread these were, and it would be unwise to give the impression that the Government were prepared to reconsider their policy towards Nigeria as a result of outside pressures. On the other hand,the question of introducing international observers into the territories of the contending parties should be vigorously pursued; and it wouldbe helpful if the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary could prepare a paper on the Nigerian situation for consideration in the defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement and of the points made in discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary tocontinue his efforts to secure the introduction ofinternational observers into both Federal Nigerianterritory and Biafra.(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to circulate a memorandum on the Nigerian situation forconsideration in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee.
CC11 (69)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that over 40,000 of theFord Motor Company&apos;s employees were still on strike. Thecompany had been granted an interim injunction restraining thetrade unions concerned from taking further action to promote thestrike, and it was expected that the court&apos;s decision on their application for a mandatory injunction would be known shortly.The Acting General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress wouldbe seeing representatives of the unions concerned later that day inan effort to find a basis for the resumption of work. For the timebeing therefore the Government could only await developments.The Minister of State, Board of Trade, said that Fords1 current production for export was estimated to be worth about  3-5 million a week. Given the widespread nature of the strike it must be assumed that most of this output was being lost. The effect on the monthlytrade figures would not be immediate and his tentative judgmentwas that if the strike were to come to an end shortly the effect mightbe small. A more prolonged strike could begin to have a significant effort on exports in March or April and the amount involved couldbuild up to about  15 million a month.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the First Secretary of Stateand the Minister of State, Board of Trade.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum about the farm price Review 1969 by the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Agriculture (C (69) 22).The Minister of Agriculture said that negotiations with the farmers&apos; representatives had been proceeding on the basis of an award not exceeding  30 million, which had been authorised by theCabinet. It was clear that, while there was agreement with the farmers that the emphasis in the award should be on beef, pigs andcereals, a total as small as  30 million would be wholly unacceptable,and if it were imposed on the farmers there would be a serious crisis in the industry. The farmers had made plain their view, with whichhe agreed, that such an award was quite inadequate to achieve theexpansion programme, and consequent import saving, to which theGovernment were committed. Since the Cabinet had last consideredthe situation, the increase in Bank Rate would raise costs byR
 2-4 million; the publication of the Economic Assessment to 1972had confirmed the Governments commitment to the expansion programme announced last November; and the report of the SelectCommittee on Agriculture, published on 5th March, had stronglyfavoured agricultural expansion. In the circumstances, it wasnecessary to increase substantially the size of the award in order toreach a settlement which could be defended as consistent with theGovernments declared policy. Within the total award, he proposedto place the main emphasis on beef, pigs and cereals; he intendedto make a neutral award on milk; and to provide less than fullrecoupment of cost increases on sheep, oats and potatoes. He was proposing to give no increase at all for sugar beet.The Minister without Portfolio said that the Agricultural PolicyCommittee had been unable to reach agreement on how the award of  30 million might best be divided between the various commoditiesconcerned. The Agriculture Ministers had insisted that it wasnecessary to provide as much for beef 15s. Od. a cwt. within a 30 million award as within their original proposed  50 million. it seemed clear from discussion in the Agricultural Policy Committeethat an award of this size for beef could not be made consistent witha total award of  30 million, since it would not leave sufficient forsheep and a number of other commodities. He could not accept thatan award of  30 million was inconsistent with the Governmentsagricultural expansion policy announced last November. That policy was decided on the basis of an extensive report by officials andeconomic advisers which had, inter alia, reached the conclusion that agricultural expansion could be expected to proceed at the rateagreed by Ministers if the farmers were left, over the next four years,with about half their annual increase in profits. Moreover, anincrease of 15s. Od. per cwt. for beef more than double the increasein costs would be the largest for many years. He had reached theconclusion, therefore, that on economic grounds an award of 30 million remained adequate. He could not ignore the fact thatthe cost of the award to the Exchequer would reduce the contingency reserve which had been so painfully established by last summetsexpenditure cuts. Any addition to the award would still furtherreduce the contingency reserve and therefore the Governmenfsfuture freedom of political and economic manoeuvre.In discussion, it was pointed out that the farmers&apos; incomes and output had fallen substantially in 1968-69 and that the investment,expansion and import saving required could not be expected without an adequate allowance for these setbacks in this year&apos;s award. Itwas suggested that, if an award of  30 million were imposed, theGovernment would have to admit that they had been compelled to defer the start of the new expansion programme.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th March, 1969.On the other hand, it was suggested that there was generalagreement that there should be negative awards minus  6 - 9 million for milk and eggs. In consequence, within a total of  30 million,the remaining commodities would share an award of  36-9 million,i.e.,  4-5 million in excess of their total increases in cost (including those due to the increase in Bank Rate). The Government wouldbe able without difficulty to demonstrate in these circumstances thatthe award was consistent with the expansion programme announcedlast November. The only significant change since this matter had last been considered was the increase in Bank Rate. The Bank Ratehad, however, been reduced last year after it had entered into thecomputation of costs for the purposes of the Review, and the samecould happen again.In further discussion, it was suggested that the size of the awardcould be increased, without increasing public expenditure, by raising the awards for milk and sugar. On the other hand, it was argued that any further encouragement to milk production would seriouslyworsen the already difficult situation which existed with our commonwealth and other traditional suppliers of milk products;and that an increase for sugar would create difficulties in relationto the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement.Finally, it was suggested that if the award were substantially increased above  30 million the Government should explain to the farmers&apos; representatives that this was in all the circumstancesgenerous, and would be taken into account in subsequent reviews.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that ministers were very evenly divided between those who consideredthe limit should be  30 million and those who wanted more. on balance, the Cabinet were now prepared to accept an increase to afinal figure of  34 million on the clear understanding that they wouldnot consider a request for any further increase.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to negotiate a totalaward of  34 million in the Farm Price Review 1969.
