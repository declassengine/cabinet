CC 19(69)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs (C (69) 38) and the President of theBoard of Trade (C (69) 40) about the report of the Committee onthe Intermediate Areas (the Hunt Report); and a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (69) 39) to which was attached a draft Parliamentary statement.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that the reportby officials attached to C (69) 38 set out the provisional decisions reached by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic policy on a programme of assistance for certain areas following the Reportof the Hunt Committee.The Cabinet considered C (69) 38 section by section.Intermediate areas the Cabinet-(1) Agreed that special assistance to industry should be providedwithin the intermediate areas described in paragraph 2 ofC (69) 38. The exact boundaries of these areas wouldbe settled after consultation with the Regional economic planning Councils.Measures of AssistanceIn discussion it was suggested that a reduced level of regional employment Premium (REP) would be the most effective methodof helping the intermediate areas. On the other hand it was argued that a reduced rate of REP would lead to greater criticism from thedevelopment areas than the present proposals and would not satisfy the intermediate areas; it would also add to the complexity of thearrangements.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that assistance to industry should be made availablein the intermediate areas as described in paragraphs 4-of C (69) 38.Derelict land clearanceIndustrial Development CertificatesThe Humber bridge the Cabinet-(3) Approved the proposals for derelict land clearance inparagraph 7 of C (69) 38.10367
(4) Approved the future policy in relation to the issue ofIndustrial  Development  Certificates  as  set  out inparagraphs 8-11 of C (69) 38.(5) Agreed that construction of the Humber Bridge, whichshould be subject to tolls, and its associated roads should start in 1972.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to announce the decision at (5) when the HumbersideReport by the Central Unit for Environmental Planningwas published.Calder Valley and other roadsThe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that a partof the total assistance to the intermediate areas would take the formof expenditure of  5 million a year on developmental road works.In 1972-73 and 1973-74 this sum would be fully committed to theconstruction of the Humber Bridge. Thereafter the cost of the humber Bridge would be met from within the normal expenditure programme of the Ministry of Transport. Thus it would be possible from 1974-75 to spend up to  5 million a year either on the CalderValley link road thus bringing forward the date of its start oron other developmental road links of the kind proposed by theHunt Committee. A decision on how the  5 million should be allocated in 1974-75 and subsequently was not required at this stage.In discussion it was strongly argued that the provision of the humber Bridge out of financial savings made at the expense of thedevelopment areas would be difficult enough to defend and that there could be no justification for providing additional roads in Englandand Wales at the expense of the Scottish and other development areas. The problems of the latter were by no means solved. Onthe other hand it was pointed out that expenditure of  20 million ayear on additional assistance to the intermediate areas was relatively small compared with the large and growing expenditure in thedevelopment areas; and improvement of communications in the intermediate areas was an essential part of the assistance required.Industrial development certificates had been approved in 1968 fora total of 110 million square feet, of which nearly 38 million square feet were in the development areas. This total for the development areas was much larger than in any previous year and continued thesubstantially rising trend since the beginning of the 1960s.The Cabinet (7) Agreed, in principle, to the expenditure of  5 million a year after 1973-74 on additional road construction as part ofthe measures to assist development of the intermediateareas.
Proposed SavingsThe President of the Board of Trade said that a reduction of 5per cent in the rate of investment grant in the development areas would be badly received. It was widely regarded as the most successful of the development area incentives. More seriously, areduction in the rate would cause acute difficulties for the aluminiumsmelters, particularly for Alcan Limited. Expenditure on constructionof the aluminium smelters would reach a peak in 1970 althoughexpenditure on the second stage of the Alcan smelter would fallmainly in 1973. There would have to be transitional arrangements to provide continuance of the higher rate on projects undertaken inexpectation of that rate. These arrangements would need to covernot only the smelter but other large and long-term investment projects; a lower limit of the order of  100,000 total expenditure should cater for most projects where expenditure was likely to runbeyond a year. There would of course be a very sharp reaction from our partners in the European Free Trade Area if transitional provisions were provided only for the aluminium smelters.In discussion there was general agreement that the smelterspresented a difficult problem particularly in view of the letters sent bythe Board of Trade to the aluminium companies last year which had explained that it would be the normal practice to make suitabletransitional arrangements if substantial changes were made.However, it was argued that transitional relief extending as widelyas the President now proposed would whittle away the savings whichwere already barely sufficient to cover the cost of the programme ofassistance. After allowing for the reduction in corporation taxpayable consequent on the reduction in investment grants, the actualsavings to the Exchequer would be substantially less than  25 million in any event-and the net cost of the reduction to individual companies would similarly be much less. Postponement to 1st January, 1971, of the operative date for reduction in the rate would materially assist the smelter companies, although it would not cover the second stage of the Alcan smelter and would not avoid a major row with the smelter companies. Such a postponement would leave substantial expenditure not covered by savings in the second half of 1971. In all the circumstances it was suggested that therewould be advantage in finding the savings instead by withdrawal of theadditional 7s. 6d. in Selective Employment Tax payments to manufacturing companies in the development areas.It was further urged that the Department of Employment and productivity could not be expected to absorb within their normalprogramme the additional expenditure incurred on special trainingprogrammes for the intermediate areas in 1970-71.
The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the transitional problems raised by the President of the Boardof Trade could not be solved without further detailed examinationof the alternative solutions available. These included postponement of the date for a reduction in the rate of investment grant; some limited transitional provisions; or securing the savings from the selective employment premium instead of from investment grants inthe development areas. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should consider urgently with the Secretary of State for Economic affairs and the President of the Board of Trade the best method of resolvingthe difficulties raised while saving the sum required to meet the costof the assistance programme. Meanwhile the Secretary of State for economic Affairs in his statement to the House of Commons that day would say that the programme of assistance would cost nearly 20 million a year and that this cost would be met from a reduction inthe very substantial and increasing sums being spent on assistance to industry in the development areas; and the House would be informed that an early date of the details of the reallocation of this expenditure.The Cabinet (8) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade, to seek agreement on how the necessary savings could best be found to pay forthe programme of assistance to the intermediate areas;and to report to the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy as soon as possible.(9) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, in his statement to the House of Commons that day, to say thatthe cost of the programme would be met from sumsspent on assistance to industry in the development areas,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.Parliamentary statement in discussion of the draft statement, amendments were proposedin particular to the description of the intermediate areas and to take account of Conclusion (9) above.The Cabinet (10) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to amend the draft statement to take account of the points made in discussion of it; and to agree the amendment made totake account of (9) above with the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade.
ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessBettermentLevy(previous reference :CC (69) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was noted that Monday, 28th April, would be a Supply Day,when a debate would arise on an Opposition Motion on the refundingof betterment levy. It was not clear whether it would be open to members to raise on this occasion the question of the retrospectiveoperation of a provision to be inserted in the Finance Bill for therelief from betterment levy of certain small owner-occupiers, but ifthe point were raised it would be desirable that the government spokesman should explain clearly why it was thought to be impossiblefor the provisions to operate retrospectively.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would call a meeting ofthe Ministers concerned before the debate to consider what line the Government spokesman should take.industrial relations Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 17thConclusions)The Lord President reported that the Liaison Committee had asked that when the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) resumedon 30th April their discussion of the Governments proposals for legislation on industrial relations, the Attorney-General should be present to explain the legal aspects of the proposals for imposingfinancial penalties on persons participating in unconstitutional strikes. It would be more appropriate, however, for the LordChancellor to intervene in the course of the debate.In discussion it was suggested that the Lord Chancellor should explain why it had been necessary to put forward proposals forsanctions (other than criminal sanctions) to support the judgmentsof the Industrial Board. It would be useful to know the reactions of the PLP to this explanation before deciding upon the precise formthe sanctions should take in the draft Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be important to reduce the area of disagreement without committing the Government to the details to be embodied in thelegislation: these would have to be considered later in the light ofthe discussions in the PLP and of the next meeting between the first secretary of State and the Trades Union Congress (TUC). It wouldbe helpful if the Lord Chancellor would intervene in the discussion in the PLP meeting with these objects in mind.   Ministers should
NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)also take opportunities as they arose of explaining the government&apos;s proposals to members of the Trade Union Movement.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.SECRET*3. The Home Secretary reported to the Cabinet on thesituation in Northern Ireland. He said that since Captain 0&apos;Neill(the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland) had visited London inNovember, 1968 for discussions with United Kingdom Ministers, hehad secured the implementation of four of the five reforms which theyhad urged upon him. In addition, he had now secured the agreementof his Government to the early application of the principle of &quot; one man, one vote&quot; to the local government franchise. This was a remarkable achievement.On the previous Sunday (20th April) there had been a recrudescence of violence at civil rights demonstrations in NorthernIreland, and certain public utilities had been damaged by explosions.It had been impossible at short notice to call together the group ofMinisters primarily concerned with the problem of Northern Ireland,but the Prime Minister, the Defence Secretary and himself had agreedthat we should respond to a request from the Northern ireland government for the assistance of United Kingdom troops stationed in Northern Ireland in guarding certain key installations essentialto the life of the community. It was not yet possible to say who was responsible for recent explosions, but it was known that the irish republican Army (IRA) was now dominated by a Communist elementand that the civil rights organisation contained a mischievous fringeof extremists. For the present, however, the leaders of the civilrights movement were succeeding, though with difficulty, in maintaining their control. The extreme Protestant supporters of theReverend Ian Paisley were actively opposing the civil rights movement,and Captain 0&apos;Neill was thus exposed to attack from both flanks.It was unlikely that the implementation of the principle of &quot; one man, one vote &quot; would now put an end to violence, though it might result in separating the moderate members of the civil rightsmovement from the hooligan elements. The root of the unrest inNorthern Ireland seemed to lie in the growing contrast, reminiscentof the situation in this country early in the century, between therelative prosperity of a section of the people and the continuingpoverty of the majority. For the present the best course seemed tobe to support Captain 0&apos;Neill while his programme of reform wasimplemented.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the acting United Kingdom Commissioner in Anguilla, Mr. Cumber, hadtaken up his post, and the situation on the island appeared to be somewhat more stable. He had recently had informal talks with theHigh Commissioners of the Caribbean States on the longer termaspects of the problem. The talks had aroused some suspicions onthe part of Mr. Bradshaw, the Prime Minister of St. Kitts, Nevisand Anguilla, who has however been assured that they had beenpurely exploratory. It would probably be necessary at some stage in our consultations to invite Mr. Bradshaw to visit London for discussions.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the four-power talks in New York on the Middle East were making some progress. There were signs that the Soviet Union was drawingnearer to the Anglo-United States viewpoint on the importance of effective guarantees of the terms of any new settlement. This was particularly encouraging in that the Israeli Government regardedadequate guarantees as a crucial factor, which would go far todetermine their attitude to any settlement proposed by the four powers.10367bThe Prime Minister said that the troops had a duty at civil law to respond to requests to assist the civil power in maintaining order.Captain 0&apos;Neill had undertaken that such requests would not be madeexcept after consultation between the Government of NorthernIreland and the United Kingdom Government, but in the presentsituation, if it became necessary for the troops to intervene, they wouldbe thought to be doing so in order to maintain the Orange faction in power. The constitutional consequences might be very grave, and once we were involved it would be difficult to secure our withdrawal.He was considering whether there would be advantage in calling around-table conference. In the meantime the group of Ministers on northern Ireland were standing by in case urgent decisions were required. They would consider the constitutional position and,particularly, the obligations which rested on the United KingdomGovernment under Section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920,and would report to the Cabinet in the following week.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theHome Secretary.
North Korea(previous reference:CC (68) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)Mr. GeraldBrookeThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in discussions in Washington United States representatives had disclosedthat, up to the time when a United States surveillance aircraft hadbeen shot down by the North Koreans on 15th April, the new administration had not conducted any review of their policy onelectronic surveillance generally. A review was now in progress.The fact that Soviet forces had taken part in the search for traces ofthe missing aircraft was in accordance with standard internationalpractice at sea. In this case it also held out for the Russians theprospect of acquiring some information about United Statesequipment.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there was still no clear evidence whether the Soviet Government had decidedto stage a fresh trial of Mr. Gerald Brooke, the British lecturer atpresent imprisoned in the Soviet Union. There were indications of an internal struggle within the Soviet Government machine betweenforces which favoured a detente and those which attached over-ridingimportance to negotiating an exchange with Kroger, the Soviet spyimprisoned here. If the Russians did seek, by taking further actionagainst Mr. Brooke, to put further pressure on us to agree to an exchange with Kroger, issues of major importance requiringreference to the Cabinet would arise.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.LegislativeProgramme1969-70SECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (69) 35) on the legislative programme for 1969-70.The Lord President said that the provisional programme set outin his memorandum had been discussed in the Ministerial Committeeon Future Legislation and a substantial measure of agreement hadbeen reached. The programme was designed to be capable of beingpassed into law before the Summer Recess, so as to preserve themaximum freedom of manoeuvre, but a supplementary list of bills had been added which would be prepared, as resources permitted,against the possibility that the Session might be extended; one or twoof the Bills included in the programme might reach the Statute Bookthis Session and he was proposing to add Human Tissue to the reservelist. The core of the programme was the four major measures towhich the Government were already committed Industrial Relations,National Superannuation and Social Insurance, Merchant shipping and Ports Reorganisation. These would all be long and difficult Bills,and to avoid the risk that the House of Lords might have more
business than they could dispatch towards the end of the Session, with consequent need for an autumn spillover, it was highly desirable tointroduce at least one of the major Bills in that House. In his view it would be possible to introduce Merchant Shipping in this way,particularly if it had already received a Second Reading in the Houseof Commons during the present Session.In discussion the following points were made (a) While Merchant Shipping should be ready in time to receive a Second Reading in July, it would be most undesirable politically tointroduce it in the House of Lords next Session, since it would becritically received by Peers connected with the shipping industry.(b) A decision would have to be taken later whether to proceedwith legislation on local government reorganisation in Wales; it wouldbe possible to send any Bill to the Welsh Grand Committee.(c) A Bill on mineral working rights would be an attractiveaddition to the programme and might be considered for the reservelist.(d) The Home Secretary was under a statutory duty to lay thereport of the Boundary Commission before Parliament &quot; as soon asmay be &quot; after receipt, together with a draft Order in Council giving effect to the recommendations, with or without modifications; if itwere desired to take a different course, legislation would be needed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the programme set out in C (69) 35, subject to thepoints which had been made. It was important so to distribute thebusiness between the two Houses as to avoid the risk of congestion in the House of Lords late in the Session, but the necessary decisions could more conveniently be taken at a later stage.The Cabinet-Gave provisional approval to the proposals set out inC (69) 35.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th April, 1969.
