ParliamentaryAffairsFuture BusinessDivorce reform bill(previous reference:CC (69) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Chief Whip recalled that the Cabinet had agreed that thesponsors of the Divorce Reform Bill should be given an opportunityin Government time after 10 p.m., and subsequently in morningsittings, to secure the passage of the Bill through the House ofCommons. He had been asked on the previous evening by Sir LionelHeald to give time for a Motion critical of the Governments decisionto provide these facilities for a Private Member&apos;s Bill and had agreedthat the Motion could be put down for debate immediately beforethe debate on the Bill. He had thought it right that the opponents ofthe Bill should be enabled to state their case against the grant ofGovernment time for its discussion; but he had subsequently realised that the Motion amounted to a Motion of censure and that they mighthave difficulty in securing its rejection, since the day&apos;s business was subject only to a one-line Whip.In a brief discussion it was pointed out that the Government mustbe careful that, in giving time for what was clearly a filibusteringMotion, they did not establish a precedent. They might be obliged toprovide additional time for the Divorce Reform Bill equivalent to thatspent on the Motion. On the other hand, however, it was important to ensure that the Bill left the House of Commons in the current week.The appropriate course might be to move the closure at midnight,having if possible concluded the debate on the Estimates before10 o&apos;clock, and to issue a three-line Whip to ensure the attendance of sufficient Government supporters to secure the closure.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to give further consideration to the handling of the day&apos;s business inthe light of their discussion, and if necessary to reportdevelopments to the Prime Minister.SECRETOverseaAffairsRhodesia(previous reference:CC (69) 26thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Foreign and Commonwealth. Secretary said that theGovernor of Rhodesia, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, had now made hisintended statement. The British Press had not so far reported orcommented on Sir Humphrey Gibbs&apos; observation, which had beenmade with the concurrence of the Opposition, that the Constitutionproposed by the regime could not form the basis of a settlement with any Government in the United Kingdom. This point had however been picked up by the British Broadcasting Corporation.10394a 2
Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (69) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)CentrifugeCollaboration(previous reference:CC (69) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)Arms sales in the MiddleHastThe text of the policy speech which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had himself made on 10th June would be placed in the library of the House of Commons. It had been interpreted by the rhodesian Centre Party leadership as an intimation to the Rhodesianpeople that an honourable settlement was theirs for the. taking ifthere were a &quot; no &quot; vote in the referendum.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen no further difficulties since the closure of the land frontier at la Linea, and that emergency arrangements were working well. TheAlgeciras ferry was still running, but might be forced to close down ifthe restrictions imposed by the Spanish authorities on its use bySpanish nationals resulted in its ceasing to be commercially viable.This would suit the Spaniards better than closing the ferry down by administrative action, since they appeared to believe that this mightbe a violation of the Treaty of Utrecht, which was the purportedlegal basis for their measures against Gibraltar.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the tripartite Ministerial discussions in Bonn at which the BritishGovernment had been represented by the Minister of technology and the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Mr. Mulley, there had been difficulties with the Germans and Dutchwhich might slow down the timetable for the signature of aMemorandum of Understanding. This might however in the longrun be to our advantage, in that it would give us more time to resolvethe problems with the United States which he had mentioned to hiscolleagues on 9th June.The Cabinet-(1) Took  note  of  the  statements   by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.*The Cabinet considered the sale of arms in the Middle East.The Lord President said that the request made on the previous day in the House of Commons by Mr. Eric Heffer, for a statement on the sale of Chieftain tanks to Libya, would be pressed later inthe day.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was notthe practice to give the House of Commons details of individualarms deals. He was prepared, within the limitations so imposed, to answer a Parliamentary Question if one were to be put down; tomake a statement would not only be undesirable in itself but would set an awkward precedent. The line we had taken over the supplyof tanks to both Libya and Israel had been discussed by the Defence
CC27(69)and Oversea Policy Committee and agreed to in the knowledge thatthe supply of Chieftain tanks to Libya was an entirely different matterfrom their supply to an Arab country which was engaged, or couldengage, in active hostilities against Israel. There was no possibilityof the Chieftain tanks to be supplied to Libya being used in this way.It was also relevant that we had treaty obligations to Libya.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that the Israelies were well aware of our intention to supply Chieftain tanksto Libya and had been actively lobbying those whom they believed tobe their friends and supporters in this country. Such lobbying was probably not in their own best interests and might have the oppositeeffect to that intended; nevertheless, it was important that ministers should inform the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary of anyattempt to approach them in this context.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALPrices andIncomesPolicyService Pay(previous reference:CC (69) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to which was attached a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Defence on Service pay (C (69) 64).The Defence Secretary said that in 1966 the Government had decided to abandon the previous method of determining Service pay,which was known as the Grigg formula, and to make a standingreference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).The Board had now produced a clear and cogent report (Cmnd. 3651)in which they analysed conditions of Service life and made somefar-reaching and constructive proposals for reforming Service pay.The report showed that inadequate pay and conditions were the biggest single cause of the disastrous fall in recruiting, which if notarrested would face the Government with some grave and politicallydifficult choices. The Board had proposed an interim award of3-9 per cent on basic pay from 1st April, 1969; new scales of pay for service doctors and dentists to bring them nearer to parity withgeneral practitioners; and change in certain other allowances. Thiswould still leave the Services with significantly less than they wouldhave got under the Grigg formula and it was important that theGovernment should give some indication of their intentions for thelong-term restructuring of Service pay. On this the Board had proposed that there should be a &quot; military salary&quot;, common tomarried and single men, which would be fixed by a process of job
evaluation and supplemented by an amount to compensate for thegreater liability in the Services for disturbance and interference with private life (the X-factor). The cost of these reforms could not beestablished at present but it would amount to substantially more thanwhat the Services would have received under the Grigg formula.Because of the importance he attached to the long-term restructuringof Service pay he was prepared to agree that the cost of applying job evaluation and the X-factor next year should be held to not more than 31 million above what would have been allowed under the Griggformula; and that this additional cost should be met from the defence budget. His proposals had been agreed by the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes which had considered them very fully earlier in the week, and he proposed to announce them on Monday,16th June. He would explain to the Press as necessary that increasesarising from the long-term restructuring of Service pay might have tobe staged if they were too large.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the short-term recommendations in the NBPIreport on Service pay (Cmnd. 3651) should be accepted intheir entirety.(2) Endorsed in principle the Board&apos;s long-term recommendations on the structure of service pay.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to announce their decisions on Service pay concurrently with the publicationof the NBPI report.SECRETParliamentReview ofParliamentaryConstituencies(previous reference:CC (69) 26thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (C (69) 63) and the Secretary of State forScotland (C (69) 66) on the review of Parliamentary constituencies.They also had before them the reports of the Boundary Commissionsfor England, Scotland and Wales (circulated with C (69) 60).The Home Secretary said that the Boundary Commissions for england, Scotland and Wales had now submitted their secondperiodical reports under the House of Commons (Redistribution of seats) Acts, and he and the Secretary of State for Scotland were undera statutory duty to lay these before Parliament &quot; as soon as may be &quot;together with drafts of Orders in Council for giving effect to them,with or without modifications. This duty could be enforced bymandamus and there was a real risk that an application for such anorder would be made if there was any unreasonable delay. AQuestion had been tabled for oral answer on 19th June asking whenit was expected that the Orders in Council would be made and it
was essential that an early decision be taken on whether theGovernment intended to give effect to the reports or to legislate to suspend the present statutory obligation to do so. If they failed togive effect to the reports, there would be accusations ofgerrymandering, but he was himself convinced after a careful study of the reports that, political considerations apart, it would be wrong to give effect to the reports at the present time, and the group ofMinisters who had considered the problem had shared his view.The reason lay in the proposals formulated by the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England (the Redcliffe-MaudCommission), published the previous day, which envisaged a completeredrawing of the local authority map of England outside London.The rules for redistribution of seats under which the boundary commissions operated in England and Wales required the constituency pattern to be based on the pattern of local governmentunits, and a redrawing of the local authority map meant a redrawingof the constituency map. In Wales and Northern Ireland legislation to alter local government boundaries was also in prospect. Thepresent constituency boundaries had already been in existence for15 years: it seemed preferable to leave them for another four or five than to face another radical revision when the local government reorganisation had been carried out.In London, however, the process of local government reorganisation was already complete and there would be advantage from the point of view of all political parties in carrying through the constituency adjustments which the Boundary Commission proposedthere. In other parts of the country there were areas which were severely under-represented and areas which were over-represented.If the Boundary Commissions&apos; recommendations were not to be implemented wholly, the aim should be to make the minimum change;and since in his judgment over-representation was much less objectionable than under-representation, he would find no difficultyin defending proposals which dealt with the worst cases of under-representation and left constituencies with very small electorates asthey were; even the proposals of the Boundary Commission wouldnot prevent a very wide range in the size of the electorates. he therefore proposed that they should introduce legislation which, inaddition to relieving the Secretaries of State of their stautory obligation to lay before Parliament Orders in Council giving effect tothe reports of the Boundary Commissions, would provide that whereoutside London two adjacent constituencies each had an electorateof over 90,000, the area should be re-divided into three and thatsingle constituencies with an electorate above 100,000 or perhaps90,000; this was for consideration should be divided into two.
Inside Greater London effect should be given to the boundary commission^ recommendations, although some adjustments wouldbe needed in the case of constituencies straddling the Greater Londonboundary. The result of these changes, assuming the 90,000 criterion,would be to increase the House of Commons by only one; and interms of party advantage so far as could be judged on the basis ofthe 1964 figures his proposals would make little difference. he invited the Cabinet to agree that legislation should be introduced onthese lines with a view to it being passed before the summer recess,and that he should announce the Governmenfs intention to introduce such legislation in the House of Commons on 19th June.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the problem inScotland was substantially different from that in England. The reportof the Royal Commission on Local Government in Scotland (theWheatley Commission) was not expected before September, and no case for not giving effect to the report of the Boundary commission could be founded on any recommendation of the Royal Commission.Moreover, the connection between constituency boundaries and localauthority boundaries was very much less close in Scotland than inEngland; the only rule to which the Boundary Commission had towork was that no burgh other than a county or a city should beincluded partly in one constituency and partly in another. Therewere at present constituencies comprising the whole or parts of twoor even three counties and others comprising a number of burghsand it was unlikely that any recommendation of the RoyalCommission would necessitate extensive consequential changes in the pattern of constituencies. There were in Scotland both areas whichwere heavily over-represented and areas which were under-represented-three constituencies in Glasgow had a total electorate substantially less than Dumbarton and it would be extremely difficult for himto justify taking no action on the report of the Boundary Commission.He appreciated that to take a course different from that of theHome Secretary might create embarrassment and he had consideredpossible alternatives, but he remained of the opinion that they wouldnot be satisfactory and that the most acceptable course would be to implement the report of the Boundary Commission without modification. He could defend the difference between the action proposed in Scotland and in England and Wales by reference to thedifference between the English and Scottish rules for the redistribution of seats.In discussion there was general agreement with the approachsuggested by the Home Secretary for England and Wales and at thesame time a recognition of the difficulty of justifying a similar course for Scotland. Some members of the Cabinet thought that the differences in circumstances and in the rules under which the boundary Commissions worked were wide enough to justify giving
effect to the report of the Boundary Commission for Scotland whileadopting for England and Wales the course proposed by the HomeSecretary; but others considered that it would embarrass the HomeSecretary severely in the course he proposed for England and Walesif effect were given to the report of the Scottish Commission. It wassuggested that this difficulty might be resolved by carrying still further the logic underlying the Home Secretary&apos;s approach and postponinga decision on Scotland until the report of the Wheatley commission was available. This could be achieved by legislating to relieve theSecretary of State for Scotland of the obligation to act on the reportof the Boundary Commission and taking powers to deal with thesituation after the Royal Commission^ report had been received andits effect could be judged; no legal objection was seen to such acourse. Admittedly this would bring the Secretary of State under some pressure in the coming months both publicly and in private from members who were concerned about the delay in reorganisingconstituencies likely to be affected by the Boundary Commission^report, but this would be less embarrassing than following either ofthe other courses mentioned.In further discussion it was suggested that the House of Lordsmight seek to obstruct the proposed legislation and that the delay would encourage interested parties to seek an order for mandamus.But it would be politically difficult for the House of Lords to take astrong line on the composition of the House of Commons. Thelegal risk had to be accepted; mandamus was however a discretionaryremedy and the courts might be reluctant to intrude into so essentiallypolitical a dispute: if the Parliament Act were invoked they might accept that the matter was before Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals of the Home Secretary for legislation in relation to England and Wales and Northern Ireland, except forthe single question outstanding of whether the size of electoraterequired to justify splitting a single constituency should be 90,000 or100,000. This point should be remitted for decision to the group of Ministers who had studied the question: As regards Scotland thelegislation should relieve the Secretary of State of his presentobligation to implement the report of the Boundary Commission and provide for action to be taken in the light of the report of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in Scotland. The Home secretary should announce the Governments intentions in the House ofCommons on 19th June.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a group of ministers to decide whether the size of electorate required toSECRET10394 b
justify splitting a single English or Welsh constituency into two should be 90,000 or 100,000.(2) Subject to (1), approved the proposals in C (69) 63.(3) Agreed that in relation to Scotland the proposed legislation should relieve the Secretary of State of the obligation toact on the present report of the Boundary Commission and provide for the position to be reconsidered after the RoyalCommission on Local Government in Scotland had reported.(4) Authorised the Home Secretary to announce theGovernment^ intentions in the House of Commons on19th June.confidential. The Prime Minister said that he and the First Secretary ofState had continued their discussions with the General Council ofthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) on the previous evening. He had told them that there seemed to be three possible alternatives. First,the provisions in relation to unconstitutional disputes in &quot; programme for Action &quot; could be strengthened to the point where the Governmentcould be satisfied that they would be reasonably effective. Secondly,they could examine the possibility of supplementing or backing theprovisions in &quot; Programme for Action&quot;, as they related tounconstitutional strikes, by legislative provisions of one kind or another which did not involve the imposition of fines on unions orwork people. Thirdly, if a solution could not be found in either ofthese directions, the Government would probably see no alternative to immediate legislation which included the so-called &quot; penal clauses&quot;,but held them in suspense in that the First Secretary of State wouldnot be empowered to invoke them for a stated period of months afterRoyal Assent. It had been agreed that the possible solutions shouldbe considered in detail by a smaller group consisting of the first secretary of State and himself and of six members of the general council Sir Frederick Hayday, and Messrs. Feather, Allen, Greene,Jack Jones and Scanlon. This smaller group had examined possible means of strengthening TUC Rule 11 so that the obligation on individual unions to secure a resumption of work by their members would be as binding in the case of unconstitutional strikes, as it was,in Rule 12, in the case of inter-union disputes. He and the first secretary of State had suggested an amendment to this end. Theiramendment, which was drafted in the language of &quot; Programme for action &quot; would in essence include in Rule 11a clause corresponding to rule 12 id), which imposed an unambiguous obligation on unions concerned to take immediate and energetic steps to obtain a
confidential. The President of the Board of Trade said that evidence had recently come to light that there had for some years been a persistentunder-recording of exports. Customs and the Board of Trade had carried out a thorough investigation and it now appeared that the under-recording was of the order of 2 to 3- per cent net. It had beenagreed that Customs should reintroduce a more comprehensive system of checking ships&apos; manifests, but this would not be fully effective for some months. In the meantime the published tradefigures would not be adjusted but a conservative estimate of the under-recording would be given in the Press notice which accompaniedthem.   The discovery of this under-recording would eventually beresumption of work. The TUC representatives, on the other hand,had suggested circulating a letter to their affiliated organisationsclarifying the manner in which the General Council intended toproceed in future under Rule 11 in the case of unconstitutional strikes.The terms of this letter were not sufficiently precise and unambiguousabout the obligation to secure a resumption of work. He and theFirst Secretary of State proposed that evening to give the TUC a firm assurance that the Government would not proceed with the&quot; penal clauses&quot; if Rule 11 were amended on the lines which theyhad proposed. A revised draft of the Governments proposed amendment was being sent to the TUC that day. If the TUC general council refused this offer, he would report back to the Cabinet earlyin the following week so that they could decide their course of action.But in the event of such a refusal it would presumably be necessaryeither to introduce a Bill, incorporating the &quot; penal clauses &quot; but insuch a way that they could not be invoked for a stated period afterRoyal Assent, or to introduce alternative legislative provisions which did not involve the imposition of fines.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Special TUC congress on 5th June had not the power to make amendments to the rules:this could only be done at the Congress in September. If theGovernments proposed further amendment to Rule 11 were acceptedby the General Council, it could only be on the basis that the latter would recommend its adoption to the Congress in September. Therewas general agreement that if the General Council were prepared tomake a recommendation in this sense, this would be sufficient toenable the Government to drop the &quot; penal clauses &quot;.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.
reflected in equal and opposite adjustments to the export figures andthe balancing item. There would be no change in our basic positionor in the reserves.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th June, 1969.
