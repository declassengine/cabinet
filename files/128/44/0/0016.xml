CC 16 (69)secret. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.2. The Minister for Planning and Land said that there had recently been strong criticism of the Land Commission Act, 1967,chiefly on the ground that it bore unduly harshly on small transactions.He had reviewed the operation of the Act in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Scotland;and he proposed that certain modifications in the betterment levyshould now be made. These were set out in a draft White Paper(circulated at the meeting) which it was proposed to publish on 15thApril, following a brief reference to it in the Chancellor of theExchequer^ Budget Speech. The proposed changes would, in his view, meet the criticism which had been expressed, while leavingunaffected the main principle of the levy that a substantial part ofthe development value created by the community should be returnedto the community. Of the five modifications proposed two would have some retrospective effect. He was satisfied that for administrative and other reasons it would not be possible to make the other changesretrospective.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper on modifications in the betterment levy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th April, 1969.
