Police BillMutual aid and the special powers Act(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (C (69) 156) and the Secretary ofState for Defence (C (69) 157) on the provisions for mutual aid inthe Police Bill and their relationship to the Special Powers Act.The Home Secretary said that the purpose of the mutual aidprovisions in the Police Bill was to provide for short-term assistancein normal times by police forces in Great Britain to the royal ulster Constabulary (RUC) on special occasions, such as RoyalVisits, processions, or sporting events. It was not the intention toprovide assistance for the RUC in dealing with disorders suchas had been experienced in August; under such conditions,reinforcements from Great Britain police forces would be of limitedusefulness and might indeed be singled out for special attacks. Insuch circumstances, Chief Constables in Great Britain wouldprobably be unwilling to send their men to Northern Ireland. the mutual aid provisions in the Bill had instead been seen primarilyas a means of bringing the RUC and British police forces closer together, in accordance with the objectives of the Report of theAdvisory Committee on Police in Northern Ireland (the HuntReport). During the Second Reading of the Bill, a number ofspeakers had expressed concern about the prospect of police from great Britain having to operate the Special Powers Act. Theseanxieties were known to be shared by the Police Federation. Hehad made it clear that it was not his intention that any policemanfrom Great Britain serving in Northern Ireland under the mutual aid provisions should operate the Act. The Northern ireland government accepted this. What he now wished to do was tounderline the assurances he had given by adding a provision to theBill which would make it impossible for the Northern ireland government to confer on policemen from Great Britain any powers,or require from them any duties, under the 1922 Northern IrelandSpecial Powers Act. He recognised that this might result in theSecretary of State for Defence being pressed to amend in a similarsense the Bill setting up the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR); andhe accepted that it would be essential to resist such pressure. Buthe thought that the arguments which had been advanced against his proposed addition to the Bill were based on a misunderstanding of the purpose which mutual aid between police forces was designedto serve. He agreed with the Defence Secretary that the BritishGovernment should press the Northern Ireland Government toreplace the Special Powers Act by some more acceptable form oflegislation. The Northern Ireland Government had in fact been on the point of repealing most of the regulations earlier this year;10681a 2
but since the outbreak of sabotage this spring, and the disturbanceswhich had taken place from August onwards, they had been takingthe line that they could not dispense with the powers under presentconditions.The Defence Secretary said that he felt bound to resist theHome Secretary&apos;s proposal. He took the point which had notbeen made fully clear in the Second Reading Debate that it wasnot the intention to invoke the mutual aid provisions in situationssimilar to that of last August. Nevertheless, if policemen from great Britain were not able to operate under the Special powers act, their usefulness would be much reduced; and the result mightbe that earlier resort would have to be made to calling in troops.There would also be pressure on him in the House to place similarrestrictions on the regular Army and on the UDR. It was impossibleto draw a clear-cut distinction between times of disorder and normalconditions; in the circumstances now prevailing in Northern Ireland,even the most peaceful demonstration might degenerate intoviolence. Moreover, Northern Ireland was at present going through a twilight period when active disorders had ceased but the situation had not returned to normal. Under such conditions, the differencebetween the role of the Army and that of the police was very small;the two forces had been co-operating very closely in the recent driveagainst arms running, which could not have been effective withoutthe use of powers deriving from the Special Powers Act. Our main objective should be to secure the repeal by the Northern ireland government of the Special Powers Act and its replacement bysomething more acceptable. If this could be done by the time conditions were established in which the mutual aid provisions ofthe Bill could safely be invoked, the need for the proposed amendment would disappear. In his judgment, therefore, it wouldbe a mistake to amend the Bill as the Home Secretary proposed; todo so would make it easier for the Northern Ireland Government to delay action to repeal the Special Powers Act. The better coursewould be to confine ourselves to assurances in the House on the linesof those already given by the Home. Secretary; and to increase the pressure on the Northern Ireland Government to replace the special powers Act. He did not accept the argument that the Governmentcould not move in this direction until normal conditions returned;his view was that all the powers that were really necessary in presentconditions could be made available under forms of legislation more acceptable to opinion in this country.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Government were already committed to the view that the Special Powers Act must go,though no deadline had been fixed. The aim of the police reformsadvocated in the Hunt Report was to put the RUC on a similar basis
to British forces; but an amendment on the lines proposed by theHome Secretary under which police from Great Britain would be exempted from operating the Special Powers Act, while the RUCwould still be subject to it would only highlight the differencebetween them. And it would be very difficult to explain why, if thepowers were such that policemen from Great Britain should not beasked to apply them, the Army and the UDR should be operating under them. Considerable support was expressed for the view thatit would be better to intensify the pressure on the Northern ireland government to replace the Special Powers Act by more satisfactorylegislation; and, in the meantime, to confine action in the House ofCommons to confirming, if necessary, the assurances already given and emphasising the British Government^, desire to see the special powers Act repealed. At the same time, it was recognised thatthis course carried with it some risk of adverse reactions inParliament and from police organisations in Great Britain. If itwere the case that adequate powers could be made available underordinary emergency powers legislation, there was no need to await the return of normal conditions and the withdrawal of the Armyfrom its security role. It would still be possible, if need be, to amend the Bill in the House of Lords; but it would be unwise tactically tomake any reference to this during the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Commons. So far as an approach to the F^orthern ireland government was concerned, their reliance on a British militarypresence was a strong card in our hand; but it would have to beborne in mind that overt threats of withdrawal might only hardentheir attitude and estrange Protestant opinion. To approach theNorthern Ireland Prime Minister with a straightforward request to repeal the Special Powers Act might be counter-productive. Abetter line might be to ask him for his ideas on legislation toreplace it.The course outlined above would have the incidental advantageof rescuing the Government from the embarrassing position in whichthe Special Powers Act placed them in relation to the EuropeanConvention on Human Rights. There were at present proceedings before the Commission on Human Rights in which it was alleged that the Act was incompatible with the Convention, which we had signed, though we had made a reservation on this point.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthere appeared to be general agreement that it would be better notto amend the Bill as proposed by the Home Secretary. In the debate in the House of Commons later that day, the Home secretary should confirm as necessary the assurances he had already given that police from Great Britain would not operate the Special Powers
Act; and make it clear that the Government would continue to press the Northern Ireland Government to repeal the Act and replace it bymore satisfactory legislation as soon as possible. On this, theHome Secretary should approach the Northern Ireland Government,drawing on the points made in discussion and also emphasising, ifthe occasion arose, the embarrassments caused to the BritishGovernment in the international sphere by the continued existence ofthe Northern Ireland Special Powers Act.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to be guided by it during theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons and in had discussions with the Northern Ireland Government.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (69) 155) on public expenditure, to which was attached a draft White Paper on public expenditure for 1968-69 to1973-74.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the previous day the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP)had considered a number of presentational problems arising onthe draft White Paper. There had been general agreement thatthe White Paper should show the development and pattern ofpublic expenditure in the last decade; and he had been asked toconsider the possibility of showing the rate of increase in public expenditure in each of the 10 years in question. The figuresshowed that between 1960-61 and 1964-65 the gross domestic product (GDP) had grown faster than public expenditure in every year save one; and that in the period from 1965-66 this position hadbeen reversed. He had also been asked to consider the possibilityof excluding transfer payments from the figures of public expenditurein order to show the demand made by the public sector on thecountry&apos;s resources; but having examined the figures, he did not recommend this.The White Paper would include figures for public expenditureon each main programme in 1972-73 and 1973-74. He proposedthat paragraph 32 of the draft White Paper should be amended tomake it clear that the Government had not yet taken decisions onthe levels for individual programmes in 1972-73 and 1973-74, butthat they were planning on the basis that the total of public expenditure would grow broadly in line with the forecast of thePublicExpenditureDraft white paper
growth of the economy as a whole. The Green Paper on The TaskAhead, published in February 1969, had indicated a likely growth ofGDP of between 3 and 4 per cent a year. He proposed, therefore,that the projections shown in the White Paper for 1972-73 and1973-74 should be based on a rate of growth of total public expenditure of 2\ per cent a year. To use a higher figure would be politically and economically damaging; and its implications for future tax levels and the balance of payments would be immediatelyapparent. Provision would be made within the projections of totalexpenditure for a contingency reserve of the order of  350 million for 1972-73 and  450 million to  500 million for 1973-74.Experience indicated that these figures would be barely adequate tomeet possible calls on the contingency reserve, for example for the uprating of social security benefits. As no decisions had yet beentaken for 1972-74, Ministers would not be committed by the figures shown for individual programmes. For the purpose of next year&apos;sreview by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESO, he proposed that the figures in the 1969 PESC survey and in the white paper should have equal status as the starting point for consideringindividual programmes.Following the discussion in SEP he had considered whetherit was necessary to include figures for interest on debt in the white paper. The rise in debt interest since 1964-65 was primarily dueto an increase in the level of public borrowing rather than to higherinterest rates. The projection in the White Paper for future yearsassumed no rise in interest rates and debt interest was shown asabout level. As a consequence the total of public expenditure,including debt interest, was shown as increasing by 3i per cent ayear in 1972-73 and 1973-74; if debt interest were excluded theincrease would be 4 per cent in 1972-73 and 3-9 per cent in 1973-74.In discussion it was generally agreed that on balance it wouldbe preferable not to include figures for public expenditure before1964-65. It was also generally agreed that the annual rate of growth of total public expenditure projected in the White Paper for 1972-74should be 3J per cent. It was, however, suggested that, bearing that mind the low rate of growth projected for expenditure on education and health in particular, the wording of paragraph 32 was too restrictive even in the amended version proposed by theChancellor in his opening statement. It should be stressed, bothin this paragraph and in a note incorporated in table 1.6 of theWhite Paper, that it would be for the Government of the day to takethe final decisions on expenditure for 1972-74 in the next Parliament.It should be borne in mind that it might by then be possible toreduce the heavy expenditure incurred in recent years on assistance
to industry, much of which was part of a &quot; once for all&quot; operation to improve industrial efficiency; and this might make it possible toincrease expenditure on other programmes without altering the ratioon public expenditure to GDP.In further discussion it was strongly argued that, leaving aside the special situation arising from the devaluation of the poundsterling, it was both desirable and inevitable that public expenditure should grow more quickly than GDP. The ratio of public expenditure to GDP was too low; and the social and economic pressures of atechnologically advanced society were bound to push it higher.On the other hand, it was argued that unless public opinion was clearly instructed on the relationship between social expenditure and taxation, a sharp increase in the ratio of public expenditure toGDP would be seen to carry clear implications for the level oftaxation.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the White Paper should not include figures for public expenditure before 1964-65. Interest ondebt should be included; but the White Paper should include a noteexplaining the basis on which the figures were calculated. The rateof growth projected for total public expenditure in 1972-73 and1973-74 should be 5\ per cent a year; but paragraph 32 of the draft white Paper should be revised to make it clear that the final decisions on expenditure for those years would be taken in the nextParliament by the Government of the day, and a note to this effect should be incorporated in table 1.6. For the purposes of next year&apos;sPESC review, the figures in the 1969 PESC survey and in the white paper should have equal status as the starting point for consideringindividual programmes.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate forconsideration at their next meeting revised drafts ofparagraph 32 and table 1.6 of the White Paper togetherwith a note on debt interest, as indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.(3) Agreed that for the purposes of next year&apos;s PESC review the figures in the 1969 PESC survey and in the white paper should have equal status as the starting point for considering individual programmes.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was unableto accept that the defence budgets should be shown in the white paper as  2,070 million in each of the years 1972-73 and 1973-74.
CC56(69)These figures could not in any sense be regarded as a projectionof existing policy.  The present estimates for these two years were 2,134 million and  2,177 million, including contingency allowances of  30 million and  50 million respectively.   Very reluctantly, hewas prepared to accept a reduction to  2,070 million in 1972-73;but he could not accept a reduction from  2,177 million to 2,070 million in 1973-74.    When account was taken of the 25 million to be found for the military salary, he was being askedto reduce the defence budget by  132 million in 1973-74.  Such areduction could not be achieved without a further Defence Review,which would have to start early in 1970. Domestic and internationalconsiderations made such a review wholly unacceptable. By 1972-73,the United Kingdom defence programme ( 2,070 million) would amount to 5 per cent of estimated gross national product (GNP).The United States, France, Portugal and Turkey were all forecastingexpenditure at that time of a larger proportion of GNP. Moreover,our other allies would be increasing defence expenditure in real terms at 4 per cent a year over the next few years.  The causeof this increase in expenditure was partly that the unit cost ofdefence equipment here and abroad was rising faster than pricesgenerally, so that an increasing level of real expenditure was requiredin order to maintain a given level of defence capability.  He couldjiot accept that United Kingdom expenditure on defence should remain on a plateau after the withdrawal from East of Suez had beencompleted, since this would imply a reduction in our future defencecapability.   The estimated expenditure on defence equipment in1972-73 was exceptionally low; and this accounted for the fairlysubstantial planned increase in expenditure in 1973-74.  But in any event some increase in defence expenditure for 1973-74 would, inhis view, be necessary if an early Defence Review were to be avoided.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that they were nowdiscussing figures for years in respect of which no decisions hadbeen taken; the level of expenditure shown for any particularprogramme did not therefore commit the spending department concerned, but it nevertheless had some political significance.From the latter point of view and even if it were possible to fitsome increase in defence expenditure into the total programme for1973-74 it would be wholly undesirable to show defence expenditure increasing again after the full effects on public expenditure of the withdrawal from East of Suez had spentthemselves in 1972-73. Apart from the contingency reserve in thedefence budget, the difference between the present estimates for thetwo years was only  23 million, which was well within the likely
margin of error so far ahead. At 5 per cent of GNP, our defence expenditure in 1972-73 would be a higher proportion than that ofmany of our allies, including, for example, the Federal german republic, Canada and Belgium. There was some dispute about the precise level of French expenditure on defence, but that expenditurehad recently been reported to the French National Assembly asamounting to 3 - 4 per cent of GNP. If other needs were to be met in the 1970s, ways would have to be found of at the very least keeping the level of defence expenditure constant in real terms.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet recognised the importance of the considerations which the Defence Secretary had advanced relating to our futuredefence capability and the need to avoid a further defence review. However, the figures which would be shown in theWhite Paper for 1972-73 and 1973-74 were no more than forwardprojections from the figures which had been decided for 1971-72 and earlier years; and the Cabinet had already agreed that this must beheavily emphasised, in relation to all the programmes, in the textand the relevant tables of the White Paper. On balance theCabinet agreed that defence expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-74should be shown as  2,070 million; and that the Chancellor of theExchequer should agree with the Defence Secretary a formula foruse in the White Paper describing the status of this figure.The Cabinet-(4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(5) Agreed that defence expenditure should be shown as 2,070 million in 1972-73 and 1973-74 in the forthcomingWhite Paper on Public Expenditure.overseas aid(previous reference:CC (69) 49thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Prime Minister said that at their meeting on24th November, the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy had provisionally agreed that the Minister of overseas development should make a statement about the future level of overseas aid in advance of the White Paper on Public Expenditure,which it was proposed to publish on 2nd December. The minister might explain that it was impossible, owing to the difficulty ofmaking any reliable estimate of the future level of private aid flowsand export credits, to predict when the United Kingdom wouldattain the target set at the United Nations Conference on Tradeand Development (UNCTAD) of one per cent of the Gross National
Product (GNP) for total aid. But taking optimistic estimates aboutprivate flows, the UNCTAD target could be reached not much afterthe target date of 1975 set by the International Commission under mr. Lester Pearson&apos;s chairmanship. The Minister of overseas development might also state that it was, in any event, the government&apos;s intention, provided that our balance of payments position permitted, to achieve the UNCTAD target by the end of theSecond Development Decade. She should not however make any reference to the target of 0-7 per cent for official aid. There hadbeen a division of opinion in the Committee about the level of aidexpenditure which should be shown for 1972-73 and 1973-74 in theforthcoming White Paper on Public Expenditure; but it had been thegeneral view that whatever total was finally agreed for the two yearscombined, it would be better to show a larger figure for 1973-74than for 1972-73, so as to indicate a prospective acceleration. TheCabinet were now invited to confirm the decisions provisionallytaken by the Committee about the line to be taken by the Ministerof Overseas Development in her proposed public statement; and todecide on the level of expenditure on aid in 1972-73 and 1973-74 tobe shown in the White Paper on Public Expenditure.The Cabinet, after discussion (1) Approved the line to be taken in the proposed public statement by the Minister of Overseas Development, as agreed in the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy.(2) Agreed that the level of total overseas aid expenditure(including special aid to Malaysia and Singapore) to be shown in the White Paper on Public Expenditure for1972-73 and 1973-74 should be  270 million and 305 million, in cash terms, respectively.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th November, 1969.
