The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary reported thathe had that afternoon made a statement in the House of Commonsregarding the future of Greece in the Council of Europe. TheCouncil&apos;s Committee of Ministers had agreed that a decision on theposition of the Greek Government would be taken either at their next regular meeting, which would take place at the latest inDecember, or, if the report of the Councils Human RightsCommission was available earlier, at a special meeting. some progress had therefore been made, since it had now been accepted that, by December at the latest, either the Greek Government wouldhave been able to convince the Commission that it was making progress towards the re-establishment of democracy in Greece, orthe Committee would have to agree that Greece should be suspendedfrom membership of the Council of Europe or expelled from it. Hewould circulate a brief note of the position for the information ofhis colleagues.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth SecretarySstatement.(2) Invited him to circulate a brief note on the lines he had indicated.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary informed hiscolleagues of the latest situation in regard to Mr. Gerald Brooke.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatMr. Brooke had been visited by H.M. Consul on 5th May. the consul had previously been informed by the Soviet authorities that further proceedings against Mr. Brooke for alleged acts ofespionage had been instituted. The decision to institute proceedingsdid not, however, indicate that the Soviet authorities had finally determined that Mr. Brooke should be brought to a fresh trial.Under Soviet law, the laying of a charge against an accused personwas followed by a period of investigation, which might continue for two to nine months, and only at the end of this period was itdecided whether or not to bring the accused to trial. It was thusstill possible for the Soviet authorities to abandon the proceedingswithout loss of face. It was however most important for thispurpose that we should not confirm publicly that the soviet authorities had decided to institute proceedings. Mrs. Brooke,who had shown herself to be very discreet, had been told in* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET&quot; a 2
confidence. In public, however, it would be essential not to go beyond the terms of his statement in the House of Commons, inwhich he had informed the House of the ConsuPs visit toMr. Brooke but had said no more on the point of possible action by the British Government than that any Soviet decision to submitMr. Brooke to a further trial would have grave consequences for Anglo-Soviet relations.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Mr^ Brookehad appeared to be in fair condition when seen by our Consul; but his health was not good, and the prospect of a further long prisonsentence must be viewed with some anxiety. It had been made clear to the Soviet Ambassador in London that any retrial ofMr. Brooke would ensure that there would be no possibility of theKrogers being released before 1974 at the earliest, but that if itwere agreed that Mr. Brooke would be released at the end of his present sentence we would then be prepared to discuss the matterof the Krogers further.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he hadbeen considering whether there were any further retaliatory measures,in addition to the expulsion of known Soviet intelligence agents inthe Soviet Embassy in London to which he had referred in his lastreport to his colleagues, which we might take if, despite ourwarnings, Mr. Brooke was subjected to a fresh trial. It was difficultto devise any such measures which would be both effective and moreinjurious to Soviet interests than to our own; and he had not yet reached firm conclusions.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement.NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)SECRET*2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (69) 45) which outlined the recent history behindpolitical events in Northern Ireland, appraised the current politicalsituation, considered the implications of the use of troops and discussed what should be the broad objectives of the United kingdom governments policy.The Home Secretary said that it was important to remember that the Northern Ireland Government were not in power againstthe wishes of the majority of the Northern Ireland population. they represented more than half of the electorate, some of whom indeedthought that the Government were not being active enough in defence of their interests; and if the United Kingdom Government* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
CC21(69)introduced direct rule, the majority of the Northern Irelandpopulation would oppose it. This was being increasingly realisedby those members of the Labour Party who wanted the UnitedKingdom Government to intervene directly. Good progress hadbeen made in Northern Ireland since the Prime Minister and hehad seen Captain 0&apos;Neill, then Prime Minister of Northern Ireland,in November, 1968. Four of the five points which they had madeto Captain 0&apos;Neill had been adopted by the Northern ireland government, and although they had not yet all been implementedsteps were being taken to that end; and the fifth had been adoptedin principle. The influence of the United Kingdom Governmenthad been beneficial, and the presence of television cameras andreporters in Northern Ireland had made a substantial impact there.He had had a telephone discussion with the new Prime Minister ofNorthern Ireland, Major Chicbester-Clark, who accepted theunderstanding that troops could be used only after a request from government to Government, understood that the use of troops would in certain circumstances have constitutional implications and agreed that there would be no going back on &quot; one man, one vote &quot;.The Home Secretary had arranged that Major Chichester-Clarkand some of his Ministers should meet the Prime Minister and himself in London on 21st May.The Home Secretary said that since he had spoken to MajorChichester-Clark, the amnesty for those convicted in connectionwith the demonstrations had been announced. This would benefit the supporters both of the Reverend Ian Paisley and of the civilrights movement and had apparently been fairly well received inNorthern Ireland. On balance he thought that Major Chichester-Clark had been right to declare the amnesty.The civil rights movement still contained people of high idealsbut it had been infiltrated by less desirable elements, includingTrotskyists and Communists. The Irish Republican Army had alsobeen infiltrated by Communists in recent years.The Home Secretary proposed to mention to Major Chichester-Clark the possibility of a round-table conference being held. Hewould not put this forward as a positive proposal at this stage,although he himself was in favour of such a conference.He had just received a telephone request from the NorthernIreland Government for the use of troops to guard the BelfastHarbour Estate which included parts of Messrs. Harland and Wolffsshipyard and various public utilities. He had arranged for theNorthern Ireland Government to be informed that he did not understand why troops were needed for this purpose, at a time
when the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) should be under lessstrain; it was not clear why the &quot; B &quot; Specials could not be used forthis task; and he was doubtful of the wisdom of meeting the request.He had asked the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland,for his views and for an appreciation of the situation.In discussion it was suggested that it would be helpful to theCabinet to have an Objective analysis of the political situation andof the basic social factors in Northern Ireland of the kind that ourAmbassadors abroad regularly provided. The Government lackedthe inforfhatidri dri which to judge the complaints of political andeconomic discrimination; and they had no expert knowledgeavailable dri the internal problems which would arise from directrule arid no adequate means of assessing the tasks involved. TheHoihe Office kept closely in touch with Northern Ireland affairs,howeverf arid had access to the kirid of sources on which ourAmbassadors relied for their reports. The Home Office was inparticularly cidse tbuch with the Northern Ireland Civil Service andthe RUG had recently been strengthened by the secondment ofBritish security personnel. It might be possible for the Home Officeto produce ah appreciation, or a series of situation reports, on thelines suggested frdfri information which it already received, althoughmore staff would be required: There would still be a lack of independent and up-to-date reports on the political situation,prepared on the spot, but the Northern Ireland Government wouldresent political representatives of the United Kingdom government being sent there. It would be helpful if the Home Secretary would consider this general problem further and inform the Cabinet ofhis views. It would also be helpful if the Home Secretary would circulate to the Cabinet a brief paper on the question whether theStormont Parliament was fairly elected and on complaints ofgerrymandering of constituency boundaries. Although there werenurrierous cornplairtts on the local government franchise in NorthernIreland, there appeared to be&apos; rio serious suggestion that the parliament was not genuinely representative. There was anindependent Boufidafy Cdrhfhissidn in Northern Ireland operating under the same rules as the boundary commissions for the UnitedKingdom Parliament;Iti discussion of the plannirig hypotheses set out in paragraph23 df G (69) 45, it was suggested that the difficulties of direct rule,which would probably have to be imposed against the wishes of themajority of the population, would be very great. Reforms imposed by the United Kingdom Government would be bitterly resented by both Catholics and Protestants. The^Uriited Kiftgddrh Governmentcould not allow complete anarchy&apos; in Northern Ireland. But iftroops had to be used ori a large scale to preserve law and order,there would be a choice between direct rule arid Using troops in
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Home Secretary&apos;s provisional decision withregard to the use. of troops to guard the Belfast Harbour Estatealthough it would be open to the Home Secretary to bring the issue&apos;before Ministers again if he wished. The Home Secretary should consider the provision of a political and social analysis of theNorthern Ireland situation, on the lines indicated in discussion, andshould, circulate a paper setting out his views oh how this mightbe done. . He should also circulate a paper on the extent to whichthe Stormont Parliament could be regarded&quot; as genuinelyrepresentative of /the eleotorate.;     &quot;   .    ; &apos; It had been suggested in some quartersthat the United Kingdom Government should wash its hands ofNorthern Ireland &quot;affairs, but it ^a^eleat^lhat^tte-woMd^not^e^defensible policy.OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS act the Cabinet, generally endorsed, li^appropriate^aoi^se^o^k^afa^fi^s-,27-32 of.

The Prime Minister said that he and the First secretary would be seeing representatives of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) on 12th May. The purpose of the meeting would be to find out whether the TUC had any alternative proposals to make fordealing with unofficial strikes winch would be as effective as theGovernment^ proposal for a conciliation pause. It seemed unlikelythat the TUC would have any practical suggestions to put forwardbut it was important that they should be given every encouragement and opportunity to do so. There were indications that oppositionwithin the Parliamentary Labour Party to the use of statutory powers would be reduced if it became clear that the TUC had no practicalproposals for dealing with unofficial strikes in other ways.
CC21(69)In discussion the point was made that many trade union leaders were anxious to make a constructive contribution towardsthe solution of the problem of unofficial strikes and that it wouldbe unwise to press for an immediate answer to the Governmenfsrequest for alternative proposals. On the other hand it was argued that the TUC showed no sense of urgency in dealing with theproblem and there was no evidence that they would, if given more time, be able to propose any practical and effective alternative tothe conciliation pause.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would be able to have a full discussion on the proposed legislation on industrial relations, taking account of the outcome of the discussion with the TUC on 12th May, at their meeting inthe following week.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th May, 1969.
