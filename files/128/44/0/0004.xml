CC4(69)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatpolitically the situation in Vietnam remained very much as it was.The procedural arguments at the Paris conference continued. Themilitary situation was quiet, though there was some evidence thatthe Viet Cong were preparing a military offensive.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the Russianproposals for an Arab/Israel settlement appeared to be something more than a mere propagandist move. The essence of the RussianNote was that it translated the United Nations Resolution of22nd November into a sequence of steps towards a detente ending on completion with an unequivocal guarantee of Israeli security, andit was possible that this might result in something acceptable to us.Any discussions arising from the Soviet proposals would have to be conducted through Dr. Jarring, the Special Representative of theUnited Nations Secretary-General. The Soviets accepted the Arabposition on this, whereas the Israelis themselves were still standingout for direct discussions. We should have to see what we and thenew United States Administration could make of the Russian ideas,which at first sight seemed quite promising.In discussion it was generally agreed that the Soviet proposals were encouraging. Attention was drawn to the French Governmentsrecent statement that they could not remain indifferent to a threatagainst Lebanon. It was pointed out, however, that it was unlikelythat the Israelis would in fact take aggressive action against thatcountry, though if they were provoked they would of course retaliate.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.secret. The Cabinet had before them Notes by the Secretary of theCabinet covering the final communique of the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers (C (69) 9) and the main speeches onbehalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Government made at the Meeting (C (69) 10).The Prime Minister said that the&apos;Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, which had concluded on the previous day, had been much more successful than had been expected. The generalatmosphere had been relaxed and friendly and there had been muchgoodwill. Although many of those present had been seekingunrealistic solutions of the Rhodesian problem, the discussion of this
item had been conducted without heat or acrimony, a fact whichwas due in large part to the tour which the Minister without Portfoliohad made to Commonwealth countries in Africa towards the end ofthe previous year and to the consultations with the Presidents ofZambia, Tanzania and Uganda which the Government had conductedbefore the Conference began. There had been good discussions ofthe world political situation and also of the world economic situation.In the latter, the Meeting had shown a greater sense of realism than hitherto in concentrating on relatively modest schemes of aid andbilateral arrangements rather than on demands for assistance ona scale beyond our means. It had proved possible to reach agreementfairly quickly on the communique issued at the end of the Conference.The Commonwealth leaders had left the United Kingdom moreemotionally attached to the Commonwealth than they had beenwhen they arrived. Many of them had become disenchanted withother groupings such as the Organisation for African Unity or eventhe United Nations and therefore saw greater value in the opportunity which membership of the Commonwealth gave for exchanges ofview between 20 or more Heads of Government. There had been general agreement that another meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters should be held in the not too distant future, perhaps in1970.Among the Prime Ministers at the meeting, the most outstandinghad been Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore, who had shown a realistic appreciation of the new problems whichindependence had brought to former Colonies, problems whichcould no longer, as in earlier days, be blamed on the Imperialists.Mr. Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, had confined himselfmainly to posing questions; and it was perhaps surprising that hewas not yet ready to express definite views and conclusions on someof the major issues of the day, e.g., the importance which Canadaattached to remaining a member of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO). Mr. Gorton, the Prime Minister of Australia,had made a considerable impression on the Meeting and had madea number of succinct and useful interventions, particularly on rhodesia. Mr. Barrow, the Prime Minister of Barbados, had alsoplayed an effective role. In particular, he had taken theCommonwealth countries in Africa to task about the contrastbetween their own internal policies and their attitude over Rhodesia;and he had pointed out that implementation of the pledge of &quot; noindependence before majority rule &quot; (n.i.b.m.r.) would be no guarantee that a majority Government in Rhodesia might not be overthrownby force after independence. Although President Nyerere ofTanzania had been helpful, there was no sign of any change in hisbasic attitudes or in those of President Kaunda of Zambia.
9796RhodesiaThe First Secretary of State said that it was evident from thediscussion of Rhodesia at the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters that many Commonwealth leaders were strongly opposedto the British proposals made after the meetings on boardHMS Fearless in October 1968 between the Prime Minister andMr. Ian Smith, and that, if these were ever put into effect, the relatively reasonable attitude which the Commonwealth leaders had shown at the Meeting would change rapidly. The Cabinet should therefore have an early opportunity to consider what our policy should be henceforward. Should we, for example, be ready to contemplate a settlement on the basis of a 10-year period of directrule in Rhodesia, followed by a period of transition to majority rule,as had been suggested at the Meeting? Although direct rule was at present unacceptable to the regime in Rhodesia, they might haveno alternative if South Africa could be brought to endorse this solution on the basis that it was most likely to produce the stabilityon her northern borders which must be deemed to be one of hermajor objectives in the longer term.In discussion it was pointed out that there was no sign that theSouth African Government regarded direct rule as an acceptablesolution or were prepared to help us to press it on the regime.Everything possible had been done to enlist South African support in solving the Rhodesian problem; but the South african governments attitude remained that, while they would be preparedto press the regime to honour any agreement which they might reachwith us, they could go no further than this. Even though they mightrecognise that the future interests would be better served by having a stable African majority Government in Rhodesia than by a continuance of the present state of affairs, their freedom of action was limited by public opinion in South Africa, which was sympathetic to the white regime in Rhodesia. A careful watch was being keptfor any sign of a change of view on the-part of the South african government; but at present there was little to suggest that any majorshift in their attitude was likely.Commonwealth ImmigrationThe Home Secretary said that, in the course of the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers, he had made a series of approaches to representatives of the Commonwealth countries aboutimmigration, and particularly about the problems which would arise if there were to be a new influx into this country of Asians from east Africa. Meetings with those mainly concerned had proved possible, except for President Obote of Uganda, who had evadeddiscussions on the subject. Nevertheless, he had succeeded in making
it sufficiently clear to the countries mainly concerned that we couldnot accept an increase in total immigration from the Commonwealth.He had also informed Commonwealth representatives of our intention to withdraw the concession allowing fiances to enter theUnited Kingdom in order to marry and henceforward to permittheir entry only on compassionate grounds. It had been generally accepted that it was for each country to decide for itself how manyimmigrants it admitted. But Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya had maintained their view that Asians who had retained United Kingdomcitizenship were our responsibility. Other commonwealth representatives, however, did not accept their arguments without qualification; and the East African Governments were now somewhaton the defensive as a result. In particular, there were some indications that the withdrawal of work permits from non-citizensin Kenya might be slowed down in the interests of the Kenyaneconomy. The way was now clear, therefore, for us to consider what action to take if, despite the warnings which he had given, there wasa large additional influx of Asians from East Africa. Officials hadbeen instructed to examine the problem on the basis that there wasno particular sanctity in the figure of 8,500 vouchers a year currentlyavailable for issue under the Commonwealth immigration scheme.The matter would in due course be considered by the ministerial committee on Immigration and Community Relations.In discussion, there was general agreement that, in view of theimportant human and policy issues involved, it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to decide in due course what policy to adopt if anadditional influx of Asians from East Africa became likely. It was essential, however, that the relevant facts about the number of immigrants that might be involved should first be established andexamined by the appropriate official and Ministerial Committees.It had to be recognised that we should be in a weak position to criticise the Governments of countries in East Africa if they wereto expel Asians who had taken local citizenship unless we wereourselves prepared to receive Asians who were United kingdom citizens. On the other hand the very large number of immigrantswho might wish to come here posed a problem different in kind fromthat which we faced at present.NigeriaThe Prime Minister said that, although there was a convention that the internal affairs of member countries were not discussed at meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, it would hardly havebeen possible to allow the recent meeting to have taken place withoutany attempt to solve the problem of the civil war in Nigeria. Inview of the convention, the final communique had made no mention
of this question; but a number of attempts had been made to arrangemeetings between Federal Nigerian and &quot; Biafran &quot; representatives.The attitude of the Biafran representatives had been that they wereprepared to attend a meeting only if the Federal Government hadnew proposals to make. In informal discussions which had beenarranged outside the main Meeting, Chief Awolowo, the FederalNigerian representative, had expressed a willingness to meet Biafranrepresentatives in London without conditions, provided that themeeting was promoted on the initiative not of the federal government but of any appropriate third party. He had beenprepared to contemplate that, if the war could be brought to an end,there should be a general amnesty for the rebels, not excludingColonel Ojukwu, the Biafran leader. He had remained insistent,however, that the war could be ended only on the basis of &quot; oneNigeria &quot;; and it appeared that a further attempt to achieve this aimby military action might be made soon. No meeting between thetwo sides had in fact taken place; and it was doubtful whether therewould be one before their respective representatives left London.The possibility of influencing Colonel Ojukwu to allow increasedrelief supplies into Biafra had been discussed with Presidents Nyerereand Kaunda, as the Heads of Government of the two members ofthe Commonwealth who had recognised Biafra. But, although they agreed with our own attitude on this question, it was doubtfulwhether they had any substantive contact with, or influence on,Colonel Ojukwu.publicity in discussion, there was general agreement that the success ofthe recent Meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers had beeninadequately reflected by the Press and other information media.It was the more desirable, therefore, that the Prime Minister shouldmake a statement in the House of Commons soon after parliament reassembled in the following week, in order to put the outcome ofthe Meeting in a more correct and favourable perspective.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theHome Secretary.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the problem ofUnited Kingdom passport holders in East Africa who might wish to enter this country to be considered by the ministerial Committee on Immigration and community relations, in preparation for its further consideration bythe Cabinet at an early date.; secret: -
IndustrialAffairsCommissionon industrial relations(previous reference:CC (69) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary of Stateproposing revised terms of reference for the Commission on industrial Relations (C (69) 11).The First Secretary of State said that the terms of reference hadbeen amended in the light of discussion at the previous meeting ofthe Cabinet to emphasise the positive role of the Commission on industrial Relations (CIR).In discussion, it was pointed out that the inclusion of a remit topromote improvements would enable the CIR to take action where iteffectively could in pursuance of its objectives, but in co-operationwith the Department of Employment and Productivity and not byusurping the latters functions in this field. It was proposed that theterms of reference should follow the normal practice of requiring the Royal Commission to report to The Queen.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposed terms of reference, subject to deletionof the words after &quot; report &quot;.The Cabinet Approved the proposed terms of reference of theCommission on Industrial Relations, subject to theamendment recorded in the Prime Ministers summing up.DecimalCurrencyThe Change-over: draft white Paper(previous reference:CC (66) 62ndConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (69) 5), to which was attached a draft white paper about the change-over to a decimal currency.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to publishan explanatory White Paper at the same time as the second decimal currency Bill was introduced later this month. The proposals on compensation were the only issue which had not been collectivelyconsidered by Ministers. It had been made clear from the outset that the Government were not prepared to accept liability for^compensation as a general principle, but the Decimal CurrencyBoard had been given the responsibility for consideringrepresentations from firms and organisations for compensation in exceptional circumstances and making recommendations to him on them. After considering about a hundred cases, the Board had reached the conclusion that there was no middle way between apolicy of general compensation and of no compensation in any circumstances. They had accordingly asked to be relieved of their statutory function of dealing with claims for compensation.   He
CC 4 (69)proposed to provide accordingly in the Decimal Currency Bill andto make plain that there would be no compensation in any circumstances.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet approved the white paper, subject to avoiding the repetition of the conversion table inparagraph 24 and in Table A of the Appendix. The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should agree the date of publication with theLord President.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper attached to C (69) 5, subjectto the amendment recorded in the summing up by thePrime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th January, 1969.
