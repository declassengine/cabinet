CC 7 (69)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was suggested that time should be found in thenear future for a debate in the House of Commons on the White paper on National Superannuation and Social Insurance in order that thework of explaining the proposals to the public might begin withoutdelay. It might be possible to arrange a debate on this White paper in the week beginning 16th February by deferring the proposed debate on the Family Law Reform Bill (Lords). It was also important thatthe Government should not be thought to be reluctant to arrange a debate on the White Paper on Industrial Relations, &quot; In Place ofStrife &quot;, though there would be no objection if the debate expectedto take place in the House of Lords on 19th March preceded that inthe House of Commons.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to give further consideration, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to the timing ofdebates on the White Papers on National superannuation and Social Insurance and on Industrial Relations.secret. The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that discussions in Paris continued between the United Statesand South Vietnamese on the one hand and North Vietnam and therepresentatives of the National Liberation Front (NLF) on the other.There had so far been no major development, and the north vietnamese and the NLF appeared to be trying to take the measureof the new United States Administration.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the United States had now accepted the French proposal that there should be a four-Power meeting on the Middle eastern situation within the framework of the Security Council. In general,the United States views were in line with our own.The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that the situation in Iraq appeared to be quieter, though a numberof Iraqis were still under detention on political charges, and would indue course be brought to trial. The one American citizen who hadbeen arrested on such charges had recently been released. there appeared to be no truth in the rumours that General Takriti, a deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, had resigned.9902
The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs said that there had been rumours of a new peace move in the Nigerianconflict on the part of the French-speaking African countries who were currently holding a meeting in Kinshasa. There was a possibility thatemissaries from two of these countries which were favourable toBiafra might be dispatched to Colonel Ojukwu while a similar mission from two countries favourable to the Federal Government might goto General Gowon, in an attempt to bring the two together.Meanwhile, the Italian Parliament had passed a unanimousresolution, of which, under the Italian Constitution, the ItalianGovernment were bound to take account, calling on the ItalianGovernment to raise the Nigerian issue in the United Nations. SinceU Thant, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, had now saidpublicly in a Press conference what he had already said to us in private, namely that he regarded the Nigerian problem as an internalissue and thus inappropriate for discussion in the United Nations, and since he had moreover said that he would not be a party to raising thequestion of secession in the United Nations, it was difficult to see whatuseful purpose an Italian initiative would serve.In discussion reference was made to reports of anti-Semitism andpersecution of Jews in Poland. The Minister of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs undertook to enquire about this and inform his colleagues of any developments.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.The Home Secretary said that in recent weeks there had been anumber of admissions of refugees to the United Kingdom on politicaland compassionate grounds. In view of the current state of opinionon immigration these had been made as inconspicuously as possible,but he thought his colleagues should know of the position.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.The Prime Minister referred to discussions which Mr. GeorgeBrown had been having with European leaders. He emphasised thatMr. Brown had been speaking in a private capacity and that what hehad been saying in Europe did not in any way commit theGovernment, with whom he had had no previous consultation, or theParliamentary Labour Party. This had been made clear to the Press.Mr. Brown had been talking in terms of a major initiative, providingfor a federal European structure to deal with political and defence matters separate from but in parallel with the European economic community.   From the full reports which had been received of
agricultural policy(previous reference:CC (68) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4)Farm price review, 1969CONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the minister without Portfolio reporting consideration in the Agricultural PolicyCommittee of the Governments negotiating limits in the 1969 farm price Review (C (69) 16).The Minister without Portfolio said that the Agricultural PolicyCommittee had been unable to reach agreement. The agricultural ministers had argued that an award of  50 million was required thisyear in order to provide the means and the incentive for the expansion programme announced last November. Anything less than this wouldnot satisfy the expectations aroused among farmers by thatannouncement and in consequence the expansion programme as awhole, and the important import saving which would result from it,would not materialise. An award of  50 million would provide fullrecoupment of cost increases and an additional incentive of  12million. The Treasury, which proposed an award of  20 million, andthe Department of Economic Affairs, which proposed  24-5 million,had both argued that their proposals were consistent with the achievement of the objectives announced for 1972-73 and with thebasis on which those objectives had been agreed by ministers collectively. In their view, the programme announced in Novemberamounted to a rolling forward by two years of the original selective expansion programme announced in 1965 and called for no new or special incentives. The exceptional squeeze on public expenditure in1969-70 made it very difficult to offer an award on a substantially more generous basis than in 1968, when the farmers had been left9902A3Mr. Brown&apos;s talks in Germany it did not appear that his discussionsthere had been very productive. However, the Italians, who were themselves thinking on similar lines, though not in terms of a federaliststructure, had been more receptive. The Prime Minister consideredthat Mr. Brown&apos;s initiative had been a healthy and beneficial one,provided that it was clearly understood by all concerned that his activities did not in any way commit the Government or the LabourParty; and this appeared to be the case. Part of Mr. Brown&apos;sobjective appeared to have been to take soundings in connection withM. Jean monnet  Action Committee of which he was a member. Inconclusion the Prime Minister drew his colleagues&apos; attention to theexcellent and robust speech made recently in the Italian parliament by Signor Nenni, the Italian Foreign Minister, on European and north Atlantic Treaty Organisation matters.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.
with less than 50 per cent of their productivity gain. He had reachedthe conclusion that it was not possible to accept the proposal of theAgricultural Ministers that farmers should be left with 140 per cent of their productivity gain in the coming year: this would appear tobe the most generous basis of an award for the past 10 years.Nevertheless, he considered that, despite the public expenditureproblem, the award should be on a rather more generous basis thanin 1968, and he had therefore proposed an award of  26 million, whichwould leave the farmers with 60 per cent of their productivity gain in 1969-70.There was general agreement that the major part of the awardshould be allocated to beef, barley and wheat. The estimated increasein the production costs of fat cattle was 6s. 7^d. Against this, theAgricultural Departments were proposing an increase of 15s. at this review, while the Economic Departments had suggested that 7s. 6d.would be enough: and the Treasury would agree to provide an assurance that the guaranteed price for beef would not be reduced below the 1969 level between now and 1972-73 if the increase at this review did not exceed 7s. 6d. On wheat and barley, production costshad increased by 9s. 3d. and 8d. per cwt, and the agricultural departments were proposing an increase in the award of Is. 9d. for both. The Treasury had suggested increases of the order of Is. and9d. He had mentioned these details because the agricultural ministers had emphasised the importance, in order to achieve the required expansion, of a total recoupment of cost increases. Whileit was not possible in his view to provide total recoupment in respectof all commodities, it would be possible to provide completerecoupment for beef, wheat and barley the three most important commodities within his proposed total of  26 million, though this might require some reductions in the proposals for other commoditiesby the Agricultural Ministers. An award limited to  26 million would no doubt come as a considerable disappointment to farmers, but he considered that it was consistent with the policy statement by theMinister of Agriculture last November and could be presented as areasonable settlement in the light of the very considerable financial stringency under which the Government had to operate in the coming year; and that the basis of the settlement would be more generousthan in 1968. If his colleagues agreed on the total size of the award and that the emphasis should be as far as possible to recoup the cost increases on beef, wheat and barley, the Departments concerned would no doubt be able to reach agreement on the details of the government&apos;s negotiating limits.The Minister of Agriculture said that after collectiveconsideration by Ministers of all the issues involved, he had announced in November an agricultural expansion programme which,consistently with the Governmenfs general aim of switching resources
to improve the balance of payments, was aimed to save  160 million of imports by 1972-73. In his view, this was the most importantFarm Review for very many years and its outcome would decide whether or not we should get the increase in output and import saving for which we aimed. He had made it clear in his public statement that there would be a measure of flexibility in theprogramme which extended over a period of four years. But thiswould be the most important Review in that period; if the objectiveson cereals and beef were to be achieved by 1972-73, incentives and resources must be provided now: there were long time lags betweendecisions to expand agricultural production and their fulfilment.Moreover, the farmers were reserving judgment about the expansion programme and whether therefore they should plan to fulfil it until they saw the outcome of the current Review. The 350,000farmers in the country, of whom 93 per cent farmed between 5 and300 acres, would not accept the risk of expanding production without an assurance of reasonable prospects.The index of output last year had fallen five points as a result ofa bad harvest and the aftermath of the epidemic of foot-and-mouth disease. Productivity had been lower and net farm income was estimated to have fallen by  39 million. As C (69) 16 rightly pointedout, net farm income was not comparable with ordinary wages and salaries. He had reached the conclusion that an award of  50 million was required to achieve the 1972-73 objectives after the most thorough examination of the situation and with the help of expert economicand technical advice. Only  28 million of this  50 million would fallon the Exchequer in 1969-70 and this would bring the estimated costof agricultural support in that year within the original public expenditure Survey estimate. The expenditure on agricultural support in the current year was now estimated to be some  35 millionbelow the original estimate and such a short-fall had been a commonfeature of recent years.The Agricultural Ministers had accepted the maximum possiblecut in the support for eggs. As regards milk production, they wereaiming to keep the position stable. There had been a cost/pricesqueeze on cereals for several years past and income from cerealproduction in real terms had declined substantially. The achievement of the 1972-73 target for cereals would save approximately  70 million of imports a year. The average earnings of beef farmers, afterproviding interest on capital, were  21 a week, less than the averageindustrial wage.Mere recoupment of increased costs would not provide thenecessary resources or incentives for expansion: indeed, it would
simply be a waste of money. If the Government were to demonstrate that their objectives were more than paper ones, it was necessary togive the realistic award this year for which he asked.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that while it was true thatthe award suggested by the Minister of Agriculture would not exceed the existing public expenditure survey estimate for 1969-70, it would lead to an excess over the estimate for 1970-71. But this was not areasonable basis on which to judge the size of the award. They hadto decide what public expenditure was absolutely essential for thepurposes in mind. An award of  20 million would not mean theabandonment of the policy objectives stated last November. Theagricultural objectives for 1972-73 had been accepted by theGovernment on the explicit basis that rising productivity wouldenable the expansion to be achieved with a continuing cost/pricesqueeze on the farming industry. This meant that it was not necessaryto give the farmers an award which left them with the whole of theirproductivity gain. The latter, taking good years with bad, was accepted by the farmers and the Government as amounting on average to  30 million a year. In 1968, after a relatively good year,the award had left the farmers with 45 per cent of their productivitygain. This year, the Minister without Portfolio had proposed thatthey should be left with 60 per cent of their gain and he would beprepared reluctantly to accept this. In reaching a decision, theyshould have regard to the recent report of the National Board for prices and Incomes on agricultural pay. The pay increase concernedaccounted for about  17 million of the total cost increases of  38million, and the NBPI had commented that it was in the governments own power to prevent this increase from falling on consumers andtaxpayers. The suggestion by the Agricultural Ministers that thesettlement should be on the basis of leaving the farmers with 140per cent of their productivity gain was wholly unacceptable,particularly having regard to the extreme stringency which had to beexercised on other public expenditure programmes.In discussion, it was argued that after a drop of  39 million in income in 1968-69, the farmers must be given a relatively generousaward to provide the incentive and even more important theresources to expand production in 1969-70 and subsequently. Bankcredit would not be available on the scale required for the investmentneeded. Small farmers would find it particularly difficult to obtaincredit. There had in fact been no productivity gain in 1968-69.Agricultural output would be practically the same in 1968 as in 1964.The very detailed and thorough studies which had been carried outlast year had shown that, whereas productivity had been risingmuch faster in agriculture than in industry for many years, incomeshad been rising more slowly. While the desired expansion might beachieved with an award of somewhat less than the  50 million
recommended by the Agricultural Ministers, an award of only  26million would be wholly ineffective and therefore a waste of public money.On the other hand, it was argued that the basis on which theagricultural expansion programme had been adopted was that this could be achieved if the farmers were able to retain on average about50 per cent of their productivity gain. The bad weather during lastyear&apos;s harvest might justify an increase to 60 per cent this year,although farmers had not been asked in the past to forgo part oftheir award on the grounds that the previous year&apos;s weather had been better than average. Agriculture was a priority category for bankadvances, and, despite the severe credit squeeze, there had been anincrease of  23 million in advances to agriculture in the 12 months ended November 1968. A further increase in the price of milk to theconsumer, as proposed, was undesirable in itself and would lead tolarger production of milk products and therefore to increasingdifficulties with our traditional overseas suppliers. This proposal should therefore be further considered.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their discussion in the following week. Forthat meeting the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofAgriculture should provide papers, which should so far as possible befactual, dealing with the doubts expressed in the discussion. Inparticular, it would be helpful if the Chancellor would set out the relationship between the size of an award and actual Treasuryexpenditure. It would also be helpful if he would set out the factsabout the increase in farmers&apos; income over recent years and theirrelevance to the annual award. A number of Ministers had recognisedthat last year&apos;s poor harvest justified some increase in the award thisyear, but it was not clear whether in the past farmers had accepted a lower award after a good year. It would be helpful if the Minister ofAgriculture could deal with the possibility of providing someautomatic link from year to year between the size of the award andthe effects of the weather on the previous year&apos;s harvest.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to resume their discussion the following week.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofAgriculture to circulate memoranda for that meeting onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th February, 1969.
