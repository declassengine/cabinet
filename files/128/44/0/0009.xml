The Prime Minister reported that the parliamentary committee, at a meeting earlier that morning, had discussed the slow progress which the Parliament (No. 2) Bill was making in Committee.They had agreed that, since some of those among their own back-benchers who were opposing the early clauses of the Bill, on the composition of the reformed House of Lords, might not oppose laterclauses dealing with powers, it would be premature to consider nowwhat tactics to adopt in the later stages. The situation would be reviewed in a week&apos;s time. The Home Secretary had reported thatthe confidential meeting with leading members of the conservative opposition, which had been mentioned at the Cabinefs previous meeting, had made it clear that the Opposition were not interestedin a compromise on the timing of the introduction of changes in the composition of the House of Lords, but only in the postponement tothe next Parliament of these provisions as a whole. TheGovernment&apos;s attitude to this should be considered when moreprogress had been made in Committee.The Parliamentary Committee had also considered the tacticsto be adopted in the debates likely to take place early in March onthe White Papers on National Superannuation and Social insurance and on Policy for Industrial Relations. It was agreed that the white papers should be debated on Motions identical in substance, whichwould on the one hand place the Opposition in difficulty vis-a-vistheir own policies, and, on the other, enable critics among theGovernments supporters to vote in favour of the Motion without committing themselves to the details of the proposals. The lord president and the Chief Whip had been asked to work out the termsof a Motion in consultation with the Secretary of State for social services and the First Secretary of State and it might be necessarythat the Motions should be approved by the parliamentary committee or the Cabinet before they were tabled.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet discussed the . growing interest evinced by theOpposition in problems of crime, and noted that it would benecessary to consider later how best to contain the tendency to makecrime into a political issue.2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in therecent elections in India the Congress Party had suffered a setbackin four states. In West Bengal, the Communist-dominated front had won a landslide victory.  The elections would increase theSECRET9936 A 2
PakistanMiddle East(previous reference:CC (69) 7thConclusions,Minute 2)Central Government&apos;s difficulties in achieving working relationships with the State Governments, and although no convincing alternative to Congress as a national Government had yet emerged, there was some doubt about its prospects in the 1972 elections. If as a resultof present developments democracy in India were to fall into disrepute, the consequences would be serious.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in Pakistanthe situation, as might be expected after 10 years of authoritariangovernment, remained disturbed, and the outlook was uncertain.Opposition to President Ayub&apos;s Government was widespread and anumber of political figures had come out publicly against him. ThePresident had made some conciliatory gestures recently but hisopponents (in particular Air Marshal Asghar Khan, the Chief Justice,and Mr. Bhutto) appeared unwilling to enter into discussions withhim.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thefour-power meeting on the Middle East situation, previouslyarranged for 19th February, had not in the event been held, but he hoped it would take place before the end of the week. In theBritish view the first step was to agree on a message of support fromthe four powers to Dr. Jarring, the Special Representative of theUnited Nations Secretary-General and a request to the opposingpowers to co-operate with him. All of the four powers had alreadycondemned the latest attack on an Israeli airliner and urged Israelto refrain from retaliation.On the substance of the dispute the aim must be to devise a comprehensive settlement comprising all the elements in the security council Resolution, including also concessions which each side mightoffer in order to make the settlement more acceptable to the other.A four-power initiative was needed to break the deadlock created bythe fact that the opposing sides and to some extent Dr. Jarring, hadall taken up rigid positions.One encouraging development had been that the Soviet Embassy,in response to our request for clarification of some points of detail in the recent Soviet note on the Middle East situation, had suggestedthat representatives of the two countries should discuss the Sovietproposals in parallel with the four-power conversations in New York.It seemed possible that the Soviet Union had now concluded thattheir interests would be better served by a settlement in the middle east than by a continuance of the existing state of tension.The Cabinet-(1) Took   note  of  the  statements   by   the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.
general de Gaulle&apos;sProposals for Anglo-FrenchDiscussions :european co-operation in theWesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC(69)8thConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that recently the President of the French Republic, General de Gaulle, had sent for HM Ambassador in Paris and had put to him a series of ideas onthe future organisation of Europe. The essence of General de gaulle&apos;s suggestions had been that there should be an independentEurope which would make the North Atlantic Treaty Organisationunnecessary. The European Economic Community (e.c.) wouldbe transformed into a looser but at the same time wider, economic association within which there would be an inner political directorate of the larger European powers, i.e., France, Britain, Germany andItaly. General de Gaulle had suggested that France and britain should enter into bilateral talks on defence and other matters. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary said that General de Gaulle&apos;sbasic propositions were quite unacceptable. Neither we nor our other potential partners in the e.c. wished to disrupt either the EECor the Western Alliance. It was difficult to see how such proposals could work in practice. They would be unwelcome to the othermembers of the e.c., who would see in what General de Gaulleproposed in respect of the Community the destruction of its solidachievements in exchange for a concept which remained entirelyvague. The smaller powers would object violently to the idea of a european political directorate. General de Gaulle&apos;s motives inmaking these proposals were not entirely clear. But their effect would certainly be disruptive; and probably their intention was too.It was important not to allow General de Gaulle to get into a positionin which he could tell the Europeans that British entry into the eec no longe mattered, since he and the British were now planning a new and entirely different arrangement. If this were allowed to happen, we should lose our friends in Europe and gain no advantagefor ourselves. Past experience suggested that General de Gaullemight have something of this nature in mind and this surmise was confirmed by some of the (probably inspired) leakages which hadtaken place.We had accordingly replied to General de&quot;Gaulle making itclear that his basic ideas were unsatisfactory to us. While we wouldbe prepared to have bilateral discussions with him, we could not doso without informing our partners in the Western European Union(WEU). During his visit to Bonn the Prime Minister had informedDr. Kiesinger, the German Chancellor, of General de Gaulle&apos;approach, and the same information had been given to the othermembers of the WEU. In this way we had avoided the risk of being placed in a false position by General de Gaulle and of arousingsuspicions in the minds of our WEU partners that we were attempting to do a deal with the French at their expense.  It was possible that
in making his approach to us when he did General de Gaulle had had in mind the forthcoming visit of the President of the UnitedStates, Mr. Nixon, to Europe, and the desirability of trying to convince the President that he had put forward reasonable proposals in regard to Europe but that the British had rejected them.Turning to the question of political consultation in the WEU,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in this case, asin others, an important question of substance had arisen under theguise of a question of procedure. Both we and the other membersof WEU (the &quot; Five &quot;) believed that so long as Britain was excludedfrom the e.c. there must be as much consultation as possiblebetween us and them in the fields not covered by the Treaty of Rome,and in forums other than the e.c.. One important reason for thiswas that if we showed no interest in consultation with our Europeanpartners-for which the initiative had come from them they would tend to lose interest in us and in our entry into the Community.Moreover, there would be an increasing tendency to centre discussionof matters not covered by the Treaty of Rome, within the e.c., withthe result that we should be excluded, perhaps permanently, from such discussions. For so long as we were not members of the e.c.,we must ensure that it did not become the sole forum of discussion in Europe.It was with these considerations in mind that we had proposed the discussion on the Middle Eastern situation between thePermanent Representatives on the Council of the Western european union which had taken place on 14th February. The five european members, other than France, had welcomed this meeting, had found it useful and had taken the view (which was opposed by the French)that in calling and holding the meeting the Secretary-General hadacted wisely and properly. The French had objected to the meeting,and had attempted to bring pressure to bear on the Secretary-General,who had however stood firm. The French would probably persistin boycotting such meetings. If they did, we should not attemptto exclude them, but neither should we feel debarred from carryingon without them. It was hoped that such meetings would continue and give a new lease of life to the WEU, which would now begin to fulfil some of the purposes for which it was intended.The German attitude over this episode had been somewhatconfused. At first the Germans had strongly supported the holding of these meetings, but later their enthusiasm had waned and dr. Kiesinger, it appeared against the advice of the german ambassador in London and the Foreign Ministry in Bonn, had issued a somewhat ambiguous statement. This had been followedby two further statements, which were also obscure, and appearedto be motivated by the desire to please both sides.  The Germans
7CC 9 (69)were being asked for clarification of their attitude; but as this appeared to be that only meetings of Ministers required unanimousapproval, and they seemed to have no objection to the holding of regular fortnightly meetings of Permanent Representatives, whichcould be used for the purposes we had in mind, their position didnot appear to preclude us from getting the substance of what we andthe other European powers wanted. Though on present indicationsit was unlikely that the Germans would refuse to attend meetings at which the French were not present it would be inadvisable todiscuss political issues in a forum from which both France andGermany were absent.In discussion the point was made that while the ambiguity ofthe German attitude over the recent WEU meeting was regrettable,it had to be borne in mind that the Federal Government attached as much importance to the Franco-German alliance and the buryingof traditional enmities which it represented, as they did to the irrelations with us. This Was a genuine and legitimate Germaninterest. Moreover, they were facing a general election within thenext few months. There were therefore limits to the degree ofco-operation we could expect from them. The diplomaticmanoeuvres in which we were engaged vis-a-vis France should notbe carried to a length which might endanger our relations withGermany. On the other hand it was pointed out that the relevationof General de Gaulle&apos;s thinking and in particular of his ideasregarding the e.c. had made a considerable impression on theGerman as on other European governments, German policieswere bound over the ensuing months to be influenced by electoralconsiderations and Dr. Kiesinger in particular would be forced to do what he could to keep at least the semblance of a Franco-Germanalliance in being. However, no German party could afford to be forced into a position where it could be represented as being sosubservient to French policies as to be prepared to throw away thebenefits of good relations with Britain in the interest of good relationswith France. It was for us to make it clear by our actions that itwas the French and not ourselves who were being unreasonable and doing the bullying: opinion in Germany, in Europe generally, andeven to a large extent in France, appeared to be reaching this conclusion. During the Prime Ministers visit to Bonn the GermanGovernment had been left under no misapprehension about thefrustration and resentment which had been&apos; caused in Britain by thefact that on two important issues (trading arrangments with the e.c. and the Harmel proposals for political co-operation) the germans had appeared to be siding with the French rather than with ourselves.Dr. Kiesinger had assured the Prime Minister that the german attitude had been inspired not by sympathy with France but bytactical considerations.
With regard to General de Gaulle&apos;s initiative, it was deplorablethat Britain and France should be at variance: but the differences between the two countries could not be solved by making concessions to the General, who had demonstrated his hostility not only to britain but to the sort of Europe we and our European partnerswanted and (as his attitude towards the Non-Proliferation treaty had shown) to even wider interests. In general, the outcome of theLuxembourg meeting of the WEU, the Prime Minister&apos;s visit toBonn, and the action subsequently taken in WEU had been favourable. We should now work towards a situation in which any discussion (at any rate between the &quot; Five &quot;) of new policies shouldtake place in a manner which allowed of consultation, whethercollectively or bilaterally, with ourselves, and in which positionswithin the e.c. would not become hardened so long as the french attitude towards British entry remained unchanged.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the points made in discussion.The Prime Minister said that discussions with the Germans on questions of technological co-operation had on the whole been satisfactory. On ELDO he had emphasised the desirability ofcarefully examining the issues of cost and political benefit in orderto ensure that projects were financially viable and brought a realeconomic return and had fully explained the reasons underlyingour attitude towards the organisation. This had brought no adversereaction from the Germans. On the airbus, he had expressed hissurprise that the Federal Government should have reached adecision on the form of aircraft they favoured and had announcedthis apparently before they had assessed the state of the market andthe sales prospects of the aircraft. He had deprecated any attemptto establish a link between the airbus project and that for themulti-role combat aircraft (MRCA). To this, both the federal german Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, and the Finance Minister, HerrStrauss, had signified their assent. In his view, it would be a mistake to build, for political reasons, an airbus which could not be sold andan MRCA which did not meet the military requirement. The twoprojects must be treated on their technical, political and commercialmerits, and it was essential that the governments concerned shouldbe satisfied that they were viable. Discussion of collaboration in producing enriched uranium by the gas centrifuge process had ledinto a discussion of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and its implications for the application for peaceful uses of nuclear energy.It had been agreed that Dr. Stoltenberg, the Federal Minister for scientific Research, could usefully discuss these aspects with the
IndustrialAffairsInter-UnionDisputewithin theBritish steel corporation(previous reference:CC (69) 8thConclusions,Minute 4)9936CONFIDENTIAL3. The First Secretary of State said that there was a risk of serious trouble in the steel industry as a result of the conflict betweenthe recommendations of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on unionrecognition and the findings of the court of inquiry under LordPearson. The six craft unions were taking a stand on the formerand the two white-collar unions on the latter; and both groups were ready to take industrial action if the decision went against them.Ministers concerned when he visited London on 11th March. Thiswould help to overcome Herr Strauss&apos; opposition to signing theTreaty, which he was basing on the ostensible ground that it wouldinhibit peaceful nuclear development. The Germans had expressed a degree of satisfaction at the Soviet intimation that if the federal government signed the NPT their accession would not have anydiscriminatory implications and that the Security Council resolution no. 235 would extend to the Federal Government in the same way as to other non-nuclear signatories. Some anxiety evidentlyremained in their minds that the Soviet Government might claimto retain the right of intervention under the &quot; enemy states &quot; clauses of the United Nations Charter. The Prime Minister had pointedout in this connection that the essential security assurance for theFederal Government was provided by the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) and the United States commitment to NATO.It seemed likely that the Federal Government would eventually sign the NPT, though not until after the elections, and though there wasa possibility that German signature of the Treaty might become an election casualty.In discussion, the point was made that collaboration with europe in technical matters had already reached a high level even thoughthe political problem had not yet been resolved. We should not therefore be unduly discouraged by current political difficulties orallow political considerations to dominate questions of technical co-operation. As against this, it was pointed out that the opportunities which had presented themselves in the technical fieldhad arisen precisely because we had succeeded in convincing our european partners that we were European-minded and anxious to collaborate with them. If the political momentum were allowed toslacken, the picture might be a very different one.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister and ofthe points made in discussion.
WageNegotiationsin the MotorIndustryShe had told the British Steel Corporation (BSC) that while herDepartment would do all all they could by way of conciliation theycould not act as arbitrators nor could they impose a settlement onthe lines of the findings of the court of inquiry or otherwise. It wasthe statutory duty of the BSC as part of its management function, todecide which unions to recognise. She had urged the BSC to bearin mind the need to avoid damaging stoppage in the industry; and her Department were now trying to assess the relative damage to the economy which strike action by the six craft unions on the one handand the two white-collar unions on the other might cause. It shouldbe borne in mind that while action by the white-collar unions mightextend to the motor industry and other sectors of the engineering industry, a strike by the craft unions would bring the steel industryto a halt and so cause serious disruption throughout the steel-using industries. &apos;In discussion it was pointed out that the conflict between the tuc&apos;s recommendations and the court of inquiry&apos;s findings had placed the Chairman of BSC in a very difficult personal position. Itwould therefore be important to assure him that the Governmentwould support any decision taken by the BSC management onrecognition. The risk of strike action might be reduced if the craftunions could be brought to accept a measure of recognition for thewhite-collar unions, at local level, in plants where they were stronglyrepresented. On the other hand it was important that theGovernment should not recommend to the BSC any particular courseof action in what was essentially a matter for management decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange for contingency planning to deal with theindustrial consequences of a strike to be kept underreview as the situation developed.The First Secretary of State said that a serious situation had developed in the motor industry. The trades unions concerned had approved by a narrow majority the agreement on wages andconditions which had been negotiated with the Ford motor company. The shop stewards from the Amalgamated Union of engineering and Foundry Workers (AEF) had however refused toaccept it and were being supported by shop stewards from theTransport and General Workers Union. A meeting of the employees&apos; side of the Ford Motor Company&apos;s national joint negotiating committee was to be held on the following day and it
CC9(69)was expected that if a majority of the unions represented at themeeting voted in favour of the agreement, the AEF would formallydissent and give official backing to the shop stewards&apos; action.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.20th February, 1969
