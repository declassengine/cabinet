ParliamentaryAffairsSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.On consideration of the codes of Recommendations for the welfare of Livestock the Government would have against them awell-organised and powerful lobby. The Government had a strong case, for we were the first country in the world to produce suchcodes, and it was important that it should be presented to maximumeffect. The Minister of Agriculture would be explaining the government&apos;s case to the Party that evening and he would be incharge of the debate. The course of the debate on the codes in theHouse of Lords showed that if the Governmenfs case were properlydeployed it would make a powerful impression which, at a later stage, might be turned to our advantage in the international field.The debate on Procedure would take place on Motions to amendStanding Order 18 and to take note of the Reports of the SelectCommittee on Procedure. This would allow of a preliminary discussion of the Committee&apos;s proposals for the scrutiny of public expenditure, in the course of which the Lord President would announce the Governmenfs acceptance of the Committee&apos;s main recommendations for reorganising the business of Supply, whilereserving their position on the recommendations for a SelectCommittee on Expenditure working through a series of sub-Committees.It was pointed out that the legislative programme for 1969-70would be a heavy one and that it was important that all Ministerssitting in the Lords should take their full share of the work involved.(previous reference :CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatfollowing the release of Mr. Anthony Grey a number of Britishsubjects detained by the Chinese had also been released. The numberstill in custody had thus been reduced from 13 to 7 and we were continuing to press for the release of the remainder. Except in thecase of Mr. Grey, over which they had from the outset adopted arigid posture, the Chinese had not sought to bargain over the releasesso far effected. It seemed possible, now that the case of Mr. Greywas disposed of, that the Chinese might be seeking to improve the irrelations with us.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theelections in Turkey had confirmed the position in power of the rulingparty.  Although the main opposition party had made considerable
gains, they had done so largely at the expense of the smaller parties.There was unlikely to be any major change in Turkish foreign policy,but the new Government might be in a better position to adopt ahelpful attitude over the Cyprus problem. It was, however, facedwith considerable economic difficulties.West Berlin The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there had recently been an attempt to enforce the use by Allied traffic on theautobahn between West Berlin and the Federal Republic of germany of a travel document purporting to emanate from the german democratic Republic. In concert with the United States and french authorities we had resisted this attempt, since we held that theagreements governing access to Berlin were with the Russians, andthat the German Democratic Republic had no standing in the matter.The Soviet authorities had quickly backed down. It seemed likely that the measure had been introduced under pressure from theGerman Democratic Republic and that the Russians, for their part,had no wish to make difficulties for the German Federal government or for the Allies. It was noteworthy that the French attitude duringthe Allied discussions on the subject had been much more co-operativethan in the days of General de Gaulle&apos;s presidency.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements made by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.public expenditure:1971-72(previous reference:CC (69) 44thConclusions,Minute 3)PublicExpenditureSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer about public expenditure in 1971-72 (C (69) 141);memoranda about overseas aid by the Minister of overseas development (C (69) 130 and 142); and a memorandum about fuel policy by the Minister of Technology (C (69) 137).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had been askedto arrange for officials to make detailed proposals to trim the public expenditure programme for 1971-72 so as to reduce demand by 300 million. The proposals in C (69) 141 were designed to secure this reduction in demand by a cut of  355 million in the level ofpublic expenditure. This reduction in demand continued to be essential in order to keep the economy on its present reasonably satisfactory course and to ensure that the burden of taxation did not become intolerable. The proposals for reductions in public expenditure were summarised in paragraph 3 of C (69) 141. 154 million would be saved as a result of decisions taken in respectof previous years. Further savings of  19 million had accrued sincethe original Public Expenditure Survey Report (PESC) for 1969.
This left  182 million still to be found. Of this, he proposed that 60 million should come from the defence budget and  10 millioneach from the investment programmes of the gas industry and british railways. He further proposed that the growth of local authorities&apos;current expenditure in 1971-72 should be limited to 4 per cent,instead of 5 per cent, above 1970-71. Such an increase would be larger than the expected growth of national income and than thegrowth of public expenditure as a whole. This restriction of localauthorities&apos; current expenditure, to be achieved in the next rate support Grant negotiations, would save approximately  34 million in 1971-72. He understood the anxiety of the Secretary of State for education and Science that any reduction in the Rate Support Grantbelow the level hitherto assumed in PESC might lead local authoritiesto economise by employing fewer teachers. But this problem wouldnot be solved by over-generous provision of Exchequer funds. TheGovernment should make clear their views on how current expenditure by local authorities should appropriately be distributed,and if for any reason the local authorities acted unreasonably, theGovernment should exert the necessary pressures on them. He wasalso proposing that the 1971 uprating in social security benefits should be postponed by one month to save  19 million in 1971-72.In this connection, it should be borne in mind that no savings hadbeen required of the social security budget for 1970-71.The Chancellor added that they had before them two claims for additional expenditure in 1971-72 for overseas aid and to assistredundant miners. If the proposals which he had just outlinedproved acceptable to his colleagues, some modest additional expenditure on overseas aid and assistance to mining could in normal circumstances have been accommodated without too much difficulty from the contingency allowance for 1971-72, which stood at  250 million. However, he had just learned that estimates of thelevel of expenditure on investment grants had been very substantially increased. Expenditure under this head was now expected to be 115 million more in 1969-70;  60 million more in 1970-71; and 65 million more in 1971-72. The consequence of this higher estimate which apparently arose from faster rates of claim rather than from unexpectedly higher investment was to absorb substantially more than the present contingency reserve for 1969-70 and approximately to halve the reserve for 1970-71. Urgent examinationwas required of the possibilities of bringing this expenditure underbetter control and of reducing it as much and as soon as possible.In discussion, the following points were made (a) Defence. The proposed reduction of  60 million in thedefence budget for 1971-72 could be reluctantly accepted. Because
the defence budget would also be absorbing the cost of introducing the new military salary, the actual savings to be found in 1971-72would total  85 million. This would be done by postponements and reductions across the board. There would be substantialcancellations and postponements of previously planned orders for ships, aircraft and other equipment.(b) Gas Industry Investment. The proposed reduction of 10 million was acceptable On the understanding that it would besubject to review in 1970 in the light of further experience and estimates of the future rate of expansion.(c) British Railways Investment. The proposed reduction of 10 million was acceptable on the understanding that it related tothe basic investment programme only and did not necessarily rule out additional expenditure on the proposed electrification of the line from Weaver Junction to Glasgow.(d) Local Authorities&apos; Current Expenditure. As a result of thedecision taken in January 1968 to postpone the raising of the school leaving age (RSLA), there would in any event have been someproblem over the next few years in matching with demand the supplyof teachers, which had been expanded to meet RSLA. The proposed reduction in the rate of growth of local authority expenditure in1971-72 would make the problem considerably worse. More thana quarter of local authorities&apos; current expenditure was on teachers&apos;salaries. If the local authorities became aware by next summer thatthe level of their current expenditure was to be restricted in 1971-72,as now proposed, this would reduce the number of teachers employedin September, 1970. On the other hand, it was pointed out that under the present Rate Support Grant (RSG) system, it was verydifficult to ensure that adequate numbers of teachers would beemployed irrespective of the level of RSG. The latter was too bluntan instrument to enable the Government to ensure that nationalpriorities were observed by the local authorities. The present arrangements for financing local authority expenditure should accordingly be reviewed in the light of the views expressed on thissubject by the Royal Commission on Local Government in England.It was further argued that an increase of 4 per cent in current expenditure by local authorities might well involve no improvementin services provided because the changing age structure of thepopulation was increasing the numbers dependent on those services.(e) Other Civil Expenditure. The proposals in paragraph 6 ofC (69) 141 were agreed. Some saving was possible on housing andlocal environmental services because local authorities were buildingfewer houses than expected. The Government was not restricting the level of approvals for public housing starts. But the high rate ofinterest paid by local authorities on money borrowed between the start and completion of public housing was a serious deterrent.
It was urged that more should be spent in 1971-72 on legal aid and the courts; but on the other hand it was pointed out that thewhole of the proposed reduction of  2 - 5 million in expenditure onlaw and order would fall on the Home Office Vote, and no additionalfinance was available for legal aid and the courts.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of their discussion,said that the Cabinet approved the Chancellor^ proposals, inparagraphs 4, 5 and 6 of C (69) 141, for reducing public expenditurein 1971-72. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, should examine the causes of the very substantial increase in the estimates of expenditureon investment grants which had just been disclosed; and seek bettermethods of future control, and possible ways of reducing this expenditure. The reduction of  10 million by the Gas Council in1971-72 would be subject to review in 1970. The Minister ofTransport would consult the Secretary of State for Scotland aboutthe means by which a reduction of  10 million would be secured inthe basic investment programme of British Railways. The Secretaryof State for Local Government and Regional Planning, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for education and Science, the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales and other Ministers concerned should review the methods ofproviding finance for local authority expenditure and report to theCabinet by the end of the year.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of this partof their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Approved the proposals in C (69) 141 for the reduction ofpublic expenditure in 1971-72.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Technology, to carry out an examination,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister, intoinvestment grants, and to report to the Cabinet.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theSecretary of State for Education and Science, theSecretary of State for Wales and other ministers concerned as necessary, to review the financing of localauthority expenditure on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister, and to report to the Cabinet.
The Minister of Overseas Development said that the Governmentwere committed to move towards the target for net financial flowsto developing countries of 1 per cent of gross national product (g.n.p.)which had been set by the second United Nations Conference on trade and Development in 1968. There would be growing pressure on us and other donors to be more specific about reaching this target.The 1970s had been designated by the United Nations as the SecondDevelopment Decade; and the developing countries were pressing for 1972 as the date for reaching the 1 per cent target. AnInternational Commission under Mr. Lester Pearson&apos;s chairmanshiphad recommended in a recent report (the Pearson report), which hadbeen welcomed by the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government,that all industrialised countries should provide resource transfers ofat least 1 per cent of g.n.p. by 1975 at latest. As our balance ofpayments improved we should no longer be able&apos; to argue with thesame force as hitherto that our aid programme must be kept downbecause of our economic difficulties. This programme was the only onewhich, for purposes of the PESC review, was expressed in cash terms.A static or very slowly growing cash figure implied a steady fall inthe value of the programme in real terms. As a percentage of g.n.p.our official aid had gone down from 0 - 53 per cent in 1964 to 0 - 42 percent in 1968; and on the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ proposalsit would fall to 0-37 in 1971-72. In her view, the figure for grossofficial aid flows in 1971-72 should be increased by  33 million overthe figure of  227 million proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer. This was the minimum necessary to maintain the valueof the present programme in real terms and to allow for some verymodest growth.In discussion it was emphasised that the improvement whichhad so far taken place in the balance of payments provided no basis for any general relaxation in the control of public expenditure; andour creditors would not take kindly to any substantial increase in our aid programme while our standing debts were so large. Moreover,despite our economic difficulties, our record did not compare unfavourably with that of other countries; and the quality of our aid, measured by such tests as the proportion of grants to loans, wasnot matched by any other donor country. However, the need atleast to maintain the value of the aid programme in real terms and asa percentage of g.n.p. was generally accepted.In further discussion there was wide support for the view that weshould couple an announcement about the aid programme for1971-72 with a declaration of our intent to meet the 1 per centtarget recommended in the Pearson report by, say, the later 1970s;and that this would carry more conviction if it could be shown thatthe aid programme for 1971-72 represented some increase, howevermodest, over the previous year in terms of percentage of g.n.p. The
possibility of offsetting an increase in the flow of aid by some reduction in its quality was suggested; but the general view was thatthis would harm the developing countries and would be badlyreceived by those concerned with aid matters at home and abroad.In further discussion it was pointed out that developing countriesderived substantial benefit from our purchases of sugar and other commodities at prices above normal world levels and also, in certain cases, from our miltary aid; but both these forms of assistance were excluded by the formula adopted by the Organisation for european co-operation and Development for International aid comparisons.These points should be borne in mind in the domestic presentation of aid policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that there could be no question of a generalrelaxation in the control of public expenditure. They agreed,however, that the aid programme for 1971-72 should be increasedby an amount which would maintain its value, compared with theprogramme already agreed for 1970-71, in real terms and as a percentage of g.n.p. and would provide for some modest growthover and above this. On the basis of the Chancellor of theExchequer^ provisional estimate that to maintain the value of theprogramme would cost an additional  11 million, the Cabinet agreedthat the figure for gross official aid flows should be increased fromthe  227 million (excluding military aid to Singapore and Malaysia)originally proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to 245 million; but this was subject to review if the basis on which itwas calculated proved on further examination to need revision. TheCabinet would wish to consider further the implications of makinga declaration of intent in relation to the 1 per cent targetrecommended in the Pearson report. For this purpose the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of overseas development, should arrange for a memorandum to be preparedshowing the estimated increase in total and official aid respectivelywhich would be involved year by year if the Government decided tomeet the target by the late 1970s.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that the figure for Government expenditure on overseas aid (excluding military aid) in 1971-72 shouldbe increased to  245 million, on the basis indicated in thePrime Minister^ summing up.(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Overseas Development, to circulate a memorandum to Cabinet showing the consequences
for public expenditure of making a declaration of intenton the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up.Fuel Policy The Minister of Technology said that the Ministerial Committeeand Assiifor CoalIndustryand Assistance on industrial Policy had reviewed fuel policy as set out in the White101 Coal        Paper on Fuel Policy published in November 1967 (Cmnd. 3438)and in the light of this review had considered proposals for the continuation of financial assistance to the coal industry. At present this assistance took the form of a scheme providing redundant mineworkers aged 55 or over with about 90 per cent of their take-homepay for three years or until they reach age 65 if this were earlier; and thereafter they were paid their normal mineworker&apos;s pension. Inaddition the Exchequer reimbursed two-thirds of other special socialcosts incurred by the National Coal Board as a result of the rapidrundown of the industry. He proposed that statutory powers shouldbe taken in the coming Parliamentary Session to enable theGovernment to continue these schemes. There had been generalagreement in principle in the Ministerial Committee on industrial policy to such continuance, but agreement had not been reached on whether or not the scale of compensation and of the exchequer contribution should be tapered after March 1971.In discussion it was argued that there should be some taperingof the existing scale of compensation to redundant miners, not primarily because of the Exchequer costs involved, but because itencouraged miners aged 55 to draw their weekly compensationinstead of finding alternative work. Of some 20,000 former miners in receipt of compensation only 1,200 had so far obtained alternative employment. As an alternative to the methods of tapering suggestedin C (69) 137 it was suggested that special compensation might onlybe made available to ex-miners aged 60 or more, instead of 55.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of their discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that a Bill should be introduced in the1969-70 Session to enable the Government to continue after March1971 the special arrangements set out in paragraph 15 (a) ofC (69) 137. The reference to this legislation in The Queen&apos;s Speechshould be, however, to a Bill to &quot; continue &quot;, not to &quot; extend &quot;, theGovernment&apos;s powers under the Coal Industry Act, 1967 to help thecoal industry. Meanwhile the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the paymaster General should consider with the Social Services secretary and other Ministers concerned how the cost to the Government ofthe special schemes for redundant miners might best be tapered afterMarch 1971.The Cabinet (7) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of this part of their discussion.
Prices andIncomesControl ofLocalAuthorityand PrivateRents(previous reference:CC (69) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their meetingon 30th July the Cabinet had agreed that the Local authority associations and the Greater London Council (GLC) should be consulted about the possibility of a voluntary system of control on local authority rent increases after the end of 1969. these consultations had now taken place; and the Future Policy Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes badconsidered the outcome earlier in the week. All the associations,though not the GLC, had been persuaded to recommend to their members guidelines which would operate for a period of not morethan 18 months. These provided that authorities would increasestandard rents under existing tenancies only to the extent necessaryto meet unavoidable increases; and would in any 12-month periodlimit the average increase to 7s. 6d. a week and the increase for anyone dwelling to 10s. Od. a week. The Sub-Committee had endorseda proposal by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales andthe Minister of Housing and Local Government that statutory powers should be taken to require authorities to obtain the Minister^prior consent to any rent increase above the ceilings laid down inthe voluntary agreement. These powers would operate for a periodof 18 months from 1st January, 1970. The Sub-Committee had alsoendorsed a proposal by the Housing Ministers that phasing of private(8) Agreed that a Bill should be introduced in the 1969-70Parliamentary Session for the purposes described inparagraph 15 (a) of C (69) 137.(9) Invited the Lord President of the Council to amend the draftof The Queeifs Speech on the Opening of Parliament(attached to C (69) 143) on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister.(10) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Paymaster General and other Ministers concerned,to consider further the tapering after March 1971 of the government&apos;s contribution to the social costs of the coalindustry&apos;s contraction and of the compensation forredundant miners.(11) Agreed that the ban on the conversion of power stationsfrom coal to oil or natural gas should be maintained forthe present but that the position should be kept underregular review; and also approved the recommendations in paragraph 15 (c) of C (69) 137.
rent increases should continue when the present powers under thePrices and Incomes Act, 1968, expired at the end of 1969 and that legislation should be introduced for this purpose.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced as soon aspossible giving the Government power to controlincreases in local authority rents and to phase increases in private rents, as indicated in the Chancellor of theExchequer^ statement.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to include in thedraft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliamentary reference to the fact that legislation would be introduced to continue in modified form powers to limit increases in house rents.Paper(previous reference :CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 5)SECRETNational 5.  The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State forSuperannuation Social Services (C (69) 140) to which was annexed a draft of a WhiteDraft White    Paper  on  the Terms  for Contracting  Out of the  national superannuation Scheme.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the white paper set out the terms on which partial contracting out would beallowed and had appended to it a memorandum by the government actuary, which was in some ways the most important part of the document. The White Paper of January 1969 had laid down theprinciple that for employees who were partially contracted out ofthe State scheme the deduction from contributions should be linkedto the deduction from pensions on the basis of &quot; commercial cost&quot;.The Government Actuary was the Governmenfs independentprofessional adviser, as he was the adviser to a number of professional schemes; in his memorandum he had set out his view(on the assumptions stated) that the abatement of contributions formen corresponding to an abatement of pensions of 1 per cent was1-25 per cent each for employer and employee. He had also recognised that this relationship, though fair on average, would present difficulties for small schemes and schemes whose membershipwas above average in age; and he had expressed the view thatincreasing the contribution assessment to 1-3 per cent a side, asproposed by the Government, should be sufficient to make the termsfinancially acceptable to a further number of schemes covering an appreciable number of employees.The memorandum would be a powerful weapon against the pension interests who, while generally accepting 1 per cent as the
measure of abatement of pensions, contended that the correspondingmeasure of abatement of contributions should be 1-5 per cent aside. In terms of the weekly contribution of the individual thedifference was insignificant (Is. 5d. a week on an income of  36),but it was critical for the finances of the scheme and the Governmentcould not afford to give way. Moreover, any concession given tothose contracting out would be at the expense of those remainingfully in the State scheme; and the Trades Union Congress were opposed to any further improvement of the terms of abatement.Nevertheless the Government had to face the fact that there wouldbe widespread opposition to the proposals and to plan accordingly.He intended to issue with the White Paper a Press release setting outthe arguments in simpler terms; in the meantime it was mostimportant that there should be no intimation of the conclusions towhich the Government had come. He hoped that the Lord privy seal would be able to issue at the same time as the White Paper was published statements designed to reassure members of public sectorpension schemes, among whom there was widespreadmisunderstanding.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper, subject to any drafting amendments, which should be sent to the Social Services Secretary.They were agreed on the need for a careful and thoroughpresentation of the Governmenfs case. The Social Services secretary and the Lord Privy Seal should circulate drafts of their proposedstatements to the Ministers concerned; and arrangements should bemade for the issues to be explained to the Governmenfs supporters in the House. The timing of the White Paper and the variousstatements should be considered by the Ministerial Committee on home Publicity; in the meantime there must be no disclosure of the contents of the White Paper.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (69) 140,subject to drafting amendments.(2) Invited the Social Services Secretary and the Lord privy seal to circulate drafts of the proposed Press release and proposed statement on public sector pension schemes tothe Ministers concerned.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Home Publicity to consider the timing of publication of the White Paper and statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th October, 1969.
