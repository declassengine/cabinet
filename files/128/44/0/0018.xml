ParliamentaryAffairsParliament(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 15thConclusions,Minute 3)CC 18(69)secret the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord chancellor on the Parliament (No. 2) Bill (C (69) 37), to which was annexed acopy of a letter addressed to him by the Lord Privy Seal on theconsequences, for the conduct of business in the House of Lords, of abandoning the Bill.The Lord Chancellor recalled that at their meeting on 3rd april the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for the Ministerial Committeeon the House of Lords to consider the progress made by the parliament (No. 2) Bill after the resumed debate in Committee on14th April and to report their conclusions to the next meeting ofthe Cabinet. The Committee had met the previous morning andconcluded that there were only two courses now open to theGovernment: to introduce a timetable motion or to abandon theBill. Morale in the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) was very low, with the result that during the debate on 14th April theGovernment had found themselves unable to enforce the closure. TheChief Whip&apos;s advice was that a timetable motion could not be carriedunless there were behind it the full authority of the Prime Minister andthe Government and the issue were made one of confidence in theirleadership; but granted that there was an urgent need to assert the government&apos;s authority in the Party, it might be that this was not thebest issue on which to do so. On the other hand, the consequences of not proceeding with the Bill could be most damaging. It would behailed by the Opposition as a defeat for the Government, and would encourage the dissidents amongst the Governmenfs own supporters.In the House of Lords the consequences for the Governmenfslegislative programme could be serious, because the House of lords would feel secure from any retribution in this Parliament from theHouse of Commons. It was not in his view likely that the House ofLords Would reject Government Bills outright, though some membersof the Committee thought that the proposed Bills on reorganisation ofthe ports and the abolition of feu duty in Scotland might be lost.But they would be likely to insist on proper time for the considerationof Bills reaching them late in the Session and to decline to sit intoAugust to finish arrears of business, and they might also obstructsubordinate legislation. The risks would be particularly great towardsthe end of next Session and the Governmenfs freedom of manoeuvrein deciding the date of the Election might be compromised.These disadvantages would be additional to the direct loss whichthe Government would sustain by abandoning the Bill, which ifenacted would destroy the built-in Conservative majority in the Houseof Lords, reduce its power to delay legislation and deprive it of itspresent power of veto over subordinate legislation. He had therefore been considering with the Lord Privy Seal since the Committee met10366a 2
whether it might not be preferable to seek to carry the Bill in atruncated form, retaining the clauses on composition which hadalready been fought through Committee and discarding the restexcept for the clauses dealing with subordinate legislation. If theydid this they could leave the Opposition in doubt whether they intended to enact the rest of the provisions in the following Session.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentsinability to make progress with the Bill was the result of the generalmalaise in the PLP rather than of the provisions of the Bill itself andthat there was an urgent need to restore the Governments authority in the Party this was an issue so important that it might deserveconsideration at a separate meeting; but there was doubt whetherthe appropriate issue on which to take a stand was the Parliament(No. 2) Bill or the Industrial Relations Bill. On the one hand itwas argued that to let the Parliament (No. 2) Bill go, apart fromthe loss of a good measure which would remove a long-standingthreat to Labour Governments, would be regarded as a betrayal byloyal members of the PLP. It would throw doubt on theGovernments determination to insist on the passage of any other measures, including the Industrial Relations Bill, which were resisted by a minority of their supporters; and it would deprive them of anycredible threat to the House of Lords, who would feel freer than atany time in recent years to ignore the wishes of the House ofCommons. It was therefore essential to persist with the Parliament(No. 2) Bill or at least to leave the way open to introduce in the next session a different Bill dealing with powers alone. A truncated Billon the lines suggested by the Lord Chancellor seemed likely, however,to afford further opportunity for delaying tactics and to create anumber of anomalies not present in the existing Bill.On the other hand, it was urged that if the authority of the PrimeMinister and the Government was to be placed behind a demand fordiscipline in the PLP, the occasion should be an issue of manifestnational importance and one plainly related to current nationalproblems. On this criterion the Industrial Relations Bill seemed the better choice. It should be remembered, however, that, in the last resort, discipline depended on sanctions, and until the relationsbetween the Government and the National Executive Committee ofthe Labour Party could be improved, they could not rely on thesupport of the National Executive in enforcing discipline uponrecalcitrant Members.It was urged that great care must be taken in presenting a decision not to proceed with the Parliament (No. 2) Bill, since such a decision could be represented as the abandonment of a Bill to limit the powerof the Peers in favour of a Bill to limit the freedom to strike. Thedecision should be presented as the outcome of a reappraisal of legislative priorities in the face of the failure of the Opposition to
support what had been introduced as a measure reflecting theconsensus of opinion among the main Parties. It was clearlyimportant that a statement should be made by the Prime Ministerto the PLP as soon as possible and also to the House of Commons,since the Leader of the House would be pressed for information whenthe business statement was made on Thursday. It was desirable,however, that before a statement was made to the PLP they shouldhear the explanation which the First Secretary of State would be giving that afternoon of the Governments proposals for legislation on industrial relations. On balance the best course would be for thePrime Minister to announce the Governments decision in the Houseof Commons on Thursday afternoon and for his statement to befollowed by a meeting of the PLP at which the decision could be presented in its full context and the need for discipline be reasserted.The point should be made that the greater freedom of expression and voting allowed by the present Government required as its corollarythat members should support the Government on all issues ofimportance.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was clearly in favour of notproceeding with the Bill, though they should leave open the possibility that legislation on powers alone might be introduced next Session ifthis would not endanger the rest of the legislative programme. TheBill was a valuable measure and its abandonment would be a loss tothe Labour Party as well as to the nation, but the general view wasthat this was not the right issue on which to base the attempt to restore the Governments authority in the Party and that withoutdoing so they could not force the Bill through. He would prepare a statement on the lines discussed, to the effect that the Governmenthad decided not to proceed with the Parliament (No. 2) Bill at this time, and would show it to members of the Ministerial Committeeon the House of Lords; if the Leader of the House of Commonswere questioned on the matter after the business statement, he should refer to the statement which was to follow. A meeting of the PLPshould be arranged for Thursday afternoon at which he would present the Governments decision, after reassessing their legislativepriorities, not to proceed with the Bill, and would seek to rally theParty, stressing that the relaxation of discipline on everyday mattersmust be matched by greater cohesion and discipline on major issues.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th April, 1969.
