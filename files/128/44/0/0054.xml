The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on Mr. Robert Sheldon&apos;s motion on 21st Novemberwould provide a useful guide to backbenchers&apos; views on thedesirability of televising the proceedings of the House and to theextent of their interest in the subject. Strong arguments could be advanced both for and against the introduction of television camerasinto the Chamber. On the one hand it would help to offsettendentious Press reporting of debates; on the other hand experience in the House of Lords indicated the difficulty of producing a balancedprogramme at reasonable expense. There was no possibility of taking action in the present Parliament, but it would be useful to review the arguments in the light of the debate and of developments since the Cabinet last considered the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that, when he spoke in the debate, the lord president should give a brief account of the arguments for and against televising the proceedings of the House; he should undertaketo consider sympathetically the views expressed in the debate but should not seek to give a lead on the matter. The Cabinet would want to consider the matter further, and members of the cabinet should accordingly not take part in any vote at the end of the debate.The Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure should review the arguments in the light of the views expressed in the debate,of experience in the House of Lords and of other relevant factors and should report their conclusions to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure to review thearguments for and against televising the proceedings ofthe House on the lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.The Cabinet were informed that, following discussions betweenthe First Secretary of State and the General Secretary of the TradesUnion Congress, the members of the Society of Graphical and AlliedTrades who had been involved in unofficial action at Her Majesty&apos;stationery Office (HMSO) had now decided to resume normal working. It should be possible to publish the London Gazette inits normal form on the following day and to begin to catch up with10653
the backlog of Parliamentary and other work. The possibility offurther trouble could not, however, be ruled out; and the emergency arrangements which had been made to maintain essential services toParliament might well have to be brought into operation again at short notice. There were clear indications that if a similar situationarose in the future, the attitude of the Civil Service unions wouldmake it impracticable to use the Ministry of Technology&apos;s Drury Lanepress or other facilities operated by non-industrial civil servants.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the group of Ministers under the Lord Privy SeaTs chairmanship,which had handled a difficult situation with great skill, should standready to deal with any recurrence of industrial action at HMSOand should consider whether any further steps should be taken in readiness to deal with such a contingency.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and other Ministers concerned, toconsider whether any further steps should be taken in readiness to deal with a possible recurrence of industrial action at HMSO.Services and facilities for members ofParliament(previous reference:CC (69) 35thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*2. The Lord President said that on 22nd July the cabinet had accepted the recommendation of the Sixth Report of the SelectCommittee on House of Commons Services (the Services Committee)that provision should be made at public expense for secretarial assistance or an allowance to meet the cost up to a maximum of onefull-time secretary per Member of Parliament. He had announcedthis in the House of Commons on 24th July and had subsequentlycanvassed the views of Members of Parliament outside theGovernment, most of whom favoured a cash payment rather thanthe provision of secretarial services as such. The ministerial committee on Secretarial Assistance had agreed that the best meansof providing secretarial assistance for MPs would be to pay a cashallowance against a declaration by the individual Member that hehad spent on secretarial assistance at least the amount claimed. Thechief Opposition member of the Services Committee, Mr. SelwynLloyd, with whom he and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had discussed the matter, took the same view. As to the amount, onwhich the Ministerial Committee had been unable to agree,Mr. Selwyn Lloyd considered that while the House might accept an allowance of no more than  500 as a useful measure of relief, theterms  of the Services Committee&apos;s  recommendation and the
expectations of many Members would only be met by a substantially higher sum. He himself shared Mr. Selwyn Lloyd&apos;s view and recommended a tax-free allowance of up to  750 a year.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that in any public statement about the proposed allowance it would be important not to describeit as tax-free. MPs who incurred expenses could deduct the net costof the relevant services from their assessable remuneration. A cashallowance in respect of such services reduced their net cost and hence the amount of deductible expenses. This was a long-established principle of tax law and it would be wrong in principle and damaging to the Government to make an exception for MPs.In his view  500, which represented half the salary of a full-timesecretary, was the highest figure which could be justified as a cashallowance for secretarial services. An allowance of anything over 500 would be widely regarded, not as a contribution to Members&apos;expenses, but as a straight increase in their salaries. Hisunderstanding was that Mr. Selwyn Lloyd accepted this and would support an allowance of  500 a year.In discussion it was pointed out that while MPs generally accepted that there could be no increase in their salaries as suchduring the present Parliament, there was wide support on both sides of the House for an improvement in facilities. A cash allowance for secretarial assistance on the lines proposed would not benefitthose MPs who had no secretary, but it would be of considerablehelp to hard-working MPs with large constituencies. There was astrong case therefore for providing an allowance which would meetthe greater part if not the whole of the cost of a full-time secretary,which, in London at least, now exceeded  1,000.On the other hand it was argued that the needs of mostconstituencies could be appropriately met by providing members with a half-time secretary at a cost of about  500. A cash allowance of this amount could therefore be justified as being directly related to Members&apos; needs. To provide an allowance of  750, whichexceeded the amount which the average Member now spent onsecretarial assistance, would open up the possibility of abuse andwould be correspondingly difficult to defend to public opinion.In further discussion it was argued that the proposal to providethe allowance against a simple declaration by the individual Memberthat he had spent at least the sum claimed on secretarial assistance was open to objection. Expenditure on secretarial services shouldbe treated in exactly the same way as other expenses incurred byMembers in connection with their Parliamentary duties.   Against
this, it was suggested that the proposal to seek a declaration from members would result in a greatly simplified procedure and reducethe need for detailed checking of individual claims.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the best way of providing secretarial assistanceto MPs was to make a cash allowance, up to a stated maximum, asa contribution towards the expenses incurred by an individual member on secretarial services. On the question whether themaximum should be  500 or  750 a year opinion within the cabinet was very evenly divided, though the preponderant view wasmarginally in favour of the lower figure. At their next meeting theywould consider further the procedure for claiming the allowance andthe question of parallel adjustment in Peers&apos; expense allowances anda new figure for the MPs&apos; car allowance, with a view to making a comprehensive announcement on the Services Committee&apos;soutstanding recommendations as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1969.
