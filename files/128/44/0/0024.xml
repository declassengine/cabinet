ParliamentaryAffairsBusiness afterthe RecessIndustrialDisputes :Strike atHer Majesty&apos;sStationeryOfficeWarehouse(previous reference :CC (69) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)10378CONFIDENTIALa 21. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Whitsun Recess.confidential the Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, as he had reportedto the House of Commons the day before, the strike at the stationery office warehouse by members of the Society of Graphical and AlliedTrades (SOGAT) was continuing. Furthermore, the engineers atthe press which prints the material supplied to the warehouse had refused to work overtime. This new problem was likely to worsenbecause it involved issues which arose on a national scale. Therewas no sign of an early end to the strike at the warehouse and little progress had been made with SOGAT about the enquiry into thedispute there.In discussion it was pointed out that one of the more serious consequences of the dispute was to delay the publication of thereport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England(the Redcliffe-Maud Report), printing of which would not becompleted in time to allow publication before 11th June. even when copies were then available, it would be possible to makeonly a limited distribution to Members of Parliament, the press and all local authorities. Members of the Cabinet would receivecopies shortly before the end of the Recess. Any attempt to widen the arrangements for special distribution would incur the risk ofaccusations of strike-breaking, which could widen the dispute. Thedelay in publishing the Redcliffe-Maud Report had grave implications for the handling of the reports of the Boundaries Commissions,which could place the Government in serious embarrassment. TheOpposition had already shown themselves aware of this and inaddition they might exploit the fact that Parliamentary businesscould be disrupted by demanding copies of relevant earlier publicdocuments, which could not be obtained from the warehouse; but unless they embarked on a deliberately mischievous campaign, mostdemands could be met by photo-copying, for which arrangements had already been made in the House,The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be helpful if the Minister without Portfolio, in consultationwith the Home Secretary and the Minister, of Housing and LocalGovernment, would take charge of arrangements for ensuring thatthe Redcliffe-Maud Report was distributed as soon as possible onthe basis indicated in the discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on the disputes in the Stationery Officewarehouse and printing works.
(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, to make arrangements to ensure thatthe Report of the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment in England was published as soon aspossible.NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)Meeting withthe PrimeMinister ofNorthernIrelandSECRET2. The Home Secretary reported to the Cabinet on thediscussions which he and the Prime Minister had had on the previous day with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (Major Chichester-Clark) and other Northern Ireland Ministers. The Home secretary said that Major Chichester-Clark and his colleagues had been ableto report rather more progress that he had expected in their measuresto improve the political atmosphere in Northern Ireland. Thechange of Government under Major Chichester-Clark&apos;s leadershipappeared to have enabled him to embark on a progressive course which his predecessor, Captain 0&apos;Neill, had found impossible tofollow; he was much helped in this by Mr. Faulknefs active co-operation. The measures which the Northern Ireland Governmenthad in hand were as follows:(i) Legislation would be passed in the current Session, whichran until December, providing for the local government elections to be held on the basis of &quot; one man, one vote&quot;, and for the deferment of the elections due in 1970 until October 1971, so thatthey would be held on the new franchise.(ii) They would introduce in 1970 a Bill to reorganise localgovernment and the local government franchise. This would comeinto operation before the local government elections of 1971. the government&apos;s proposals would be published in a White Paperthis autumn. A crucial preliminary to this reform, which they didnot wish to make public yet since the proposal had not yet beenconsidered by the Cabinet, was the appointment of an independentcommission under a High Court Judge to determine the wardboundaries within the smaller number of new local authorities.These proposals would strike at the basis of the power of the UlsterUnionist Party in local government and there was likely to be strong opposition to them.(iii) In order to establish a system of allocation of localauthority housing which was fair and could be seen to be fair, they proposed to issue to local authorities in the next month or so amodel allocation scheme based on Scottish experience. It wouldbe impracticable to compel the authorities to conform precisely to
the scheme, but they would be required to secure the Governmentsapproval to any alternative scheme they proposed. The NorthernIreland Ministers had readily accepted an offer of consultation withthe Ministry of Housing and Local Government on the details.(iv) The Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration for northern Ireland would take up his duties as soon as the relevantBill received the Royal Assent. The Northern Ireland Ministersproposed also to introduce in the present Session legislation toestablish machinery to consider citizens&apos; grievances against public authorities other than central government Departments, includinglocal authorities. The main purpose of this move was to tacklereligious discrimination in employment.(v) The amendment of the Special Powers Acts was impendingwhen attacks on vital installations were made in May. The NorthernIreland Ministers appreciated our embarrassment vis-a-vis the human Rights Convention and wished to remove the source of embarrassment as soon as possible, but considered that they couldnot forgo their powers under the Acts until the situation becamecalmer.(vi) The Northern Ireland Ministers had no wish to rely on british troops to guard vital installations longer than was strictlynecessary, but the numbers could not be significantly reduced in thepresent situation until the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) hadbeen strengthened. They proposed to conduct a special recruitingcampaign in the Roman Catholic areas where the schools if notthe church-might help, which would serve both to strengthen theRUC and to increase the proportion of Roman Catholics in it.(vii) An expansion of the housing programme was planned fromthe current level of 12,000 houses a year to 17,000 by 1975. TheNorthern Ireland Ministers said that they could not themselves find the additional  3- 4 million a year which would be needed and asked for help from the United Kingdom Exchequer. AlthoughNorthern Ireland had more than her share of pre-1919 housing, therate of progress in her worst areas was proportionately far betterthan in many cities in Great Britain, and the Ministers had therefore been told that we could not help them.The desire of the Northern Ireland Ministers to improveopportunities for employment and to do all they could to increasethe provision of new housing, was aimed at what they believed tobe the root causes of much of the present discontent, and should do much to improve the situation. Major Chichester-Clark&apos;s view was that the atmosphere was already better, although there was still tension below the surface which could produce fresh disorder
at any moment. He and his colleagues had however been able togive reasonable assurances on the major points of concern to thetwo Governments.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.CONFIDENTIALUpper Clyde 3.   The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the MinisterialL^mhedWerS Steering Committee on Economic Policy had agreed on 6th Maythat a further grant of  3 million should be made available by the shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) to Upper Clyde Shipbuilders.Limited (UCS) as part of a plan to increase its efficiency and establishit on a viable commercial basis. It was inherent in their decision thatthe UCS should be kept afloat for long enough to enable a plan tobe prepared, and he had accordingly authorised the payment of 250,000 to cover payment of the company&apos;s wages in the previousweek. He had, however, made it a condition that this should takethe form of either a secured or a preferred loan. In the event it hadnot been found practicable to insist on this condition, to which he attached considerable importance, and no progress seemed to havebeen made towards formulating a plan to make the company viable.UCS had now asked for a further sum of  250,000 to pay thisweek&apos;s wages. There was no evidence that this sum was neededimmediately to avoid liquidation. It was not clear that the previoustranche of assistance had been used solely to pay wages or that anew one would be so used; nor was there any reason to believe that anew plan would be available quickly. In his view any further assistance at this stage would be a waste of money.The Minister of Technology said that he had visited UCS on 7th May and informed them of the Governmenfs decision, withoutmentioning the sum of money which they were prepared to make available to re-establish the company&apos;s viability. The ExecutiveDirectors of UCS had prepared a plan involving a radical solution to the company&apos;s problems but the shareholders had rejected this and an alternative plan had now been drawn up and submitted tothe SIB. It was important that UCS should not be forced into liquidation before the SIB, which was meeting for the purpose onthe following day, had had a chance to consider both plans. Hewas satisfied that  250,000 was the minimum needed to avoid^liquidation.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that if further assistance was required to enableUCS to pay wages and buy essential supplies for one or two weeks,

The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as hiscolleagues would be aware, Mr. Ian Smith had made a broadcast on20th May in which he had outlined his intentions in regard to a newconstitution, and which could be regarded as the opening of the campaign leading up to the referendum. This was now likely to takeplace on or about 20th June. He himself had made a statement inthe House of Commons, in reply to a Private Notice Question, whichhad been well received. There had been one or two suggestions fromOpposition members that sanctions should now be abandoned, butthis had had no support from the Opposition Front Bench. In hisbroadcast, Mr. Smith had implied, quite /unjustifiably, that the messages he had sent to the British Government had containedpositive proposals, and some play had been made with this in theHouse. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had for sometime intended to publish a White Paper which would demonstrate that this and other mis-statements by the regime were unfounded.He now intended, after giving notice to Mr. Smith as we had undertaken to do, to arrange for the publication of a White paper as soon as possible, He proposed in the first instance to publish theexchanges with the regime which had taken place since the Ministerwhile plans to restore its viability were being considered, it shouldbe made available. All possible steps should however be taken toensure that any sums paid to UCS were solely for this purpose. TheMinister of Technology and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should decide together, in consultation as necessary with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, what immediate assistance was required, how itshould be provided and on what terms. They should discuss thefuture of UCS with the Chairman of the SIB as soon as possible and bring proposals on the long term future of the company to theCabinet in the week beginning 2nd June.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if necessary, further assistance should be madeavailable to UCS on the lines indicated in the PrimeMinister^ summing up.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology and the Chief Secretary,Treasury (i) to decide what immediate assistance was required, howit should be provided and on what terms;(ii) to bring proposals on the future of UCS to theCabinet in the week beginning 2nd June.
without Portfolio had visited Salisbury in-November, 1968. Furtherconsideration would have to be given to whether in due course a fuller record should be published giving details of the Fearlessdiscussions and of those which the Minister without Portfolio had had with the regime in Salisbury. As he had already informed his colleagues, he intended to make a major policy speech on rhodesia; and a suitable occasion for this would be the addresshe was to give to the Diplomatic Writers&apos; Association on 9th June.He would also be giving an interview to the Rhodesian Sunday Mailfor publication on 15th June.The leadership of the Rhodesian Centre Party, which was somewhat more moderate than the governing Rhodesia Front, hadbeen offered to Mr. Evan Campbell, a prominent Rhodesianbusinessman who had served in London as Rhodesian HighCommissioner. The Centre Party had made a proposal, which was supported by the Governor of Rhodesia, that the British Governmentshould make a statement in support of the Centre Party and of theproposals which they had communicated to us for an alternativesecond safeguard internal to Rhodesia. Mr. Campbell, who wasin Europe, was prepared to come to London to discuss thisproposition. There were obvious dangers in committing ourselves to the Centre Party in this way, and it was in any case doubtfulwhether anything that we could properly say would be consideredadequate by the Centre Party from their point of view. However,and especially in view of the personal interest the Governor was taking in the matter, he had not wished to reject it out of hand; andhe had agreed that he or a Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeMinister would see Mr. Campbell He would report further to hiscolleagues when the interview had taken place.In discussion, there was general agreement that the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement had been well receivedby the House of Commons. Difficulties could however be expected in the United Nations if as seemed likely the Rhodesia Fronfsproposals were approved by the referendum. Doubts were expressed about the degree of influence exercised by the Rhodesian CentreParty. It was pointed out that if we endorsed their proposals on asecond safeguard, which would involve a further erosion of ourposition, we should invite criticism for having failed to offer similar concessions to the regime. The Fearless proposals were still on the table for the Centre Party or anyone else to take up if they wished.Similarly it was open to them or anyone else to revert to the 1961Constitution, thus opening the way for the establishment of a legalgovernment.With regard to the publication of a White Paper, it was generally agreed that to publish the text of the written exchanges with the regime which had taken place since the Minister without Portfolio
visited Salisbury would certainly demonstrate the falsity ofMr. Smith&apos;s claim that he had made positive proposals. However,the exchanges were somewhat arid; a White Paper based exclusivelyon them would not make the best of our case, which was a strongone, and would do little to strengthen the good impression which hadbeen made by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement in the House of Commons. In particular, and even though theMinister without Portfolio had reported fully to the House on had discussions in Salisbury, it would be difficult, without some referenceto the actual records, to refute effectively Mr. Smith&apos;s equallyunjustified insinuations that the only real point of differenceremaining after the Fearless discussions was that of the appeal to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council, and that during theSalisbury discussions the Minister without Portfolio had, afterconferring with African leaders, introduced nine further non-negotiable conditions.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted with approval the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s proposals in regard to a policy speech and an interview with the Rhodesian Sunday Mail. They agreed that he or a foreign and   Commonwealth   Office   Minister   should   see  Mr.   EvanCampbell if the latter came to London.  They also agreed that a white Paper should be published as soon as possible.  So far as itscontent was concerned, there would be advantage in publishing^a somewhat fuller document which would continue the story fromwhen it had been left by the White Paper on the discussions heldon board HMS Fearless (Cmnd. 3793).  It would not be necessaryto publish the text of these or of the November discussions in salisbury in extenso,  but there should be a full account of developments   since   the   Fearless   discussions,   which   woulddemonstrate the falsity of Mr. Smith&apos;s allegations about the nine non-negotiable points and the lack of foundation for his other mis-statements and distortions.  The White Paper could conclude withthe texts of the written exchanges with the regime as originally proposed. A number of further points required urgent consideration:for, example the future of the Governor; the position of the Crown,on which Mr. Smith had again misrepresented us in his broadcast;the position of the United Kingdom Residual Affairs Office in salisbury and of Rhodesia House in London; and arrangements forthe reinstatement or compensation of loyal public servants.  these could best be dealt with in the first instance by the ministerial group on Rhodesia which should meet as soon as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.SECRET10378 B
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that talks withthe Premier of the Associated State of St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla,Mr. Bradshaw, had now been concluded. We had made proposalsfor aid, and Mr. Bradshaw, for his part, had accepted theestablishment of a Commission. The main difficulty had been overthe Commission^ terms of reference. Mr. Bradshaw had at firstinsisted on wording which would have precluded the commission from recommending any separation of Anguilla from the AssociatedState. This we could not accept. Finally Mr. Bradshaw had agreedto a formula accepting that Anguilla was at present part of the associated State, referring to the danger of fragmentation in the carribbean, and permitting the Commission to take into account&quot; such other considerations as they considered pertinent&quot;. the definition of such matters would be for the Commission itself todetermine. The members of the Commission had not yet beenappointed, and it was unlikely that they would be until November.In discussion of administrative points, Mr. Bradshaw had been concerned to emphasise Anguilla&apos;s continuing membership ofthe Associated State and reluctant to make any concessions which might appear to prejudice this; however, mutuallysatisfactory arrangements had been agreed which, in the view ofHM Commissioner in Anguilla, would be acceptable to the islandersthemselves.In discussion attention was drawn to the risk that the commitment of troops and police for the maintenance of order inAnguilla might become of indefinite duration. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary said that although the situation was improving, it was not at present possible to put a term to the commitment. It would not be possible to effect any reductionsbefore December of this year. It was clearly desirable to reduceat any rate the police commitment and to replace the MetropolitanPolice contingent by a local force as soon as possible; but in Anguilla,as elsewhere in the Caribbean, there were difficulties in inducing thelocal people to serve in the police.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen a definite movement in favour of the enlargement of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.). Even the Gaullist candidatein the French Presidential elections, M. Pompidou, had feltcompelled to adopt a rather more forthcoming attitude on this issue.
Malaysia and singapore(previous reference:CC(69) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)CC 24 (69)In Germany, on the other hand, the enlargement of the e.c. andthe British candidature were unlikely to become an electoral issue,since all the principal political parties were in favour.In discussion the point was made that if there were any questionof winding up the Concorde project the best moment for an approach to the French might be immediately after a. victory by M. Poher inthe Presidential election.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that order hadbeen restored in Kuala Lumpur, but that the state of emergency was still in force. British subjects were in no difficulty. There was little evidence to support the allegations by the Prime Minister,Tunku Abdul Rahman, that Communists had been behind the recent disturbances. There had lately been two incidents in Singapore, andthe authorities there were watching the situation with some anxiety.The Cabinet-(3) Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.IndustrialRelationsIndustrialRelations Bill(previous reference:CC(69) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State about an Interim Bill on Industrial Relations(C (69)59).The First Secretary of State said that, while discussions were continuing with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) about proposalsfor dealing with unconstitutional strikes and inter-union disputes,it was not possible to reach decisions on these matters. But in orderto save time, she invited her colleagues to consider&quot; and approve theother relatively uncontroversial provisions of the proposed Bill whichhad been considered at length by the Ministerial Committee on industrial Relations. As regards enforcement of the right to belong to a trade union,. there was some disagreement in the industrial relations Committee as to whether the sanctions provided in theBill against an employer who prevented his employees belongingto a trade union should take the form of a fixed amount of damagespayable to the employee or of a penalty exacted by the State. she had now reached provisional agreement with the Law Officers thatthe better course was to provide that an employee who wasprevented or deterred from becoming a member of a trade union or penalised because he was a member-should be able to sue his employer for a fixed sum of  50 damages. As regards the applicationof the provisions of the Bill to thexCrown, she had reached provisional10378B 2
agreement with the Lord Privy Seal and the Law Officers that theprovisions should apply to Crown servants, though, not to the armed forces or the police.  She would be empowered to refer recognitionproblems involving Governmental Departments to the Commissionon Industrial Relations (CIR) and the recommendations of the CIRwould be binding on the Crown without the need for a formalOrder.  There were still some technical problems about applicationto the Crown which she would seek to resolve with the Lord privy seal. As regards penalties imposed in order to enforce any provisions relating  to  inter-union recognition  disputes,  there  had  beendisagreement in the Committee on Industrial Relations as to whetherthe maximum penalty imposed on a union should be the same,namely  10,000, as on an employer, or less.   In her opinion, itwould be difficult to justify a lower maximum penalty for tradeunions, particularly because, in the typical inter-union dispute, itcould generally be expected to be a trade union which would act in breach of any award, rather than an employer.  The President ofthe Industrial Board would be legally qualified and would be either the President or one of the independent members of the industrial court.   The Board&apos;s other members would be drawn from thelegally qualified independent members, the employer members, andthe employee members of the Industrial Court.   If the TUCcarried through their present intention of dissuading trade union representatives from sitting on the Industrial Board, this would leadto difficulties, but it should still prove possible to provide fully adequate employee representation.   Finally, agreement had beenreached with the Social Services Secretary to amend existing legislation so as to narrow the grounds on which an employee laidoff because of a strike might be denied  unemployment orsupplementary benefit.In discussion, it was suggested that it should only be necessaryto provide that an employer should not prevent an employee from becoming a trade union member; it was not necessary, as proposed,to deal also with deterrence or penalisation by the employer, and itwould be almost impossible to establish satisfactorily the facts ofsuch cases. There was general agreement that the maximum penaltywhich could be imposed in dealing with inter-union recognitiondisputes should be the same for employers and unions. Withregard to the change in the law relating to unemployment and supplementary benefit, it was argued that the opportunity shouldbe taken in the Industrial Relations Bill to amend the Ministry of social Security Act, 1966, so as to regularise the current practice of excluding Pay As You Earn (PAYE) refunds when calculatingsupplementary benefits due to strikers. The present practice, whichhad continued for some years, was inconsistent with the law andshould be regularised as soon as possible.
The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet approved generally the proposals in C (69) 59and its Annex. However, the First Secretary of State shouldspecifically invite the views of the&apos;TUC about her proposals inrelation to the right to join a trade union and report back to theCabinet, so that, in considering the final version of the Bill, theywould be able to decide whether it was necessary to go further thanplacing a statutory obligation on the employer not to preventmembership of a trade union. The First Secretary of State andthe Lord Privy Seal would seek to settle the problems still outstandingon the application of the Bill to Crown servants. The First Secretary. of State, the Social Services Secretary and the Attorney-general should consider further whether it Was essential to deal in the interimIndustrial Relations Bill with the current practice of excluding PA YErefunds, bearing in mind the need to keep the Bill as short and simple as possible.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (69) 59 and its Annex, subject to the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to seek the views of the tuc about the provisions giving a right to trade unionmembership, and to report back in due course.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State and the Lord privy seal to seek agreement on the remaining problems connected with the application of the interim Bill to theCrown.(4) Invite the First Secretary of State, the Social ServicesSecretary and the Attorney-General to consider further whether the interim Bill on Industrial Relations should include provisions regularising the existing practice of excluding PAYE refunds in calculating supplementary benefits for strikers.Discussions The Prime Minister said that he and the First Secretary of Stateolth had continued their discussions with representatives of the TradesRepresentatives TT .      - m.n, &quot; .        , Ttof the TUC     Union Congress  (TUC) on the previous day.    It was very(Previous       encouraging, as he had told the General Council, that the TUCReference:      had made more progress in the past month or so than in the previousCC (69) 23rd    forty years.  As regards inter-union disputes, the proposals of theMhuteS10nS&apos;    General Council in their report to the Special Congress on 5th June,mute 0&apos;       &quot; Programme for Action &quot;, now seemed satisfactory.   The first secretary of State had informed the TUC representatives that their proposals and those of the Government were complementary in this field: to the extent that the General Councils proposals operatedsatisfactorily, the Governmenfs statutory powers would not be
brought into operation. On unconstitutional strikes, the general council had made considerable progress. Paragraph 42 of&quot; Programme for Action&quot; now made it clear that the general council would require unions to satify the Council that they had done all that they could reasonably be expected to do to securecompliance with a Council recommendation or award. However,it was still not clear what practical steps the General Council wouldtake if an affiliated union failed to use all its powers to get members on unconstitutional strike back to work when the Council so ruled.There was no assurance that in such Circumstances the unions concerned would invariably use their full powers to obtain a returnto work, and this was the essential weakness of the present TTJCproposals. But the validity of the TUC proposals as a whole had ofcourse been thrown in doubt by the decision of the Executive ofthe Amalgamated Engineering and Foundry workers Union (AEF)not to support them. He and the First Secretary of State had made it clear that, if paragraph 42 of &quot; Programme for Action &quot; were amended so as to make clear that individual unions must proceedwith their full powers against unconstitutional strikers who refusedto comply with a General Council ruling that they should return towork, then they believed that the Government and the TUC wouldbe very close to agreement. It was not possible for the general council to amend their document before the Special Congress, but ithad been agreed that there should be a further meeting with theFirst Secretary of State and himself immediately after the SpecialCongress and before the First Secretary of State put her finalproposals for legislation to the Cabinet. It had also been made clear tothe General Council that he and the First Secretary of State would beprepared to continue discussions, if necessary, after the publication and Second Reading of the Bill, and indeed up to the committee stage, in an attempt to reach agreement. If the TUC providedreasonably satisfactory alternatives to the so-called &quot; penal clauses&quot;,it would still be necessary for the Government to consider whetherit would be necessary to take reserve statutory powers to be used only where the voluntary TUC scheme failed. In this respect, ithad to be borne in mind that the Acting General Secretary of the tuc had stated that a prerequisite for going ahead with &quot; programme for Action&quot; was that any new legislation introduced by theGovernment should not incorporate penal clauses on workers or trade unions. He had replied that the credibility of the tuc&apos;s&quot; Programme for Action&quot; in the eyes of the public would be completely undermined if the General Council were to maintain this position.In discussion, it was suggested that in view of the very substantial progress made by the TUC and their insistence that theywould not proceed with their programme if penal clauses were

The Cabinet had before them a draft, dated 20th May, 1969,Monetary Fund of ,the Letter of Intenit to ,the international Monetary Fund (IMF)Reference-      requesting a standby credit of $1,000 million.CC (69) 23rd The    Chancellor    of    the    Exchequer    said    that    heMinutel)118, t0ld   the   H0USC   0f   Commons   that   he   WOuld   publish the Letter of Intent when negotiations with the IMF had beencompleted.

Alternatively,if this view were not accepted, it would be preferable to delayintroduction of the interim Bill even at the cost of Parliamentsitting through August until negotiations had been completed,rather than take the second reading of a Bill including penalprovisions which might be substantially modified or dropped atCommittee stage. It was pointed out, on the other hand, that itwould be even more difficult to introduce penal provisions into aBill in the 1970-71 Sessions than it was to-day. And theabandonment of these provisions without a fully satisfactory TUCalternative would be a clear abdication of responsibility by theGovernment which would cast serious doubts at home and abroadon their continuing ability to govern.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would be invited to consider the proposed legislation afreshand in detail after the Special Congress of the TUC on 5th june and in the light of the further discussions which would then followbetween the General Council and the First Secretary of State and himself. Meanwhile, the General Council were in no doubt afterthe discussion yesterday of the very serious consequences if theGovernment and the TUC failed to reach agreement. The practicalvalue of the TUC proposals now depended essentially on the extentto which paragraph 42 of &quot; Programme for Action&quot; could be strengthened on lines which had been made clear to the general council, and on the reception which &quot; Programme for Action&quot;received at the Special Congress particularly from key unionssuch as the AEF.The Cabinet-(5) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
disclose its terms before then. We would have to make an initialdrawing of $500 million before the end of June. Thereafter heenvisaged that we would make drawings of around $200 million atroughly quarterly intervals. But we were not obliged to make these later drawings and it would be open to us not to make them if our economic situation improved very substantially or the outcome of any of the subsequent consultations with the IMF was unsatisfactory.The negotiations over the terms of the Letter had been difficult and protracted. The IMF had been anxious to include provisionsunder which automatic consultations could be triggered off by the behaviour of some previously determined set of economic indicators.They had, however, been persuaded to agree instead to regularconsultations which in his view had considerable presentationaladvantages for us. The most significant new feature of the letter was the emphasis placed on control over domestic credit expansion,the constituent parts of which were the Governments borrowingrequirements, the volume of bank lending to the private sector, andtransactions in gilt-edged securities with the non-banking sector.The Memorandum of Understanding attached to the Letter set out a quarterly path of domestic credit expansion which the government accepted as an objective; this path was in line with the Government^own forecasts. He proposed to disclose the existence of theMemorandum to Parliament, but to explain that for reasons connected with the management of the market in government securities the text would not be published. The undertakings givenin the Letter about domestic credit expansion would not of themselvesaffect credit for exports, though it must be recognisedthat all forms of credit would be very tight in the coming year.The reference in the Letter to trade liberalisation restated theGovernments present policy. There could be no question of introducing import restrictions before we made the initial drawingfrom the standby credit at the end of June. Thereafter, leaving aside the economic and political arguments for and against suchaction, it would be open to us to introduce restrictions if we wereprepared to forgo any further drawings. This would, however,provoke a serious reaction from the IMF, who attached greatimportance to the maintenance of liberal trade policies. In themeantime it was essential that Ministers should reaffirm, as occasionarose, that it was the Governments policy to maintain the presentdegree of trade liberalisation.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the terms of the draft Letter of Intent, whichhad been negotiated with considerable skill, and agreed that theChancellor of the Exchequer should send it to the IMF later that day.
confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland about the procedurenecessary to secure the permanent abolition of capital punishment for murder (C (69) 48).The Home Secretary said that, under Section 4 of the Murder(Abolition of Death Penalty) Act, 1965, the Act would expire after31st July, 1970, unless Parliament otherwise determined by affirmative resolutions of each House. If the Act expired the Homicide Act,1957, would revive. The case for the abolition of capital punishmentwas a moral one and it was for those who wished to restore capital punishment to prove their case. But there was in fact no conclusive evidence that capital punishment was a unique deterrent, nor were such figures as were available for recorded offences of murder since1957, still less those since 1965, a sufficient basis on which to rest acase. In any event the available figures must be taken with cautionbecause changes in the law relating to the nature of the offence of murder, and in particular the introduction of the defence ofdiminished responsibility, meant that comparisons between variousrelevant periods had to be based on estimates of a jury&apos;s decision on matters which were not in fact put to them. It was possible thatthe abolition of capital punishment increased both the willingness ofthe accused to confess to murder and the willingness of juries toconvict. Moreover, while there had been an upward trend in thenumber of recorded murders, the increase had occurred beforeabolition and was not necessarily to be attributed to it.If the Cabinet agreed that abolition should be made permanentthe questions for consideration were whether the Government shouldtake the initiative in moving the resolutions required by Section 4of the Act, and when they should do so. He and the Secretary ofState for Scotland both considered that, although the 1965 Act hadbeen sponsored by a Private Member and opinion an the country at large was probably against abolition, it would be right for theGovernment to take the initiative, but it would be in accordancewith tradition to allow a free vote.As to the timing of the resolutions, there was no reason why they should not be moved well in advance of July, 1970, and therewould be advantage in their being moved in the autumn of 1969.If the two Houses came to different decisions neither could be askedSECRETThe Cabinet-(1) Approved the terms of the draft Letter of Intent.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to send the Letterof Intent to the IMF later that day.
to reverse its decision in the same Session. Rejection by one Houseat the beginning of the 1969-70 Session would leave time for legislation to rectify the position, for example by continuing the-effect of the Act temporarily, but to move the resolutions at the endof the present Session would allow the Government the opportunityto ask either House to reverse its decision in the following Session.The Secretaries of State therefore recommended that the Governmentshould take the initiative in moving affirmative resolutions in theautumn of 1969, and they would welcome their colleagues&apos; views on,whether it would be better to do so at the end of the present Sessionor at the beginning of next Session.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould take whatever initiative was considered appropriate. It wassuggested, however, that in order to remove controversy about theAct from the period preceding the General Election, it might bedesirable to seek the extension of the Act for three years rather than to move a resolution to secure the permanent abolition of capital&apos;punishment. If the Government sought to bring forward the date at which Parliament was asked for a final decision, the Governmenfscritics could argue that they had curtailed the experimental periodprovided by Section 4 of the Act. On the other hand, it was argued that if a final decision was postponed until after the next GeneralElection the issue would remain a topic of lively political controversy. Moreover, it was not clear whether an extension ofthe experimental period could be effected by a simple resolutionunder the Act, as the authorities of both Houses of Parliamentbelieved, or whether an extension would require legislation, whichthe Attorney-General thought to be the sounder opinion. If there remained doubt as to whether an extension of the experimental period by resolution was valid, there was a risk that a court mighthold that the resolution was invalid and that the Homicide Act,1957, had revived. This could occur, for example, where the accusedhad been convicted of two murders on separate occasions, since the judge would then be bound, if he held that the Homicide Act was infact in operation, to sentence him to capital punishment. In sucha case it was essential for doubt to be avoided. On balance, therefore,it would be better to move a resolution towards the end of thepresent Session to secure the permanent operation of the provisionsabolishing capital punishment.In further discussion it was suggested that the Government wouldbe wise not to rely too strongly on the argument that the case against capital punishment was entirely a moral one. capital punishment was still retained for treason and for certain offencesin the face of the enemy, and its appropriateness as a penalty couldbe said to be to some extent dependent on the seriousness of the offence in the light of the surrounding circumstances.
CC 24 (69)The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the proposals put forward by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland in C (69) 48. they considered that the resolutions necessary to continue the abolition ofcapital punishment permanently should be moved in the spilloverperiod of the present Session. Their decision should, however,remain confidential for the time being.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C (69) 48.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland to move the resolutions required to continuethe abolition of capital punishment permanently duringthe spillover period towards the end of the present session.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd May, 1969.
