CC 15(69)CONFIDENTIALPolitical l.  The Cabinet discussed the current political situation; theSituation conclusions reached were recorded separately and copies werecirculated only to The Queen and the Prime Minister. A copy is kept in the standard file of the Secretary of the Cabinet.Prices andIncomesPolicyNBPI Reporton top salaries(previous reference:GG (69) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)10360CONFIDENTIAL2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that in view ofthe critical attitude adopted by public opinion, particularly withinthe Parliamentary Labour Party, towards the proposals in the recently published report of the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) about top salaries, he had arranged for the deferment of the public announcement on the subject which theCabinet had approved at an earlier meeting in order that ministers might have an opportunity to reconsider the issues involved. these had been discussed by the Ministers primarily concerned; and itwas now proposed that a compromise should be adopted and announced by the First Secretary of State in the House of commons that day in the terms of the draft which she had circulated to theCabinet at the outset of their discussion.On the basis of this compromise the Government would acceptthe conclusions of the NBPI as regards top salaries in private industryand, in particular, would undertake to consider, in consultation withthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC), the reference to the Board of salary structures of individual firms. As regards the recommendations of the Board inrelation to top salaries in the nationalised industries, the Governmentwould accept the Board&apos;s general conclusion that the present top salaries were too low; they would endorse in principle the Board&apos;sproposals to remedy this situation; and they would agree that those proposals should be implemented as soon as the requirements of incomes policy allowed. In present circumstances, however, it wouldnot be practicable to increase the salaries in question by an amount in excess of the per cent ceiling prescribed by current prices and incomes policy; and, although the Board&apos;s proposals for increases in the salaries of the Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen and members ofthe Boards of nationalised industries as from 1st April, 1969, fell within this ceiling and could therefore be implemented, the further increases in their salaries which the Board recommended for implementation in April 1970 and April 1971, would need to beconsidered in the light of developments in the prices and incomes policy over the next two years. The Government would accordinglyreview the situation in the light of those developments.
In discussion, it was suggested that the Government must adoptone of three possible courses of action. They could adhere to their original decision to accept the NBPI recommendations on salarylevels in the nationalised industries, including the dates on which thethree successive instalments recommended by the Board would bepaid. Or they could adopt the compromise now under discussion,whereby the Government would endorse the first instalment proposed for 1st April, 1969, but would reserve their position as regards anyfurther increases during the next two years. Or they could decide that in present circumstances it was inopportune for the time being to permit increases in the salaries concerned, and could defer actionon the Board&apos;s recommendations to some later date. Some supportwas expressed for the first course, particularly on the grounds thatthe increases proposed by the NBPI were unquestionably within thelimits of the prices and incomes policy and that there could be no advantage in either deferring a decision to accept and to implementthem or in seeking some compromise which had no logical basis.On the other hand, the reaction of public opinion to the NBPIreport had been adverse; and there was no doubt that the anxietiesexpressed at a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour party had accurately reflected a widespread feeling that it would be wrong to concede such large increases in top salaries at a time when theGovernment were requiring workers to show the utmost restraint inrelation to increases in wages. In view of the importance ofmaintaining adequate differentials in salary structures it would beimpossible to ignore the fact that the salaries in question had notbeen increased since 1964 and to limit the increases to 3  per centas from a current date; and on balance the least disadvantageouscourse appeared to lie in adopting the compromise proposed by theFirst Secretary of State.In further discussion it was suggested that on this basis the presentation of the decision would be improved if the statement werecouched throughout, so far as possible, in terms of annual, ratherthan cumulative, rates of increase, since the former would be seen to be well within the limits prescribed by the current prices and incomes policy. At the same time the statement should avoid anywording which might inhibit the Governments freedom of actionin subsequent years and should therefore merely indicate that itwould be wrong to endorse increases in top salaries in nationalised industries which might be represented as inconsistent with the prices and incomes policy, without stipulating any specific ceiling for thispurpose in subsequent years.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the majority of the Cabinet favoured action on the lines proposed by the First Secretary of State, subject to the points which:had been made.
ParliamentaryAffairsAllegedDisclosureof BudgetInformation(previous reference:CC (69) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)Parliament(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 13thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet, at their previous meeting, had invited him to give further consideration tothe question whether, and if so when, an opportunity should beprovided for the House of Commons to debate the report of theSelect Committee on Vehicle Excise Duty (Allegations). Havingdone so, he was of the opinion that the report should not be debated.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should not table a Motion onthe report of the Select Committee on Vehicle ExciseDuty (Allegations).The Cabinet were informed that the debate on the committee stage of the Parliament (No. 2) Bill would be resumed on 14th April.Thereafter it would be convenient if the Ministers concerned would consider the progress made and make recommendations to theCabinet on the future handling of the Bill.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committeeon the House of Lords to consider after 14th April theprogress made by the Parliament (No. 2) Bill and toreport their recommendations to the next meeting of theCabinet.OverseaAffairsAnguilla(previous reference:CC (69) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)secret.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit to Anguilla of Lord Caradon, the United Kingdom special representative at the United Nations, had produced a much betteratmosphere on the island and had given us the breathing space were quired to enable us to consider the future position of Anguilla, itsrelationship to St. Kitts and our policy in the Caribbean generally.However, the internal situation still gave some cause for anxiety.10360A 3The Cabinet-Agreed that the First Secretary of State should announce in the House of Commons that day the government&apos;s decision on the report of the National Board for prices and Incomes about top salaries on the lines which sheproposed, subject to the points made in their discussion.
Lord Caradon had confirmed that there had been intimidation, andthat it was continuing last week. Hidden stocks of arms might wellexist. Though there had been some deficiencies in our intelligence,the correctness of our original assessment that Mr. Webster and the extremists did not command overwhelming support had on the wholebeen borne out. One of the two companies of paratroops had alreadyleft, and the position in regard to further withdrawals would be assessed again when the officials who had accompanied Lord Caradonreturned in a few days&apos; time. The Royal Engineers and the Policecontingent would remain for the time being. The reaction ofMr. Bradshaw, the Premier of the Associated States of St. Kitts,Nevis and Anguilla, to our intervention had inevitably been adverse.So far he had not made a public statement, and we were doing our best to restrain him from doing so. Controversy might flare up if mr. Bradshaw came out in open opposition to our action, and he might attempt to dispute its legality. This, however, rested on theOrder in Council which did not require the Premiers consent; andin the last resort, he might have to be told that Anguilla was our responsibility and not his. The basic anomaly was inherent in theConstitution of the Associated States which was not really workablein the kind of conditions which had arisen. So far as the future was concerned, the main hope lay in involving our Caribbean partners in the problem to the extent possible, but they were themselvesdivided on the best long-term solution. Lord Caradon had already made a tentative suggestion for a Caribbean Commission withrepresentatives of the independent Caribbean States and of the associated States. This seemed to be a promising line to follow.It was also for consideration whether we might appoint aBritish Special Representative for the Caribbean with functionsapproximating to those discharged by Mr. Malcolm MacDonald in east Africa.In discussion there was general agreement that the ideaof a United Kingdom Special Representative merited furtherconsideration. It was also agreed that developments since ourlanding in Anguilla had shown that the intelligence on which theoriginal decision had been based had been deficient in a number ofrespects. This was however to some extent due to financial stringency, which had limited the scale of our representation in thearea, and also to the fact that with the change in their status as the carribbean territories attained either full independence or associatedstatehood, British representatives no longer had the same access to information. These and other questions could be investigated on thereturn to London of the senior officials from the Foreign and commonwealth Office who had accompanied Lord Caradon. Therewas general agreement that Lord Caradon had discharged a difficultmission with great skill.
secret the Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;sstatement and the points made in discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to convey to Lord Caradon an expression of their appreciation ofthe manner in which he had discharged his task in the carribbean.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, barringunforeseen developments, the Four Power talks on the Arab/Israelproblem would begin that afternoon. The Security Council had passed a resolution about the incident at Es-Salt which was unsatisfactory to us in that it was more condemnatory of Israel thanthe facts and the general background warranted. We and othershad therefore abstained. It was unlikely, however, that this would prevent the Four-Power talks from proceeding. The United states had produced a document as a basis for discussion which showed a greater measure of agreement between the Four Powers than had at first seemed likely, but a considerable gulf still remained to bebridged.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that we should avoid pronouncing judgment publicly on the merits of the new government of Pakistan. The United Kingdom had signed anagreement with the new Government on a minor matter on which negotiations had been proceeding before the change. The PrimeMinister had also sent a message to the new Administration, whichwas thus being treated as the effective Government of Pakistan. Nofurther formal act of recognition appeared to be necessary. Therewas no doubt that the new Administration was iri effective controlof the country; and for the present, at any rate, there seemed to beno cause for anxiety about the safety of British subjects.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the formerHead of State of Ghana, General Ankrah, had been forced to resignfor taking bribes; and had been succeeded by Brigadier Afrifa whoappeared to be well disposed towards Britain.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit to London of President Hamani Diori of Niger had gone well.President Diori was a strong supporter of the Federal nigerian government and of our policy towards it.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in Vietnamthe Communist offensive was still continuing but that its pace hadslackened. Recently the South Vietnam Premier, General Thieu,had made a somewhat surprising statement about his willingness to engage in private talks with the Vietnamese National LiberationFront. The latter&apos;s reply had been abusive but had not constitutedan outright refusal.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the further statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.confidential.   The Prime Minister said that his colleagues would havelearned from the statement which he had made in the House ofCommons on the previous day the main impressions which he had formed as a result of his visit to Nigeria and Ethiopia.  But it was perhaps worth emphasising that he had been particularly struck bythe attitude of General Gowon, the Head of the Federal military government, who, although still young and relatively inexperienced,was a man of great sincerity and deep religious conviction.  Therewas no doubt that in prosecuting the war he was, determined toavoid as far as possible any action which was likely to increase thedifficulty of promoting an eventual reconciliation between the Ibopeople and the rest of Nigeria.   The fact that he was ready tofacilitate relief supplies for the rebel territories, even though he knew that they provided a means by which additional arms could alsoreach the rebels, was a reliable indication of his generosity of spirit;and his readiness to appoint Ibos to important positions in his administration was additional evidence to the same effect.  It was equally clear that the non-Ibo peoples in the areas which the federal government had liberated from the rebels would not be preparedto accept any restoration of Ibo authority in view of the atrocitieswhich the Ibo leaders had perpetrated while they held the territory;and there was little doubt that the eventual solution of the conflictmust be found in the concept of a united Nigeria, based on the12 States into which it was now divided. There was little prospect,however, that such a settlement would be easily or rapidly achieved.The differences between the Federal Government and the rebels were still too wide; and there were no grounds for confidence that theformer would be able to bring the war to a rapid conclusion byachieving a military victory, in view of the relatively low standardof efficiency of their commanders and the lack of adequateco-ordination of their operations in the field.   On the other hand
his discussions with the Emperor of Ethiopia had suggested certainlines of approach to the problem which might make it possible toarrange for discussions between the two sides to be started; and,if these could be conducted in the context of a cease-fire combined with an arms embargo, they might lead on to a more prolongedcessation of hostilities, which could both facilitate the distributionof supplies for relief and rehabilitation and provide a foundation for a permanent political settlement. In these circumstances it wasthe more unfortunate that he had failed to meet the rebel leader,Colonel Ojukwu, with whom he had wished to discuss the problemon the same basis as with General Gowon. Despite the misleadingaccounts of this episode which Colonel Ojukwu&apos;s representatives inLondon were now disseminating, the failure of the attempt toarrange a meeting rested with Colonel Ojukwu himself.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd April, 1969.
