Productivity,Prices and incomes PolicyDraft white paper(previous reference:CC (69) 57thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary of Stateand Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity (C (69) 165)attaching a proof copy of a White Paper on Productivity, Prices and incomes after 1969, together with drafts of Sections F and G of theWhite Paper, dealing respectively with Guidance on Prices and charges and Guidance in Relation to Dividends.The First Secretary of State said that the proof text of the white paper incorporated most of the amendments which had been agreed by the Sub-Committee on Future Prices and Incomes Policy (PI (F)).One or two further drafting amendments agreed by PI (F) wouldappear in the final printed version, together with some minor stylisticchanges. The Sub-Committee had asked that Section F should be redrafted; it had been left blank in the printed proof and she nowinvited her colleagues to adopt the text of this section, attached toC (69) 165, which had been agreed among the Departments most directly concerned.The Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) had been consulted about an earlier draft ofthe White Paper. The TUC opposed in principle the government&apos;s decision to base its policy in the next phase on the activation of thestatutory powers provided under Part II of the Prices and incomes act, 1966; they had made no comments on the detailed text of thedraft White Paper. However, in the course of a comparatively quietmeeting, they had, like the CBI, shown interest in the proposed new commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM), although they realised that its powers would not be settled by the time the white paper was published. While the TUC thought the draft White Paperconcentrated to an excessive degree on restraint in incomes, the CBIhad argued that it did the same in regard to price increases. The CBIhad asked in particular for the exclusion from the &quot; early warning &quot;arrangements of products subject to competitive forces, and for the deletion from the text of the current list of products covered by these arrangements (in Appendix 2). She proposed to accept the latterrequest; and to go some way to meet the former by making a reference in the White Paper to the need for reviewing the early warningarrangements when the CIM was established.The Sub-Committee had agreed that some changes should bemade in the Section of the White Paper giving guidance on dividends.She accordingly proposed the adoption of the text of Section Gattached to C (69) 165 in place of that incorporated in the printedproof of the White Paper.10683
In discussion of Section E of the draft White Paper on Guidancefor Pay Negotiations, and in particular of paragraphs 92 to 96 on pay in the public services, it was pointed out that the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes had agreed on 4th December that,to avoid a conflict with the proposed norm of 2\ to A\ per cent, schoolteachers in England and Wales should be offered an increase of no more than  75 a year, which was equivalent to A\ per cent. If in thenear future the Government expected to have to concede public sectorpay increases above A\ per cent, it would be necessary that theprovisions in the White Paper for exceptions to the norm shouldbe so drawn as to authorise increases of this nature. It might indeed be necessary to specify that, as incomes policy had been morerigorously applied in the public than the private sector in recent years,exceptional treatment would be given to the former in the next phase of the policy so as to allow some readjustment of the balance. Thiswould be preferable to the alternative of specifying no norm and merely laying down principles for determining pay increases. It mightbe appropriate in some instances, such as teachers&apos; pay, to take account of increases in the cost of living; but this was not admissibleunder present policy, since after the devaluation of sterling in 1967a substantial rise in prices had been expected and it had beenconsidered necessary to ensure that incomes did not follow suit.In further discussion of paragraphs 92 to 96 of the draft white paper, it was agreed that at the end of paragraph 94, mention shouldbe made of the special conditions applying to the determination of pay for the Armed Forces, which were the subject of a standing referenceto the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI). It was also agreed that in paragraph 95 a reference should be made to thepossibility of using management techniques to improve efficiency inthe nationalised industries, even where increased pay could not be directly linked to increased efficiency.In further discussion of the draft White Paper, the followingpoints were made Section B Review of the Operation of the Policy(a) In paragraph 6, the phrase &quot; deliberately stimulated &quot; in thefourth sentence should be omitted.(b) the accuracy of the reference in the fifth sentence to therelative size of the overseas deficit in 1964 should be checked.Section D The Framework of the Policy(c) Although it would not be acceptable to review immediately the &quot; early warning &quot; list in order to remove products subject tocompetitive forces, as the CBI had requested an amendment shouldbe made to add at the end of paragraph 31 the following:
&quot; The Government considers that it would be right for thepresent arrangements to continue unchanged, or with only minor modifications, in the period until the establishment of the CIM. it proposes, however, to review the arrangements for early warningwith those concerned in the context of the establishment of the CIMin order to make appropriate longer term arrangements.&quot;This amendment would soften the Governmenfs rejection of theCBFs request.Section E Guidance for Pay Negotiations(d) The phrase &quot; or indeed below it&quot; should be deleted from paragraph 37, since settlements below the 2\ per cent lower limit ofthe range for pay increases were not very likely.(e) Paragraph 49 on national as distinct from local payagreements should be amended to indicate that a national agreement which could be satisfactorily linked with productivity improvements(especially where, as in the nationalised industries, there was only asingle employer) was acceptable.(/) Paragraph 71 should end at the phrase &quot; giving priority to thelow paid &quot;.(g) Paragraph 90 should include a statement that, even wherecomparisons with other workers were relevant to fixing pay levels,pay increases should wherever possible be linked to improvements in productivity.Section F Guidance for Determining Prices and Charges(h) In paragraph 1 of the new draft of this section circulated with C (69) 165, in the second sentence, &quot;most industries aredominated . . .&quot; should be altered to &quot; many industries are dominated. . .&quot; and the third sentence should be amended to read &quot; Indeed thereare many parts of the economy in which conditions of even nearperfect competition do not exist &quot;.(i) In paragraph 7 of the same passage, the phrase &quot; and applied &quot;should be deleted from the second sentence.Section G Guidance in Relation to Dividends(/&apos;) The last sentence of paragraph 5 of the new draft of thissection circulated with C (69) 165 should be revised since it was notaccurate as it stood.Appendix 2 Arrangements for Notifying Proposed Price Increases(k) To meet the CBFs request, the Appendix should be revised to omit the lists in Parts B, C and D.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet wished the passage on public sector pay in Section E of thedraft White Paper to be revised so as to indicate that all relevant factors should be taken into account in determining the pay of thosepublic servants who had no counterparts in the private sector withwhich direct pay comparisons could be made. The Cabinet agreedthat, in such circumstances, the cost of living might be one factor tobe taken into account; but no mention of this should be made in theWhite Paper. The revision of paragraphs 92 to 96, on which the first secretary of State should consult Ministers directly concerned, shouldtake account also of the points made in discussion on paragraphs 94and 95. Sections F and G of the White Paper should be based onthe new drafts circulated by the First Secretary of State with c (69) 165. Amendments should be made to the various Sections ofthe draft to cover the points made in discussion at (a) to (/c) above.Subject to these changes, the Cabinet agreed that the White paper should be published at 3.30 p.m. on Thursday, 11th December. TheOrder activating Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966, shouldbe laid before the Houses of Parliament at the end of business that day (8th December), with a view to consideration on 9th Decemberby the House of Commons Statutory Instruments Committee and a debate in the House of Commons on 16th December. The cabinet agreed that the name of the new body to take the place of the NBPIand the Monopolies Commission should be &quot; the Commission for industry and Manpower &quot;.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up by the PrimeMinister.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) in consultation with the Secretary of State for education and Science, the Lord Privy Seal, theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister ofState, Department of Health and Social Security,to amend the draft White Paper on Productivity,Prices and Incomes Policy after 1969 on the lines indicated in the summing up by the Prime Minister;(ii) to arrange for publication of the White Paper in themanner indicated in the summing up by the PrimeMinister;(iii) in consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Lord Privy Seal, to arrange to lay theOrder under Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act,1966, before the Houses of Parliament as indicatedin the Prime Minister^ summing up.
Continuanceof the Murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act, 1965(previous reference:CC(69) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 59 (69)confidential. The Home Secretary said that he remained convinced thatthere were overwhelming arguments in favour of the early introductionof Resolutions to make the Continuance of the Murder (Abolition of death Penalty) Act, 1965, permanent. There was no need to wait for further figures to become available; while too much relianceshould not be placed on statistics when such small numbers were involved, the figures published in the Home Office research study&quot; Murder: 1957 to 1968 &quot; would certainly not support the argument that the suspension of the death penalty had resulted in a substantial increase in the number of murders. To extend the five-year trial period by 18 months, as Mr. Quintin Hogg had suggested, would notin his view prevent capital punishment from becoming an electionissue. He could see no merit in extending the period for another fiveyears since at the end of this further period capital punishment was likely to be just as controversial an issue as it was now. If, however,the Resolution was defeated in the House of Lords, there might wellbe a case for introducing a short Bill extending the Act of 1965 fora further period of years; and it would be open to the Governmentto do this if they wished.In discussion it was generally agreed that if a decision on thepermanent abolition of capital punishment were postponed it wouldcertainly become a subject of controversy at the General Election.It was suggested that no reference should be made in the debate tothe possibility that the Government might introduce new legislationif the Resolution were defeated. It would be better to confrontParliament with a choice between the permanent abolition of capital punishment and a return to the provisions of the Homicide Act, 1957.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their previous decision that Resolutions to makepermanent the Continuance of Murder (Abolition of death Penalty) Act, 1965, should be moved in Parliamenttowards the end of the year.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Lord Privy Seal,to arrange for Resolutions to be tabled later that day inaccordance with (1) above; and for the Opposition to beinformed of the Government^ intention that theResolutions should be debated in both Houses ofParliament on Wednesday, 17th December.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1969.
