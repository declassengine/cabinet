secret. The Cabinet were informed that the printing of Bills andOrder Papers had been delayed by an unofficial strike at her majesty&apos;s Stationery Office. The men had returned to work that morning but as the problems underlying the strike had not yet been resolved difficulties could recur.The Debate on the Address would occupy the House ofCommons until Tuesday, 4th November. The debate on the first two days would be general. The Opposition had made it clear thatthey wished to debate foreign affairs on Thursday, 30th October.The subjects of debates on the other days would not be knownbefore 27th October.The Lord President reported that the group of Ministers under his chairmanship had considered the situation arising from the Houseof Lords&apos; decision on 16th October to insist on their amendments tothe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill. they recommended that draft Orders in Council for the four countriesbe laid on Thursday, 30th October, and debated in the week beginning 10th November. The form of the Motion required furtherconsideration, in consultation with the House of Commonsauthorities.In discussion the general view of the Cabinet was that it wouldbe preferable to lay the Orders on the day Parliament reassembled;this would accord better with the undertakings which the HomeSecretary had given and would also be likely to attract less publicity,since the Press would be preoccupied with The Queen&apos;s Speech.The Secretary of State for Scotland should make a statement on theScottish Order on 31st October and should provide the PrimeMinister with a form of words which he could use if the matter were raised by the Leader of the Opposition during the Debate onthe Address.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the draft Orders in Council to give effect to thereports of the Boundary Commission should be laid on tuesday, 28th October.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to make astatement in the House of Commons on Friday,31st October, about the Scottish Order.
Continuance ofthe Murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act 1965(previous reference :CC (69) 46thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet were informed that the Home Office StatisticalUnit had prepared and were about to publish an evaluation of the statistical evidence relevant to the abolition of the death penalty.As the Leader of the Opposition had recently proposed that acommittee of three impartial experts, under the chairmanship ofa judge, should be appointed to evaluate the evidence, there mightbe advantage in informing him of the impending publication and suggesting that this might meet the need which he had in mind. on balance however it seemed that the better course was to publishfirst and await reactions.National The Cabinet agreed that the terms of abatement applicable toSuperannuation persons contracting out of the earnings-related pensions scheme(Previous) should be announced on Tuesday, 4th November.   A statementpreference *CC (69) 49th should be issued at the same time explaining the effect of theConclusions, proposals on members of public sector pension schemes.Minute 5)Cyclamates The Minister of Agriculture said that he had received the viewsof the Pharmacology Sub-Committee of the Committee on theMedical Aspects of Food Policy about the evidence on which theUnited States Government^ recent decision to ban the use ofcyclamates was based. The Sub-Committee were not convincedthat the new information from the United States provided conclusive evidence against the use of cyclamates. They accepted that it wouldbe prudent to ban their use in food; but if the doubts about them could be resolved by the results of further work, they would see no reason why the use of cyclamates should not be allowed again.They saw no grounds for requiring stocks of food containingcyclamates to be destroyed or withdrawn. After consultation withthe Secretary of State for Social Services he proposed to introduceregulations prohibiting the further use of cyclamates in food and drink and providing that no food or drink containing cyclamatescould be sold after 1st January, 1970.In discussion there was general agreement that, despite the limited nature of the experiment on which the United StatesGovernmenfs decision was based, there was no alternative to introducing a ban as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture. Toencourage the early withdrawal from the market of existing stocksit might be helpful to discuss with the manufacturers the possibilityof publishing a list of branded products containing cyclamates.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the Minister of Agriculture^statement.
RabiesOverseaAffairsFederalRepublicof Germany(previous reference:CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 1)SomaliaSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatHen- Willy Brandt had been elected Chancellor of the federal republic of Germany by two votes more than the requisite 50 percent plus one of the membership of the Bundestag. Prospects forthe stability of the Government appeared to be reasonably good,since the Free Democratic Party, who had done badly in the recentgeneral elections, were unlikely to wish to provoke new ones. Thenew Foreign Minister, Herr Scheel, had spoken of continuity inforeign policy, though this had been somewhat qualified by herr Brandt&apos;s statements on relations with Poland and Germansignature of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. In general, the new government might be expected to make a more vigorous effort thanits predecessors to come to terms with the East, and to be somewhatfirmer in its support of the British application for membership ofthe European Economic Community: but it was more a matter of differences in emphasis than of any fundamental change in basicpolicy. The members of the new Government were on the wholewell disposed towards the United Kingdom, and the outlook for Anglo-German relations appeared to be good.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePresident of Somalia had recently been assassinated. The assassinhad been a policeman and his act did not appear to have beenpolitically motivated. Subsequently and not necessarily as a resultof the assassination there had been a coup d&apos;etat. This had followeda familiar pattern in that the coup had been carried out by junior officers, some of whom had received training in the Soviet Union,with the head of the Army as a figurehead: Not much was knownas yet about the probable orientation of the new Administration:but the previous Somali Government had made a genuine attemptto improve relations with Kenya and Ethiopia, and it was to be11471-1The Minister of Agriculture said that rabies had been diagnosedin a dog which had recently been released after undergoing sixmonths&apos; quarantine in this country. He was considering what further action could be taken to minimise the risk of further outbreaks of rabies; this might involve stringent measures and he would informthe Cabinet of his conclusions.The Cabinet (4) Took note that the Minister of Agriculture would informthe Cabinet in due course of any further action to betaken to minimise the risk of rabies.
Middle East:The LebanonChileNigeria(previous reference :CC (69) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)hoped that this would continue. A decision would have to be takenshortly on recognition of the new regime: it was unlikely that recognition would be long delayed.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theLebanese Government had been having difficulty in suppressing theactivities of Arab guerillas (the Fedayyin). Their attempts to do sohad brought hostile reactions from Libya, Syria and Iraq. TheUnited States Government had approached us, expressing their concern and enquiring our views on what could be done to prevent a further deterioration in the situation. The Americans had however made no specific proposals.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that ChileanForeign Minister, Senor Valdes, had recently paid a successful visit to London during which agreements had been signed on anglo-Chilean trade and the peaceful uses of atomic energy.During the visit there had been a revolt by two regiments of the chilean Army: but this had been concerned mainly with pay andconditions, and did not appear to have a political background. the case with which it had been suppressed might well have strengthenedthe position of the Chilean Government. Advantage had beentaken of the visit to explain our position on Gibraltar, on whichthe Chilean Government had consistently sided with Spain at theUnited Nations. The Chileans had not attempted to dispute thelogic of our case, but it was evident that their sympathies, like thoseof the rest of Latin America, lay with Spain, despite the fact thatthey had themselves rebelled against Spanish rule and had, indeed,obtained their independence with British help.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen no major change in the situation, but that there were reports offurther attempts to bring about a dialogue between the two sidesthrough the Organisation of African Unity. The Liberian Presidentof the United Nations General Assembly had been contemplatingvisiting Nigeria, but had been dissuaded from doing so by the africans themselves.The Cabinet Took note of the statementsCommonwealth Secretary.by   the  Foreign  andIndustrialAffairsSECRET*3. The Cabinet heard a report from the First Secretary of state on industrial affairs.
The First Secretary of State said that the unofficial strike at Standard-Triumph&apos;s Liverpool factory gave cause for serious concern. The strike did not arise from any failure on the managements part to operate procedures speedily; and it was not due primarily to the militancy of shop stewards. The indicationswere that it simply reflected a mood of near-anarchy on the shopfloor. The Chairman of British Leyland Motors, Lord Stokes, with whom she had discussed the matter earlier in the day, was disposed to stand firm until the men went back to work in order to demonstrate that unofficial action did not always pay. She had nottried to discourage him in this; but she had emphasised that itmight involve a prolonged stoppage and had suggested that before deciding to adopt this policy the company should be quite clearhow long they could afford to go on with it. If they were notprepared to stand a long strike it might be better to make concessions now, in which case a Court of Inquiry might have ahelpful part to play. In the face of opposition from the transport and General Workers&apos; Union and the Amalgamated engineering and Foundry Workers&apos; Union, whose officials had made no realeffort to get the men back to work, the Trades Union Congress(TUC) could do little to help: though if the strike were prolongedthe mood of the other unions represented on the General council might change. Moreover, experience showed that the TUC, if theydid intervene, would almost certainly try to conciliate instead ofsimply fulfilling their undertaking to get the men back to work sothat negotiations could be resumed under the agreed procedures.In discussion general concern was expressed at the deterioratingcondition of industrial relations, which amounted in some industries to a total abdication of responsibility on the part of individualworkers. This was not confined to manufacturing industry or tothe private sector. The success achieved by the dustmen in their recent unofficial action had been noted by many other sections ofthe community which had no history of militancy, including nurses,firemen, teachers and industrial workers in the Civil Service. Paywas not the only issue involved; in some cases considerations ofstatus, morale and conditions of work were equally important. the causes of unrest among these and other groups were complex. Theyincluded dissatisfaction with the operation of incomes policy which many people in the public services considered inequitable; and a widespread feeling that in many occupations family men who dida conscientious job of work were only marginally better off thanthose who preferred to remain unemployed. These considerationsmight seem to point to some relaxation in incomes policy, especially as it affected the relevant groups in the public service; but the serious
budgetary and other problems posed by even the present rate of growth of incomes must not be overlooked.In further discussion attention was drawn to the risk of periodiclightning strikes on the London underground system during thewinter months. These could lead to serious dislocation of surfacetraffic and contingency plans for dealing with it should be put inhand.The Prime Minister, summing up, said that the discussionreflected the Cabinefs deep concern at the deteriorating conditionof industrial relations. The General Council of the TUC had been told during the previous day&apos;s discussions on the recent changesin the machinery of government that the Government would want to meet them again to consider the problem of unofficial strikes.As a first step he would arrange to see the Chairman of the general council and the General Secretary of the TUC with the first secretary to obtain their assessment of the extent and reasons forthe deterioration in industrial relations, including the growth ofmilitancy on the shop floor, and to examine with them the reasonsfor their inability to live up to the undertakings which they had given in the summer.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof Transport, to arrange for contingency plans to beprepared for dealing with traffic dislocation arising fromstrikes on the London underground system.SECRETEducation 4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of reorganisation State for Education and Science (C (69) 145) on the reorganisation of Secondary    of sec0ndary schools.schools the Secretary of State for Education and Science said that theprovisions to be included in the Bill now being drafted had beenapproved in detail by the Ministerial Committee on Social services on 12th May, 1969; and he was bringing them before the Cabinetin response to the request made during the discussion on the queen&apos;s Speech on 14th October (CC (69) 48th Conclusions,Minute 4). In his view the movement towards comprehensivesecondary education would be seen as one of the biggest reformsintroduced by the present Government. Considerable progress hadbeen made since local education authorities were asked in July1965 to submit plans for reorganising secondary education oncomprehensive lines; but the drive was losing momentum and there
LocatGovernmentReorganisationin Wales(previous reference:CC(69) 46thConclusions,Minute 6)secret. The Secretary of State for Wales said that he had been giving further consideration to his proposals for the reorganisation of local government in Wales in the light of the points made in thediscussion in Cabinet on 7th October. Conditions in the 11 ruralcounties were so different from those in most of England that it was unlikely that his proposals for them could cause any embarrassment to his colleagues; but he recognised that his proposal to retain thewere 25 educational authorities which either had submitted no plansor had had their plans rejected as unsatisfactory and had notsubmitted revised proposals. Progress towards a fully comprehensive system would in any case have been slow because sufficient building resources were not available to replace the many unsuitable school buildings; but it was being further held up by lack of co-operation from authorities under Conservative control and by his own lackof powers. The Education Act 1944 required local authorities toensure that sufficient schools were available and laid down certaincriteria which they must observe; but it said nothing about educationbeing on comprehensive lines. He therefore proposed to add tothese criteria the need for ensuring that secondary education isprovided in schools whose admission arrangements do not refer toability or aptitude; and to give the Secretary of State power torequire the submission of plans for secondary reorganisation and to reject or modify unsatisfactory proposals. In addition the bill would lay down strict requirements for consultation by educationauthorities with parents and teachers. The Bill would not compellocal authorities to reorganise on comprehensive lines, because thatwould be impracticable within the framework of the presentEducation Acts, to say nothing of the economic limitations; but itwould mark a useful step forward and in his opinion would be popular.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were agreed that the proposed Bill was a valuablemeasure, both educationally and politically; and that reference toit should be made in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C (69) 145.(2) Agreed that The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament should contain a reference to the government&apos;s intention to introduce a Bill requiring localeducation authorities to prepare plans for reorganisingsecondary education on comprehensive lines.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd October, 1969.existing county boroughs of Cardiff, Newport and Swansea was insharp conflict with the recommendations of the Royal Commissionon Local Government in England and would perpetuate the division between town and country. He was therefore prepared to put inhand a fresh review of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire with a viewto formulating proposals which would remove the divisions betweencounties and county boroughs and so resolve the conflict betweentown and country; but if he was to face the criticism which sucha change of policy would inevitably incur, he must be in a positionto make clear that he was adhering to the pattern of authoritiesand boundaries proposed by the White Paper for mid- and north wales. He proposed to make a statement to this effect during thefollowing week. This compromise solution had found favour withthe Ministerial Committee on Local Government Reorganisation.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the compromise proposals put forward by theSecretary of State for Wales. He would consider further, inconsultation with him, whether it would be better that he shouldmake the announcement in the course of his speech in the debate on the Address or that it should be the subject of a separate statement by the Secretary of State for Wales.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
