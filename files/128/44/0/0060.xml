ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessLegislativeProgramme1969-70(previous reference:CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. It was agreed thatin view of the wide public interest in the subject and the importanceof the issues involved, it would be wrong to devote less than a day tothe debate on the Resolution to make the Murder (Abolition of death Penalty) Act, 1965 permanent. The debate could beconveniently held on 16th December. This would make it possibleto debate the related Opposition Motion of Censure on the previous day; it would also ensure that the House of Commons voted on theResolution before the matter was debated in the House of Lords.The debate on the White Paper on public expenditure could be postponed until after the Christmas Recess, when it would be possibleto devote two days to it.The Order to reactivate Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act,1966 would be debated on 17th December. It was essential to bring home to the Governmenfs own supporters the importance of the vote on this occasion, which must be regarded as a vote of confidence in the Government. The reactivation of Part II was necessary asa bridging operation until the Commission on Industry and manpower could be set up. Without it, all the Governmenfsstatutory powers over prices would lapse at the end of the year; andthe possibility of securing the co-operation of industry in limitingprice increases, as had recently been done in the case of the brewers,would be substantially reduced. Furthermore, the absence of any powers of delay over incomes in the next few months could well leadto a situation in which the benefits accruing from our improvedbalance of payments were dissipated by a series of substantial andunjustified wage increases.The Cabinet were reminded of the need to ensure that anyremaining policy issues concerning main programme Bills wereresolved and the necessary instructions given to parliamentary counsel as soon as possible. The legislative programme for thecurrent session was substantial; and pressure on the draftsmen wouldbe very heavy in the coming months. Bills for which instructions were not submitted in good time might have to wait, with the resultthat it might not be possible to enact them within the lifetime of thepresent Parliament.10684
commission for Industryaud ManpowerDraftConsultativeDocument(previous reference:CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (69) 167) by theFirst Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity on the Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM)to which was attached a draft document for use in consultation withoutside interests.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Policy (IPY) had been set up to consider the scope and content of the legislation the purpose of which was to rationalise thework of the Monopolies Commission and the National Board for price and Incomes (NBPI) and to merge the two bodies. TheCommittee had reached broad agreement on the main elements ofthe legislation. She now hoped to initiate consultations with those concerned, starting immediately with informal consultations in the strictest confidence with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).The Committee had examined the draft consultative documentannexed to C (69) 167 on the preceding day and had agreed upon anumber of amendments. The machinery for dealing with politicallysensitive top salaries was still under consideration in IPY. She would report their conclusions on this point to Cabinet at a later date; butin the meantime the whole section on pay in the public services(paragraphs 17-21) might be omitted from the document to be shown to the CBI. The proposals set out in the document were largelyself-explanatory. Their starting point was that the behaviour oflarge industrial and commercial undertakings could have a significant impact on the national economy and was therefore amatter of legitimate public concern.In discussion it was argued that the proposals involved a majorincrease in the discretionary powers of Government over industry.The existing powers to make references to the monopolies commission and NBPI were restricted to cases where a technicalmonopoly existed; to mergers which involved the acquisition of assets of over  5 million; or to questions involving prices and incomes. These powers nevertheless allowed substantialadministrative discretion in deciding whether or not references shouldbe made. If, however, firms with over  10 million capital employedwere to be made liable for investigations on any of the wide groundsindicated, they would never be free of the risk of reference. the definition of the circumstances in which references might be made should be tightened, for instance by setting out,in detail the factors which might justify a reference.On the other hand, it was argued that experience with the monopolies Commission and NBPI under existing legislation had shown that the present definition of the circumstances in whichmarket power might be abused was inadequate. Many government supporters were of the view that the Government should have power
CONFIDENTIALto ensure that the large groupings which were emerging from industrial reconstruction were operated in the public interest. As the document made clear, the inclusion of large firms within the field of possible inquiry did not imply any presumption that their conductwas against the public interest, any more than control of one-thirdof the market (as provided for in the present Monopolies legislation)was presumed to be in itself against the public interest. The CIMwould normally be asked to consider and report on specific aspectsof the conduct of its business by a particular firm; and paragraph 7of the document contained an illustrative list of the kind of circumstances which might provoke a reference. To attempt to define in the legislation the detailed circumstances in which inquiriesmight be initiated could lead to protracted legal argument aboutparticular references; moreover, if the list were comprehensiveenough to include all those matters which the Government might wishto see referred, it might provoke more concern in industry than would the more generalised phrases now proposed, coupled with anillustrative list. Those Ministers who were responsible for sponsoringindustries had emphasised their wish to retain discretion as to when a reference was made; and it had therefore been agreed thatreferences should be made jointly by the Minister concerned and theFirst Secretary of State. It was, however, important that theestablishment of the CIM and the references made to it should not interfere with the established and developing dialogue betweensponsoring Departments and major firms.In further discussion the following points were made (a) The proposal that United Kingdom subsidiaries of overseascompanies should be liable to enquiry where the overseas group asa whole had a minimum of  10 million capital employed raisedimportant issues of policy, for example in relation to the powers ofthe directors of such subsidiaries. These issues would need further study before decisions could be taken on the extent to which UnitedKingdom subsidiaries of overseas companies should be brought withinthe scope of the CIM&apos;s investigations.(b) It was suggested that it might be appropriate to review the government&apos;s policy on mergers in the light of the extensivereorganisation of industry which had taken place in recent years.There was a case for providing that any merger affecting one of the50 or so largest companies should be automatically referred to theCIM. On the other hand, it was argued that circumstances varied sowidely that it was essential to continue to consider each caseindividually.(c) In the light of the discussions in IPY, it was proposed thatan amendment should be made to the second sentence of paragraph
29, the effect of which would be that while the CIM would work inpanels for particular inquiries, their reports would normally be approved by, and carry the authority, of the Commission as a whole;it might, however, be desirable in particular cases to appoint panelswhich would report direct to the Minister, provided that theChairman obtained the approval of the Minister in advance. Thiswas a practical proposal, drawing both on the practice of the monopolies Commission of panels reporting direct and recordingminority views and reservations, and on the practice of the NBPI ofworking in panels but with the report being considered and issuedas an agreed document by the Board itself. On the other hand,there was wide support for the view that, if reports were required tocarry the unanimous approval of the Commission or even of a panel,their authority would be greatly weakened; and that independent-minded people would be reluctant to accept appointments to the CIM.There was no advantage in concealing serious disagreement whenit existed; and if unanimity was not insisted upon, those reports whichwere unanimous would carry even greater weight.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that, while the Government should retain discretion to refer large companies for enquiry by the CIM asthe Government considered appropriate, it would help to reassureindustry if the consultative document were to include an illustrativelist of the circumstances which would normally justify a reference.The First Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of State for local Government and Regional Planning and other ministers concerned, should consider the possibility of including a new passageon these lines. She should also arrange for further consideration tobe given to the treatment of United Kingdom subsidiaries of overseasgroups in the legislation setting up the CIM. Both these issuescould, if necessary, be brought back to Cabinet for furtherconsideration. The Cabinet also agreed that while the Chairman ofthe CIM should have power to appoint panels for particular enquiriestheir reports should be issued with the authority of the commission as a whole; and that reports issued by the Commission need not be unanimous. Subject to these points and to the omission of thesection on public services in paragraphs 17-21 inclusive, the cabinet approved the draft consultative document attached to C (69) 167 asamended in the light of the discussion on IPY on 10th December.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to consider, in consultation with the Secretary ofState for Local Government and Regional planning and other Ministers concerned, the possibility of
OverseaAffairsEast-west relations:Meeting of north atlantic council in brussels,4th-5thDecemberSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therehad been no significant response from the Soviet bloc to the north atlantic CounciPs offer in the declaration issued at their meetingat Reykjavik in June, 1968, to join with the Soviet Union and otherEastern European countries in discussing mutual force reductions.The invasion of Czechoslovakia which had followed in August of thatyear had soured the atmosphere and brought about a major setback.The Warsaw Pact Powers, at a meeting in Prague in October, 1969,had put forward their own proposal for a European SecurityConference. They had agreed, albeit with some reluctance, that theUnited States and Canada could take part in such a conference,provided that the &quot; German Democratic Republic &quot; was allowed toattend the conference on the same footing as other participants.The Prague conference had produced documents proposing thediscussion of economic relations between East and West and theconclusion of an agreement on the renunciation of the use of force.The latter document had included the proviso that any arrangement which might be reached as a result of the proposed conference shouldnot prejudice the existing obligations of the participating states, i.e.,the continuing existence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) and the Warsaw Pact, and by implication the &quot; Brezhnevdoctrine &quot;, under which the Soviet Union and her allies claimed theright of intervention in the internal affairs of other &quot; socialist&quot; states.In general, the reaction in the North Atlantic Council to the warsaw pact proposals had been reserved. Misgivings had been expressed about the restriction of the agenda of the proposed conference to only two items, one of which (economic co-operation) was being discussed through other channels. It had been pointed out that the participation of the &quot; German Democratic Republic &quot;would, in factincluding in the consultative document anillustrative list of the circumstances which would normally justify a reference of a large company to the CIM.(ii) to arrange, in consultation with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and other ministers concerned, for further consideration to be givento the treatment of United Kingdom subsidiaries of overseas groups in the legislation setting up theCIM.(2) Approved the draft consultative document attached toC (69) 167, subject to (i) above and to the points made inthe Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
if not in form, constitute a step towards recognition of the east german regime. Attention had also been drawn to the danger of recognising, even by implication, the rights of intervention claimedunder the &quot; Brezhnev doctrine &quot;. The United States, who no doubthad their current discussions with the Soviet Union on strategicarms limitation in view, had been cautious. The Germans were evidently chiefly interested in the outcome of the bilateral discussions in which they were at present engaged with the Soviet Union, withother Eastern European governments, and with the East Germanregime. The Dutch had been more forthcoming, but the unwillingness of the French to co-operate with the rest of the north atlantic Alliance in military matters seemed now to extend to political matters also. They appeared to prefer that any discussions betweenEast and West should be on a bilateral rather than on a collectivebasis.  Progress on such lines was likely to be very slow.Despite these reactions, he had felt that the North atlantic council should not reject the Warsaw Pact proposals out of hand,unsatisfactory though they were. Pie had therefore urged that the alliance should maintain its interest in balanced force reductions andshould in particular produce &quot; models &quot; illustrative of various possiblesituations. The approach should be that we wanted to deal withconcrete matters and were prepared to put forward concrete proposals to the other side. The documents which had emerged from thePrague conference were admittedly inadequate; and there weredivergent views in the Alliance as to how they should be handled.The members of the Alliance should discuss their differences with aview to agreeing at the next Ministerial meeting on a common lineof approach to the Warsaw Pact powers. In doing so, they shouldnot underestimate the importance of the contacts which had alreadybeen initiated. A number of approaches were possible. It was unlikely that all the problems outstanding between East and Westcould be settled in one conference; and there might have to be aseries of conferences. Another possibility might be to set up some kind of standing commission on East-West relations.In a short discussion it was pointed out that the United states had initiated talks on strategic arms limitation with the Soviet Union;the Federal Republic of Germany was having bilateral discussions with that country and other Warsaw Pact members; and the french had declared themselves in favour of a system of bilateral contacts.We did not appear to have taken any comparable initiative; and wetherefore ran the risk of being accused of rigidity and a lack ofenthusiasm for a detente between East and West. If this impressionwere allowed to gain ground, the consequences, both internally andexternally, might be damaging. On the other hand, it was argued that so far as the United States was concerned, strategic arms
limitation was a subject which only that country and the soviet union could profitably discuss. It was we who had kept alive in nato the concept of balanced mutual force reductions. We hadplayed a leading part in negotiating the Non-Proliferation treaty and in urging others to sign and ratify it. We were playing a major part in the talks between the Soviet Union and the three western powers with special responsibilities for Berlin. While there hadbeen some misunderstanding of our attitude in the early stages ofthe NATO Ministerial meeting, the attitude we had taken during itand the ideas we had put forward, many of which were reflected in the Declaration and Communique issued at the end of themeeting, had done much to dispel misconceptions.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during the ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, hehad been able to discuss with Ministers from the six member countries the result of the European Economic. Community&apos;s summit meetingat The Hague held on 1st and 2nd December. It was clear thatthey were determined to deal with their internal problems concerningthe British application for entry into the Community over the next six months (or possibly even more quickly) and thereafter to enterinto negotiations with us without delay. The other members of theCommunity were evidently not prepared to brook any delaying tacticson the part of the French. The Dutch had indicated that if theFrench attempted to hold up negotiations with Britain, they wouldnot ratify the arrangements for a Common Agricultural Policy.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the GhanaGovernments recent decision to require all foreign nationals withoutresidence permits to leave Ghana had probably been prompted byconcern over unemployment which, as a result of Dr. Nkrumah&apos;sextravagances, was still a serious problem in Ghana. The decisions would bear mainly on nationals of other African states; but it was unlikely that many British subjects would be affected.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that very littlereliable information had yet emerged about the recent coup d&apos;etat inDahomey. It was clear however that British subjects were not at risk.SECRET10684 b
Gibraltar(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)Greece:Membership ofthe Council ofEurope(previous reference:CC (69) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the talksheld with the Gibraltar Chief Minister, Major Peliza, from 2nd-8thDecember had gone well. They had been greatly facilitated by the concessions which the Defence Secretary had been able to make inregard to Service property in Gibraltar.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would be attending the meetingof the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, where hewould take the line on Greece already agreed by his colleagues. the outcome of their consideration of the suspension of Greekmembership of the Council would depend largely on the attitude ofthe German Government. We had informed them of the course we ourselves proposed to follow; and had expressed the hope that theywould act on similar lines.The Cabinet (3) Took  note   of  the  statements   by   the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.AircraftIndustryConcorde(previous reference:CC (69) 14thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of technology (C (69) 163) and the President of the Board of Trade(C (69) 164) about the future of the Concorde project after the endof 1969.The Minister of Technology said that the first flight tests of concorde had been successful; 150 hours test flying had beencompleted and the handling qualities were very good over the wholespeed range investigated so far. It was expected that somemeasurements of performance at Mach 2 would be made by the end ofJune 1970; but a full assessment at that speed would not be available for next autumn. There was a real problem in the failure so far toreach the target payload; but officials considered that improvements to the propulsion system which were under development, togetherwith minor changes in operating conditions, should allow the targetpayload of 20,000 lb. at entry into service to be achieved. a fundamental redesigning of the nozzle system might increase thepayload by about 5,000 lb; but this would be likely to cost more than 20 million and a firm assessment of the redesign would not beavailable until June 1970. The Concorde&apos;s approach noise was likely to be about the same as that of the Boeing 707; but its lateralnoise would almost certainly be higher than that of existing aircraft.However, officials believed that there was a good chance of developingimproved silencers before entry into service. The latest estimate ofthe development cost, taking account of minor adjustments to theprogramme and the devaluation of the franc, was exactly the same
10684as the January 1969 estimate, though at a later price basis. the revised estimate at current prices of the United Kingdom share was now  352 million. If the project was stopped at the end of this year,some  120 million might be saved; the savings would be reduced to under  100 million for cancellation at the end of June 1970, or to 55 million for cancellation at the end of 1970. There was stillconsiderable doubt about the commercial prospects. The UnitedKingdom members of the Concorde Economic Prospeots Committeeforecast sales of from 50 to 150 aircraft; but they inclined towardsthe lower figure. This meant a possible range from 10 per cent to90 per cent in the implied preference when both the low development and high development cost estimates were included. He had metM. Mondon, the French Minister of Transport, with our ambassador in September and had put forward our view that we were free to break off the development at the end of 1969. M. Mondon had disagreedwith our interpretation of an exchange of letters with M. Chamant, his predecessor, and had contended that the agreement allowed for withdrawal only after the achievement of Mach 2 flight, and not for withdrawal at the end of 1969. It was the opinion of the attorney general that we had the right to withdraw after 31st December,1969, and that our position was. likely to be upheld by theInternational Court. This was the first occasion since 1964 that theGovernment had been given an opportunity for a real choice aboutthe continuation of the project. In his view, we should now tell theFrench Government that we would continue until 30th June, 1970,and then assess the situation again.The Prime Minister said that the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy had considered the Concorde project on theprevious day; and he had undertaken to convey their conclusions to cabinet. It was common ground that the project should never havebeen started. The uncertain commercial prospects, the continuingescalation in costs and the prospect that further large sums might be needed for redesigning the nozzle system were matters for serious concern. The Committee had accepted, however, that it would notbe desirable, on broad political grounds, for us to withdrawunilaterally from the project at the end of this year. They had agreed that the French Government should be told that we wereprepared to continue with Concorde until 30th June, 1970. Theposition could then be reviewed in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time. In informing the French Government of our decision we should make it plain that this was without prejudice toour contention that any automatic obligation to continue with the project ended on 31st December, 1969; and that our commitment for the future would extend only so far as we ourselves might fromtime to time decide.  We should also press the French to provide us
with the facts and figures with as full detail as possible on whichthey based their optimistic assessment of Concorde&apos;s commercial prospects, with the aim of establishing a common view with them onthis point before the middle of next year.In discussion the point was made that until the Cabinet decidedto cancel the project everyone engaged on it should work for thesuccess of Concorde. Authorised development work should not beheld back because of its uncertain future, as this would only guaranteefailure. Attention was drawn to the possibility that the Isle of Manauthorities might resist proposals that supersonic flights should beallowed over the island. There would be an increase in the number ofsupersonic bangs when the testing programme started, and there hadalready been some problems. It would be helpful to have regularreports of the effects of supersonic bangs and reactions to them here and in France.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the conclusions of the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy. They agreed that we shouldcontinue the development of Concorde until 30th June 1970 when theposition could be reviewed in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology (i) in consultation with the Attorney General, to informthe French Government in writing that we wereprepared to continue with Concorde until 30thJune, 1970, but without prejudice to our contention that any automatic obligation ended on 31stDecember, 1969.(ii) to press the French Government to provide detailed information on their views of Concorde&apos;commercial prospects (iii) to consider, in consultation with the Home Secretary,the President of the Board of Trade and the attorney General, the problems which would arise if the Isle of Man authorities resisted proposals toallow supersonic flights over the island.SECRETLocal 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theReoSsation Secretary of State for Local Government and Regional planning in England     (C (69) 166) on Local Government Reorganisation in England.
The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that the Ministerial Committee on Local government reorganisation had considered the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England (the RoyalCommission) in the light of the comments made upon them. in doing so, they had taken full account of the political considerations;in particular, the sharp reduction in the number of councillors of executive authorities which the proposals entailed and feeling withinthe Party at national and local level. The purpose of his memorandum was to seek the endorsement of the Cabinet for theconclusions which the Ministerial Committee had - reached on the shape of the new local government structure, which would form thebasis of the White Paper to be published early in the New Year.There were a variety of associated points which the White paper would have to cover, such as whether councillors should be paid;these the Cabinet would be able to consider when the White Papercame before them.The Ministerial Committee were united in accepting the broadstructure proposed by the Royal Commission, with unitary authoritiesvarying in population from about \ million to 1 million coveringmost of the country and a two-tier structure of metropolitanauthorities and district councils in a limited number of areas whichwere too large for unitary treatment but which required, for thepurposes of some services, to be organised as a whole; below these authorities there would be local councils whose main functionwould be to represent local opinion. The Royal commission had also proposed that at regional level there should be provincialcouncils, most of the members being elected by local authorities,whose function would be to decide upon provincial strategy andthe planning framework within which the local authorities would operate. This recommendation had aroused intense interest, but theprovisional view of the Ministerial Committee was that no conclusioncould be reached until the Commission on the Constitution had reported.Taking first the Royal Commission^ proposals for metropolitanareas, the Ministerial Committee accepted in principle that thereshould be such areas within which a two-4ier system of governmentwould operate. The environmental services, such as planning and transportation, would be administered by the upper tier and personal services would be administered by the lower tier. The Committeehad also agreed that this form of organisation was appropriate forthe West Midlands, Merseyside and Selnec areas. They were,however, in favour of some changes in the division of functions between the two tiers; and they considered that there were further
areas which warranted metropolitan treatment. On functions, theywere agreed that education should be the responsibility of the uppertier, since a number of the proposed district councils were too smallto make satisfactory education authorities; and they agreed that thereshould be some strengthening of the housebuilding powers of metropolitan authorities. It was, however, the question of additionalmetropolitan areas which had most exercised the Committee; theyhad considered in detail six possible areas West Yorkshire, SouthHampshire, Central Lancashire, Notts /Derby, South Yorkshire,and Tyneside. They were unanimous in recommending that WestYorkshire and South Hampshire should be metropolitan areas,mainly for reasons of planning and transportation and, in the case ofthe West Riding, for reasons of education; and a majority of theCommittee had favoured making Central Lancashire a metropolitan area in view of the rapid development expected in this area. In hisopinion there were also good reasons for making Nottingham / Derbya metropolitan area because it was an incipient conurbation; butthe majority of the Committee had felt that it would be dangerous toincrease the number of metropolitan areas this far. There was nostrong case for a South Yorkshire metropolitan area unless such areas were established for both West Yorkshire and Notts/Derby;and the Committee were at one in rejecting the idea of a metropolitan area for Tyneside, although a case could be argued for combiningTyneside and Northumberland in a single large unitary area.Whatever the decision about the number of metropolitan areas, theywere agreed that provision should be made in the Bill to enableorganisational changes to be made in future, as circumstancesdemanded, without the need for legislation.On unitary authorities, the Ministerial Committee had rejected the suggestions made in some quarters that some of the larger unitary areas proposed by the Royal Commission should be divided; butthey wished to leave open the possibility that some areas might be amalgamated to produce stronger authorities. Local councils hadbeen proposed by the Royal Commission with the main function of representing local opinion and acting as a link between the public and the main authorities. These councils were also to have powerto spend money on local amenities; and it was suggested that thelarger of them might play a part, subject to the agreement of theunitary authority, in administering some of the main government services. The Commission proposed that local councils should be constituted initially for the areas of all county boroughs, boroughs,urban districts and parishes, although the pattern was to bere considered at the end of a five-year period. These proposals hadbeen widely criticised, particularly in the light of the fact that local councils would vary in size from Sheffield down to the smallest parish;but the majority of the Ministerial Committee believed that it would
be politically impossible to sweep away all existing councils,particularly those in small and medium sized towns. The Committeehad therefore concentrated on trying to improve the RoyalCommission^ proposals. They agreed that these councils shouldhave power to spend money on local amenities; that they should havea consultative function and the right to make nominations to bodiessuch as governing bodies of schools. In addition, the committee proposed that every unitary authority should be required todecentralise the administration of appropriate services to district committees; and that local councils should nominate half, or evenmore, of the members of these committees; the committee considered that it would be possible in this way to increase publicparticipation without serious damage to the efficiency with whichthe services were administered. Admittedly, it made little sense to constitute local councils for the areas of &quot;the larger boroughs withpopulations in excess of say, 100,000 most of which would in anycase be capitals of unitary authorities and the sooner these couldbe replaced the better; for the purposes of the White Paper, he proposed that they should say as much and see what emerged inthe process of subsequent consultation.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentshould accept the recommendation of the Ministerial Committee andendorse the broad structure proposed by the Royal Commission.The Cabinet then considered in turn the Ministerial Committee&apos;srecommendations for the several levels of local government.(i) Provincial CouncilsThere was general agreement that the Government could take no decision until the Commission on the Constitution had reported;and that the White Paper should be drafted in this sense, with a reference to the need for the economic planning councils to continue their work in the meantime.(ii) Metropolitan areas the Cabinet approved the changes in the distribution of functions between the two tiers proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Local Government and Regional Planning. On the proposalsfor further metropolitan areas, it was agreed that West Yorkshire andSouth Hampshire should be organised in this way; and that theywould consider the case for metropolitan areas in Central lancashire and Notts /Derby at a subsequent meeting, perhaps when the draftof the White Paper was before the Cabinet.(iii) Unitary AreasIt was agreed that no increase in the number of unitary areas should be contemplated; on the contrary, a good case could be madeon educational grounds for rejecting the proposals of the Royal
Commission to split the present counties of Herts, Surrey, Kent and east Sussex. On economic planning grounds there would be advantage in uniting Northumberland with Tyneside; the ministerial committee had agreed that this possibility might be considered further after publication of the White Paper if there was pressure for such an amalgamation, although it would produce a unitaryauthority which was not only very large but was also lacking incoherence. The case against splitting Herts, Surrey, Kent and EastSussex could be similarly considered after the White Paper was published, although it had to be remembered that decisions couldnot be taken simply on the basis of the needs of one service, and thatthere was a strong feeling in the Party against amalgamation ofunitary authorities.(iv) Local CouncilsThere was general agreement that local councils should haveno responsibility for the operation of the main government services;that they should be entitled to appoint members to district committees of unitary authorities who would be responsible fordecentralised administration; but that it might be unwise to allowrepresentatives of local councils to constitute a majority of such committees. It was also agreed that there should be discussions withthe local authority associations after publication of the White paper on various aspects of the local council proposals, including the subsequent review of areas; feeling in the Ministerial Committee wasthat such a review should be carried out at the earliest possible moment, particularly in the larger towns. As part of this process,consideration would also have to be given to the position of historictowns with old charters.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would consider at a later stage whether the White paper should propose that Central Lancashire and Notts/Derby becomemetropolitan areas. Subject to this, they accepted the proposals inparagraph 21 of C (69) 166.
