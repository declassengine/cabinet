CC23 (69)confidential parliamentary 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons in the following week.Future The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Sub-Committee onBusm*^ ol Future Policy of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes of Rent kac* considered the case for taking fresh powers to control rent increases increases when the existing powers under the Prices and Incomes Act,1968, lapsed at the end of the year. A majority of the Sub-committee considered that if it were decided to take such powers it would be preferable to do so by way of a separate Bill and not by amending the current Housing Bill; and the Lord President had assured themthat such a Bill could if necessary be introduced early in the next session. Opinion in the Sub-Committee was sharply divided on thedesirability of taking fresh powers. They had concluded that thenext step should be consultation with the Parliamentary Labour party on the matter and that the Sub-Committee should then consider theproblem further in the light of these consultations.International The  Chancellor of  the Exchequer  said  that his  currentMonetary Fund negotiations with the International Monetary Fund would not becompleted before Parliament resumed after the Whitsun Recess. he did not propose to make any statement before the House rose, andhe understood that any demand for a debate would be resisted. Ifthe Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund agreed toa further loan he would report to the Cabinet before signing a Letter.of Intent to the Fund and would subsequently publish the letter.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the statements by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Parliamentary The Prime Minister said that it would be of the greatestSittings importance to maintain the Governmenfs voting strength in theHouse of Commons during the summer. Ministers should therefore confine oversea visits to periods when the House ofCommons was not sitting. Where it was essential for the Governmentto be represented on a particular occasion by a Minister, arrangements should if possible be made, in consultation with the Leader and theChief Whip of the House of Lords, for a Peer to attend; and if the attendance of a particular Minister who was a member of the Houseof Commons could not be avoided, the Minister should consult theChief Whip on the arrangement of business and on arranging asuitable pair. Ministers would also be well advised, in making eitherofficial or personal plans, not to assume that Parliament would in theevent be able to rise at the end of July.Members of the Cabinet should bring to the attention of theirjunior Ministers the necessity of avoiding oversea visits while
Parliament was sitting and to refrain from committing themselvesto plans based on the assumption that Parliament would rise at theend of July.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that discussions with the Premier of the Associated State of St. Kitts,Nevis and Anguilla, Mr. Bradshaw, were still continuing.Mr. Bradshaw had agreed in principle that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom and his Government should appoint a Commission, and that other Caribbean governments should be asked to suggest candidates to serve on it. The twoGovernments would appoint the members of the Commission in their personal capacities, and not as representatives of the Governmentswho had nominated them. The function of the proposed commission would be to consider the Anguillan problem and submit recommendations. It would not consider wider Caribbean problems.The main point of difficulty so far had been the Commission^ termsof reference. Mr. Bradshaw had wished these to be drawn so as to rule out the separation of Anguilla from the Associated State in any circumstances. We could not of course agree. During thediscussions, the questions had been raised of aid for Nevis and assistance in the construction of an airstrip for jet aircraft in St. Kitts.It remained to be seen whether Mr. Bradshaw&apos;s anxiety to obtainBritish help over these problems would be sufficient to induce himto abandon his unacceptable demands in regard to the terms ofreference of the Commission. During the talks there had also beendiscussion of various administrative problems: for example, landsales, postage stamps and passports. On all these issues,Mr. Bradshaw had pressed for solutions which would emphasise the continuing authority of the Associated State over Anguilla. We had pointed out the unwisdom of this. If agreement could be reachedover the terms of reference of the Commission, however, it was likely that these minor problems would fall into place. discussions with Mr. Bradshaw would continue on Friday, 16th May.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen some movement in the Paris negotiations on Vietnam. TheNorth Vietnamese National Liberation Front had put forward theirten-point plan; and the President of the United States, Mr. Nixon,had on 14th May announced a series of measures aimed at thewithdrawal of foreign forces from South Vietnam and the terminationof hostilities. In his speech President Nixon had made it clear that
MalaysiaIran:negotiations between the shah and theWestern OilConsortium(previous reference :CC (66) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet-(2) Took   note  of  the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and. Commonwealth Secretary and invited him to circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet.the United States were not simply going to abandon the south vietnamese. Any withdrawal of United States troops would be conditional on the withdrawal of North Vietnamese troops from south Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, and the creation of conditionsin which the South Vietnamese could freely choose their own government. It was of interest that, in the course of the currentexchanges, the North Vietnamese had for the first time overtlyadmitted that there were North Vietnamese troops in South Vietnam.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that recent events in Malaysia seemed to show that the uneasy alliance betweensome Malaysian elements and some Chinese elements appeared to bebreaking down. In the recent elections there had been gains by the extremists on both sides, and the future of the coalition was in doubt.It was possible that the prospect of an impending United Stateswithdrawal from Vietnam had stimulated some of the Chinese inMalaysia to demonstrate their sympathy with China. These factorswere in the long term perhaps a more serious feature of the situationthan the rioting which had taken place. So far as the security situation was concerned, Kuala Lumpur now appeared to be quiet,though 20 people had died and 60 had been injured. There had,however, been only one minor incident involving a British subject.The Cabinet-(1) Took  note  of  the  statements   by   the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thenegotiations between the Shah of Iran and the Western Oil Consortiumoperating in Iran had been brought to a successful conclusion.Contrary to Press reports, the results had not been a one-sidedvictory for the Shah. It was fortunate that the agreement had beenreached when it had been, since this issue might otherwise have caused difficulties at the impending meeting of the Central treaty organisation. The subject was a somewhat complicated one, and he proposed to circulate a short memorandum to his colleagues.
IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelations Bill(previous reference :CC (69) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Prime Minister said that he and the First Secretary ofState had had a useful discussion with the General Council of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) on 12th May. At the suggestion ofthe TUC the discussion would be resumed on 21st May and the first secretary of State would be able to report the outcome to the Cabineton the following day. In the meantime it would be helpful if she would circulate a paper dealing with those parts of the proposed legislation on which there was already broad agreement betweenthe Government and the TUC.The First Secretary of State said that the General Councilsattitude at the meeting had been co-operative. There had been a constructive discussion of a draft report entitled &quot; industrial relations A Programme for Action &quot; which the TUC had preparedfor circulation to the special Congress which they had called for5th June. There was a good deal of common ground between theproposals in the tuc&apos;s report and in the White Paper &quot; In Place ofStrife &quot;. The tuc&apos;s proposals for dealing with inter-union disputeswere in line with the Governmenfs own approach and seemedgenerally satisfactory. Their proposals for dealing withunconstitutional stoppages arising from disputes with employers were much more vaguely worded and it was by no means clear that theywould be either effective or quick-acting. A large part of the meeting had been devoted, without much success, to clarifying the TUCsintentions on this point. Following the meeting she had sent thema list of questions, largely relating to the operation of the procedures for dealing with unconstitutional stoppages, and the General council would be considering these before finalising the text of the report tothe special Congress. She had told the TUC that the introductionof the Bill would be delayed until after the special Congress and theyhad warmly welcomed this. The special Congress would not,however, be able to do more than reach decisions in principle whichwould be subject to confirmation at the Annual Congress inSeptember. It would be some time before it would be possible to judge whether the tuc&apos;s programme taken as a whole represented a satisfactory alternative to the Governmenfs own proposals.In discussion it was generally recognised that, while the TUCsproposals for dealing with inter-union disputes might well be satisfactory, there still appeared to be a significant gap between the tuc&apos;s proposals and those of the Government for dealing withunconstitutional stoppages arising from disputes with employers. Itwas argued that the TUC would not in fact be able to exert effectivediscipline over affiliated unions, since their only sanction was the threat of expulsion which they would be generally unwilling to putinto effect. The importance of reaching decisions which could beaccepted by the TUC as well as the Government was emphasised and
LegislationDivorceReform Bill(previous reference :CC(69) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor about the Divorce Reform Bill (C (69) 51).The Lord Chancellor recalled that the Cabinet had agreed inNovember, 1968, that the House of Commons should have anopportunity to reach a conclusion in the present Session on Mr. AlecJones&apos; Divorce Reform Bill, which was in substance the same as aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill which had failed to secure a passage in theprevious Session. Accordingly, time had been made available forthe Second Reading. The Bill was now being considered on Report,and determined opposition on the part of a small group of members had made it plain that there was no prospect of its being passedunless the Government were prepared to provide additional time.In his view it was desirable that this should be done if necessary bymeans of an all-night sitting; there would be widespread dismay andit was suggested that the possibility of combining the tuc&apos;s proposals with a stronger supervisory role for the Commission on industrial relations should be considered. Against this it was pointed out thatthe TUC had not shown any particular enthusiasm for theCommission.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the tuc were clearly anxious to continue their consultations with theGovernment, and it would be premature for the Cabinet to considereither the substance or the timing of legislation at this stage. TheFirst Secretary of State would circulate to the Cabinet copies of the tuc&apos;s report to the special Congress and would report to the Cabinetthe outcome of the resumed discussions with the TUC in the following week. In the meantime it was important that Ministers should avoidsaying anything to members of the General Council of the TUCwhich might encourage them to maintain their opposition to theGovernments proposals.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate forconsideration at their meeting in the following week (i) a paper dealing with those parts of the proposed legislation on which there was broad agreementbetween the Government and the TUC;(ii) copies of the report prepared by the General Councilof the TUC for circulation to the special Congress.(2) Took note that at their meeting in the following week theFirst Secretary of State would report the outcome of herresumed discussions with the General Council of the tuc.
resentment amongst the Bill&apos;s supporters, most of whom were members of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), if this reformwere again frustrated, as it had heen in the previous Session, through lack of time. It was also relevant that the Bill was still strongly supported by the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Committee on the reform of the divorce law.In discussion it was suggested that the provision of Governmenttime was likely to be unpopular with the public; it would be resentedby the bill&apos;s opponents; and it would be important to ensure that a concession could not be exploited to delay the passage of government legislation. On the other hand, it would be a valuable demonstration of the influence of back-benchers if Government interventionenabled a measure supported by the majority of the PLP to completeits passage through the House of Commons. A single all-nightsitting would probably not be sufficient, however, and it would bedesirable to consider giving time on the same basis as for the passageof the Abortion Bill in 1967, when it was clearly understood that the debate would start on a Thursday night and if necessary continueinto Saturday. A similar opportunity would not arise until the weekafter the Whitsun Recess; but it should be taken then because, unlessthe Bill completed its passage through the House of Commons in that week, it would face the competition in the House of Lords of anumber of major Government Bills and might well fail again. if government time was to be made available, it was important that before any announcement was made to this effect the PLP shouldbe consulted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, subject to consultation with the PLP,Government time should be given to enable the Bill to complete its passage in the House of Commons. The aim should be to provide sufficient time for this purpose during the first week after the whitsun recess, possibly on the same basis as for the Abortion Bill. TheChief Whip should discuss with the Chairman of the PLP when itwould be convenient to put the matter to the Party.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Government time should be made available toenable the Divorce Reform Bill to complete its passage in the House of Commons, on the basis indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to consult the Chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party about the timing of a discussion with the Party.
BSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services (C (69) 50) on the uprating of social security benefits.The Minister of State, Department of Health and Social Security,said that the proposed increases in retirement and war pensions and100 per cent disability benefit did no more than reflect price increasessince October, 1967, in accordance with the Governmenfs previous decision; the increases in supplementary benefits were substantiallysmaller because the rates had last been increased in October, 1968.The net cost of the changes in benefits was estimated at  236 million in the first year, but this was not the whole measure of the additionalsums which had to be provided; the National Insurance Fund had shown a deficit of about  80 million in 1968-69 and it was estimatedthat this would rise to  160 million in 1970-71. Taking these two factors together it was necessary to raise  440 million in the first year,of which it was proposed to find approximately  370 million from contributions and the remainder from the Exchequer. If the whole amount to be raised from contributions were found by raisingflat-rat,e contributions, this would mean an increase of about 3s. 6d.each for employer and employee on the man&apos;s contributions, whichwould be quite intolerable for the lower paid. The Chancellor of theExchequer had already, in winding up the Budget Debate, ruled out any question of making employers pay more than their normal shareand it would not be right to make the scheme too dependent onExchequer finance; it was therefore proposed to raise about half themoney needed by increasing the graduated contributions on earnings between  18 and  30 a week from \ per cent to 2  per cent perannum, which would mean that whereas the flat-rate contribution would be increased by Is. 6d. a week the increase would be 6s. lid.a week for those earning  30 or more. This represented a fairspreading of the burden and would be a step towards the long-termearnings related scheme; but it would undoubtedly cause strongprotests in some quarters.Since it was proposed to extend the graduated scheme in thisway, it was essential to find some way of improving it and makingthe proposals more acceptable. He therefore proposed that, with effect from 1972, benefits earned by graduated contributions shouldbe revalued to take account of changes in prices or earnings overlife. In addition to remedying the worst defect of the ConservativeGovernmenfs scheme, this would help those who were already tooold to derive much, if any, benefit from the new pensions scheme;redress the balance between those within the present scheme andthose who had been contracted out, which had been disturbed byrising interest rates; and deter large employers who were threatening
to contract out to the detriment of the Fund. On the other hand there was no doubt that if the Government acted as proposed theywould be accused of a breach of faith in changing the terms on whicha large section of employees, including the mineworkers, had beencontracted out, and would also be accused of going back on their ownWhite Paper. Whichever way the Government opted there would bevocal opposition; the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation ofBritish Industry and the National Association of Pension Funds were all in favour of &quot; dynamising &quot; graduated pensions, while the LifeOffices Association had made it clear that they would regard suchaction as tantamount to the retrospective revision of a contractentered into by the Government. The balance of advantage was inhis view in favour of &quot; dynamising &quot; graduated pensions, althoughnothing comparable could be done for those contracted out; he invited the Cabinet to approve the increases in benefits and contributions specified in C (69) 50, and to authorise the publicationof the Bill on 21st May and the making of a statement at the sametime about the Governments intention to &quot; dynamise&quot; graduated pensions as from the commencement of the new scheme.In discussion a number of Ministers took strong exception to the cabinets being asked to consider so complex and important a matter at short notice. Accepting that the decision to postpone theintroduction of the Industrial Relations Bill had upset previous plans,the fact remained that the timetable proposed by the Secretary ofState for Social Services would make it impossible to make even ashow of consulting the representatives of contracted out workers,who, contrary to previous undertakings, would be placed in a worse position than those under the state scheme, including the NationalUnion of Mineworkers (NUM) and other organisations of employees of nationalised industries and the Civil Service unions. This couldonly lead to angry recriminations.One way out of this difficulty would be to omit any mention of&quot; dynamism &quot; from the statement to be made on introduction; it didnot relate to the text of the Bill, and a statement of the Government^intentions on this point could be left until Second Reading. but without mentioning &quot; dynamism &quot; it would be almost impossible todefend successfully the sharp increases proposed in graduated pensions. Moreover the timetable on the Bill must be so arranged as to leave time for discussion in the Parliamentary Labour Party(PLP) and for the Government to try to carry the Party in the country with them. The size of the increases in contributions particularly inrelation to low-paid workers would come as a severe shock, thoughthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had made it clear during the Budgetdebates that additional (but unspecified) sums would have to be raisedtowards meeting the deficit in the National Insurance Fund.  Since
CC23(69)this was an essential element in the calculations on which the Budgetwas based, the sum would have to be raised and there could be noquestion of increasing the Exchequer contribution.It was essential that the Bill reached the Statute Book by theend of July, but it did not necessarily follow that it must receive aSecond Reading in the week following the Whitsun Recess.Postponement of introduction until after Whitsun would give timefor Ministers to consider the issues properly, for approaches to bemade to the NUM and other bodies whose members would be adversely affected by the changes proposed, and for discussions withinthe Party. Publication either on 21st May, or on the day Parliamentrose, would not be suitable.On the other hand postponement of the introduction until afterWhitsun would mean that the proposals would break upon theGovernments supporters at a time when their morale might be understrain as a result of the publication of the Industrial Relations bill and of the arrangement with the International Monetary Fund; itwas open to doubt, however, whether the interval afforded bypublication before Whitsun would have much effect on the strengthof the reaction to the proposals. A further difficulty aboutpostponement was that the Government had been under pressure forsome time to make an announcement about the increases in contributions, and a debate on this subject would take place in theHouse of Commons later that day. This difficulty might, however,be overcome by making a preliminary statement of the governments intention to &quot; dynamise&quot; graduated pensions under the existing scheme in order to remove the schemeS worst feature; the delay in introducing the Bill could be explained by reference to the need forextensive consultations on this point. The House could then beinformed that the Bill would be introduced as soon as possible afterWhitsun.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet was that though the principle of raising part of the sum needed by increasing graduated contributionswas accepted, more time was needed to study the details of theproposals, and particularly the burden on the lower-paid. the ministerial Committee on Social Services should meet for this purposeearly in the following week; if necessary the matter could be further considered by the Cabinet on 22nd May. As to timing, they were agreed that the introduction of the Bill should be deferred until afterWhitsun. The interval should be used, once agreement had beenreached on the policy, in approaching the NUM and other bodiesrepresentative of those likely to be adversely affected, and in
confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C (69) 48) about thepermanent abolition of capital punishment for murder.The Cabinet Agreed that since there was inadequate time available forthe discussion of this topic it should be placed on the agenda for 22nd May and, if necessary, considered at an adjournedmeeting in the afternoon of that day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th May, 1969.legislation the PermanentAbolition ofCapitalPunishmentfor Murder(previous reference :CC (65) 35thConclusions,Minute 1)promoting understanding of the issues in the PLP. The Secretaryof State for Social Services should refer, in the course of the debate inthe House of Commons that day, to the Governmenfs plans tointroduce &quot; dynamism &quot; of graduated pensions, to the resultant needfor consultations and to their intention to introduce the Bill as  oonas possible after Whitsun; any question to the Lord President on theBusiness Statement could be answered by reference to what theSecretary of State would be saying.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to arrangefor the Ministerial Committee on Social Services to meetearly in the following week to consider the details of theproposed increases in contributions.
