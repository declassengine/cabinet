The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet that thepublication of the White Paper on the Farm Price Review, and the related statement, had been postponed until Wednesday, 19th March.He thought it right to warn the Cabinet that there was reason to expectstrenuous Parliamentary criticism.The Prime Minister said that he had seen the President of theNational Farmers&apos; Union (Mr. G. T. Williams), who had put the farmers&apos; case but had not submitted any arguments which had not already been put to the Cabinet by the Agriculture Ministers. He had made it clear to Mr. Williams that the Cabinets decision on the matter had been final, but as a courtesy had undertaken to reportMr. Williams&apos; representations to his colleagues.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theMinister of Agriculture.The Lord President reported that, in accordance with thedecision of the Cabinet at their previous meeting, he, with the HomeSecretary and the Chief Whip, had had a discussion with the DeputyLeader of the Opposition, Mr. Maudling, and the Opposition chief whip, Mr. Whitelaw, about the possibility of reaching agreement ona voluntary timetable for the Parliament (No. 2) Bill. It had become apparent that there was no prospect of reaching accommodation on a voluntary timetable because the Opposition were unable to guarantee that it would be observed; and that they would oppose a Motion fora formal timetable. In view of this, and of the attitude of the opponents of the Bill on the Governments side of the House, atimetable Motion would probably be defeated.The Lord Chancellor said that the remaining options had beendiscussed by the Parliamentary Committee, who had considered whether there would be advantage in withdrawing the Parliament(No. 2) Bill and substituting a more radical measure dealing with thepowers of the House of Lords alone. They had concluded, however,that the introduction of such a measure and its passage underthe Parliament Act would so disrupt the Governments importantlegislation for the next Session that there would be no advantage in adopting this course. They had also seen no advantage in seeking totake the remainder of the Committee Stage of the Bill in StandingCommittee, since amendments might well be carried against them and10357A 2
they would be faced with a prolonged Report Stage in which the bill would have to be restored to its original form. There would consequently be no net saving of time on the floor of the House.In discussion it was emphasised that the solution of the government&apos;s difficulty lay in the firm assertion of their determination to secure the passage of the Bill. It was not impossible that sufficient firmness might secure the passage of a timetableMotion, but if the Whips could ensure the attendance of sufficientMembers to obtain a closure it should be possible to complete the Committee Stage without undue delay, on the floor of the Houseby sitting until 11 p.m. and resuming on the following morning.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the best course was to continue to fight theBill through the Committee Stage on the floor of the House and topresent a firm and united front to the opponents of the Bill. If thisposture was to carry conviction it was important that neithermembers of the Cabinet nor junior Ministers should give any ground for the belief that the Government were divided on the merits of theBill. In addition, the Lord President and the Chief Whip shouldsummon the Labour Members who were, in part, responsible forprolonging the discussion of the Bill, and impress upon them that,since the Government had no intention of giving way, theexpenditure of unnecessary time on the floor of the House could onlyprejudice the despatch of other Government business.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their intention to secure the passage of the parliament (No. 2) Bill.(2) Agreed that the Committee Stage of the Bill should becontinued on the floor of the House.(3) Invited the Lord President and the Chief Whip to speak tothe opponents of the Bill among the governments supporters on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.CONFIDENTIALOverseaAffairsActionCommitteefor a UnitedStates ofEurope(previous reference:CC (68) 39thConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Foreign and Commonwealth.Secretary said that theAction Committee for a United States of Europe had held a usefulmeeting in London on 11th March under M. Jean Monnefschairmanship. This had been the first meeting of the Committee tobe attended by representatives of the British political parties. such meetings served to keep up interest in British entry into the european economic Community (e.c.) both on the Continent and in thiscountry. The Committee had decided to set up four study groupscovering monetary affairs, agriculture, technology and institutions.It was expected that the reports of these groups would confirm that
there was no well-founded basis for the objections which had been raised to British accession to the e.c.. A further meeting of theCommittee would be held in Bonn in May, when it was hoped toconsider preliminary reports from the study groups.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Government would inno way be committed to these reports, since the Action committee itself was composed of representatives of Parliamentary Parties andTrade Unions and not of Governments. However, in view of theeminence of those responsible for the studies, it could be expectedthat their impact would be generally helpful. M. Edgar Pisani wasdealing with agriculture, Professor Hallstein with institutions, LordPlowden with technology and Signor Guido Carli with monetaryaffairs.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had hada useful discussion with Dr. Mahmoud Fawzi, the Egyptian ForeignMinister, on 10th March. Dr. Fawzi had emphasised that it was more important for Egypt to obtain a good settlement than a quicksettlement. Dr. Fawzi had said that the only solution he couldforesee was for the four Powers to agree on the basis of a settlement and then to apply pressure to persuade both the Arab and Israelisides, however reluctantly, to accept it. It was expected that four-Power talks would begin during the coming week.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the latestmessage from the Salisbury regime had been no more than arecapitulation of the line they had taken during the discussions inHMS Fearless. It did not amount to anything like the fresh plan atwhich Mr. Smith had hinted in some of his speeches. The regime&apos;attitude on the second safeguard remained unchanged. Equally,Mr. Selwyn Lloyd&apos;s account of his discussions in Salisbury had revealed no new development. A reasoned reply had been sent tothe regime explaining why we could not accept what they proposed.If the regime put it about that our reply had been an unhelpful one,they could be invited to come forward withconstructive proposals oftheir own. Commonwealth Governments and the United States,Portuguese and South African Governments had been informed ofthe general tenor of the exchanges which had taken place.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, followingan encouraging report from Mr. Lee, a former Colonial civil servantwho was well known in Anguilla, Mr. Whitlock, the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Common-wealth Affairs, had arrived in the island by air on 11th March. Hehad been well received at the airport but later in the day Mr. Webster,the separatist leader in Anguilla, and his supporters changed theirattitude. Hostile demonstrations had taken place during which shots
pCONFIDENTIAL3.. The First Secretary of State said that her Department hadnot yet succeeded in bringing the Ford Motor Company and the tradeunions together. Talks were continuing but even if they did notbreak down they would have to be adjourned later in the day toenable some of the trade union representatives to attend meetings inYork. Fords had withdrawn their legal action and had undertaken to renegotiate the clauses in the agreement to which the trade unionsobjected as soon as work was resumed. The unions were confusedand divided. The Electrical Trades Union strongly supported thecompany&apos;s line. The Transport and General Workers Union(T &amp; GWU) and the Amalgamated Union of Engineering andFoundry Workers (AEF) were insisting that the agreement must berenegotiated, to remove the so-called penal clauses and provide afurther increase in pay, before work was resumed. The company were concerned about the cost of the strike but recognised that theconsequences of giving into the militants&apos; demands would be muchmore damaging. There was now a real possibility of a prolongedstrike but this would, in her view, have to be faced despite the harmit would do to the economy. She proposed, if the talks broke down,to make a statement in Parliament that afternoon.IndustrialAffairsWageNegotiationin the motor industry(previous reference:CC (69) 11thConclusions,Minute 3)were fired. Mr. Whitlock had been advised to leave the island andhad done so. He was expected to arrive in London during the courseof that day. Until he had reported, it would be premature to decide what our next steps should be. News of his return from Anguillaand of the circumstances in which he had left the island had alreadybroken and Mr. Whitlock would be warned to say nothing of substance to the Press before reporting to the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.In discussion, it was pointed out that a frigate had been standingoff during Mr. Whitlock&apos;s visit, but that it had been decided not tomake any visible show of force, which might have worsened theprospect of an eventual political solution to .the problem of the island&apos;s future. It would, however, be advisable to keep the frigateavailable in case of emergencies.The Cabinet (1) Took   note   of  the  statements  by   the  Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary:(i) To report on developments in the Anguilla situation as soon as further information was available.(ii) To remain in touch with the Defence Secretary in casea situation arose in which a frigate might have to be despatched to Anguilla.
SECRETOverseaPolicyNigeria(previous reference:CC (69) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (C (69) 24) on policy towards Nigeria.The. Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that policy towards Nigeria had been considered on several occasions. Theimmediate occasion for the present review had been the concernwhich had been expressed in Parliament and by the public at largeover the bombing of civilians in rebel-held territory. His own viewremained that the truth of the matter was as had been set outin paragraphs 2-6 of C (69) 24, namely that the bombing of civilianshad not been a deliberate act of policy, but that there had beenrecklessness   and   disregard   of   orders   by   individual   pilots.In discussion it was emphasised that the strike could no longer be treated as an ordinary industrial dispute. It was clear that someof the trade union leaders involved were using the strike for politicalends and had no desire to reach a settlement. The leaders of theT &amp; GWU and the AEF in particular were concerned to assert theright of trade unions to complete freedom from government intervention and legal action. On the other hand it seemed clearthat a large number of Ford workers, especially at Dagenham, were opposed to the strike; and the possibility of holding a ballot, at anopportune moment, should be borne in mind. Careful consideration should be given to the way in which the issues at. stake were presented to the workers concerned and to the public generally. It would be important to make clear to the workers the effects which a prolongedstrike would have on industry and employment in Britain. Fordswas an international company which planned its operations in Europeregardless of national frontiers; and the strike might have a lastinginfluence on the company&apos;s willingness to expand production and investment at its British plants.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the strike raised issues of far-reachingimportance. He would have an opportunity, in a speech onMerseyside later in the week, to make a considered statement aboutthe Governments attitude. The general question of the way in whichthe issues should be presented to the public required further examination, and he would consider with the First Secretary how thisshould be undertaken.The Cabinet Took note, with, approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
Representations had been made to the Federal authorities throughboth the Nigerian High Commissioner in London and the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Lagos. In each case the reply hadbeen that instructions would be tightened up and offenders disciplined.The basic problem was whether it was right to maintain our policyof supplying arms to the Federal Government. This was a major issuewith far-reaching implications affecting the whole future of Africa. Itwas also a question on which there were genuine and deeply-helddifferences of opinion; and it was not possible to strike a clear balance between the moral issues involved and our material interests. WhenNigeria had become independent, the Commonwealth and the united nations had both accepted her for membership without reservations.Her unity and viability as a State had not been in question. If the war were to be halted and Colonel Ojukwu, the Biafran leader, were ableto achieve his objective of a continuing separate existence for&quot; Biafra&quot;, the Biafran secession would be followed by secessionselsewhere, leading to a period of increasing bloodshed in Africa. we might be tempted to feel that even if our policy was right inprinciple, it could not be sustained against the pressure of the criticismit had aroused; but if it were abandoned, any resulting relief wouldbe short-lived. Other African States with similar problems wouldcriticise us for the stimulus we would have given to secessionistmovements, while at home criticism from the opponents of ourpresent policy would merely be exchanged for better-justifiedcriticism from those who had loyally supported it. Last summer hehad said that if it were the intention of the Federal Government notmerely to preserve the unity of Nigeria, but to proceed without mercywith the slaughter and the starvation of the Ibo people, or ifthe Federal Government intended to take advantage of a militarysituation to reject a reasonable settlement, we should have to reconsider our policy. Neither of these contingencies had arisen.Charges of genocide had been conclusively refuted by theinternational observers; and the Federal Government had repeatedlydeclared their readiness to consider any solution consistent with themaintenance of Nigerian unity. He had therefore reached theconclusion that it would be neither right nor wise to1 cut of farms supplies to the Federal Government. At the same time, he attached great importance to the proposals for concurrent action setout in the conclusion (paragraph 16, (l)-(5)) of his memorandum.We should do what we could to promote negotiations between thecontending parties and bring the war to an end in a mannerconsistent with the concept of &quot;one Nigeria&quot;. The prospect of a clear-cut Federal military victory was receding, and this might increase Federal willingness to negotiate. But a cease-fire in isolationwould merely afford Colonel Ojukwu a respite and an opportunity tobuild up his military strength.  The Federal Government would not
accept this, and could not be expected to do so. A cease-fire wouldmake sense only if it were accompanied by an effective arms embargo.One possible method of opening the way to a comprehensive settlement comprising a cease-fire, an arms embargo and theinstitution of &quot; mercy corridors &quot; for relief would be to try to induce the two sides to meet without preconditions and without a cease-fire.This had been attempted when Chief Awolowo, Vice-President of theFederal Executive Council, had been in London for the Common-wealth Prime Ministers&apos; Meeting, but had failed owing to the lack ofresponse from the unofficial Biafran representatives. Any steps we might be able to take towards negotiations must be taken in close consultation with the Organisation of African Unity and with thelatter&apos;s support. There was increasing resentment in Africa at theidea that the Nigerian problem could be solved without reference toAfrican opinion.In conclusion the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatthere were grave and decisive arguments against any major changein our Nigerian policy. In his view we should press on with the policyadvocated in his paper.In discussion, it was pointed out that the bombing of civilians bythe Federal forces had created a situation which had been ablyexploited by Biafran propaganda and in which we could not evadethe moral responsibilities which attached to us in virtue of our relationship with the Federal Government. So far as the militarysituation was concerned, there seemed to be little prospect of a clear-cut decision in the foreseeable future. Hitherto, responsibleviews on the prospects of an early Federal victory had differed; andour representatives in Lagos had perhaps been over-optimistic in thisrespect. In any event, however, it was now likely that for as long as could at present be foreseen Biafra would maintain some form of separate identity. We should have to take account of this, whilebearing in mind that we should have to live with the federal government as well. While it was clearly desirable to bring the two sides to the conference table as soon as possible, there were limits towhat either side could be expected to accept. In particular, theattitude of the Federal Government on the question of Nigerian unitywould be crucial. While differing degrees of emphasis were laid onthe extent to which account must be taken of Federal views and the degree of pressure which should be applied to General Gowon toagree to enter into negotiations unconditionally and without insistingthat Nigerian unity was not negotiable, it was generally agreed that interms of the possible repercussions throughout Africa of encouragingsecessionist movements, the danger of driving the federal government into the arms of the Soviet Union, and the risk ofSECRET10357 b
stimulating reprisals against our very valuable economic interests andthe 16,000 British subjects still in Nigeria, the arguments against a major change in present policy were decisive. So far as the domesticsituation was concerned, while a change of policy might afford someshort-term relief, in the long term the Government might find that ithad merely alienated its supporters without appeasing its critics.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it hadafforded ample evidence of the concern which Ministers and he himself felt over the Nigerian situation. This concern was shared byopinion in the country as a whole. However, it was clear that therewas no case for a unilateral abandonment by the British Governmentof their policy of supplying arms to the Federal Government, andthere was nothing to be gained either domestically or in the field offoreign relations by a change of direction. We must have a viableand defensible policy; and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s proposals provided this. The discussion which had takenplace would be of great assistance to the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretajy in deciding how best to present the Governmenfs policy inthe forthcoming foreign affairs debate. The Permanent Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, would bereturning in the course of the day from his discussions with the PrimeMinister of the Federal Military Government in Lagos. It might be advisable for the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to report further to the Cabinet after he had seen the Permanent Under-Secretary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.secret parliament 5.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Prime MinisterDeclaration of (c (69) 25) and the Paymaster General (C (69) 26) on the employmentMembCT^of       Members 0^ Parliament to represent pressure groups in ParliamentParliament and anc* the registration of propagandists for oversea interests.the Registration .       - . . . , \ ,of Agents for &quot;e Pnme Minister said that he had set out in his memorandumOversea        the main considerations which had emerged during a preliminaryInterests        discussion in the Parliamentary Committee.   There were twoproblems which overlapped but could be distinguished. The first wasthe problem presented by the employment of Members of parliament on a salaried or fee paid basis to represent particular interests,frequently without other Members being aware of the connection;the present rules on &quot; declaration of interest&quot; were effective only inthe case of directors and substantial shareholders in firms likely to be directly affected by the matter under discussion and took no accountof the growing practice of employing Parliamentary consultants. This
was essentially a subject for Parliament itself to review; one possibility would be to appoint a Select Committee for the purpose,but for staffing and other reasons it might be better to refer the matter to the Committee of Privileges. The second problem was presented by public relations firms attempting to influence Parliament, theGovernment, and public opinion, sometimes by exploiting radio and television programmes, on behalf of foreign Governments, of regimessuch as those in Rhodesia and Biafra, and of foreign interests such asthe Katanga lobby. Here he thought that it was for the Governmentto give a lead, though that did not rule out examination by a SelectCommittee, and&apos;they  could benefit from the experience of the UnitedStates, where registration of foreign lobbyists had been compulsoryfor 30 years. There was growing public concern; and the feeling inthe Parliamentary Committee had been that a statement of theGovernment^ intentions should be made this week. A suggested textwas attached to his memorandum.The Paymaster General said that she had endeavoured to summarise in her memorandum the provisions of the relevant UnitedStates statutes. They went very wide and required all propagandistson behalf of foreign Governments and interests to register, to supplyinformation about their activities, and to file copies of all materialsent through the mails, though there was no restriction on theactivities of the propagandists as such. Careful study would be needed before firm conclusions could be drawn, but on a preliminaryview it seemed that it should be possible to adapt this model to meetthe requirements of this country; decisions would, however, have tobe taken on a number of points, such as how foreign governments were to be denned, whether the requirements should extend to unpaidpropagandists, the treatment of oversea firms whose business activitieshad political implications, and the position of the Press and the bookindustry. She suggested that a working party of officials be set upto consider these and allied points urgently with a view to an early statement and possible legislation.In discussion it was agreed that the Committee of Privilegeswould be the best body to investigate the activities of Members. TheCommittee ought to consider not merely the form in which adeclaration of interest should be made but also the circumstances inwhich it should be required; whom a Member represented was relevant not merely to the speeches he made in the House, but to hisother public activities and in particular to his dealings with Ministers.Some anxiety was expressed lest the Committee might embark on aroving inquiry, and it was suggested that their terms of referencewould need to be carefully drawn to prevent the investigation of individual cases which might draw damaging attention to the practiceof some trade unions of sponsoring a number of Members ofParliament and result in embarrassing the Government.
CONFIDENTIALCabinetRelease ofOfficialInformation6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C (69) 21) on the release of official information.It was suggested, and the Cabinet agreed, that, since the PrimeMinister^ paper required fuller consideration than it could be givenin the time available that morning, it should be remitted to theParliamentary Committee for preliminary discussion.On the problem presented by the activities of public relationsfirms operating on behalf of oversea interests, it was suggested thatit would be unwise to make a statement of Government policy, let alone hint at legislation, until more thorough consideration had beengiven to the implications of the possible courses open to theGovernment. One view which commanded considerable support wasthat the best course might be to set up a pre-legislation SelectCommittee to investigate the activities of public relations firms, to test Parliamentary opinion and to consider the legal and other problems involved in legislation. The American example suggestedthat the publicity which the firms would receive would be at least as effective in limiting their activities as any system of registration, andin this way the Government would preserve some freedom of action.It was impossible to say at this stage where any investigation might lead. If the topic were referred to such a Committee it would bedesirable to let it be known that the Government were aware of thedifficulties in the way of legislation, perhaps in their evidence to theCommittee which could be published.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that more thought should be given tothe issues involved before any decisions were taken or any statement made. He would arrange for the Parliamentary Committee toconsider further in the light of their discussion the best way oftackling the problems of declarations of interest by Members and ofpublic relations agencies operating, whether in the House or in thecountry generally, on behalf of oversea interests. The parliamentary committee should also consider the terms of a possible statement.He would report their views to the Cabinet. Before any of theproblems were referred to the Select Committee it would be desirableto consult the Opposition parties on the terms of the necessaryMotions.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theParliamentary Committee to consider the matter further asindicated in his summing up.
TransportPolicyHighwayStrategy:Draft GreenPaperCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (69) 23) covering a draft Green Paper on HighwayStrategy.The Minister of Transport said that since an earlier draft of the green Paper had been considered by the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy he had arranged for it to be redraftedto take account of the points made in discussion, particularly the emphasis on the importance of roads for the promotion of regional development. The Paymaster General, with whom he had been askedto consider the presentation of the document, agreed both with the revised text and with his new proposals for the main map. Thiswould show the boundaries of the economic planning regions and themain centres of population, including New Towns. It would be accompanied by four larger-scale maps on which the plans for particular regions could be more clearly seen. If the Cabinet agreed,the Green Paper could be published on 26th March.In discussion it was suggested that the current traffic and accidentloss criteria did not take account of the external benefits of road construction. Paragraph 17 of the draft might be amended toemphasise the part played by roads in stimulating economic development and to indicate that the Government would be giving further weight to that factor in assessing priorities. On the otherhand, it was argued that the planning of link and developmentalroads was a second stage which would follow the planning of the strategic network and that it would be unwise to reducethe importance attached to the direct economic return as the maincriterion for the selection of road projects. It was also suggested thatthere might be adverse reactions to the omission from the map of theproposed Calder Valley road, the case for which the Cabinet hadalready accepted in principle.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thepoints made in discussion might be met by amending the last twolines of paragraph 17 of the draft to read &quot; of those cases whereconnection to the network can enable areas at present deprived of adequate road communications to achieve a higher degree ofeconomic development &quot;, and by inserting a reference to consultations with the local authorities particularly in respect of regional and local the Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theParliamentary Committee to consider C (69) 21 and would report the discussion to the Cabinet.
needs, including roads connecting with New Towns. Subject to these points, the Cabinet endorsed the Minister of Transports proposal to publish the Green Paper on 26th March.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport (i) to arrange for the Green Paper on Highway Strategy to be revised on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up;(ii) to arrange for the Green Paper to be published on26th March.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th March, 1969.
