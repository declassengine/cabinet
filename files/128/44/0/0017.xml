ParliamentaryAffairsIndustrialRelations Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)10365a 2SECRETThe Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet wouldhave seen the record of the discussion which he and the first secretary of State had had on 11th April with the Acting general secretary and members of the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC). He had undertaken to report their views to theCabinet and had assured them that they would be very fully considered.The TUC had expressed the strongest objection to what theydescribed as the introduction of criminal law into the field ofindustrial relations; and they were bitterly opposed to the proposal that penalties imposed by the Industrial Board should, in certaincircumstances, be collected by the attachment of earnings. they also objected to the proposal for compulsory strike ballots, and a concession on this point might influence some members of theGeneral Council to take a more favourable attitude to theGovernments proposals as a whole. There was no indication thatthe TUC would be able to suggest, within a reasonable time, any effective alternative method of dealing with the problem to whichthe Governments proposals were directed. In the light of thediscussion with the TUC and of the increasing public interest in thematter, it would in his view be wrong to delay the introduction oflegislation until the next session. He accordingly proposed that theChancellor of the Exchequer should announce in general terms inhis Budget Speech that the Government intended to introduce an interim Bill on industrial relations during the current session; and as a separate point that they did not propose to introduce new legislation on prices and incomes when the 1968 Act expired. TheFirst Secretary, who had given preliminary consideration to the content of an interim Bill on the lines set out in the memorandum which had been circulated at the beginning of .their meeting (nowcirculated as C (69) 36), would explain the Governments intentionsmore fully when she spoke in the Budget debate on 16th April.The First Secretary of State said that the Industrial relations committee at a meeting earlier that day had agreed in principle thatthe Government should aim to secure a short interim Bill before the summer Recess. The Committee had also agreed that the Bill should contain provisions to give individual employees the right to belong to a trade union; to order an employer to recognise and negotiate with a trade union; to amend the present rules about disqualificationfor unemployment benefit; to provide for a conciliation pause in serious unconstitutional strikes; and to establish the Industrial Board.The majority of the Committee were, however, of the view that, in place of powers to order a strike ballot, it would be preferable to
take powers to deal with inter-union recognition disputes. She was ready to accept this change from her original proposals. A major problem remained in respect of the proposal to attach wages to collect penalties imposed on individual strikers. There was bitteropposition to this proposal, partly due to misunderstanding, but atpresent there seemed to be no satisfactory alternative means of enforcement in the last resort. It could not be done through thePA YE income tax system. It might be possible to provide an option,in cases of failure to pay, of attachment of wages or the existingprocedures for collection of civil debts. In any case, the Bill wouldcategorically rule out imprisonment for failure to pay these financialpenalties. She had considered the possibility of using any penaltiescollected for the benefit of the trade union movement or, for example,of workers laid off on account of strikes. Despite the attractions ofsuch an arrangement, it would give rise to serious practical difficulties,but she was considering urgently whether these could be surmounted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as a result of thediscussions which had taken place over recent weeks in the Committeeon Future Prices and Incomes Policy, he had come to the conclusionthat it would be virtually impossible in practice to replace the prices and Incomes Act, 1968, by fresh legislation when it expired at theend of this year. If his colleagues reached the same conclusion, it seemed important that he should announce this decision in his budget statement. It would be most damaging particularly to foreignconfidence in sterling if he and other Ministers were to defend thewhole of the existing prices and incomes legislation in the Budgetdebate and the Government then announced a few months later thatthey did not propose to introduce new legislation. This would leave a strong impression that he had been reluctantly compelled to acceptthe views of the majority of his colleagues. The Budget statementprovided a good opportunity to announce that it was not proposedto introduce new prices and incomes legislation, provided that thestatement also announced the Governmenfs intention to introducethis summer a short interim Bill on the lines suggested by the first secretary of State. If the Government failed to legislate forthwithon this issue, they would come under increasing pressure over thenext six to nine months, both from the great weight of public opinion which was concerned about the damage being done to our economyby industrial disputes and from opponents of such legislation withinthe trade union movement and amongst the Governmenfs supporters.It was clearly desirable that the Governmenfs intentions about futureprices and incomes policy and industrial relations should be announced together, although it was not intended that they should form a package. He therefore proposed that he should say in his budget statement that the Government did not intend to introducefresh prices and incomes legislation but would rely on Part II of the
CC17(69)Prices and Incomes Act, 1966, after the expiry of the Prices and incomes Act, 1968; and that they intended to introduce a shortinterim Bill on Industrial Relations.In discussion it was argued that the Cabinet would be unwise to take hasty decisions on matters of such importance. They should seek to work out, in consultation with the TUC, who had alreadyshown signs of modifying their attitude on certain of theGovernment^ proposals, a package which the trade union movementas a whole could accept. On the other hand it was generally recognised that, while there might be room for argument about the effectiveness of some of the proposals in the White Paper, the case for early legislation was very strong. There was a great deal ofmisunderstanding about the position on the attachment of earnings.There was no question of introducing criminal law into the field ofindustrial relations, nor would penalties imposed by the IndustrialBoard be fines. A massive educational campaign would be needed to remove this and other misconceptions about the governments proposals. The strength of the opposition to the attachment of earnings should, however, be recognised and every effort made to devise ways of mitigating it for example, by providing that financialpenalties collected from workers taking part in unconstitutionalaction should be paid into a fund which could be used to compensateother workers who were laid off as a result or for some other beneficialpurpose agreed with the TUC.In further discussion it was suggested that there was much tobe said for making it known immediately that the Government didnot intend to take power to require strike ballots. This provision was in any case of very doubtful merit and to drop it now might help to secure the support of moderate trade union opinion for theGovernments other proposals. On the other hand it was argued that it would be damaging to the Government to retreat at thisstage from any of the major proposals in the White Paper. Thereshould be further discussions with the TUC who might be persuaded to agree to insist on the inclusion, in the rules of affiliated unions, ofprocedures for holding strike ballots. It was also suggested that itwould be better to keep the power to require strike ballots and to drop the conciliation pause which was bound to be ineffective andwould be quickly seen to be so. But the general view was that theconciliation pause must be retained because of its relevance to theproblem of unofficial strikes, which was of great public concern.The need for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to include a reference to future prices and incomes policy in his Budget speechwas widely recognised. There was considerable support for the view
that it would not be practicable to introduce new legislation on prices and incomes when the 1968 Act expired, and that it would be best tomake this clear immediately. On the other hand it was pointed outthat the Committee on Future Prices and Incomes Policy had notyet reached conclusions and it would therefore be premature to announce a decision now. It would moreover be most unwise to announce a decision not to renew the 1968 Act at a time whenexcessive increases in incomes were endangering the success of theGovernments economic policy. Developments between now and theend of the year might force the Government to change their mindson the need for fresh powers related to incomes and in any eventthere was a case for not allowing the existing powers over prices tolapse. It was further suggested that a decision to rely on Part II ofthe 1966 Act for the implementation of their prices and incomes policy generally need not preclude the Government from takingseparate powers to deal with rents and dividends. There would need to be discussions with the TUC, the Confederation of BritishIndustry and the National Board for Prices and Incomes about thenext phase of prices and incomes policy. It was generally recognisedthat the presentation of the Governments future intentions on prices and incomes would need very careful handling. It would be important to show that the Governments decisions were not beingtaken from weakness and that the fact that certain statutory powers were to be allowed to lapse did not imply that the policy was beingabandoned.Doubts were expressed about the practicability of securinglegislation on industrial relations before the Summer Recess. Ifdecisions on policy were taken quickly it should be possible for ashort Bill to be drafted in time for introduction during the whitsun recess. The scope and objects of the Bill were however likely tobe such as to make wide-ranging amendments possible and it would almost certainly be necessary to resort to a timetable motion in theHouse of Commons. The possibility of delay in the House of lords would also have to be borne in mind.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that in his Budget speech the Chancellor of theExchequer should announce in general terms that the government intended to introduce an interim Bill on Industrial Relations duringthe current session and that they did not propose to introduce new legislation on prices and incomes when the Prices and Incomes Act,1968, expired. The First Secretary of State would explain theGovernments intentions more fully in the course of her speech inthe Budget debate on 16th April. The Cabinet agreed that the interim Bill should include provisions, on the lines indicated in theFirst Secretary of StateS memorandum, to give individual employeesthe right to belong to a trade union; to order an employer to
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th April, 1969.recognise and negotiate with a trade union; and to amend the presentlegislation on disqualification for unemployment benefit. It shouldalso contain powers to secure a conciliation pause and to deal withinter-union recognition disputes. It would need to include provisionfor the collection and use of penalties imposed by the IndustrialBoard, but it was most important to find a satisfactory solution tothe problem of the attachement of earnings, to which many of theGovernments supporters were bitterly opposed. The proposal totake power to require unions to hold strike ballots should not be abandoned but there were practical objections to including it in the interim Bill and it should accordingly be left over for the second Bill.In the meantime, the proposal could be discussed with the TUC, whowould be entitled to press the case for abandoning it before thesecond Bill was introduced if they could show that subsequent changesin trade union rules and procedures made statutory powerssuperfluous.The Lord President, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState, the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Whip, should work out apractical timetable with the aim of securing the interim legislationbefore the Summer Recess. It was particularly important to maintainsecurity on their decisions which would form part of the budget statement.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the first secretary&apos; of State to announce the governments intentions on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministetssumming up.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for thepreparation of an interim Bill on Industrial Relations.(4) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the first secretary of State, the Lord Privy Seal and the chief whip, to prepare a timetable for the Bill.
