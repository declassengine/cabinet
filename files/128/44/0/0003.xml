IndustrialAffairsPolicy forIndustrialRelations:Draft white paper(previous reference:CC(69) 2ndConclusions)9795A 2SECRET1. The Cabinet considered a revised version of the draft white paper on Industrial Relations (C (69) 6), which had been circulatedby the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for employment and Productivity, and a memorandum on the conciliation pauseproposals (C (69) 7) by the Secretary of State for Social Services andthe Paymaster General.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that in discussion in the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations the section of thedraft dealing with the conciliation pause had been substantiallyimproved and a number of doubts had been cleared up but thisproposal remained as the one issue of policy on which agreement hadnot been reached in that Committee. The families of strikers who refused to obey an order to return to work would receive the samesupplementary benefit as those of any other strikers. While the pausewould apply to strikes where there was no existing conciliationprocedure, or the procedure was obscure, as well as to strikes whichwere strictly unconstitutional, an Order would not be made in thesecases until an adequate conciliation procedure had been provided.The White Paper must put forward some proposals for dealing withthe serious problem of unofficial strikes, and this was the best that hadbeen suggested. However, he remained doubtful whether the compulsory conciliation pause was practicable or desirable. It would therefore be better to present it more as an outline scheme to whichconstructive amendments would be welcome, and to make it clearthat the proposal would be withdrawn if the Trade Union Congress(TUC) came forward with an acceptable voluntary alternative. this approach was followed elsewhere in the White Paper; if it were usedhere the next few months might be spent in constructive consultationinstead of in conflict with the unions. Moreover, if the Governmentwere committed to a Bill with these proposals for next Session theymight find it impossible also to undertake new. prices and incomeslegislation even if economic circumstances made it essential. he therefore invited the Cabinet to agree that paragraph 96 of the draft white Paper should be amended on the lines shown in paragraph 4 ofC (69) 7.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Relations had agreed that something must be done about the serious problem of unofficial strikes. They alsounanimously agreed in rejecting the proposal by the RoyalCommission on Trade Unions and Employees Associations (the donovan Commission) for limiting the protection of Section 3 of theTrades Disputes Act, 1906, and the proposals of the Confederation
of British Industry (CBI) and of the Opposition. No alternative tothe conciliation pause had been put forward by Ministers. Herproposals were already stimulating some new thinking by the TUC.If the TUC put forward an effective and enforceable proposal-there could be a revolution in trade union behaviour and attitudes. But ifthe pressure were reduced by presenting the conciliation pause in theway proposed in C (69) 7 the TUC would bring forward unprovenpaper proposals on the basis of which they would expect theGovernment to withdraw their own. Moreover, to present theproposals as suggested would indicate weakness and indecision onthe part of the Government. The real choice was either to present theproposal in the White Paper as a workable and credible contribution to dealing with what all agreed was a serious problem, or to abandonit and to do less than the Donovan Commission had proposed. the mere existence of the powers, however, would be a real incentive tothe trade union movement to produce a workable alternative; in so faras they did so, the reserve powers would not have to be invoked. Shetherefore asked the Cabinet to agree that paragraph 96 of the draft white Paper should stand as drafted.In discussion, it was pointed out that of 17 recent unconstitutional strikes the majority had been settled in less than two weeks and mostof the remainder were concerned with pay.  An interval of up to a fortnight might normally be expected between the start of a strike and the enforcement of a conciliation pause, and the latter was generally expected not to be effective in dealing with disputes aboutpay. Thus, on recent experience, it was extremely doubtful whetherthe conciliation pause could be used to practical effect.  The main purpose of including the proposal was presumably therefore to spurthe trade union movement to produce their own effective measures todeal with unconstitutional strikes.   It was arguable whether this objective would be more likely to be achieved by presenting the pauseas a firm Government proposal, with an indirect hint that alternativesmight be considered, as in the draft White Paper, or as a tentativeproposal for discussion with the trade union movement and other interests concerned.  There was no doubt, however, that to present it as a firm proposal would embitter the trade union and Labourmovements.  Moreover, while there was general agreement that theconciliation pause could be introduced, at best, in only a very few cases, the present draft of the White Paper in effect demanded from thetrade union movement as the condition for dropping the proposal fully effective arrangements for.dealing with all unconstitutional strikes. Although it was intended to make clear in public presentationthat the reserve power to order a conciliation pause could be suitablyinvoked in only a few cases, public opinion would inevitably regard it as the Governments panacea for unconstitutional strikes.  As itsineffectiveness became apparent, public opinion would turn against...   - . - .)SECRET
9795the Government, who would have incurred the deep hostility of thetrade union movement to no good purpose. The proposed timetable for publication of the proposals now, followed by an interval of10 months before the introduction of legislation, greatly aggravatedthe problem. Mounting opposition in the trade union and Labourmovements in this interval would find its full expression at the annualconferences before the legislation had been introduced. If theconciliation pause was to be proposed at all in the White Paper, itshould be made clear that, in common with a number of other proposals, it would be the subject of consultation and discussion withthe trade union movement and other interested parties.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the ministerial committee on Industrial Relations had unanimously rejected the donovan Commission^ relevant recommendation that the protection given by Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act, 1906 should be givenin future to registered trade unions only; and all other proposals to deal with unconstitutional strikes had been found equallyunacceptable. It was the case that the conciliation pause could beexpected to help in only a small number of cases, but if it were usedsuccessfully to end one or two serious unconstitutional strikes, its influence would begin to bear more widely on the whole problem.The adverse effects of disruptive unconstitutional strikes on the economy and increasingly on industry&apos;s ability to obtain export ordersmust be tackled as soon as possible. The amendment to paragraph96 of the draft White Paper proposed in C (69) .7 would be clearsignal to the trade union movement and to the public that theGovernment were unable to decide on this crucial proposal andwould be ready to withdraw it if the trade union movement madealternative proposals, even though the effectiveness of the latter couldnot possibly be demonstrated before the Industrial Relations bill was introduced. The amendment would in practice pave the way tothe withdrawal of the proposals for a conciliation pause. If, however,the trade union movement came forward, after publication of theWhite Paper, with alternative proposals for dealing withunconstitutional strikes, these would be welcomed and it would be emphasised again as the draft White Paper already emphasised that to the extent that these alternatives were successful, the reserve powers to order a conciliation pause would not be needed.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the general view of the Cabinet was that the paragraphs dealingwith the conciliation pause in the draft White Paper attached toC (69) 6 were satisfactory.The Cabinet then considered the remainder of the draft white paper and approved a number of drafting amendments. In addition,the following points were made:
(a) The method of operation of the Industrial Board and the recovery of any penalties imposed by it in Scotland should be covered in paragraph 62 of the draft.(b) The First Secretary of State would consult the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer about the briefing which might be given to the Pressabout the scope of the proposed Trade Union Development Schemedescribed in paragraphs 71-75 of the draft White Paper.(c) If the trade union movement established fully independent and satisfactory machinery to deal with complaints against tradeunions by individuals, the Government should be prepared to reconsider the proposal, in paragraph 115 of the draft White Paper,to refer such complaints to the Industrial Board.(d) The Lord Privy Seal had agreed with other ministers concerned a formula for dealing with questions about the applicationof the proposals in the White Paper to the Armed Forces, the CivilService and other Crown servants.(e) The proposals in the White Paper would involve the eventualemployment of an additional 500 to 600 civil servants. It should bepossible to absorb this increase within the manpower ceiling for theCivil Service as a whole. The cost of the proposals, including the staff,had been offset by the additional savings, recently agreed, in public expenditure on the Redundancy Fund.(/) The First Secretary of State proposed to appoint theCommission on Industrial Relations by Royal Warrant when theWhite Paper was published. The Commission would subsequently be statutorily established by the Industrial Relations Bill. The draftterms of reference which had been proposed for the Commissionrequired some revision to emphasise its positive role.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the White Paper should be published onFriday, 17th January. The First Secretary was authorised to make further drafting amendments which did not involve changes of policyand would clear with the Secretary of State for Scotland any,amendment to paragraph 62 to take account of the different legal position in Scotland. After consultation with the Lord Chancellor,the Solicitor General and the Scottish Law Officers, the First Secretaryof State should circulate to the Cabinet for consideration at their meeting on Thursday, 16th January, the proposed terms of reference of the Commission on Industrial Relations. The Paymaster general would provide speaking notes on the subject for Ministers bySaturday, 18th January. The additional manpower required to carryout the proposals in the draft White Paper should be absorbed withinthe manpower ceiling for the Civil Service as a whole.
secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Lord President (C (69) 1) on the timing of legislation on industrial Relations.The Lord President said that as requested by the Cabinet he had discussed the timing of legislation further with the Chancellor of theExchequer and, in the absence of the First Secretary of State, with theJoint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department ofEmployment and Productivity (Mr. Hattersley). The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had advocated a fairly short Bill enacting in thepresent Session the principal controversial elements of the proposals in the White Paper, including those on the conciliation pause and thestrike ballot. They were advised, however, that it would be necessaryto work out the details of the totality of the measures after consultationwith both sides of industry before instructions for a preliminaryBill could be given and that it was unlikely that instructions wouldbe ready before Whitsun. Thereafter it would be necessary to allowsome weeks for actual drafting. Even, however, if a Bill could beready by July its passage could not be secured without taking all stages on the floor of the House and this would mean sacrificingsome legislation already in the Governments programme but notyet introduced. Among the Bills in this position were Children,Housing, National Insurance (Uprating), Pensions (increase) andTourism. Moreover to concentrate drafting resources on the hurriedThe Cabinet-CD Approved the text of the draft White Paper annexed toC (69) 6, subject to purely drafting amendments and thoseagreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to arrange for the White Paper to be published onFriday, 17th January;(ii) to circulate to the Cabinet for consideration at their meeting on Thursday, 16th January, the proposed terms of reference of the Commission on industrial relations to be established by Royal Warrant.(3) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider how the additionalcivil servants required to implement the proposals in theWhite Paper could be provided without exceeding the manpower ceiling agreed for the Civil Service as a whole.
preparation of an interim Industrial Relations Bill would delay thepreparation of major Bills for the next Session. He had concluded that it would be virtually impossible either to produce a Bill for introduction in the summer or to find Parliamentary time to pass it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he did not thinkthat it would be impossible to pass a short Bill in the present Session,he agreed that to do so would be extremely difficult and inconvenient.Nevertheless, there were weighty arguments touching the future ofthe Government in favour of enacting legislation on the morecontroversial aspects of the proposals in the current Session. failure to do so might close the option of introducing a Prices and incomes bill in the autumn since it would not be possible to take such a Bill atthe same time as the proposed major Bill on Industrial Relations, andthe Government might find themselves deprived of powers which, inthe circumstances of that time, they considered essential to thecontinued discharge of their public responsibilities.  This, however,was not the only consideration. It would be unwise to force a majorBill through against opposition from some of their own supporters inthe last Session of Parliament or to meet the trade unions and LabourParty Conferences in the autumn without having implemented the major proposals in the White Paper.  Moreover, there was a danger that if damaging strikes occurred in the interval between thepublication of the White Paper and the passage of legislation, publicopinion would fail to understand why time had been found for lessurgent Bills, while the Government had failed to arm themselves with powers which they had themselves declared to be necessary.  If theBill could be introduced in July, the greater part of the month shouldbe devoted to passing it, preferably through both Houses, but at leastthrough the House of Commons.The First Secretary of State said that when her proposed measures were seen as a whole she believed that the trade unions would accept that they were directed to strengthening the tradeunions and not weakening them. It would be politically most unwise to forgo this advantage by selecting for early enactment, inorder to satisfy public opinion, those parts of the Bill to which thetrade unions were particularly hostile: to do so would emphasise the penal aspects of the legislation. Nor could a preliminary Bill be short.A Bill of 50 to 60 clauses would be required to set up the machinery which provided the context in which the powers to impose aconciliation pause and to require a strike ballot were designed to operate.In discussion it was pointed out that, while it might be impossibleon political grounds to attempt to pass legislation on industrial relations and on Prices and Incomes at the same time, there might be advantage in postponing the Industrial Relations Bill until later in
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th January, 1969.the 1969-70 Session in order to reduce the period during which theGovernment, having taken new powers, would be exposed to criticism if, as was foreseen, it proved impossible to prevent every damagingstrike. On the other hand the advantage of passing a Bill in thecurrent Session would be largely lost if Royal Assent could not beobtained before the autumn conferences; and experience in earlierSessions had emphasised the importance of giving adequateconsideration to the preparation of a Bill and the harm that could bedone to the rest of the Governments programme if extraParliamentary time and drafting resources had to be found for aBill introduced towards the end of the Session. It might be possible,however, to reduce the time required for the preparation of a Billby preparing the major provisions before the consultations with thetrade unions were completed and, if necessary, amending the draftlater.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that while some members of the Cabinet were impressed by the political arguments in favour of passing a Bill in the current Session asproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a substantial majoritythought it not to be practicable to do so and agreed with the views expressed by the First Secretary of State. They agreed, however, that further consideration should be given to the matter in the light ofthe reactions of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the public ingeneral to the proposals set out in the White Paper.The Cabinet Agreed to consider further at a later date the timing oflegislation on Industrial Relations in the light of publicreactions to the White Paper.
