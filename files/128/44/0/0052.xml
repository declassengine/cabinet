The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week. The printing and distribution of Parliamentary papers would be subject to delayon account of an unofficial &quot; go slow &quot; in Her Majesty&apos;s stationery office. Emergency arrangements had been made to prepare anOrder Paper for the day and the presentation of Bills would not be delayed.It was hoped that it would be possible to make a statement in both Houses of Parliament on 5th November about the date of publication of the White Paper on the terms of abatement applicableto people who contracted out of the earnings-related pensions schemeand on the effect of the proposals on members of public sectorschemes. This should help to reassure the firemen and other groups in the public services who were concerned about the arrangementsfor contracting out. It would be helpful if in addition the general council of the Trades Union Congress were to come out in favourof the Governmenfs proposals. Although the National Associationof Local Government Officers and other interests had succeeded inarousing strong opposition to the scheme, the arguments in favour ofthe Governmenfs proposals were very strong. It was important that they should be put across effectively as soon as possible; andit would be helpful if a debate on the White Paper could be arrangedshortly after its publication.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was clear that the Lebanese President, Mr. Helou, would have to make further concessions to the Arab guerilla movement (the Fedayyin).This would lead to further difficulties with Israel, who for her partwas continuing her raids across the Suez Canal. The real centre ofgravity had now shifted to Cairo; and the Government of theUnited Arab Republic could be expected to bring pressure to bearon the Lebanon for concessions to the Fedayyin. The FrenchGovernment had made a statement expressing sympathy for theLebanese President and calling for the resumption of the four power talks. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary did not thinkthat any useful purpose would be served by a statement by the10651A 2CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to send on their behalf a message of congratulations to His Royal Highness The Prince of wales on the occasion of his 21st Birthday.
British Government, though we shared the French Governmenfsview that the four power talks should be resumed; and he also considered that these should give effective guidance to the special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General, Dr. Jarring.Israeli Elections The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the IsraeliElections had resulted in some increase in right-wing representation in the Knesset, but that no major change in policy was to beexpected. It was of interest that despite hostile propaganda fromthe Arab states a quarter of the Arab electors in East Jerusalemhad voted. This spoke well for the Israeli Administration^ treatmentof the Arabs.Libya(previous reference:CC (69) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)AustralianElectionsBritishSubjects inChina(previous reference:CC (69) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Libya had recently visited London for consultations. Shortly after his return to his post, the Libyanregime had handed him a note verbale requesting Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to enter into negotiations with a view to the earlyevacuation of British forces from Libyan territory. This step wasa natural and not unexpected consequence of the Libyan revolutionitself. It was clear that our future relationship with Libya wouldhave to be placed on an entirely different footing from that whichhad prevailed in the days of the monarchy and the Anglo-LibyanTreaty of 1953. It should be possible to achieve this: the Libyanshad a number of requests to put to us, e.g. in the field of armaments,which might form a basis for negotiation. He intended to put his proposals to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee in thecourse of the following week.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theAustralian Government had been returned to power but with a reduced majority. The Minister of External Affairs, Mr. Freeth,had been defeated at the polls, possibly as a result of a somewhatill-judged speech in which he had expressed the view that Australiahad no reason to be concerned about a Soviet naval presence in australian waters. It seemed likely that he would now be replaced by Mr. Fairbairn. The Government^ relative lack of success inthe first general election fought under Mr. Gorton&apos;s leadership was likely to weaken Mr. Gorton&apos;s position as a Party leader.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that afterreleasing Mr. Anthony Grey and other prisoners, the ChineseGovernment now appeared to be taking a harder line, and hadarrested two elderly British residents in Shanghai, a man and a woman. This might, however, be a local initiative on the part ofthe Shanghai authorities, since officials in Peking had professedignorance of the arrests. Representations would continue in these and other cases.
Nigeria The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the(Previous International Red Cross were still trying to obtain the agreement ofReference *CC (69) 5lst tne Bialran leader, Colonel Ojukwu, to the plan for relief suppliesConclusions, already agreed with the Federal Military Government (FMG). the minute 2)       United States Government had agreed to make a statement ofconfidence in the good faith of the FMG; and Colonel Ojukwu&apos;sreaction to this was being awaited.Visit to The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the SouthLondon of African Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Muller, had recently visitedAfrican London.    During  the visit  the Foreign  and  CommonwealthMinister of Secretary had raised with him the question of Mr. Philip Golding,Foreign Affairs a British subject detained by the South  African authorities.Dr. Muller had indicated that Mr. Golding was likely to be releasedshortly, and had undertaken to consider our proposal thatMr. Golding should be placed in the care of the British Embassypending his being called as a witness in further prosecutions to beundertaken by the South Arican authorities. During the talks thequestion of South West Africa had been discussed. The SouthAfrican Government had produced an impressive volume ofdocumentation on their case for the United Nations; but the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had made clear to him our distaste fora number of features of the legal system under which South WestAfrica was administered. Dr. Muller had referred to the recentspeech by the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, about Anglo-South African relations in the field ofsport. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had said that thequestion of a visit by a South African cricket team next summer wasone for decision by the Marylebone Cricket Club and not by theGovernment. Mr. Howell had been speaking for himself and not as a Minister, but Dr. Muller must recognise that the views hehad expressed were shared by a great many people in Britain.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had also had a private conversation, of which highly coloured andinaccurate accounts had appeared in the London Press, withdraw. Muller (who had himself raised the matter) about the latter&apos;speeches in London. He had told Dr. Muller that there was likelyto be sharp criticism in this country of his reported preference fordealing with a Conservative Government in Britain. Dr. Mullerhad replied that this had been an unjustified interpretation of his remarks by one British newspaper and that he had not in fact saidanything of the kind.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.SECRET10651 b*
IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelations Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first Secretaryof State and Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity(C (69) 148) about the contents of a comprehensive industrial relations Bill.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Relations had considered the proposals set out in annex 1 to her paper for inclusion in the Industrial Relations Billon the understanding that there would need to be further detailed consideration of these proposals. The Committee had agreed thatthe Bill should generally cover the items in Annex 1, subject to tworeservations. First, there was the relatively minor question of whether the Bill should include provisions requiring the larger tradeunions to appoint qualified auditors and make available to their members information about their superannuation funds. these provisions seemed desirable in themselves; but they might wellprovoke strong opposition from the Trades Union Congress (TUC).At present, some of the largest unions did not employ qualifiedauditors to audit their accounts; and it was desirable that this shouldbe changed. However, it would be difficult to impose a statutoryrequirement to employ qualified auditors without making new statutory requirements about the superannuation funds, since thesetwo matters had been linked by the Royal Commission on TradeUnions and Employers Associations (the Donovan Commission) intheir report and by the Government in their White Paper (&quot; In Placeof Strife &quot;, Cmnd. 3888). Some of the superannuation schemes were,at present in bad shape and the trade unions might raise strong objections to any requirement to publish information. Sheaccordingly proposed that she should discuss both of these proposalsfirst with the TUC and, if she met with strong opposition, she shouldnot press for their inclusion in the Bill.The second, and more serious, problem was whether the present law relating to inducement of a breach of a commercial contractshould be amended. The Donovan Commission had recommendedthat the protection at present given to strike leaders should beextended in order to protect from any legal action for inducing a breach of any commercial contract (not just a contract ofemployment). The majority of the Donovan Commission had,however, further recommended that protection from legal action should only be given to registered trade unions and not, for example,to unconstitutional strikers. The White Paper had placed on record the Governmenfs intention to accept the recommendation to extendprotection as the Donovan Commission had recommended; but ithad also made clear that this extension would be accompanied by statutory powers enabling the Secretary of State to require a ballot
CC 52(69)before an official and to require a conciliation pause before anunconstitutional &quot; sympathetic &quot; strike. Although the Government,following the undertaking given by the TUC in June, had droppedtheir proposals for the statutory ballots and conciliation pause, theyhad done so because they were satisfied that the TUC would be ableto develop satisfactory alternative means of checking unconstitutionaland inter-union disputes. In these circumstances, the Governmentwould be in some difficulty in excluding from the Bill this extensionfor protection for &quot; sympathetic &quot; strikes to which the TUC attached great importance. On the other hand, if the change were made andthe present uncertainty about the law were consequently removed,there would almost certainly be some increase in &quot; sympathetic &quot;strikes as a result. Public opinion might, in any event, reactunfavourably to such an extension of protection if present conditionsin industry persisted. Nearly all the cases which had reached thecourts were concerned with situations where trade unions were seeking recognition. It could be argued that other provisions in theBill to provide the right of union membership and for settlingproblems of union recognition would avoid the need in the future forwidespread resort to &quot; sympathetic&quot; strikes in such cases. This,however, would leave the problem raised by a fairly recent case Emerald Construction Company v. Lowthian, 1966 which showed that as the law stood a trade union official could be sued if he tried to induce a contractor to break his contract with a labour-onlysub-contractor. If the present law were amended so that protectionwere afforded against liability for inducing a breach of a labour-onlysub-contract, this would remove an existing anomaly and would be consistent with the Governmenfs policy to discourage labour-onlysub-contracting in the construction industry. The industrial relations Committee accordingly recommended that this should bedone.In discussion, there was general agreement with the proposal by the First Secretary of State for amendment of the law oninducement of a breach of contract of employment. It was alsogenerally agreed that in one way or another the larger unions oughtto be required to appoint qualified auditors. If the TUC objected to legislation on the point, perhaps they themselves could be induced to introduce regulations to this effect. It was desirable that information about union superannuation funds should be maderegularly available to members. The application of the industrial relations Bill to the Crown would require careful consideration,which had been put in hand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Industrial Relations Bill should contain
provisions on the lines proposed in the numbered paragraphs 1 to 11of Annex 1 of C (69) 148. The proposals in paragraphs 13 to 15would require further consideration. The existing law in relationto inducement of a breach of a contract of employment should be amended as recommended by the Industrial Relations Committee,and not on the lines proposed by the Donovan Commission. TheCabinet agreed that, having taken this latter decision, theGovernment must-uphold it irrespective of pressures which might bebrought to bear upon them by the TUC or others. The first secretary of State should aim to secure the inclusion in the Bill of statutory provisions requiring the appointment of qualifiedauditors by the larger unions and the provision of information aboutsuperannuation funds. If the TUC strongly opposed a statutoryrequirement on auditors, she might offer them instead the alternative of TUC regulations to the same effect. The Cabinet agreed generally with the remaining proposals in Annex 1, subject to further detailed consideration of some of the items in particular the disclosure ofinformation to unions, enabling a union to be sued in tort, registration of collective agreements, friendly society rules, and the appointment ofworkers&apos; representatives to the boards of Companies. The social services Committee had agreed recently to two relevant changesin the law relating to trade dispute disqualification and supplementary benefits for strikers&apos; families. He would arrange for these proposed amendments in the law to be considered by the Cabinet in the context of the whole problem of the use of existing social security benefits of various kinds.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that:(i) subject to further detailed consideration by theCommittee on Industrial Relations the industrial relations Bill should contain provisions on thelines of the proposals in numbered paragraphs 1to 11 inclusive of Annex 1 of C (69) 148;(ii) the  existing  law  in  relation  to  protection ofinducement of breach of a commercial contractshould be amended only to the extent necessaLry toprotect strike leaders from legal action forinducing a breach of a labour-only sub-contract;(iii) the need for provisions on the lines of the proposals in numbered paragraphs 13 to 15 inclusive shouldbe further examined by the Committee on industrial Relations;
secret. The Home Secretary said that there was a risk that therewould be a strike of firemen, especially in London, on 5th November.This could have serious consequences; and he had arranged for theOfficial Committee on Emergencies to consider urgently what action should be taken to deal with them. It would be necessary to consider such questions as whether the Armed Forces should be called in todeal with fires and whether the public should be advised to refrain from lighting the traditional Guy Fawkes bonfires on that night.Although the Home Office was generally regarded as the department responsible for the Fire Service, he was not responsible for determing firemen&apos;s wages, which were settled by the normalprocess of industrial negotiation. He understood that nationalnegotiations were already under way; and it would be helpful if theycould be speeded up. There was a special problem in Londonarising from the reluctance of the Greater London Council to acceptthe recommendation of an independent committee under Sir WilliamWebber that firemen should receive a special housing allowance, onthe grounds that such an allowance would be taken as a precedentby their other employees.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theHome Secretary, to consider what could be done to settle the firemen&apos;s dispute with their employers.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Ministerialand Official Committees on Emergencies to consider urgently what action the Government should take to dealwith the consequences of a firemen&apos;s strike if it took place.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th October, 1969.(iv) provision should be made, either in the Bill or byTUC regulations, for the appointment of professional auditors by the larger trade unions;(v) new statutory provisions should be made regardingunion superannuation funds unless in priorconsultations the TUC expressed strong objectionto these.
