RacialDiscriminationandGovernmentContractsCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (69) 98) and the Attorney-General (C (69) 94) onRacial Discrimination and Government Contracts.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the question whichthe Cabinet were asked to decide was whether all government contracts should include a clause requiring the contractor not to discriminate unlawfully within the meaning of the Race relations act, and in addition to take all reasonable steps to ensure that therewas no discrimination by his employees and sub-contractors. Adecision in principle to include such a clause had been taken in 1967;but the Home Affairs Committee had decided recently, partly becauseof opposition from the Confederation of British Industry and theTrades Union Congress, that it would be better to abandon the ideaof a clause and instead append to the contract documents a note tothe effect that future contracts might be withheld from contractorsfound by the courts to be in breach of the Race Relations Act.Subsequently, however, a group of Ministers under his chairmanship,which included the Ministers with prime responsibility for race relations and the placing of contracts, had decided by a majority infavour of the insertion of a clause in the contract. The point at issue was essentially one of presentation. He entirely accepted that theclause would add little or nothing to the Governments powers, andthat even without it they were quite free to withhold future contractsfrom firms who discriminated. But it would have a powerfuldeclaratory effect; and the Race Relations Board (RRB) attached great importance to its inclusion, which would in their view makea more vivid impact than a simple exhortation. The Board would feel let down if the Government, who were known to be consideringthe question, decided not to include the clause; and in his judgmentthis consideration carried more weight than the arguments inprinciple which had been brought forward against the clause.He fully accepted that great care would be needed beforesanctions were imposed; and it had been agreed that no action should be taken without reference to the Ministers concerned. Butto restrict action, as the Attorney-General proposed, to cases wherethere had been a finding of discrimination by the courts would seriously restrict the usefulness of the arrangement. The RRB aimedwherever possible to achieve a settlement without reference to thecourts, and they saw the clause as a means of bringing pressure tobear on recalcitrant firms.The Attorney-General said that he had thought it right to ask,with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor, that the matter be brought before the Cabinet, in view of the conflict between the conclusions10632a 2
reached by the Home Affairs Committee and those reached by the subsequent meeting of Ministers. The proposed clause was in his view unnecessary; the Government required no authority to withhold contracts from any firm, and if a warning to contractorswere required it would be better given in another form. As regardsthe suggestion that future contracts might be withheld fromcontractors in breach of the clause, it was undesirable in principle,when there were already sanctions provided by law, for the executive to seek to impose a further penalty in the way suggested. If asanction was to be imposed, however, it should be only in caseswhere a Court had already found the contractor guilty of discrimination; otherwise cases might arise where contracts werewithheld from contractors who were subsequently cleared of discrimination. The right course to take in cases of allegeddiscrimination, assuming the proposed clause to be included in contracts, would be not to consider independent sanctions, but torefer the cases to the RRB, which could make its own investigationsand take legal proceedings where appropriate. Neither the RRBnor the Report of the Institute of Race Relations on Colour andCitizenship had advocated independent sanctions.In discussion there was support for both points of view, but amajority of those present favoured the inclusion of the proposedclause in Government contracts; it was pointed out that roadcontracts already carried a clause requiring conformity with any act of Parliament. The suggestion that the clause might be includedin contracts but no action taken to withhold contracts from offendersseemed an unsatisfactory compromise.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the proposed non-discrimination clause shouldbe included in Government contracts, but that no actionto withhold contracts should be taken without referenceto the Minister concerned.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make arrangements accordingly.PublicExpenditure1970-71(previous reference:CC (69) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (69) 97) summarising the results of thediscussions so far on public expenditure for 1970-71 and the itemsrequiring further discussion.The Cabinet first considered issues arising on Part I of the summary attached to C (69) 97.
Housing andLocalEnvironmentalServicesHealth andWelfareThe Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, following earlier discussions, he had now reached agreement with the Minister for planning and Land on the treatment of the expected shortfall in housing expenditure. The level of expenditure on housing and related programmes would be one of the factors taken into account when the time came to decide how far funds should be committedfor local authorities&apos; mortgages for house purchases in 1970-71.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that there was an urgent need for new housing in Scotland; moreover, cuts in public housinghad a proportionately greater impact on the total programme inScotland than in England, and he would therefore be able to findonly  6 million out of the  6-5 million savings for which he hadbeen asked under this head.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet provisionally endorsed the proposed reductionof  55 - 7 million in expenditure under this head; some of the saving on the Scottish housing programme could be found from otherScottish programmes if necessary. In view of the importance of thehousing programmes as a whole, however, the Housing ministers should circulate to the Cabinet a paper setting out the prospects for housing in the light of the Cabinefs provisional decisions. He wouldalso be putting to them proposals about future housing policy fortheir consideration.The Cabinet-(1) Provisionally approved reduction of  55-7 million in expenditure on housing and local environmental services.(2) Agreed that the Secretary of State for Scotland should have discretion, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to find from other Scottish programmes partof the  6-5 million of the total in (1) above attributable to Scotland.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotlandand for Wales, to circulate to the Cabinet a paper on housing prospects in the light of the reductions in housing expenditure provisionally approved by the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he wished the Cabinet to know that the  9 million savings on hospital building in 1970-71 for which he had been asked could be found only bydelaying all new starts for three months from October 1969.  this in turn could only be done by issuing instructions to that effect tothe Regional Hospital Boards, in whose control most of theprogramme lay.  This would amount to a public announcement ofa cut-back in the hospital building programme.   Such a step was
acceptable only as part of a package of general economy measures announced together by the Government. He could, however, find 5 million by deferment in that part of the programme under hisdirect control. He was satisfied that it would be practicable to save 9 million, as proposed, by charges for hospital treatment in all caraccident cases; the burden would fall chiefly on the insurance companies.In discussion, it was suggested that it might be possible to find 4 million savings from current expenditure on health and welfareinstead of- hospital starts. This would involve cutting back the 17 million of expenditure on new or improved services which theSecretary of State for Social Services intended to finance in 1970-71by offsetting savings of  17 million. It was suggested that the hospitalcharge for car accident cases was an inequitable levy on the insurance companies and thence on motorists as a whole. It would be preferable to raise the sum directly by increasing the excise licenceon cars.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet would for the moment provisionally agree toa reduction of  5 million in the hospital building programme, whichwas possible without any public announcement. The additional 4 million and the corresponding expenditure in Wales and scotland would be considered further, along with certain other sensitive items,at the end of the present discussions on public expenditure for1970-71. The Cabinet also provisionally agreed the proposedcharges for hospital treatment in car accident cases, but this couldbe considered further at their next discussion if Ministers so wished.The Cabinet-(4) Provisionally approved a reduction of approximately 19 million in health and welfare expenditure for 1970-71,including  5 million by deferring hospital building inEngland.(5) Agreed to give further consideration to the possibility of saving an additional  4 million by deferring hospital building in England; and to corresponding additional savings in Wales and Scotland.The Cabinet then considered Part II of the summary attachedto C (69) 97.Education The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, having considered further the points raised in earlier discussions, he was now preparedto agree that the proposed imposition of a charge for school transport should be dropped, provided all the other proposed savings underthis head were made, including the increase to 2s. in the charge for school meals.
CC37(69)In discussion it was suggested that an increase in the school meals charge was a highly regressive tax and one whose incidenceon wages at certain levels could have serious disincentive effects.It was doubtful whether a tapering scheme to mitigate the worsteffects would be administratively practicable. On the other hand,it was argued that charges were the only alternative to cuts in expenditure; in this particular field, the poorest families wereprotected by a system of remissions.In further discussion, it was suggested that the proposed savings on the school building minor works programme might slow down the provision of new classrooms as extensions to existing schools,as well as delaying the replacement and improvement of unsatisfactory accommodation.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the proposed increase in the charge for school meals, theproposed school transport charge, and  1 million of the proposedsavings on the minor works programme, should be considered withother sensitive items at the conclusion of the discussion. The othersavings proposed, including at least  5 million on minor works, wereendorsed.The Cabinet-(6) Provisionally agreed that the school building minor works programme for 1970-71 should be reduced by at least 5 million.(7) Provisionally approved the proposed reductions of 0-5 million and  2 million in expenditure in 1970-71on university&apos; equipment and recurrent grants to universities respectively.(8) Provisionally approved reductions of  1 million and 0 - 6 million in miscellaneous expenditure on education in 1970-71 in England and Wales and in Scotlandrespectively.(9) Agreed to give further consideration to the proposals toincrease the charge for school meals, to impose charges for school transport, and to save a further  1 million on school building minor works.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had reached agreement withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer that expenditure on implementing the recommendations of the Fulton Report on the Civil service should be reduced to  6-51 million in 1970-71.The Cabinet-(10) Provisionally approved a reduction of  2-92 million in expenditure on the Civil Service in 1970-71.
ScotlandAgriculture,fisheries and ForestryFinancialAdministrationCommonServicesNorthernIrelandThe Cabinet-(11) Provisionally approved a further saving of  0-1 million on expenditure in Scotland, and invited the Secretary ofState for Scotland to consider with the Chancellor of theExchequer how this saving might be obtained.The Cabinet then considered Part III of the summary attachedto C (69) 97.The Minister of Agriculture said that he would now find it possible to make further savings of  0-6 million, giving a total reduction of  2 million in expenditure on agriculture, fisheries and forestry.The Cabinet-(12) Provisionally approved a further reduction of  0-6 million(making a total reduction of  2 million) in public expenditure on agriculture, fisheries and forestry in1970-71.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would aim to save  0 - 5 million on administrative costs.The Cabinet-(13) Provisionally approved a reduction of  0-5 million in expenditure on financial administration in 1970-71.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed total savings of 1 million in expenditure by the Central Office of Information (COI)and Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office in 1970-71.In discussion, some concern was expressed lest the cut in expenditure by the COI should fall unduly heavily on advertisingother than that for Service recruitment.The Cabinet-(14) Provisionally approved a reduction of  1 million in total in 1970-71 on expenditure by the Central Office ofInformation and Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reported that agreement had now been reached with the Government of Northern Ireland on totalsavings of  6-2 million on expenditure in Northern Ireland. this figure would be increased by  0-5 million if the charge for school meals were raised to 2s., and by a further  0-3 million if charges were imposed for hospital treatment in car accident cases.The Cabinet-(15) Provisionally approved reductions of at least  6-2 million in expenditure in Northern Ireland in 1970-71.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.25th July, 1969.
