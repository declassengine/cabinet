ParliamentaryAffairsForeignAffairsCC 58 (69)secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In a discussion about the arrangements for the conduct of thetwo day debate on foreign affairs on 8th and 9th December it wassuggested that, although the Government should seek to preventattention from being focused exclusively on Vietnam and Biafra tothe exclusion of other important questions such as the Middle Eastand Greece, it would be impossible to avoid a substantial debate onthe issues raised by the war in Vietnam. Hitherto the Governmenthad been able to rest on the fact that their efforts had been directed to promoting a negotiated settlement of the conflict by directdiscussions between the United States Government and theGovernment of North Vietnam. This policy had been notunsuccessful, at least to the extent that discussions of this kind were now in progress in Paris. But the fact that the representatives of theGovernment of North Vietnam had shown not the slightest inclinationto negotiate in any genuine sense suggested that the Governmentwould no longer be able to rely, for the purposes of the forthcomingParliamentary debate, wholly on their past record; and the risingfeeling of indignation at the alleged atrocities committed by UnitedStates troops in Vietnam might compel them to consider whetherthey should dissociate themselves more actively from United states policy, even perhaps to the extent of openly recognising that therenow appeared to be no means of ending the war save by UnitedStates withdrawal from Vietnam. On the other hand this would be tantamount to conceding that the conflict admitted of a purely militarysolution, which would be both untrue in itself and contrary to theview which we had hitherto consistently maintained. UnitedKingdom Ministers had been no less outspoken than liberal opinion in the United States in expressing revulsion at the alleged atrocitiesin Vietnam; but the strong emotional reaction which was inevitablyprovoked by incidents of this kind should not be allowed to deflectthe Government from considering, dispassionately and on merits,the policy which they should pursue. The Cabinet should find anopportunity to consider these issues further, preferably before thePrime Minister^ forthcoming visit to Washington; and, in doing so,they would need to take account of the new direction which wasbeing given to United States policy towards Vietnam by PresidentNixon&apos;s recent public statements.10682A 2
Continuanceof the murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act, 1965(previous reference :CC (69) 57thConclusions,Minute 1)Rabies(previous reference :CC (69) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet considered the Parliamentary tactics to be adoptedin relation to the forthcoming debate, envisaged for 17th December,on the Resolutions to make permanent the Murder (Abolition of death Penalty) Act, 1965. They agreed that their final decision onthe issues involved would need to be taken at their meeting onMonday, 8th December, and that, despite the inconvenience whichmight result in the House of Lords, no indication should be givenuntil after that meeting to the Opposition in either the House of Lordsor the House of Commons about the Governmenfs intentions inrelation to the tabling of the Resolutions and the timing of the subsequent debate.The Minister of Agriculture said that the report of the enquiry into two recent cases of rabies would be published that day. The reportreached no firm conclusion on the source of the infection which had caused the recent outbreak of rabies in Camberley. He accordingly proposed to extend the quarantine period from six to eight months and to review the situation at the end of 1970.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement by the Ministerof Agriculture.OverseaAffairsEurope(previous reference:CC (69) 53rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) &quot; summit &quot; meeting at TheHague on 1st and 2nd December had gone much as had been expected. The French had obtained a commitment (though not an unqualified one) on agricultural finance from the other five members.The five, for their part, had secured agreement from the French ona deadline of mid-1970 for opening negotiations for British entry into the Community. The timing accepted by the French was later than the five had hoped for; and since the meeting some ministers from those countries had suggested that the date should be brought forward. The outstanding figure at The Hague meeting had been theGerman Chancellor, Herr Brandt, whose firmness and consistencyin discussion had contrasted very favourably with the performance of previous German Governments. The agreement reached at TheHague that there should be a definitive financial agreement for agriculture by the end of the year would create problems for us.But the positions adopted by Herr Brandt had been consistentlyhelpful; moreover, he had sent a senior official to London immediatelyafter the meeting to inform us of its outcome and of his views.In discussion there was general agreement that the results of themeeting, both politically and economically, were as good as could beexpected. It was to be hoped that the five, and in particularGermany, would not be forced into making excessive concessions
Greece:membership of the Councilof Europe(previous reference:CC (69) 21stConclusions,Minute 1)Greece:Extradition ofMr. ChristosKotronisIndustrialAffairsLondonDocks(previous reference:CC (69) 57thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that, following thediscussion in Cabinet on 27th November, she had urged the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (T &amp; GWU)to use his influence to get the ban on the use of the container terminalat Tilbury lifted while negotiations proceeded. He was, however,clearly not prepared to do so; and at a meeting of the joint negotiating committee on the previous day the trade union side had made a series of new demands which went far beyond their previouson agriculture to France as the price of holding her to the agreement.The attitudes adopted by the Germans on agricultural problems and(more specifically) their proposal that there should be a greater measure of national freedom in dealing with the surpluses werehelpful to us; and we should give the Germans what support wecould. The Cabinet should discuss the question of our entry intothe e.c. further, perhaps after the Christmas Recess when the resultsof The Hague meeting had been assessed. A suitable opportunity forthis would be afforded by the submission of the proposed White paper on the implications of British membership of the e.c..The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and of the points made in discussion.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster drew the attention ofhis colleagues to the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary that at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of theCouncil of Europe Britain would vote for the suspension of Greeceunless there had by then been a change in the policy of the GreekGovernment or unless Greece had herself voluntarily withdrawn fromthe Council.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor&apos;of the duchy of Lancaster.The Home Secretary said that he had informed the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary that he could not agree to the extraditionof Mr. Christos Kotronis, a Greek national who had been convictedby the Courts in Greece on a charge of fraud and sentenced to a termof imprisonment. He had instructed Home Office officials to consult with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on what should now besaid to the Greek Government.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement by the Home Secretary.
claims. The employers were divided; the stevedore companieswanted to stand firm, but the shipowners were ready to make concessions. While she accepted that the employers might need tomake some marginal improvement on their previous offer, it would,in her view, be wrong for the Government to bring any pressure tobear on them to make major concessions. The T &amp; GWU&apos;s approachin the docks was the same as that which they had adopted in the motor industry; it involved a systematic attack on the whole concept of modernising wage structures, which had been advocated by theRoyal Commission on the Trade Unions and reflected in theGovernments decision to establish the Commission on industrial relations. If the T &amp; GWU&apos;s tactics were seen to have yieldedfavourable results in the docks, the repercussions on other groups ofworkers could be very serious. It had to be recognised, however, thatif the employers stood firm, the opening of the Tilbury terminal mightbe indefinitely postponed; and a strike in the docks might well ensue.In discussion it was pointed out that the ban on the use of theTilbury terminal had already been in force for nine months; and thatthe reputation of London as an international port had sufferedconsiderable damage as a result. The continuation of the ban fora further indefinite period would have serious repercussions on our export trade and on the development of container services in Britain.The consequences of a dock strike would be very damaging; andthe advantages to be gained from the various alternative courses ofaction in the current negotiations would need to be carefullyweighed. The basic problem in the docks was uncertainty about thefuture. Most dockers recognised that a substantial contraction inemployment was inevitable. They were prepared to accept new methods; but they were determined to secure the best possible terms for those who would be made redundant in the process.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to considerthe course of action which the Government should follow in relation to the current negotiations in the london docks and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.Teachers&apos; Payin Englandand Wales(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minutes 3and 4)The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that on1st December teachers in some 350 schools had begun a two weeks&apos;strike; and one-day and half-day strikes in a number of other schoolswere continuing. He had discussed the situation with the localauthority representatives on the Management Panel of the burnham committee. The local authorities were anxious to reach agreement,rather than resort to arbitration, although most of them were of theview that the teachers&apos; associations would not now agree to any settlement which went below their claim of  135 per annum.  The
local authorities were seeking authority to make an improved openoffer of  75 per annum with discretion to go up to  85 withoutprejudice if there were clear indications that such a figure would secure agreement.The First Secretary of State said that at their meeting on 8th December, the Cabinet would be considering a draft of theWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes which would incorporate their earlier decision that the norm for increases in incomes in the nextphase of the policy should be expressed as a range of 2^ to 4i percent. An increase of  85 for the teachers would be equivalent to5 -1 per cent. To authorise an increase of this magnitude for partof the public sector in the week in which the White Paper was published would have most damaging consequences for prices and incomes policy generally. It was therefore important that the government&apos;s attitude to the teachers&apos; pay and the terms of the draft white Paper should be decided upon at the same time. If there wasto be any question of approving an offer of  85 for the teachers she would wish to reserve her right to ask the Cabinet to reconsider their earlier decision on the upper level of the range to be included in theWhite Paper as the norm for the average rate of annual pay increases.The Cabinet(2) Took note of the statements by the First Secretary of Stateand the Secretary of State for Education and Science.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to considerthe course of action which the Government should follow in relation to the teachers&apos; claim and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.4th December, 1969.
