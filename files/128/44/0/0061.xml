secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in a broadcast on 15th December the President of the French Republic,Monsieur Pompidou, had left no doubt that the French Governmentexpected negotiations with Britain to start in 1970. On the otherhand, the French President had implied some doubt whether britain was really determined to turn towards Europe.The Cabinet- (1) Took   note   of   the   statement   by  the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the ChristmasAdjournment.The Lord Privy Seal said that formal negotiations between her majesty&apos;s Stationery Office (HMSO) and the trade unions on thereport of the National Board for Prices and Incomes on Pay structure in HMSO&apos;s Presses and Binderies were to start in January. Therewas some risk that serious industrial trouble might ensue, perhapsinvolving a complete stoppage. He had considered with theDepartments mainly concerned alternative schemes for maintaining the supply of Parliamentary papers if such an emergency arose. an area of about 5,000 feet would probably be required in or near the palace of Westminster to accommodate a dozen or more high-speedcopying machines weighing up to one ton each. The most suitablelocations for emergency facilities within the Palace of Westminsterwere Westminster Hall, the Royal Gallery and Black Rod&apos;s Garden.He had consulted the House of Lords Accommodation Committee in strict confidence and had been assured that they would raise nodifficulty if Black Rod&apos;s Garden or the Royal Gallery were selected.The Royal Gallery was, of course, not strictly within the precinctsof the House of Lords and fell within the area for which the LordGreat Chamberlain was responsible. Contingency planning would continue under the direction of the group of Ministers primarily concerned so that emergency arrangements could if necessary beintroduced early in the New Year.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement by the Lord privy seal.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that we had now agreed, on the understanding that the Libyans would give us their full assistance, that British troops would be withdrawn from Libyaby 31st March, 1970. The arrival in Libya of a small consignmentof British arms had made a good effect. It now remained to be seenwhat the Libyan attitude would be over training facilities for Britishtroops; and what line should be taken, in the light of this and other factors, when considering further supplies of arms to Libya.In a short discussion, reference was made to the recent allegationby the Prime Minister of Israel, Mrs. Golda Meir, that the BritishGovernment had now refused to supply Chieftain tanks to Israel,although they had previously agreed in principle to do so and were apparently willing to supply Chieftains to Libya.The Prime Minister said that the supply of Chieftain tanks to Israel and its possible repercussions elsewhere in the Middle East hadbeen kept under constant review in the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee. While there were at present no new developments todiscuss, it would be advisable for a report to be made to the Cabinetin the New Year.The Cabinet-(2) Took note.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the termsof an agreement with the German and Netherlands governments had now been fixed. A statement would be made in the House ofCommons on the following day by the Minister of Technology.The Cabinet-(3) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet had before them a note by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (C (69) 170) covering a paper on relief for Biafra which had been prepared by officials in the Foreign and commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that both therebel administration and the Head of the Federal military government (FMG), General Gowon, had now agreed to send representatives to the talks to be held at Addis Ababa. GeneralGowon had indicated that in his view the talks should not beginuntil after Christmas; but we had urged him to send a representativeimmediately, even though it might not be possible for substantivediscussions to begin until after Christmas. The Biafrans had maintained that both sides had been invited on a personal basis bythe Emperor of Ethiopia; but the FMG contended that the talks were taking place under the auspices of the Organisation of African Unity.
The Emperor had not committed himself cither way; and it was to be hoped that the basis of the talks could be left as it stood. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had not seen Lord Can ingtonsince his return from his visit to Federal Nigeria and Biafra. In histelevision broadcast last night, Lord Carrington had been by nomeans optimistic about the outlook; but he had said nothing toindicate that he thought that Government policy should be changed.The Prime Minister said that the paper by officials providedvaluable background information and material which would be useful in preparing a reply (if one were needed) to the proposal made in theHouse of Commons on 9th December by Sir Alec Douglas-home for a carrier-based or land-based airlift relief operation in Biafra tobe carried out by Royal Navy and Royal Air Force helicopters. he pointed out that this project had not been &quot;originated by Sir AlecDouglas-Home The former Vicc-Prcsidcnt of the United States,Mr. Hubert Humphrey, had made a similar proposal some months ago; and the Prime Minister himself had called for an examinationof the technical considerations involved before the proposal had been raised in Parliament.In discussion there was general agreement with the conclusionsof the paper by officials. Failing the opening up of a surface route for relief, the next best solution was clearly agreement on daylightflights; and we should support the efforts of the international committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to secure such an agreement.None of the possible alternatives was as satisfactory as daylightflights. In any public reaction we might make to Sir Alec Douglas-Home^ proposal, we should be careful to say nothing which might endanger ICRCs negotiations or the talks in Addis Ababa. Alarge-scale helicopter operation would raise practical and political problems quite as great as those involved in daylight flights and wouldbe extremely costly. But a decision could nol be based onconsiderations of cost where human lives were at stake; and thepossibility of sharing the cost with other countries should not be ruled out. Notwithstanding the obvious disadvantages of a helicopteroperation as compared with a daylight airlift, the fact that canada and the United States appeared to be far from enthusiastic, and thepossibility that any suggestion of a helicopter operation while theICRC negotiations were in progress might well destroy any prospectof their success, we should avoid any action which would prevent us from falling back on the possibility of mounting a helicopter operationif negotiations for daylight flights failed. These considerationsadded force to the need for caution in commenting on Sir AlecDouglas-Home&apos;s proposal.
The geneva protocol andthe Use ofRiot ControlAgents in WarSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C (69) 168) reporting the outcome of discussions in theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee of the problem of defining the Governmenfs interpretation of the Geneva Protocol of 1925 inthe light of recent international and domestic political developments and of the technological changes which had occurred since 1930, when our attitude was last stated.The Prime Minister said that, after careful consideration, theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee had, on balance, decided infavour of the course of action summarised in paragraph 4 (b) of his paper. The Committee had recognised that, whatever decision wastaken, a statement of our policy would have considerable political repercussions; and they thought it right that these should beconsidered by the Cabinet.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he remainedof the view that the right course was that summarised in paragraph4 (a) of the paper, i.e., that we should reaffirm without qualification thestatement made in 1930 and make it clear that we regarded ourselvesas prohibited from using agents such as CS gas in war. To say thatwe regarded riot control agents such as CS as not covered by the protocol would amount to a reversal of the policy which the UnitedKingdom adopted in 1930. It would cause political difficulties athome and would damage our standing and credibility in internationaldisarmament discussions. Both courses of action summarised in thepaper were, to some degree, at variance with the current policy of theUnited States Government, which intended to retain freedom to usenot only CS gas but also the more objectionable CN and DM; andan unqualified reaffirmation of our 1930 position, accompanied (ashe envisaged) by a statement that we would not object if any otherState adhering to the Protocol reserved its right to use riot control the Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusions set out in C (69) 170. He would keep in touch during the Recess with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Defence Secretary; and they would decide whatuse could be made of the paper. In particular, they would consider,in the light of the paper and of the points made in discussion,whether it would be advisable to make a considered reply to theproposals made in the House of Commons by Sir Alec Douglas-Homeon 9th December.The Cabinet-(4) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
agents in war, would not create any real problem in Anglo-UnitedStates relations. The apparent paradox that an unqualifiedreaffirmation would amount to renouncing the use in war of an agentwhich we used against our own citizens in peace could be explained by reference to the purpose for which the agent was used. In peaceit was a means of minimising casualties; whereas in war, asinformation from Viet-Nam had shown, it was frequently a means to the more widespread infliction of casualties with bombs and guns.The Defence Secretary said that peacetime experience had shownthat CS was an effective and humane weapon, which was invaluablefor dealing with riots and with dangerous criminals. To announce that we regarded ourselves as prohibited from using it in war would strengthen the hands of those who misguidedly argued that we shouldnot use it in peace. Although CS gas had not so far been used in any international conflict in which we had taken part, it was easy to envisage circumstances in Hong Kong, Gibraltar, Cyprus or Berlinwhere its use against an armed incursion would be the most appropriate response. It was illogical to argue that because the americans had used tear gas in Viet-Nam in a way which did not correspond with the principle of minimum force, we should regardourselves as debarred from using it at all, while not objecting ifothers claimed the right to do so. A reaffirmation of the 1930statement, qualified by a claim that we had the right to use CS inwar, could be justified by reference to the text of the 1930 statement.At that time screening smokes, which we said were not covered by the protocol, were less toxic than any known form of tear gas. Theposition was now reversed, in that CS was less toxic than screeningsmoke; and it would be logical to claim a right to use an agent even less dangerous than one which, in 1930, we had regarded ourselves asfree to use.In discussion, some support was expressed for the view that weshould reaffirm the 1930 statement without qualification. Thealternative of a qualified reaffirmation would unite critics of the government&apos;s Northern Ireland policy with those who criticised itsdisarmament policy. It would lead to charges that we were againseeking to whitewash the United States Government. Moreover, anyside which used CS gas in an international armed conflict would beinviting the other side to escalate to more toxic gases. The majorityof Ministers, however, considered that the conclusion reached by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee should be supported. It waspointed out the vociferous lobby which had opposed the use of CS inNorthern Ireland could be relied on to exploit any statement whichcould be read as an admission that the gas was too obnoxious to beused in war. It would be extremely difficult to justify the domestic
use of CS if, in international discussions, we had taken the view thatit was covered by the Geneva Protocol as a gas which we regardedas being harmful or deleterious to man.In further discussion, attention was drawn to the need for very careful drafting of any statement qualifying our reaffirmation of the1930 policy. It would not suffice to say that in our view gases &quot; suchas CS &quot; were not covered by the Protocol. It would be important tomake it clear that the criterion was toxicity; and that, as in 1930(when we excluded screening smoke, which was less toxic than any form of tear gas then known), so now we were excluding only thosegases which, like CS, were appreciably less toxic than screeningsmoke.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the conclusion of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee that we should reaffirm, with a qualification excludingriot control agents such as CS, the 1930 interpretation of the geneva protocol. It would be necessary for the qualification to be carefullydrafted to make it clear that in referring to gases &quot; such as CS &quot; wehad in mind gases of similar or lower toxicity. In explaining our policy, we should draw attention to the facts that in 1930 we had said that we regarded screening smokes as excluded from theapplication of the Protocol; that screening smokes were at that timeless toxic than any known form of tear gas; but that moderntechnology had since developed tear gases which, like CS, were lesstoxic than screening smoke. The Foreign and commonwealth secretary, in agreement with the Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General, should arrange for the preparation of the text of a qualifiedreaffirmation of the 1930 statement on the lines which the cabinet had agreed. An accompanying statement, explaining the reasons which led us to qualify this reaffirmation should similarly be prepared and held ready for use in international or domestic discussions.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General, to prepare statements on the lines indicated inthe Prime Minister^ summing up.confidential. The Cabinet noted that a report by the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI), which was to be published early inJanuary, would endorse the National Coal Board&apos;s request for a10 per cent increase in coal prices; and that it would probably beIndustrialAffairsCoal Prices
CC 61 (69)desirable for the Government to announce their attitude to the reporton the day of publication in order to avoid publicising the price increases on two separate occasions.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to considerthe NBPI report on coal prices before it was published and to agree the terms of a Government statement if theCommittee considered it appropriate to make one.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thatfollowing discussions in the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes he had authorised the Management Panel of the burnham committee to make an open offer to school teachers in England andWales of  75 across the Board. This was equivalent to an increaseof A\ per cent. In the event the Panel had decided to offer the total sum in the form of selective increases to different categories ofteacher. The unions had rejected this offer; and as the chairman ofthe Burnham Committee was not prepared to agree to arbitrationat this stage, a further meeting had been arranged for 5th January,1970. It seemed likely that this would result in deadlock, in which case he would be required to arrange for the matter to be referred to arbitration. There was, however, reason to believe that the teachersmight refuse to nominate a member for the arbitration panel; in that case, he understood that the local authorities would be likely torecommend that the NBPI should be asked to enquire into the pay and structure of the profession. If the teachers agreed to arbitration,it would be desirable to arrange for the NBPI to carry out such an enquiry after arbitration had been completed. He accordingly proposed that officials should meet before negotiations were resumedon 5th January to consider the timing and tactics of a reference tothe NBPI. It should, however, be recognised that if wage increasessignificantly above A\ per cent were authorised for other groups ofworkers, including in particular the nurses, it would not be possibleto maintain their refusal to authorise comparable increases for the teachers.In discussion it was pointed out that there were no grounds atthis stage for including Scottish teachers in a reference to the NBPIas there had been no breakdown in negotiations. If such a breakdownoccurred, it might be desirable to ask the NBPI to hold an enquiry into the pay and structure of the profession in Scotland either as aseparate exercise or as part of a reference covering Great Britain asa whole.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for education and Science.
(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes to consider further what action the Government should take inrelation to the pay of school teachers in England andWales.Unofficial action The Cabinet were informed that workers at about 50 power m the electricity stations had given notice of their intention to work to rule fromsupply industry        rjecember and go on unofficial strike from 5th January, 1970.While working to rule would give rise to serious inconvenience, astrike, which would be illegal, would have the most damaging consequences and could disrupt industrial production quite quickly.The Central Electricity Generating Board were making every effort to discourage the men from striking; but some of the trade unions concerned did not appear to have made any attempt to explain totheir members the provisions of the agreement which had recentlybeen concluded with the Board. The solemn undertaking which theTrade Union Congress had given the Government in the summerwas intended to cover cases of this kind, where unofficial action bya small number of workers could put many thousands of people outof work.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the First Secretary of State to draw the attention ofthe General Secretary of the Trade Union Congress to therelevance of their undertaking to the Government to the unofficial action in the electricity supply industry.(5) Took note that the Home Secretary had arranged for theOfficial Committee on Emergencies to meet after christmas to consider the situation.NBPI Report The Minister of Transport said that the NBPI had just completed on London their report on the British Railway Board&apos;s (BRB) proposals forFcircsincreased fares in the London commuter area. The report endorsed the suggested yield of  5 million; but it recommended that this shouldbe achieved by a different fares structure from that which BRB had proposed. The report was, in his view, a bad one; and theGovernment would need time to consider it. He proposed that itshould be published as planned on 22nd December; and that it shouldbe accompanied by a short holding statement saying that theGovernment would study the recommendations carefully and makea further statement as soon as possible in the New Year.The Cabinet-(6) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Transport.
London Docks(previous reference :CC (69) 58thConclusions,Minute 3)CC 61 (69)The Cabinet noted that negotiations on the pay of Londondockers would be resumed early in January, 1970. The employers were divided on the attitude they should adopt in these negotiations;in particular, some of the shipowners and stevedore companies were now willing to offer major concessions. It might be helpful to arrangefor informal discussions to take place between the Government andcertain leading members of the Trades Union Congress about the wider implications of the trade union attitude towards the dispute in the London docks and related matters.industrial research andDevelopmentCorporationDraft GreenPaperCONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Technology(C (69) 169) to which was attached a draft Green Paper on industrial research and Development in Government Laboratories.The Paymaster-General said that at its meeting on10th December, the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy (SEP) had considered the Minister of Technology&apos;s proposalto establish an Industrial Research and Development Corporation.The Committee had agreed that a Green Paper should be publishedearly in the New Year and had asked the Minister of Technology to circulate a revised draft for consideration by the Cabinet. The draft attached to C (69) 169 took account of comments received from members of the Cabinet and of the views expressed at SEP, especiallyin relation to regional questions. In addition, he proposed that thesecond last sentence of paragraph 24 of the draft Green Paper shouldbe amended so as to make clear that the aim would be that industry should bear an increasing proportion of the expenditure on thereactor research establishments.In discussion it was suggested that it should be made clear inthe Green Paper that the Atomic Weapons Research Establishment(AWRE) would not be included in the new Research andDevelopment Corporation.The Cabinet invited the Paymaster-General (1) To consult the Defence Secretary and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, respectively about the reference in the draftGreen Paper to the future of AWRE and expenditure by industry on the reactor establishments.(2) Subject to (1) above, to arrange for the Green Paper to bepublished during the Christmas Recess.CONFIDENTIALFuture of 6.   The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofBritish Air state for Local Government and Regional Planning (SEP (69) 98)Services Limited11471-3c
and the President of the Board of Trade (SEP (69) 87 and SEP (69)101) about the future of British Air Services Limited (BAS).The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy (SEP) had discussed the President of the Board of Trade&apos;sproposals for a capital reconstruction of BAS. They had then invited him to arrange for the cost of saving BAS from liquidation to be fully reviewed, including the effects of liquidation on regional air services and on the regions, bearing in mind the alternative forms oftransport available. The Ministerial Committee on EnvironmentalPlanning (EP) had reviewed the position but had not yet been ableto make a precise assessment of the regional implications of the liquidation of BAS. They had however agreed that immediateliquidation of the company should be prevented, so that the implications particularly for services to Newcastle, to South wales and to Northern Ireland and for the airports affected-could befurther considered. They had therefore proposed that two parallelgroups of studies should be undertaken immediately, to be completed by the end of February. The Government should undertake a costbenefit study of the quantifiable implications of the liquidation ofBAS together with a review of the implications, both for regional economic development and for regional policies generally, of the closure of particular routes. At the same time, British european airways (BEA) should carry out an examination of the reorganisation of BAS with their own domestic regional services on the lines proposed by the President of the Board of Trade. In the meantime the liquidation of BAS should be prevented by whatever financial arrangements might be agreed between the Board of Trade and theTreasury.The President of the Board of Trade said that the report by officials which EP had considered had drawn attention to strongly held views that a number of the services provided by BAS were ofimportance for regional development; and to the risk, based onexperience following the withdrawal of regional air services operated by other companies in recent years, that no one else would come forward to take up the licences. There would also be a direct lossof jobs if BAS were liquidated; and there was some risk to the futureof those regional airports which would lose all or most of theirscheduled air services. The studies which EP had proposed wouldbe complex. By the end of February, BEA would have put a totalof  1 million into BAS in addition to the  3  million which had been advanced before SEP considered the proposals for a capital reconstruction. The additional cost of agreeing now to the provisionof  2 million in new money and the rest of the capital reconstructionwould only be  1-j million; and this would allow BEA to continue
the rationalisation of J3AS and to consider the possibility of mergingcertain secondary BEA routes with them. It would also enable themto carry on over the profitable summer season. He therefore proposedthat the reconstruction should be permitted but only on the stringentconditions he had already proposed. BEA would be told that theywould not be expected to subsidise BAS services from their own resources and that they should not assume that there would besubsidies from the Government; that they would have to undertake the proposed examination of the reorganisation of BAS with theirown domestic regional services to produce the most viable structure;and they should supply the Board of Trade in advance with BAS&apos;annual forecast of profitability by monthly periods and with theactual results as they emerged month by month.In discussion there was general agreement that the immediateliquidation of BAS should be prevented. It was, however, argued that it would be wrong simply to agree to the capital reconstructionon the basis proposed. This would involve a further  2 million ofnew money (making  5^ million advanced in total); and if BAS werenot successful, there would still be the costs of liquidation to meet.The need to maintain regional air services should be assessed on thesame basis as uneconomic rail services. If would not be right to devote large sums to the improvement of inter-city rail services andat the same time subsidise competing air services which lost traffic asa result. Moreover, if practicable proposals for rationalisation ofthe BAS and BEA services emerged, time would be needed to implement them; and the profitable summer season would allow timefor the necessary steps to be taken whether the operating authoritywere then BAS or BEA. It should be possible by the end of Februaryat least to identify those routes which were of real regionalimportance and to consider their future in relation to the possibilities for establishing a commercially successful network of regional air services.On the other hand, it was argued that while there was a need forthe proposed studies, BAS must be maintained as an operating unit in the meantime. The studies might well take considerably longer and the interim payments cost more---than had been suggested.Moreover, BEA might decide to liquidate BAS if no assurances aboutthe capital reconstruction and the future of the company wereforthcoming. There was an immediate problem in respect of the threeBAC 1-11 aircraft ordered by Cambrian Airways; a guarantee forthe financing had to be provided by the end of the week. If the firmdid not acquire these aircraft, they would have no chance of reachingeven the modest profits in the BAS plans. It should be left to BEAto see what could be done to streamline BAS and the domestic
services generally; and to implement the Governmenfs acceptance(indicated in the recent White Paper on Civil Aviation Policy(Cmnd. 4213)), of the concept that there should be a regional airline,or airline group, that would bring together all BEA&apos;s domesticservices other than those which could be regarded as forming an integral extension of its primary international network and routesserved by BAS.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the immediate liquidation of BAS should be prevented. They were not, however, prepared to agree now to thefull capital reconstruction proposed by the President of the Board ofTrade. The President of the Board of Trade should arrange, inagreement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, for the company to bekept going until the end of February, by which time the situation could be reviewed in the light of progress made in the studiesrecommended by EP. If it emerged in the course of the studies thatthere was a clear case for the full capital reconstruction as proposed,the matter could be reconsidered before the end of February.Meanwhile the Ministers concerned should give urgent considerationto the financing of the BAC 1-11 aircraft on order, so that any necessary decisions on it could be taken by the end of this month.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning, in consultation with the President ofthe Board of Trade, to arrange for an assessment to beundertaken by the end of February of the quantifiableimplications of the liquidation of BAS, together with a review of the implications, both for regional economic development and for our regional economic policiesgenerally, of the closure of particular routes.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange forBEA to undertake by the end of February an examinationof the reorganisation of the BAS enterprise with theirown domestic regional services on the lines proposed inSEP (69) 87.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Chief Secretary, Treasury (i) to arrange for the necessary steps to be taken toprevent the liquidation of BAS until Ministers hadbeen able to consider the matter further in thelight of the studies mentioned in Conclusion (1)above; and(ii) to examine urgently the financing of the purchase ofthe three BAC 1-11 aircraft for Cambrian Airways.
CC 61 (69)CONFIDENTIALBeagle Aircraft 7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of limited        Technology (SEP (69) 97) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (SEP(69) 100), about the extent to which the Government should meetthe liabilities of Beagle Aircraft Ltd.The Minister of State, Ministry of Technology, said that BeagleAircraft Ltd. (Beagle) was a limited liability company of which theGovernment owned all the shares. The Government were thereforeunder no legal obligation to make good to the company&apos;s creditorsany deficit on liquidation. Nevertheless, the Minister of Technologywished to invite the Cabinet to agree that, if the company wereeventually put into liquidation, the Government should undertakethat all of the company&apos;s proven liabilities outstanding at the timeof the appointment of the Receiver and Manager would be met infull. This proposal related to Beagle alone; and it was notunprecedented in the private sector for a large parent company facedwith the failure of a subsidiary to step in and meet the debts of thatsubsidiary rather than to allow the creditors to suffer. It was not yetpossible to give a clear picture of the company&apos;s affairs. the receiver appointed on 2nd December had agreed to keep thecompany going for four weeks to allow a purchaser to come forward;although some interest was being shown, there could be no assurance that the company would continue beyond the end of the year.Meanwhile the Receiver estimated that after deduction of payments to preferential creditors and of sums secured under debentures heldby Barclays Bank and the Government, some  64,000 might beavailable to meet the unsecured creditors, leaving a deficiency of theorder of  2 - 7 million (including  1 - 267 million due on a Governmentloan). To restrict claims to a proven minimum, an estimated sumshould be agreed with the liquidator within which he would beauthorised to settle claims and which he would use to fend offexaggerated claims. Customers and suppliers had been influenced by the fact that Beagle was directly and wholly owned by theGovernment; and it was undesirable that the Government shouldlay itself open to charges that they had acted harshly and with scantregard for creditors, particularly in circumstances where a commercialcompany might well have met the debts of a failed subsidiary.There were special problems about the treatment of employees who would lose their jobs. Statutory redundancy payments were inthe last resort payable from the Redundancy Fund. The contracts of Employment Act, however, provided for payments in lieu of notice; and if the company&apos;s works were forced to close at the endof the month there might not be funds available to meet them.Moreover, the statutory payments were no more than legal minima
to which employees are entitled; good employers normally agreed on more favourable terms. The Receiver estimated that the total costof the payments to employees, other than those from the RedundancyFund, which it would be commercially reasonable to make would amount to some five weeks&apos; wages or about  140,000. In addition,the firm were  58,000 in arrears in payment to the insurance companies responsible for the company&apos;s superannuation fund; 27,000 of this represented contributions deducted from employees&apos;pay. This situation required a full enquiry; but in the meantime theinsurance companies had stopped payment, which could cause serioushardship to individuals. He invited the Cabinet to agree that theGovernment should act as a good employer would. They should accept liability for payments in lieu of notice and should authorisethe Receiver to discuss the terms of supplementary payments. he might also be authorised immediately to assure the employees that,to the extent that enquiry proved it to be necessary, the Governmentwould ensure that the arrears of pension fund contributions were fully paid.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Minister of technology&apos;s main proposals raised a question of principle: whetherthe Government, in pursuing its policy of intervention in industry ona commercial basis, should nevertheless accept liabilities beyond thoseaccepted by private firms. If the proposals for acceptance of liability in the case of Beagle were agreed, it would prove a very expensiveprecedent; the general public would assume that any commercialundertaking in which the Government were involved (for instanceUpper Clyde Shipbuilders Ltd.) was backed by their credit. Therewas a real risk that in future the Government, when opportunities forintervention in the private sector arose, would be compelled toundertake open-ended commitments or refrain from action whichwould further their industrial policies. The alternative was to ensurethat commercial undertakings in which the Government were involved were conducted on a commercial basis, except in so far asthe public had clearly been led to believe that this would not be so.In the case of Beagle, the other parties concerned had acted on a wholly commercial basis. The bank had pressed for a reduction inthe company&apos;s overdraft when it became anxious about the future ofBeagle and was at pains to secure its own loan and its contingentliabilities; and other customers were careful to ensure that depositswere covered by bank guarantees. The Government had made itclear in the House of Commons that Beagle was expected to operate as a normal commercial company. The known cost of assumingBeagle&apos;s liabilities would be somewhere between  1 million and 1^ million; but if the course proposed by the Minister of Technologywere followed, there would also be an open-ended commitment tomeet contingent liabilities.  On the other hand, he agreed that the
Government should act as good employers, even though they werenot the actual employers. He was therefore prepared to accept that,so long as the principle of limited liability was not breached, any necessary funds should be made available to enable the employees to be treated as they would be by a good employer.In discussion there was general agreement that funds should bemade available as necessary to enable those payments to be made toemployees which would normally be made by a good commercialemployer. As for the generality of the creditors, it was argued thatthey had assumed that the Government would stand behind thecompany. Moreover, the directors had been allowed to incurobligations which they could not meet if Government support were withdrawn; if their actions were challenged, they might well say in public that they had done so on the understanding that theGovernment would support them. If the Government were notprepared to stand behind firms which they owned, this should bemade clear in advance; but that had not been done in this case.Moreover, if liability were not accepted for the debts of this wholly-owned firm, doubts might be thrown on the credit-worthiness of the nationalised industries. Liability for the debts of joint ventures inwhich the Government had a share could be regarded as a separatematter for which Beagle would not set a precedent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that arrangements should be made to ensure that the employees of Beagle Aircraft Ltd. were treated in respect of payments on redundancy as they would be by a good commercial employer, butthat these arrangements should avoid prejudging the question whetherunlimited liability to commercial creditors should also be accepted.The insurance companies should be asked to continue makingpayments due from the firm&apos;s superannuation fund on the basis thatthe Government would, at least, reimburse them. The situationwhich the Receiver had uncovered in respect of the fund should bebrought immediately to the attention of the Attorney-General.Consideration should also be given to whether the Governmentshould agree to ensure that the arrears of pension fund contributions were fully paid. The Cabinet had not, however, had time to considerfully the question of principle raised by the proposal to pay thecommercial creditors in full. They should resume the discussion attheir next meeting.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of State, Ministry of Technology (i) In consultation with the First Secretary of State andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider what action should be taken to ensure that employees of
Beagle Aircraft Ltd. were treated on the same basis as would be those of a good commercial employer and to make arrangements accordingly.(ii) In consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to invite the insurance companies concerned tocontinue making payments due from the company&apos;ssuperannuation fund on the understanding thatsuch payments would be reimbursed by theGovernment if the arrears of contributions werenot made good.(iii) To draw the attention of the Attorney-General to theposition on contributions to the superannuationfund as reported by the Receiver.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting.economic affairs(previous reference :CC (69) 50thConclusions)SECRET*8. The Prime Minister said that at their meeting on 21stOctober, when there was general agreement on the need to leave the travel allowance unchanged for the time being, the Chancellor of theExchequer had made it clear that he would keep the matter under continuous review with a view to relaxing the restrictions on foreigntravel as soon as there were firm indications of a securely basedimprovement in the balance of payments. The need to take a quickdecision on this issue could arise early in the New Year in the context of certain international discussions. Delicate questions of timingmight be involved and it would accordingly be helpful if the cabinet would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself discretion,without further reference to the Cabinet, to take such decisions asthey judged necessary about the relaxation of the restrictions onforeign travel.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Prime Minister, to take such decisions as he judgednecessary about the relaxation of the restrictions on foreigntravel.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th December, 1969.

secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that therecent Meeting of the Council of the Western European Union(WEU) at The Hague had not been attended by the French. Allother member States, with the exception of Italy, had been represented by their Foreign Ministers. There had been a majordiscussion on political collaboration in Europe, during which theGerman, Dutch and Italian representatives had all strongly supported our early entry into the European Economic Community(e.c.). The German Foreign Minister had proposed a summit meeting of the e.c. countries plus the United Kingdom later thisyear. This would be welcome to us on the assumption that it waspreceded by an agreement to open negotiations on our applicationto join the e.c.. The subject of Greece had been discussed inrestricted session. It had been agreed that all WEU memberspresent should individually make representations to the GreekGovernment pointing out the risk that Greece, if she continued her present policies, might be expelled from the Council of Europe by december or earlier. The arrangements for these representationswould be concerted by our permanent WEU representatives so thatthe Greek Government should be in no doubt that they originatedfrom a collective decision of all WEU countries except France.The decision reached in this matter reflected one of the benefits ofFrench absence since the French, had they been represented, wouldin all probability have vetoed any such proposal.There had also been some discussion on Rhodesia, duringwhich the other WEU representatives had agreed with our viewson the importance of maintaining sanctions after the proposeddepended on the outcome of the further talks which had beenarranged with them. A decision could not be delayed for very much longer, but it would be possible to postpone the introduction of theBill for a few more days in the hope of being able to reach asatisfactory conclusion.The Cabinet -(1) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate amemorandum to the Cabinet about the possiblereintroduction of Statutory Instrument No. 1376 of1951.
referendum, and of not according recognition to the regime. &quot;Ingeneral we had obtained a more sympathetic hearing than previouslyfor our views on Rhodesia. Throughout the meeting the Dutch hadbeen particularly helpful despite the difficulties we were currentlygoing through with them over, for example, our cheese and butterimports and civil aviation. Dutch support was important to us inEurope. It would be a pity if the troubles to which he had referredwere allowed to spoil the atmosphere; and he might have to ask theCabinet in the near future to consider the whole subject of anglo-Dutch relations.In a brief discussion of the Greek problem, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary said he would like to consider further thepossible advantages and disadvantages of publicising our representations, taking into account on the one hand the beneficial effect of such publicity at home and on the other the possible effecton the Greek Government^ attitude.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toconsider the advisability of making a public statement onrepresentations by WEU members to the GreekGovernment.Gibraltar(previous reference:CC(68) 30thConclusions,Minute 6)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had just answered a Private Notice Question in the House on Gibraltar.The Spanish Government had now closed the land frontiercompletely, and some 4,600 Spanish workers were being prevented from going to work in Gibraltar. The Algeciras ferry remainedopen for the present. Much of the labour shortage in Gibraltarmight be made good by recruitment in Morocco, but the MoroccanGovernment were anxious not to publicise this possibility at present.The Governor wished if possible to refute Spanish claims that theirmeasures would result in the closing of the dockyard. The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would examine with the defence secretary what could be said on this point.In a brief discussion, it was noted that there had been no lackof Ministerial visits to Gibraltar to demonstrate our continuingconcern. It was also noted that possible measures of retaliation against Spain had been examined previously but tended for the mostpart to be as injurious to ourselves as to Spain. Moreover, measuresof reprisal would be counter-productive if their effect was to reduce
The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to prepare a paper for discussion by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee on possible countermeasures to the action taken by Spain against Gibraltar.CentrifugeCollaboration(previous reference:CC (69) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the tripartite Meeting being held that day in Bonn, at which the Ministerof Technology and the Minister of State, Foreign and commonwealth office (Mr. Mulley), were our representatives, was expected to resolvemost of the outstanding points of difference between us and ourDutch and German partners, and to clear the way for the signature of an Agreement. There was, however, an outstanding problembetween ourselves and the United States Government in regard tothe release of information restricted under the Anglo-United StatesAtomic Energy Agreement. This problem was still under discussion between HM Ambassador and the United States Secretary of state on the political level and between Sir Solly Zuckerman and theUnited States Atomic Energy Commission at the technical level. Itwas impossible yet to forecast the outcome; but the possibility of difficulties with the United States on this point could not be discounted, and the Cabinet would be kept informed. meanwhile the Nuclear Policy Committee would keep the matter under review.The Cabinet-(5) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.(6) Took note that the Ministerial Committee on Nuclear policy would consider further the Anglo-United Statesdiscussions on restricted centrifuge information, and thatthe Cabinet would be kept informed of any major development.10389bCC 26 (69)still further the viability of Gibraltar. It was suggested, however,that the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee might usefullyre-examine the subject, including the possibility which the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had mentioned in the House ofCommons of a reduction of United Kingdom holiday expenditurein Spain, and of the scale of British European Airways activities inthat country.
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (69) 24thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary (C (69) 61) on Rhodesia.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he wishedto draw the attention of his colleagues to the conclusions reached bythe Ministerial Group on Rhodesia as set out in Annex A to C (69) 61.Though it would clearly not be possible to reach a final decision on several of the conclusions until after the Rhodesian regime had heldtheir referendum, he wished to secure his colleagues&apos; approval of theconclusions. With regard to the public speech on Rhodesia whichhe would be making on 10th June and which was referred to inparagraphs 4 and 5 of C (69) 61, the text he had proposed for inclusion in it which was given in Annex B of the paper had been drafted with the intention of being as helpful as we properly could to the Rhodesian Centre Party. While he realised that a statement on these lines might expose us to the risk of a further rebuff fromthe regime, especially if as seemed likely the referendum wentdecisively in favour of Mr. Smith and his colleagues, it was importantparticularly from the point of view of opinion in this country to demonstrate that we had not been unreasonable and that we had notneglected any possibility of securing a settlement. It had also to beborne in mind that the Governor of Rhodesia had strongly advocatedthat a statement in this sense should be made.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed the conclusions reached by the ministerial group, which should arrange for their detailed implementation.The Cabinet Took note with approval of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.ParliamentReport ofthe RoyalCommissionon LocalGovernmentin EnglandCONFIDENTIAL5. The Minister without Portfolio said that, in view of thesettlement of the strike in HM Stationery Office warehouse, theReport of the Royal Commission on Local Government in England(the Redcliffe-Maud Report) would receive reasonably normaldistribution, although some delay might occur.
