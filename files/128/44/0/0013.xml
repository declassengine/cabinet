ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessParliament(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 13 (69)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was noted that there was no allocation of time duringthe following week for the resumption of the Committee Stage of the parliament (No. 2) Bill. This was regrettable because continuingdelay fed the belief that the Government were weakening in their intention to secure the passage of the Bill, and because theconcentrated sittings proposed for the week before Easter would tosome extent fail in their purpose of putting the opponents of the Billunder strain since the Easter Recess would afford some relief. Thedelay was, however, unavoidable, since the business to be taken in thefollowing week could not be deferred.OverseaAffairsAnguilla(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theoperation to install the United Kingdom Commissioner on the island of Anguilla, which he had reported to the House of Commons on theprevious day, was continuing smoothly. He hoped that the troops would not have to remain long but before they could leave it wouldbe necessary to impose effective control on privately held stocks of firearms and perhaps to deport certain aliens. The duration of thestay by the British police contingent would depend on the situation;on the willingness of other Caribbean Governments to provide policethemselves; and, in part, on the recruitment and training ofAnguillans. The agitation which the self-styled Anguillan representa-tive, Mr. Jeremiah Gumbs, had sought to create at the United NationsHeadquarters did not appear likely to cause us serious embarrassment.The United Nations Special Committee on Colonialism (TheCommittee of 24) appeared to have over-reached themselves and the advance confidential warning given to the Secretary-General had hada good effect. The major problem was to devise an acceptable plan for the island&apos;s long-term political future. On this it was not possible,at the present stage, either to propose or to rule out any specificsolution. At present opinion on the island was firmly opposed to areversion to rule from St. Kitts, and the installation of a UnitedKingdom Commissioner represented the most satisfactory temporarysolution to the constitutional problem.The Prime Minister said that it had been necessary for reasons of security that the decision to mount the operation should be takenby a smaller body than the Cabinet; and the Defence and Oversea
Policy Committee had been called together for the purpose. Therehad in this instance been the further complication of a breach of security which had come to notice during the morning of Monday,17th March, and which was being investigated. To have held afurther Cabinet meeting would only have heightened speculation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although there was some possibility that the incident mighthave been avoided altogether if Mr. Whitlock, the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,had been accompanied by a small force of Royal Marines on theoccasion of his visit on 11th March, there was also some danger thatthe presence of a force which was less than overwhelming might have encouraged some armed resistance.(b) Comparatively few firearms had been found so far. It was important that the troops should not leave until the danger of anyarmed uprising had receded.(c) The legal basis for our action was that internal affairs in anAssociated State had reached a point of disintegration at which itwas impossible for us properly to carry out our responsibility for defence and external affairs. Internal developments in otherAssociated States could give rise to similar situations in which wewould again be placed in the invidious position of havingresponsibility without having clear legal powers to discharge that responsibility. On the other hand, it was not easy to devise asatisfactory alternative to associated status other than continuedcolonial rule. The unhelpful attitude which the United Nations had so far adopted to the problems of former Colonial Powers gave littlegrounds for hoping for a solution within the framework of that organisation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the major problem to emerge from the Cabinefs discussion concerned the unsatisfactory way in which certain Associated States had developed,and the dangers that similar situations might develop elsewhere in the carribbean. In his own discussions on the previous day with Dr. EricWilliams, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, the latter had suggested that the United Kingdom should take the initiative in encouraging measures of economic integration in the area. it seemed possible that a concerted initiative on our part, which neednot be costly, might help to reduce some of the local tensions andanimosities. It would be helpful if the Foreign and commonwealth secretary would arrange for an inter-departmental study to be madeof ways in which we might, without undue expenditure, encourage the Associated State to concert their plans for economic progress with our help, and of other methods by which tensions in the areamight be reduced.
CONFIDENTIALIndustrialAffairsWageNegotiationsin the motor industry(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The First Secretary of State said that the strike at the FordMotor Company&apos;s plants had been settled. The company had beenable to retain the principle that the take-home pay (including bonuses)of individual workers who took part in unofficial strike action wouldbe reduced; and they considered that the new settlement would inpractice provide bigger cost savings than would have arisen under theagreement over which the strike had taken place.The Cabinet Took note, with satisfaction, of the statement by the first secretary of State.CONFIDENTIALPrices andIncomesPolicyNBPI Reporton top salaries(previous reference:CC(68) 10thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and the Lord Privy Seal (C (69) 33) on the reportof the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on top salaries.The First Secretary of State said that the NBPI had been askedto report on the application of the Governments prices and incomes policy to remuneration at the highest levels in the private sector and nationalised industries, and on the appropriate range of remunerationat senior levels in nationalised industries. The reference arose in part from the widespread feeling that the incomes policy did not bite on top executives, but the report showed that top executives hadreceived smaller pay increases, on average, than other workers in thelast three years. The Board considered that the pay of individuals in the private sector had to be judged in relation to the entire salary structure of which it formed part; and that it was the salary structure of firms which required consideration and, where appropriate,reference to the Board. For the public sector, they argued that a sound salary structure was required to allow for adequate rewards for individual performance and responsibility, and that there was atThe Cabinet (1) Took note that the operation had been planned under thedirection of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, toarrange for a study to be carried out on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up and to report backto the Cabinet in due course.
present not enough headroom below Board level to achieve this.They recommended substantial increases in the salaries of board members in order to enable the salary structures to be revised; and found that these increases could be justified under the current white paper, on grounds of productivity and efficiency, provided they were introduced by stages.The case for increased salaries in the nationalised industries wasin her view unanswerable and should be accepted by the Government.But a decision to implement the Board&apos;s recommendations would be highly controversial and it would be essential to present it as part ofa consistent policy which applied to the incomes of senior managersand low-paid workers alike. She proposed that on the day the report was published she should announce that the Government acceptedthe Board&apos;s recommendations on the amount of the salary increase;that the first instalment of 15 per cent, which was fully justifiedunder the current criteria for prices and incomes, would be paidimmediately; but that the timing of the second and third instalmentswould be considered in the light of incomes policy after 1969. she would also announce that she intended to refer the salary structuresof a number of individual companies to the NBPI; and that the board would be invited to carry out the study, to which they had referred intheir third annual report, on ways in which employees could share inthe capital growth of industry.The Lord Privy Seal said that the general effect of the report would be inflationary. The Board&apos;s comments on the disadvantages of undue compression of salary scales would be widely noted, andthere would be serious repercussions not only on salaries in thepublic service and the judiciary but also in the private sector.Nevertheless the main recommendations should in his view beaccepted, despite the political embarrassment involved. Some of theBoard&apos;s proposals, for example in relation to pensions, would however need further study.In discussion there was wide support for the view that theGovernment should announce, at the time the report was published,their acceptance of the Board&apos;s recommendations and the dates onwhich the three instalments would be paid. While this was boundto provoke controversy, especially among the Governments own supporters, the difficulties of presentation should not be exaggerated.The report showed very clearly the serious effects which low andcompressed salary scales had on the efficiency of the nationalised industries and on their ability to recruit and retain Board members and senior staff of high quality. The morale of nationalised industrieswas at present low; and without a radical improvement in salaries itmight well be impossible to find suitably qualified people to fill anumber of important vacancies Which would be occurring shortly.
The problem of presentation was a real one, but it would be noeasier in a year&apos;s time, and there was nothing to be gained bydelaying an announcement.On the other hand it was urged that many of the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament would be strongly opposed to implementing the Board&apos;s recommendations now. The sums involved were large, andhad to be considered in the context of a prices and incomes policywhich was crucial to the success of the Governments economic strategy and bore heavily on lower paid workers. The right course was to accept the Board&apos;s recommendations in principle, but to saythat they could not be implemented until the economic situation had improved.In further discussion there was general support for the proposalto refer the salary scales of a number of individual firms to the nbpi. The Confederation of British Industries would oppose thisbut it would ease the problem of presentation and underline theGovernments determination to operate the prices and incomes policyfairly. The proposal to ask the Board to study ways in whichemployees could share in the capital growth of industry would,however, need further consideration. There were strong arguments of principle against it and the issues involved might in any case bemore appropriately considered in the context of the study, which wasbeing undertaken jointly with the National Executive Committee ofthe Labour Party, of the role of the large firm in society.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theBoard&apos;s report would be published on 25th March. On balance theCabinet agreed that in the week following the publication of the reportthe Government should announce their acceptance of the Board&apos;srecommendations on salary levels in the nationalised industries andthe dates on which the three instalments would be paid. At thesame time they should announce their intention to refer to the NBPIthe salary scales of certain individual firms; and the First Secretarycould discuss this with the Confederation of British Industries and theTrades Union Congress beforehand. The proposal to ask the NBPIto study ways in which employees could share in the capital growth of industry would need further consideration and the announcement should not contain any reference to it.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State to announce theGovernments decision on the NBPI report on top salariesas indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.
AircraftIndustryConcorde(previous reference:CC (68) 44thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (69) 27) on the development of the Concorde; amemorandum by the Attorney-General (C (69) 29) on the legal position in relation to the Concorde project; a memorandum by theMinister of Technology (C (69) 28) on the European 250-SeaterAircraft; a note by the Secretary of State for Defence (C(69)31)reporting progress on the project for a Multi-role Combat Aircraft;and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C (69) 30) covering theReport of the Official Committee on the Aircraft Industry.The Minister of Technology said that the report of the official committee on the Aircraft Industry brought out the fact that theaircraft industry in the United Kingdom had an output valued at about  600 million (at 1966 prices) and was therefore an important,technologically advanced industry. However, the Committee had concluded that decisions on the industry should take the form of decisions on major projects; that the Government should not seek to maintain the industry at any particular size; and that if theindustry were to contract partially, redeployment elsewhere couldyield satisfactory results in terms both of output and of the balanceof payments.At their meetings in August and October 1968 the Cabinet hadbeen unanimously of the view that the Concorde project should never have been allowed to start, but they had also agreed that the legal position was such that they could not withdraw from it unilaterallyat that time. As part of a strategy for future withdrawal, he had therefore endeavoured to reach agreement with the French on criteriawhich might be used for determining whether or not the project should continue. The letters he had exchanged with M. Chamant,the French Minister of Transport (attached as Annex B to C (69) 27)had laid down certain criteria in regard to airline orders anddevelopment costs, and had established that, if these criteria had notbeen met by the end of 1969, he and M. Chamant could propose totheir respective Governments an amendment to the 1962Memorandum of Understanding which would release each government from any automatic obligation to continue the projectjointly. Since this exchange of letters, the Concorde DirectingCommittee had reported that the basic estimate of the cost of thedevelopment programme had now risen to  596 million at January1966 prices. The test programme had been set back, so that results from sustained supersonic flight were not now expected beforemid-1970, and important changes of design to the wings, fuselage and engines had been proposed by the firms. Even with these changes of design, the official estimate of the aircrafts payload was now only15,000 lb., as against the 20,000 lb. necessary for commercial success.However, the firms were fairly confident that these problems could
be overcome and that a pay load of 20,000 lb. could be achieved on the paris-New York route. There had been no change in the position about the sonic boom, and the present evidence was that engine noiseon take-off might exceed the currently permitted levels at New Yorkand London. There was, however, no basis for the reports that theUnited States authorities had already reached decisions unfavourable to the Concorde on the basis of noise levels. There continued to be considerable airline interest in the project; and the studies recentlycarried out by the British Overseas Airways Corporation indicating that the operation of Concorde would be likely to weaken their financial position, were thought to be superficial, in that they did not take account of all the possible combinations of seating and fares.There was much public interest in Concorde,. and it had to berecognised that the longer the project was allowed to continue, themore difficult it would be to cancel it. The project was a major political commitment; it was the one field in which we had a significant technical lead over the United States. The industrialconsequences of cancellation would also be serious, as would the diplomatic problems. In the light of all these considerations, he sought the Cabinefs agreement to his meeting M. Chamant as soonas possible, with a view to seeking the latter&apos;s agreement to an exchange of letters in which he would draw attention to the fact thatthe  600 million ceiling for development had already been reached,but that we proposed to continue the project until the end of 1969and then to review it in the light of the criteria agreed last year.The Attorney-General said that, on the present state of theevidence, his assessment of our chances before the International Courtwas that if we withdrew at this stage we would have rather less thana fifty-fifty chance of success. The legal branch of the Foreign and commonwealth Office was, if anything, more pessimistic. In viewof this, it was of the first importance that we should do nothing to prejudice our legal position under the Chamant agreement.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it was necessary to clarify the Governmenfs objective. There had been for a long timegeneral agreement that there was no economic justification for proceeding with Concorde; and only the risk of being taken by theFrench Government to the International Court had compelled us tocontinue with the project. But the Minister of Technology now appeared to be suggesting that Concorde might be justified on its own merits and that, despite the many and serious technical difficultiesreported in C (69) 27, it would be desirable to persevere at least untilthe end of 1969, even if the legal difficulties in the way of cancellationcould be resolved. He did not agree with the Minister of Technology.The economic prospects for Concorde appeared no better, and
perhaps a good deal worse, than when the project had last beenconsidered. There were serious doubts about the payload and the engine noise, and if these problems were not satisfactorily resolvedthere would be no market for the aircraft. At the end of 1969, weshould be no wiser than now about the chances of achieving an acceptable payload. If the Minister of Technology&apos;s approach were adopted, we should in practice need to wait at least until mid-1970 at an additional cost of  100 million in order to be able to assesswhether Concorde was a saleable aircraft. If on the other hand wepursued the line which had hitherto commended itself of seeking to extricate ourselves as soon as we reasonably could, there was a powerful case for withdrawing now unilaterally if necessary. Theadvice of the Attorney-General was that, if we withdrew unilaterallynow and were taken to the International Court, the chance that thecase would go against us was rather more than fifty-fifty. Would theFrench Government take us to Court in such circumstances? the attorney-General advised that, even if we waited until the end of theyear, we could not be certain of avoiding a liability for damages. Theescalation of costs above  600 million provided us with good grounds for arguing that a fundamental change had occurred since theoriginal contract was entered into. He wondered whether we mightnot in fact be on stronger ground in claiming that such a fundamental change had occurred than in relying on the exchange of letters last autumn between the Minister of Technology and M. Chamant. he recommonded therefore that his colleagues should reaffirm their intention to withdraw from the Concorde project at the earliestreasonable opportunity. To this end, the Minister of Technologyshould be invited to begin negotiations now with the FrenchGovernment to withdraw.The Cabinet Agreed to adjourn their discussion of this subject to their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th March, 1969.
