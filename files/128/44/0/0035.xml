parliament house ofCommons(redistribution of Seats) (No. 2)Bill(previous reference:CC(69) 34thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Prime Minister said that the Group of Ministers closely concerned with the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)(No. 2) Bill had met on the previous day, but were not yet in a positionto advise the Cabinet of the course which events might follow in theremainder of the week. He hoped to be able to report more fully tothe Cabinet at their next meeting on 24th July; in the meantime, itwas important to ensure that the Opposition did not become aware of what was in the Governments mind.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.OverseaAffairsEurope(previous reference:CC(69) 24thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thepossibilities that negotiations might be opened for Britain&apos;s entry into the European Economic Community (e.c.) were nowconsiderably greater than before. The opponents in this country ofBritish membership of the e.c. had become correspondingly morevocal. This had in turn given rise to doubts in Europe about thewhole-heartedness of our candidature, though it was satisfactory thatthe &quot; early day&quot; motion put down in the House of Commonsopposing British membership of the e.c. had attracted little support.Nevertheless, it would be damaging if the idea that we were not serious were to take root. It was the Governments settled policy to seek membership; and it was important that nothing should be said by Ministers that might be taken as implying that our candidaturewas not a genuine one.In discussion it was pointed out that the situation had changedconsiderably, particularly in the economic and agricultural fields,since the original decision had been taken in 1967. There would be advantage in having an up-to-date appraisal of where our interestslay and of how negotiations should be conducted. There was likelyto be an internal crisis in the e.c. over the Common agricultural policy (CAP); and although the Foreign Ministers of certain eec countries, in particular Herr Brandt of Germany and Mr. Luns ofthe Netherlands, had expressed the view that we should be consulted in the formulation of new arrangements for financing the CAP, it was by no means certain that this would happen. Should the Frenchinsist on the satisfaction of their agricultural demands in full as a price for agreeing to negotiations for British entry, we should be in a difficult position. The price we should have to pay might be too high,
and we should not seek membership of the e.c. at any cost. If wewere to persist in our candidature, we should at least reappraise thefull implications, in particular for our balance of payments. Whilethe prospects for negotiations might have improved, it was stillunlikely that negotiations could take place very soon. The german foreign Minister, Herr Brandt, had spoken of next year, by which time a General Election might be impending in the United Kingdom.On the other hand, it was argued that there was no need to embark on a reappraisal of our policy at this moment; and to do so would, if it became known, create doubts about the seriousness ofour intentions, and would jeopardise the achievement of our objective,which remained full membership of the e.c.. It was relevant in thisconnection that the Prime Minister would be making a public statement on 29th July about Britain&apos;s policy towards theCommunity, which would reflect the firm but cautious line taken in previous statements. Careful consideration would have to be givento the situation as it developed, in particular with reference to the cap; and studies were already in hand on the attitude we should adopt if negotiations for British membership were opened, or if wewere consulted by the e.c., in advance of our entry into it, on the financing of the CAP. We should wait to see how the situationdeveloped over the next few months. If the e.c., either because ofFrench intransigence or for any other reason, were to adoptagricultural arrangements which were unacceptable to us, it would still be open to us to say that though it was our object to enter theCommunity, we could not do so on the terms we were being offered.Meanwhile, our application remained on the table. The cabinet should be regularly informed and consulted, and decisions should betaken in Cabinet. It would be unfortunate if we were to get into aposition where Ministers and others were making statements whichreflected their Departmental interests but not necessarily the policies which had been collectively decided upon; this would create an impression of divided counsels which would be highly damaging bothdomestically and in Europe; and in order to avoid it closeinter-departmental co-ordination would be required.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thecourse of events in France and in particular the departure ofGeneral de Gaulle had made the prospects of British entry into the eec more hopeful. On the other hand economic developments,including the devaluation of sterling and developments within the eec itself notably in regard to the CAP, which was still in the melting-pot had confronted us with problems even more difficultthan those which had faced us when the original decision had beentaken in 1967. There was no need for any reappraisal of policy atthe present time.  Our application to join the e.c. remained on the
Mr. GeraldBrooke(previous reference:CC(69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2)*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that agreement had now been reached with the Soviet Government on the release ofMr. Gerald Brooke and of Mr. and Mrs. Kroger. Mr. Brooke wouldbe arriving in this country early on Thursday, 24th July, and theKrogers would be released on 24th October. The Soviet authorities had further agreed to the release of two other British prisoners heldin the Soviet Union, and had also agreed to allow three British menand one British woman to go to the Soviet Union and marry Sovietcitizens. The men would be permitted to bring their wives back tothe United Kingdom; but the woman intended to settle with her husband in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities had also madea concession on a point which had not been covered by the Anglo-Soviet Consular Convention, in that they were now prepared to allowconsular visits every four months to British prisoners in their hands.There was a complication in that under the Soviet prison code the prison authorities were allowed to impose the forfeiture of consularvisits as a punishment. The Soviet authorities had, however, saidthat they would give favourable consideration to the british governments request that the interval between consular visits shouldnot be more than four months. The Foreign and commonwealth secretary said that there had already been some speculation in thePress, but that the dates proposed for the release of Mr. Brooke andthe Krogers respectively had not so far become publicly known. he intended to make a statement in the House of Commons on 24th July.Until then, the information he had given his colleagues must betreated as highly confidential.The Cabinet (2) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.table and the various problems on which decisions might later be needed were being studied. The Cabinet would take note of the state-ment by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, and would alsonote that studies were in progress. Meanwhile, it was of the greatest importance that policy in regard to the e.c. should be considered and decided on collectively in Cabinet; and that individual membersof the Government should refrain from statements reflectingDepartmental interests rather than Governmental policy.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
Anguilla(previous reference:CC (69) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatHM Commissioner in Anguilla, Mr. Cumber, had resigned his appointment for personal reasons, and that this would be announced on 25th July. Mr. Cumber Would be taking up employment with aprivate firm. Attempts had been made to find an established officialto take his place, but these had not been successful; and Mr. Cumberwould be succeeded, on contract terms similar to those which had applied to Mr. Cumber, by Mr. W. H. Thompson, who was at presentserving in the Turks and Caicos Islands and had previously beenemployed in Kenya. Mr. Thompson appeared to be eager to take on the job; and it had been made clear to him that he wouldbe expected to stay in it for a reasonable period.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.ParliamentServices and facilities for members inthe Houseof CommonsCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (69) 88) by theLord President on the recommendations of the House of CommonsServices Committee for improvements in the services and facilities available to Members in the House of Commons.The Lord President said that the main recommendations of the sixth Report of the Services Committee, which had just been published, were that:(i) Provision should be made at public expense for secretarial assistance for Members or an allowance given of up to the cost ofone full-time secretary for each Member.(ii) Members should be allowed to make free trunk telephonecalls on official business and to send all letters on official business free of postal charges.(iii) Certain minor improvements should be made in the photo-copying, stationery and filing facilities available to Members.(iv) An early decision should be taken on certain recommendations outstanding from the Second Report of theServices Committee, the chief of which were for a substantial increasein the car allowance (at present a flat rate of 4J,-d. a mile) and fourfree first-class return rail vouchers a year for Members&apos; wives.The proposals at (ii) and (iii) had been agreed in principle by theTreasury, but a Government announcement limited to these woulddisappoint many Members; a more substantial improvement was needed to forestall what would otherwise become very strong pressure for an increase in the salaries of Members of Parliament.
He therefore proposed that in a statement to the House of commons before the Recess he should confirm the Governments acceptanceof the recommendations summarised at (ii) and (iii) above and give an undertaking that the Government would study sympatheticallyand urgently the Services Committees recommendation onsecretarial assistance, promising to announce a decision on it immediately after the Recess. It would be helpful if his proposed statement could also include a decision on an improvement inMembers&apos; car allowances.In discussion, there was general agreement on the ServicesCommittees recommendation on free trunk calls and free postagefor Members&apos; official business, on improvements in the photocopying,stationery and filing facilities available to Members, and on anincrease in Members&apos; car allowance to 5^d. or 6d. a mile,representing a repayment of running costs up to the equivalent off first-class rail travel. On the proposal to give free first-class railvouchers to Members&apos; wives it was argued that this concession wouldmean going further than in any other sector of the public service, andthat it would make it more difficult for the Inland Revenue to resistclaims to allow against taxable income the travel costs of the wives ofbusinessmen. On the other hand, it was argued that a similarconcession was given in other countries, and that since Members&apos;wives often played an active part in constituency affairs, repayment of the cost of their rail travel would enable Members representingconstituencies far from Westminster to obtain the same help fromtheir wives as those whose constituencies were much nearer.In further discussion of the proposal to provide secretarial assistance, it was argued that the form which this might take wouldhave a very considerable effect on its acceptability to public opinion.If it were to be an unconditional payment, it would be generally recognised as virtually an addition to Members&apos; salaries. It mightinduce some Members to begin employing secretaries, but in general it would reward those who worked inefficiently (i.e., withoutsecretaries) more than those who seriously tried to carry out aMemberS proper responsibilities. It would also allow some members to devote still more effort (at public expense) to political activities which had little or no relevance to Parliament. At the rate of  1,000suggested, a secretarial allowance would in fact make Membersbetter off in real terms than they were in 1964, whereas the increasein national insurance benefits next November would leave retirement pensioners with a standard of living no higher than in 1964. Thecontrast between the Governments treatment of Members ofParliament and of retirement pensioners would alienate supportduring the remainder of the Parliament; and there was a highly vocal
group among retirement pensioners, and others, who would lay greatemphasis on this contrast. To avoid injustice in this direction theGovernment, if they now agreed to a general secretarial allowance for members of Parliament, would be obliged to make an increase in national insurance benefits (and charges) in the near future; and thiswould mean a substantial increase in public expenditure. an allowance to Members to cover proved expenses only, or tax-free ifspent on secretarial services but taxable if not, could be morereasonably presented to the public as the provision of facilities toenable a Member to do the work expected of him, leaving thepossibility of a salary increase to be considered by a newly electedGovernment; whereas, if Members were given now what could be interpreted as a salary increase, a new Government of whatevercomplexion would feel inhibited from giving a realistic increase in salary at the beginning of the new Parliament. Alternatively,arrangements could be made for providing a pool of secretaries for members, which would be more strictly an improvement in facilities,with a reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)on the question of Members&apos; salaries as such.On the other hand, it was argued that, however it was presented to the public, a secretarial allowance (and even the provision of facilities to take the place of what a Member at present provided athis own expense) was essentially an increase in net income for most members, whether or not they at present employed a secretary. Theeffects in the 1966 General Election of the increase of Members&apos;salaries in 1964 had not been damaging; and a fresh increase might cause no worse reaction. Moreover, if postal and telephone costs were to be free of charge, some Members at least would lose by not having tax relief for these business expenses. The difficulties of checking and auditing any accountable allowance were such that a straightforward unconditional payment was to be preferred; and an analysis of the requirements of Members indicated that the alternative of providing a central secretarial service would not be a practical solution.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that some ministers thought that a straightforward increase in Members&apos;salaries would be the best way of making an allowance for theprovision of secretarial services, while others thought any form of allowance unacceptable, as being more generous to Members ofParliament than the Government had been to retirement pensioners.But in general there was agreement that the Lord President should announce the Governmenfs acceptance of the recommendations ofthe House of Commons Services Committee on telephone and postal charges, on improvements in photocopying, stationery and filingfacilities, and on car allowance.   He should also announce the
CONFIDENTIALExtension of 4.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister, to*Lciplc,dS,nan wriich was annexed a report by officials and a draft parliamentary statement, on the extension of the ombudsman principle (C (69) 85).The Prime Minister recalled that in answer to parliamentary questions on 24th June he had said that he hoped to make astatement in the near future on the ombudsman system and localgovernment, and to make a statement before the Summer Recess on national Health Service inspection and a specialist ombudsman forthat field. He had asked the Head of the Civil Service to co-ordinateviews of officials on these topics, and their report had been circulated as an annex to C (69) 85. In his view, the two years&apos; experience ofthe working of the Parliamentary Commissioner system in centralGovernment gave strong grounds for extending the service to local governments agreement in principle to the provision of secretarial assistance, and their intention of entering into discussionwith representative Members on an arrangement which would givethe best service to Members and avoid any misuse of the new provisions. Before the Lord President began the proposed discussions, a group of Ministers would consider what arrangementhe should offer and its cost; they would also consider whether any increased assistance on expenses should be offered to Members of theHouse of Lords. At the appropriate time, the subject of the salaries of Members of the House of Commons should be referred to the nbpi, with a view to their presenting a report after the next GeneralElection.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President to make a statement in the Houseof Commons on the lines indicated in the summing up bythe Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a group of Ministers to consider what arrangements should bemade to provide secretarial assistance for Members ofParliament, and to consider the possibility of increasingthe expenses allowance of Members of the House of Lords.(3) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the first secretary of State, to circulate a memorandum on a reference of the salaries of Members of Parliament to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes.
government and the National Health Service, the activities of whichin many ways impinged more directly than those of centralGovernment upon the daily life of the citizen. There would be widesupport for such an extension, in the country at large and in theLabour Party in particular, since the majority of local authorities were not at present under Labour control. Details of the proposal had still to be worked out, and the local authority associations andthe other bodies concerned would have to be consulted. meanwhile it was desirable to announce that the Government had decided inprinciple to extend the ombudsman service, and he accordinglyinvited the Cabinet to agree that in replying to Mr. Ben Whitaker&apos;sParliamentary Question that afternoon, he should make a statement on the lines of the draft annexed to C (69) 85.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether this was theright time to extend the ombudsman principle. The recent third report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration(important), on the sale of the Duccio picture, had some unwelcomefeatures, in that it censured a named civil servant who was affordedno opportunity of reply, and had criticised a Ministerial statement inthe House. Moreover the procedures of the Select Committee made it impossible for the responsible Minister to reply to the criticismsuntil several months after its publication. That apart, it wassuggested that it would be premature to announce an extension ofthe ombudsman principle while many details of the proposal still remained to be settled. It was impossible to decide whether theproposed extension was viable without first deciding who was toappoint the local ombudsmen, to whom they were to report, and what the consequences would be if a local authority were to ignorean adverse report. Moreover, to announce the decision of principle without prior consultation might antagonise the local authority associations and put at risk their co-operation in the discussions on local government reorganisation which were just beginning. Ifnevertheless it were decided to make a statement, it should be made clear that the decision whether or not to include the National health service within the scope of the local ombudsman would not be taken until the interested bodies had been fully consulted.On the other hand, it was argued that the fact that details of theproposal had still to be worked out did not preclude the government from taking a decision in principle and making an announcementaccordingly. While it was desirable to take account of the interestsof the local authority associations and of the other bodies concerned,it was equally important to have regard to the interests of theindividual citizen. Early statements on this subject had been promised, and the Government would be criticised if they failed tomake them before the Recess.
confidential. The First Secretary of State said that she had arrangedconsultations at official level and on an informal basis with the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) about the possible content of a White Paper setting out the newprices and incomes policy, which would come into effect when thepresent statutory powers lapsed at the end of 1969. She had intendedto avoid any more formal consultation until after the TUC meeting in September, at which some opposition was likely to be expressed to the Governments declared intention of activating Part II of thePrices and Incomes Act, 1966, with its provisions for a three monthsstandstill on prices and incomes increases and penalties for disobeyinga standstill order. However, the TUC General Council would becalling on her within a few days to record their opposition to theactivation of Part II of the 1966 Act. She thought the TUC did not really expect the Government to withdraw from their already declared intention, though there might be quite determined oppositionamong some TUC representatives and among Government supporters in the House of Commons; and she would be hearing the TUCsrepresentations rather than volunteering any statement of her own.But, since the Government had withdrawn their proposal to bring in early legislation on industrial relations, with provision for penaltieson trade unionists and employers, she sought a reaffirmation of thedecision to activate Part II of the 1966&quot; Act, to come into effect whenthe present statutory powers lapsed.Prices andIncomesPolicyFilluic policy the Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the ombudsman service should beextended, and favoured an early announcement of the decision inprinciple. He would amend the draft statement annexed to C (69) 85to take account of the points made in discussion, and would make itclear that the question whether or not to include the National health service remained open. The details should be discussed with localauthorities and others concerned and thereafter considered bythe appropriate Cabinet Committee.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that an announcement should be made in parliament that the Government had decided in principle to extend the ombudsman service, on the lines of the draft statement annexed to C (69) 85, amended to take account of thepoints made in their discussion.
In discussion, it was argued that the proposal to activate Part ii of the 1966 Act was not on a par with the proposal to introduce an industrial Relations Bill and that despite some opposition from individual trade unions the tuc&apos;s willingness to operate a voluntarywage-vetting system would probably not be affected. A firm standon prices and incomes against TUC opposition would help to counterassertions that the Government acted under the dictation of the tradeunions. On the other hand it must be recognised that if Part II ofthe 1966 Act were activated at the beginning of 1970 it would be ineffect during the remainder of the Parliament.In further discussion it was confirmed that the First Secretaryof State would not at this stage be undertaking formal consultationwith the TUC about equal pay; and that proposals on this, as wellas on improvements for low-paid workers, would come forward for cabinet consideration at a later stage, as part of the proposals for thepost-1969 prices and incomes policy.The Cabinet-Reaffirmed their intention of activating Part II of the prices and Incomes Act, 1966, when the present statutory powerson prices and incomes control lapsed at the end of 1969.SocialServicesSocialInsuranceBenefit:DraftWhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (69) 86) by theSecretary of State for Social Services, to which was appended a draft white Paper on proposals for earnings-related short-term benefits and industrial injury benefits.The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that the white paper &quot; National Superannuation and Social Insurance &quot; published inJanuary 1969, which contained the Governments proposals for a fully earnings-related scheme of pensions and other long-term benefits, had foreshadowed new earnings-related arrangements for short-term sickness and unemployment benefit and consequentialchanges in other insurance benefits. The White Paper appended toC (69) 86 dealt with these matters, but in a manner rather different from that originally intended because, in the course of working outthe details, it had become clear, that the replacement of the presentsystem of flat rate benefit with earnings-related supplement by asingle earnings-related benefit created serious problems to which ithad not been possible to find a solution, except at considerable extraexpense. It had also become clear from discussions with the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) that there was no possibility at present of persuading theemployers to take over responsibility for the early weeks of sickness.
13CC 35 (69)It had therefore seemed better to &quot; mark time &quot; on the existing systemof short-term benefits, modified only to the extent necessary to makeit compatible with the fully earnings-related long-term scheme. Thiswould give time for further thought about the proper division ofresponsibility for workers who were sick for short periods, and fora proper study of the reasons why there was a rising level of short-term sickness. The proposals in Part II of the White paper had therefore been devised so as to reproduce as nearly as possiblethe present provisions relating to short-term benefits to which people were accustomed. The major difference was that married women&apos;rates of short-term benefit had been brought to the same level as thoseof other insured persons; and the cost of the guardian allowance,which was more akin to family allowances than to insurance, hadbeen transferred to the Exchequer.The proposals for industrial injury benefits were limited to theminimum necessary to adjust them to fit into the new national insurance scheme, but the details had not been finally worked out andwere still under discussion with the TUC and the CBI.The scheme now proposed was somewhat more expensive thanthe existing scheme, partly because the married woman was given anentitlement of her own; and the estimate given in the White Paper didnot include the cost of the new attendance allowance, the rates andconditions for which had not yet been settled. The government actuary estimated that the additional expenditure attributable to thebenefits covered by the White Paper would justify a contribution ofabout 2 - 2 per cent of earnings from employers and employees alike,plus the 18 per cent contribution from the Exchequer. The actualrate of contribution would depend on decisions not yet taken on thenew scheme as a whole, and on the size of the Health service contribution; and the rate to be charged at the outset would be kept under review in the light of the trend of unemployment and sicknessexperience. The draft White Paper had been submitted to the social services Committee and approved by them, subject to certain minor amendments which had been made in the text.The Cabinet Approved the early publication of the draft White Paperattached to C(69) 86.CONFIDENTIALAircraft 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordConcord Chancellor (C (69) 87) on the routes to be used by the Concorde testRoutes 6 TeSt niSnts-  They also had before them a note by the President of the
Board of Trade (C (69) 92) covering a memorandum on commercialsupersonic flying and airport noise of the Concorde, and a note bythe Attorney-General (C (69) 93) covering a memorandum on thelegislative implications of the Concorde&apos;s supersonic testing.The Lord Chancellor said that it was necessary to decide on theroutes to be used for supersonic test flying of the Concorde. Muchof this would take place on circuits over the sea and was unlikely to cause any disturbance on land; but for some of the more exactingtests it was necessary to have a straight route of about 800 mileswhich would allow the aircraft to cruise at supersonic speed for about20 minutes. To minimise the risks the aircraft should be at all timeswithin radar range, and so far as possible within reach of airfields for emergency landings and of air-sea rescue helicopters; and the routeshould if possible avoid water too deep for recovery of wreckage incase of disaster. Against these requirements had to be set thedesirability of minimising the disturbance and damage which might result from the aircraft flying over land, and in particular over heavilypopulated areas. The route preferred by the Ministry of Technologyon technical grounds ran down the West Coast of Scotland, acrossthe western extremities of Wales and across Cornwall in the vicinity of Truro (the West Coast Route). Use of this route would exposeupwards of 2 million people to sonic bangs, mainly in Scotland andNorthern Ireland, with Wales and Cornwall affected in less degree;England apart from Cornwall would be virtually unaffected. In viewof the political implications of such a choice the Home AffairsCommittee had required to be satisfied that there was no practical alternative. After hearing officials at the Ministry of Technology,the Committee were satisfied that a route over the North Sea shouldbe ruled out because it did not meet the safety criteria; and that analternative down the East Coast of England, which had been examined at their request, should be rejected because it wastechnically inferior and would disturb twice as many people. In theresult the Committee were convinced that there was no alternative touse of the West Coast Route, at any rate for the earlier and morehazardous tests.If there were to be supersonic test flying over land, some formof legislative action was necessary to provide authority and allowpayment of compensation. The choice lay between passing a Bill forthe purpose, which would give absolute protection and remove any risk of the tests being interrupted by legal action; and an Order inCouncil applying section 40 of the Civil Aviation Act, 1949, whichwould give qualified protection against actions for trespass ornuisance. The Attorney-General would prefer to proceed by Bill,but the majority of the Home Affairs Committee had concluded that
this would be disproportionate to the risk involved, and that the riskattaching to proceeding by Order in Council was slight enough to beaccepted.The Home Affairs Committee had considered a memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade on the noise problem, andhad agreed to consider further in the autumn whether commercialsupersonic flying over the United Kingdom should be banned. Twoforms of noise were involved, airport noise and noise made in flight.As to the former, it appeared that the noise made by the Concordewhen taking off would be marginally above the maximum nowtolerated at Heathrow. In flight, the engines would not be heard,but there was the problem of supersonic bangs. Some experience ofthese had already been gained as the result of flights by serviceaircraft, but more would be known about the problem aftersupersonic testing of the Concorde had begun. He invited theCabinet to endorse the conclusions of the Home Affairs Committeethat the West Coast Route should be used for supersonic testing; thatan Order in Council applying section 40 of the Civil Aviation Actshould be made in the autumn; and that a Written Answer in theterms annexed to C (69) 87 should be given before the Summer Recessto enable consultations with local authorities to go ahead.In discussion of the choice of route, the point was made that useof the West Coast Route would result in supersonic bangs being heard in the populated area around Greenock and in much of Ayrshire; the reaction of the general public might be unpredictable, but there wasno doubt that the Scottish Nationalists would seek to turn it to their advantage. The technical arguments for the West Coast Route weredecisive, but care should be taken in the presentation of the decision,and so far as possible in the timing of any announcement, to minimiseembarrassment to the Government; it would be better to avoid any reference to the possible maximum of 150 flights over three years.Some members of the Cabinet questioned the wisdom of the proposedWritten Answer, on the ground that it would prompt more questionsthan it answered; but it was pointed out that it would enable usefulpreliminary consultations to take place with local authorities in theareas affected. The suggestion was made that the National Farmers&apos;Union should also be consulted.On the point of legislative cover it was explained that the riskinvolved in proceeding by Order in Council was that section 40 of theCivil Aviation Act only barred actions for trespass or nuisance wherethe flight of the aircraft was at a height above the ground which was reasonable having regard to wind, weather and all the circumstancesof the case.   It would thus be open to the courts to find
unreasonableness and to hold the flight unlawful and even to issue an injunction restraining further flights. But the risk was thought to be small and to be outweighed by the political considerations.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (69) 87 and the Written Answerannexed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd July, 1969.
