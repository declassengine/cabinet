CC45(69)CONFIDENTIALFuture 1.  The Cabinet considered the arrangements for the conductBusiness forthcoming Labour Party Conference.No record of the Cabinefs discussion was taken.secret parliamentary 2. The Cabinet considered business for the last two weeks ofAffairs the   current   Parliamentary   Session   beginning   on   Monday,13th October, in the light of the concentration of Home Officebusiness which would need to be completed in this period and thepossible impact on certain of the items concerned of the relationsbetween the Government and the House of Lords. -In discussion it was agreed that the balance of advantage layin seeking to promote a debate on the situation in Northern ireland on Monday, 13th October, inviting the House of Commons toconsider the Lords&apos; amendments to the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill on Tuesday, 14th October;arranging for the House to deal with the Lords&apos; amendments to theChildren and Young Persons Bill on Wednesday, 15th October; anddisposing of the Southern Rhodesia Order on Thursday,16th October. Without prejudice to this timetable, however, itwould be necessary for the Cabinet to take an early opportunity toconsider the Governmenfs tactics if the House of Lords continuedto withhold co-operation in enacting the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill and to examine at the sametime the probable effect on the redistribution of seats in Scotland ofthe proposals in the report of the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment in Scotland, which was due to be published later that day. There should be close consultation between the Home Officeand the Scottish Office in order to ensure consistency in the government&apos;s approach to the interrelated questions of there organisation of local authority boundaries and the redistribution of Parliamentary seats in both countries.LegislationPermanentAbolition ofCapitalPunishmentfor Murder(previous reference:CC(69) 39thj Conclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Home Secretary said that on 22nd May the Cabinet had invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and himself to move theresolutions required to continue the abolition of capital punishmentpermanently during the spill-over period at the end of the present session. Since then statistics had become available showing that,despite a substantial rise in capital murders, the figure for all murdersin 1968 was only marginally higher than in 1967. He had now received an analysis from the Home Office Research Unit which was
on the whole helpful from the Governments point of view; and hehad undertaken that he would publish this before capital punishmentwas next debated in Parliament. In the light of these developments,it would in his view be preferable to postpone the moving of theresolutions until the new Session, and to debate them in earlyDecember. There was some risk that resolutions might be defeatedin one or other House, in which case the Homicide Act, 1957, wouldrevive unless the Government brought in a new Bill; but he considered that this risk could reasonably be accepted.In discussion it was argued that it would be better to introduce the resolutions during the spill-over period in order to get the issue,which was unpopular in the country generally, out of the way as soonas possible. Delay would simply strengthen the opposition to permanent abolition. Moreover, the Law Officers advised that if theresolutions were defeated in either House it would not be possibleto introduce a Bill on the same subject in the same Session. On theother hand, there was wide support for the view that it would be preferable to publish the Home Office analysis in October and tomove the resolutions early in the following month. Since new legislation was not involved, it would not be necessary to include a reference on the subject in The Queen&apos;s Speech; but anannouncement could be made during the course of the debate on it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the resolutions required to continuethe abolition of capital punishment permanently should not be.introduced during the spill-over period. The Cabinet should have before them at their next meeting further advice from the LawOfficers on the question whether legislation on the subject could beintroduced during the latter part of the next Session if the resolutions were moved shortly after its commencement and were defeated in either House. The Cabinet might at the same time reconsider thepossibility of extending the Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act,1965, for a further period of years, which they had considered and rejected at their meeting on the 22nd May.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the resolutions on capital punishment shouldnot be moved during the present Session.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Law officers to submit advice in accordance with the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.
OverseaAffairsCanadian ForceReductionsUnited NationsMeeting ofGenera]AssemblyMiddle East(previous reference:CC(69) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during his recent visit to Canada he had emphasised, in discussions with theCanadian Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs, themisgivings which we felt about their decision to effect reductions inthe Canadian forces committed to the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO). The combined effect of allied representationto the Canadian Government had been of positive value in that theforce reductions themselves had been scaled down, and that the canadians had also made it clear publicly that they remained firmsupporters of NATO.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during his visit to New York in connection with the meeting of the general assembly of the United Nations he had had informal discussions with the Foreign Ministers of a number of countries, including theUnited States, the Soviet Union, France, West Germany, belgium and The Netherlands. These discussions had covered a very wide range of topics among which the Middle East and our relationship with the European Economic Community (e.c.) were the mostimportant.On the Middle East, the Americans had claimed that some progress had been made in their bilateral talks with the Soviet Union,although the only specific point on which agreement had beenreached was that the Russians now accepted that the settlement would have to take the form of a document signed by all parties.There was little other evidence of movement. In a Press communique,prepared on Mr. Gromyko&apos;s initiative after a dinner attended by  Thant and the Foreign Ministers of the four Powers, a phrase hadbeen included stressing the right of all States in the Middle East tocontinue in peace and security; and in a speech to the general assembly the Israeli Foreign Minister had emphasised that fromIsrael&apos;s viewpoint nothing was non-negotiable, but in private discussion had proved as unyielding as ever on the unity andsovereignty of Jerusalem. The Egyptian representative, on the otherhand, had made an unyielding speech, but in private had indicated a readiness to meet the Israelis face to face at the final stage of thenegotiations. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thathis view, which the United States Secretary of State accepted, wasthat the four-Power discussions on the Middle East, which had beenin abeyance pending the outcome of the United States-Soviet talks,should be resumed in mid-October. He would consult the Cabineton what the United Kingdom&apos;s line should be in these further discussions.
Europe(previous reference:CC(69) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatM. Schumann, the French Foreign Minister, whose attitude was verymuch more friendly than that of his predecessor, had stressed that from France&apos;s viewpoint the achievement of the Common Market,i.e., an agreement between the Six on a common agricultural policy,was a precondition of any enlargement of the Community. Theview of the other e.c. Foreign Ministers with whom he had discussed the problem was that no more than a temporary agreement on agriculture was possible, pending British entry into the e.c. and consideration of the Mansholt plan for a revised e.c. agricultural policy. Clearly a major argument among the Six was inevitable. Itwas still possible, however, that some compromise settlement mightbe reached which would make it possible for negotiations on our accession to the Treaty of Rome to begin by about February 1970.In a discussion on the question of negotiations for entry intothe e.c. there was general agreement that the summit conference ofEEC countries in November would be unlikely to lead to any rapideasing of the strains within the Six and that some months would therefore be likely to elapse before serious negotiations between theUnited Kingdom and the e.c. could begin. There was also generalagreement that our negotiating stance had greatly improved since the1967 discussions. Not only was our economic house in better order as a result of our own efforts, a point which the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had been careful to stress at suitable points in his discussions in New York, but the e.c. countries, bothindividually and collectively, were much less self-confident. Most ofthem now recognised the manifold defects of the agricultural policywhich the e.c. had up to now pursued. In considering the political aspects of our entry, it had to be borne in mind that for most people the issue of our entry to the Common Market was subsidiary to moredomestic issues. Both in the Labour Party and in the country as awhole, those who felt strongly about the issue, whether advocates oropponents, were very much in a minority. It would be important inthe coming months to strike the right note of robust confidence,making it clear that we were ready to negotiate but were in no waysuppliants for admission to the Common Market on any terms.Equally, it would be important to avoid any suggestion of a reversal of previous policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it remained our objective to become members of the e.c.. But any negotiations for this purpose would need to be on the basis that theycommitted the Six as a whole to a genuine intention to bring them toa successful conclusion; and we should, of course, need to be satisfiedthat acceptable terms could be negotiated. It must be understoodthat in our present economic position we were now strong enough
Strategic ArmsLimitationTalksNorthernIrelandThe Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that while in new York both he and Mr. Rogers, the United States Secretary ofState, had discussed with Mr. Gromyko the continued Russian delay in replying to the United States&apos; suggestion that the two powers should hold talks on the limitation of strategic armaments. BothMinisters had formed the impression that the Russians remainedserious in their intention to enter into such talks, but were finding the subject, as had the Americans, an extremely complex one onwhich to formulate a negotiating position.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, followingan appeal by Lord Caradon, which had been preceded by intensivediplomatic lobbying by our representatives all over the world, theForeign Minister of the Irish Republic had given up his attempt tohave the situation in Ulster inscribed on the agenda of the general assembly. The matter would not now be pressed to a vote.SECRETindustrial 5.  xhe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the FirstPolicySecretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity (C (69) 123) about industrial policy, together with a noteby the Secretary of the Cabinet (C (69) 122) covering a report by officials on the nature, scope and functions of a possible IndustrialCommission.to carry the initial burdens of membership but also strong enoughto stand on our own feet, if membership on acceptable terms proved impossible. The timing and manner of our approach to negotiationswith the e.c. would be of great political importance; and theCabinet would wish to consider the subject in the fairly near future.Meanwhile the interdepartmental study of the cost of our accession to the e.c. should proceed under the central direction of the cabinet office; and it should be based on a range of assumptions aboutpossible variations in the main factors concerned. In particular theestimates should take full account of changes which had occurred since 1967 in relation to trade with the e.c. and to capital movements. The Government would have to be ready to give, toParliament and the public, full information relating to our accession to the e.c..
The First Secretary of State said that future policy on prices and incomes should be considered as part of the Governmenfs industrial policy as a whole. They were already committed to the reactivationof Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966; and this would formthe basis of policy for most of 1970.  But the power to delay the implementation of price or wage increases for three months was of limited value.  In the longer term the emphasis should move fromefforts to restrict specific increases to the positive promotion of efficiency and productivity and to the development of the concept ofthe public accountability of industry in both the public and private sectors.    The establishment of a  new Public  AccountabilityCommission, on the lines indicated in the report by officials, could make  an  important  contribution  to  this  concept.    Such aCommission would be able not only to take over the existingfunctions of both the Monopolies Commission and the national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) but also to examine theactivities of large or monopolistic firms as a whole instead of considering them only in terms of prices and incomes on the onehand or the abuse of monopoly power on the other. This would bea useful institutional reform and would eliminate an increasinglyirrational duplication of functions between the NBPI and the monopolies Commission.   In the long term, it might be possiblefor the new body also to take over the functions of the Commissionon Industrial Relations.  The new Commission would not affect theresponsibility of Ministers in charge of production departments forthe industries with which they dealt, whether nationalised or private.On the incomes side, the new body would be able to considerreferences covering pay agreements or pay structures and their implications for costs, prices and the overall efficiency of the firms concerned.  It would also be able to consider pay and efficiency inthe public sector, although further consideration would need to begiven  to   the  precise  arrangements   for  this   purpose.    TheGovernment would retain, in relation to the Commission^ findings,powers similar to those which they now had in relation to the monopolies Commission, although it might be appropriate to restrict the power to control prices at present unlimited to a period, ofsay, two years.  On this basis the Cabinet should now reaffirm that part II of the 1966 Act should be reactivated at the end of this yearand should continue in operation until the new Commission, on lines indicated in C (69) 122, was established by legislation in the coming session of Parliament.   A White Paper on the Governmenfsindustrial policy might be published and the necessary legislationintroduced in the New Year.In discussion it was suggested that proposals for institutionalchanges should follow, not precede, decisions about future policy
objectives. While the Governmenfs present policy in relation to industry could no doubt be improved, it was fundamentally sound and was widely accepted by both sides of industry, as recent discussions in the National Economic Development Council had shown. The apparent contradictions between  he roles ofthe Monopolies Commission and of the Industrial reorganisation corporation had been satisfactorily resolved. As to future policyobjectives and powers, it might well be desirable in future to havepower to consider the implications for the public interest of a company&apos;s policies and operations as a whole and also to examinethe results of past mergers. It was more doubtful, however, whetherit would be desirable to continue to exercise powers of price controlwhile dropping all powers to control incomes. This asymmetricalpolicy, even if effective in economic terms, would be liable to giverise to strong opposition from industry and to eudanger their existingco-operation with the Government on price restraint, The proposalto refer to the new Commission the activities of any large company-whether or not it exercised a statutory monopoly would inpractice extend the present scope of thp Monopolies Commissionlittle jf at all; but if would provoke intense opposition from industry,who were already concerned at the allegedly indiscriminate andunpredictable choipe of references to the Monopolies Commission.As regards institutional arrangements in this field, there was a case for some rationalisation of the existing bodies concerned withinvestigation into various aspects of industrial activity. But it wasirrational and incongruous to seek to merge- - as was now proposed responsibility for two such disparate matters as the overall efficiency of a private, company and the pay of e,g. the Armed Forces or other sectors of th? public service. A more appropriate solution might beto merge part of the present responsibilities pf the NBPI forexample, the efficiency audit of nationalised industries with the monopolies Commission in a new organisation concerned with industrial structure and efficienpy and to merge the remainder of the nbpi with the Commission for Industrial Relations (CIR) in a singleorganisation concerned with incomes policy in its widest sense.Moreover, the place of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation(1958-59) and of the Restrictive Practices Court in relation to any newinstitutional machinery would need careful consideration. For these reasons it would be preferable to give more time to detailed examination of the objectives of Government policy in relation to industry and the machinery required to implement those objectiveswith a view to aption in the next Parliament; and it would be premature and inappropriate to seek to legislate on this subject inthe forthcoming Session.
It was also suggested that, in so far as the proposed new commission might be designed to maintain the substance of a prices and incomes policy in a broader context after the necessary interimreactivation of Part II of the 1966 Act, it was doubtful whether itcould be convincingly presented in this light, particularly to theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF) to whom we were committedas regards the reactivation of Part II. On the other hand, it wasimplicit in C (69) 123 that Part II would not be likely to give theGovernment any effective powers of control in 1970; and on thatassumption the better course might be not to reactivate it at the endof the year. The IMF might be persuaded by the recent improve-ment in our economic position that such action might not now benecessary. It was further urged that a new Commission on the linesnow proposed would be liable progressively to erode the existingresponsibilities and powers of Ministers to stimulate efficiency andregard for the public interest in the private and public sectors ofindustry. Ministers were genuinely and directly accountable toParliament and public opinion for their discharge of these responsibilities; and this principle should not be blurred or confusedby the intervention of a new Commission. In any event, theestablishment of a Commission with wide-ranging powers to investigate any large company and to control prices but not incomeswould inevitably lead to a serious confrontation with industry whichcould be extremely damaging, at any rate in the short term. Thesuggestion that the new Commission should be given responsibilityfor advising on the pay of the various public services (e.g. doctors,civil servants and, presumably, teachers) would also provokeunnecessary difficulties at this time. Industry in general and the foodindustry in particular had co-operated well on a largely voluntary basis in the restraint of price increases. Co-operation between theGovernment and industry, which was particularly important for themaintenance of price stability for food, could hardly be expected tocontinue under the proposed new regime. A change on the lines proposed might also disrupt an understanding which was on thepoint of agreement with local authorities for voluntary restraint of rent increases.On the other hand, it was generally recognised that there was atpresent serious duplication of functions between the monopolies commission and the NBPI. The proposed new Commission wouldhave the advantage of resolving this duplication without encroachingon the existing powers and responsibilities of Ministers and wouldalso represent an important development of the Government&apos;industrial policies in the longer term. There was accordingly a strong case for creating as soon as possible a body on the lines of theproposed Commission in the context of the complex of problems arising in connection with prices, wages, costs, monopolies and
CC45(69)mergers. The additional functions which such a body mightdischarge in relation to the concept of greater public accountabilityon the part of industry could perhaps be the subject of more detailed and leisurely examination.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that the Government were publicly committed tothe reactivation of Part II of the 1966 Act. Ministers would clearlywish to have a further opportunity to consider the implications ofthe First Secretary&apos;s proposals in relation both to the developmentof prices and incomes policy in the short term and to the promotionin the longer term of greater industrial efficiency and publicaccountability. They would also need to consider in more detail theasymmetry between the Powers proposed in respect of incomes and prices, including rents. In terms of institutional arrangements therewas general support for the proposal to merge the monopolies commission and the NBPI, subject to two important reservations first, that there should be no derogation from the existing powersand responsibilities of sponsoring Ministers to stimulate efficiency and regard for the public interest in industries for which they were responsible in the public and private sectors of the economy; secondthat the existing arrangements for determining pay in sensitive areasof the public sector might well need to continue until new ones hadbeen worked out in consultation with those affected. The cabinet would need to give further thought to all these matters at their next meeting, and to consider at the same time the First Secretary&apos;sproposals in C (69) 123 on industrial relations. They would then beready to take a decision on the manner in which the whole complex of interrelated issues in the field of industrial policy should be presented in terms of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament and the legislative programme for the next Session.Meanwhile, the concept outlined in C (69) 122 and 123 should be examined and elaborated in the light of the Cabinefs discussion,without prejudice to the final decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting.Equal Pay(previous reference:CG (69) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity on equal pay (C (69) 120).The First Secretary of State said that, as requested by theCabinet at its meeting of 4th September (CC (69) 42nd Conclusions,
Minute 3), she had consulted the Trades Union Congress (TUC) andthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) about the need lorlegislation and the form which it might take. Their reactions hadbeen very much as predicted. The TUC had asked for implementation within two years and the CBI had asked that itshould be delayed for about nine years. Accordingly, subject to theagreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on this timing sheproposed to announce at next week&apos;s Labour Party Conference thatthe Government intended to introduce legislation on equal pay in thenext Session of Parliament, which would provide that by 1975 itwould be illegal to discriminate in pay on grounds of sex. After theannouncement she would embark at once on discussions with bothsides of industry about the details of legislation.In discussion, it was suggested that at their previous meeting no decision had been taken as to the precise date by which equal pay should be introduced; and that &quot; discrimination in pay on grounds of sex &quot; might go wider than the principle, suggested in the previous discussion, of &quot; equal pay for the same work &quot;. On the other hand,it was pointed out that the Cabinet had previously agreed to legislation on the broad lines indicated by the First Secretary which included a deadline of end-1975; that &quot;discrimination in pay on grounds of sex &quot; was a formula which satisfied the CBI and TUC aswell as the International Labour Organisation; and that it did not infact go wider than had been previously proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had already agreed that legislation on equal pay should beintroduced in the next Session on the broad lines proposed by theFirst Secretary of State, which envisaged implementation by the endof 1975. The timing and content of her announcement of thedecision should be settled in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and himself. No indication should be given in advance that such a statement might be made.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, todetermine the timing and content of her announcementof the Governmenfs decision to introduce legislation on equal pay.SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (SEP (69) 69), recommending no extension of thescheme for giving a second option to firms in Development Areas in public SectorPurchasing
Parliament(No. 7) Bill(previous references:CC(69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1;CC(69) 36thConclusions,Minute 3)*8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by chancellor on the Parliament (No. 7) Bill (C (69) 121).secret the lord the Lord Chancellor said that on 10th July the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for the Ministerial Committee on the Houseof Lords to consider the desirability of introducing a Bill to limit theHouse of Lords&apos; powers and to report to the Cabinet in September.Subsequently, at the invitation of the group of Ministers consideringthe House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Bill, he had arranged for the preparation of a draft Bill to curtail the powers ofthe House of Lords in case the Cabinet decided to introduce such aBill. The draft followed closely the provisions of the Parliament(No. 2) Bill. A decision to introduce such legislation would not affectthe date on which the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats)Bill could become law; and even if it were introduced as soon as parliament reassembled a new Parliament Bill could not become law before 15th November, 1970, at the earliest. The legislativeconsequences of introducing such a Bill would be serious. The spiritof co-operation in the House of Lords on which the Government hadto rely to get its business through would disappear and they wouldbe faced with prolonged and determined obstruction. In the light ofthese considerations the Ministerial Committee on the House oftendering for Government contracts, and proposing action to increasethe benefits of the existing scheme and to monitor its operation.They also considered a further memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (SEP (69) 75) proposing a small working group ofrepresentatives from the relevant Government Departments, the nationalised industries and, in due course, the local authorities toco-ordinate public sector purchasing.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 7 of SEP (69) 69 onpreference for Development Areas in government contracts.(2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 12 of SEP (69) 75 onthe co-ordination of public sector purchasing.
Lords had concluded unanimously that no Bill to limit the House ofLords&apos; powers should be introduced either this Session or next, andthat no reference to such Bill should be included in The Queen&apos;sSpeech.The Cabinet-Agreed that no Bill to limit the House of Lords&apos; powers should be introduced either this Session or next.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th September, 1969.
