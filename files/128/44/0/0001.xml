IndustrialAffairsA Policy forIndustrialRelations:Draft WhitePaperSECRET1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity (C (68) 131) covering the draft of a White Paper on aPolicy for Industrial Relations.The Prime Minister said that in the previous summer the first secretary had entered into consultations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) onthe broad issues arising from the report of the Royal Commission on trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations (the DonovanCommission). She had then begun to formulate proposals forGovernment action which had been considered, with particular reference to their legal implications, at two meetings of a small group of Ministers directly concerned. He had thought it advisable,following the procedure which had been successfully adopted in thepast for prices and incomes policy, that the First Secretary shouldhave further consultations with the TUC and CBI before making recommendations to the Cabinet. Formal consultations had accordingly been initiated on 30th December. The TUC, however,had not yet been able to give the First Secretary their consideredcomments on her proposals. He proposed that at this meeting theCabinet should consider the main issues arising on her memorandum and should examine the draft White Paper, but that they should not attempt to reach any formal decisions at this stage.The First Secretary of State said that, while the report of the donovan Commission had provided a most valuable basis for changesin industrial relations, she considered that it would be mistaken toproceed simply on the basis that each of the Commission^ individualrecommendations had either to be accepted or rejected. There were some weaknesses in the Commission^ report. In particular, thereport had failed to analyse adequately the developing role of tradeunions; and its analysis of the problems of collective bargaining in industry was dominated by experience in the engineering and motor vehicle industries. As regards the role of the law in industrial relations, the Donovan Commission had stressed that collective agreements were not at present generally in a form which could be legally enforced, but pointed out that when their form improved theymight be made legally enforceable by statute. In consequence, therecommendation to establish a Commission on Industrial Relations(CIR) to improve the form of collective agreements, while highly desirable in itself, had aroused great suspicion amongst many trade unionists. The CBI had made plain their wish to make all such agreements statutorily enforceable. The proposals in the draft white paper gave greater safeguards to trade unions in this respect than did9793a 2
those of the Donovan Commission. The role of the law in industrial relations would, under her proposals, be strictly limited for both moral and practical reasons.First, the present barrier to the direct legal enforcement of collective agreements between an employers&apos; association and a tradeunion would be removed by modification of Section 4 (4) of the TradeUnion Act 1871, but the draft White Paper made it clear that theGovernment had no intention of bringing pressure to bear to makecollective agreements legally enforceable.Secondly, many of the problems arose from the weakness ratherthan the strength of the trade unions. It was proposed accordingly to provide a statutory right to all to belong to trade unions and totake steps to assist trade unions to obtain recognition in individual firms and factories. The proposed Trade Union development scheme was also intended to assist in the improvement of the structure and facilities of the trade union movement.Thirdly, it was proposed to provide legal sanctions to defend the rights of the community as a whole in certain strictly limited andclosely defined fields. The Secretary of State for Employment and productivity would be given a discretionary power to require amaximum of 56 days postponement of unconstitutional strikes.During this pause for conciliation the terms of employment to be observed would be those which existed before the dispute arose, sothat the delay would not protect an employer who took provocativeaction. This discretionary power would be exercised only insituations where it was likely to be of practical value and acceptable to public opinion. The Secretary of State would also be givendiscretionary powers to ensure that members were consulted byballot, as the rules of a large number of unions already provided,before being brought out on strike. There would also be powers toenforce (by the imposition of fines on employers and/or unions) therecommendations of the CIR on inter-union disputes.Fourthly, trade unions would be required by the industrial relations Bill to register with a new Registrar of Trade Unions and employers Associations, and registered unions would be required tohave rules, of their own framing, governing admission, discipline,elections, strike ballots, and so on.Finally, an independent review body was proposed to hearcomplaints by individuals of unfair or arbitrary action by unions, andif complaints were found to be justified the review body would havepower to award damages or admission or reinstatement in a union.The First Secretary of State said that the TUC and CBI hadbeen informed of these proposals at the beginning of the week. the cbi had said that the proposals were totally inadequate withoutprovision for the legal enforcement of collective agreements.  They
had welcomed the proposed Trade Union Development Scheme, but were concerned about the provision for maintenance of the status quo during the pause for conciliation imposed in unofficial strikes.The Financial and General Purposes Committee of the TUC had been unable to give the tuc&apos;s final comments, since the proposals wereto be considered by the General Council on 7th January. Butinformally it was clear that there were three main points of difficultyfor the unions. They objected to provision for compulsory strikeballots; for a conciliation pause in the case of unconstitutional strikes;and for the CIR to make enforceable recommendations in inter-uniondisputes. They had, however, welcomed many of the proposals.She would hear the final views of the TUC at a meeting which she had arranged for the afternoon of Wednesday, 8th January.The Cabinet considered in order the issues raised in the first secretary&apos;s memorandum.Theme of the Draft While PaperIt was suggested that the White Paper should give much greater emphasis to the importance of developing more effective negotiating machinery and disputes procedure in industry. The basic theme ofthe Donovan Commission was that the root of the present troublesin industrial relations was the absence of effective procedures for the rapid and equitable settlement of grievances, and that this lackshould be made good as quickly as possible. The proposal in thedraft White Paper to use legal sanctions to deal with strikes wasmisconceived and the draft gave no satisfactory answer to the donovan Commission^ objections to such a step. The record ofindustrial disputes in the United Kingdom, given in Appendix 2 ofthe draft, showed that it compared favourably with that of most othercountries. This fact too should be given greater emphasis in the draft,and it largely undermined the case for legal sanctions. They should consider very carefully the political and other consequences of introducing legal sanctions to deal with strikes in disregard of the donovan Commission^ recommendations.In further discussion, it was suggested that, while most of theproposals in the White Paper would be generally acceptable, therewas one very important area in dispute the role of the law in industrial relations. There were four possible courses in this disputedarea. First, they could adopt the majority recommendations of the donovan Commission to the effect, broadly, that the CIR should beestablished, in the first place without legal powers or sanctions, towork for the speedy reform of existing arrangements for collective bargaining; and only if this voluntary approach failed shouldconsideration be given to providing the CIR with statutory powers.Secondly, they could follow Mr. Shonfield&apos;s recommendations in his
note of reservation to the report of the Donovan Commission and establish a CIR with considerable statutory and quasi-judicial functions and powers. Thirdly, there was the possibility of providingfor legal enforcement of all collective agreements, as proposed by the cbi and operated in many other countries. Finally, there were theproposals in the draft White Paper for combining action by the CIRon a voluntary basis to improve bargaining machinery with theprovision of certain legal sanctions; in particular, discretionary legal powers to the Secretary of State to require strike ballots before officialstrikes and postponement of unconstitutional ones and to enforce theCIR&apos;s recommendations in inter-union disputes. The Cabinet shouldbe in a position to consider fully the arguments for and against thesedifferent courses before taking a decision on a matter of such crucial importance, and the White Paper should also set out the variousarguments much more fully than at present.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, while the white paper could certainly be amended to give greater emphasis to theimportance of reforming the present machinery of industrialnegotiation, it was unrealistic particularly against the present serious economic background to wait for the voluntary reform of this machinery to put an end to the numerous strikes which were startedunconstitutionally, often by a handful of men, without adequatecause but with crippling effects on the economy.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the First Secretary should circulate a paper for consideration bythe Ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations at the beginningof the following week. The paper should set out the arguments forand against the four different roles of the law in collective bargainingwhich had been outlined in their discussions. The Committee on industrial Relations should then report their conclusions to theCabinet. The draft White Paper would require to be amended inany event to set out more fully the arguments for and against thevarious possibilities; and, if possible, to give greater emphasis to theimportance which the Government attached to speedy reform of thepresent arrangements for collective bargaining in industry.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations to consider at the beginning of the following week a report on thelines indicated by the Prime Minister and to reportthereafter to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange in due course for amendment to the White Paper on the lines indicatedin the summing up.
Commission on industrial relations in discussion, it was argued that Mr. Shonfield&apos;s minorityrecommendation that the CIR should be given certain quasi-judicial functions and statutory powers deserved further consideration. If theCIR were given substantial statutory powers, there would be little or no case for the proposed legal sanctions to deal with strikes. Onthe other hand, it was argued that it was not possible to compel two parties to reach an agreement against their wishes, so that statutory powers would not in practice enable the CIR to improve procedure agreements more rapidly and effectively. Moreover, if the CIR weregiven wide statutory powers, it would reduce its effectiveness in itsvoluntary role of improving machinery of collective bargaining. Thegroup of Ministers which had been considering the draft While paper had concluded that, while the CIR should begin its operations on a voluntary basis, the Government should consult with the industrial organisations concerned about the possibility of providing reserve powers in the Industrial Relations Bill. These statutory powers couldbe invoked on the initiative of the Secretary of State for employment and Productivity, following a report by the CIR, if experience showed that a completely voluntary system had not proved fully effective.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat a decision on the powers and responsibilities of the CIR couldnot be finally taken before the Cabinet had considered the reportreferred to in conclusion (1) above.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.Registration of agreements the Cabinet(4) Invited the First Secretary of State to consider with the lord privy Seal whether the requirement to register procedure agreements should apply to the Civil Service and to thePost Office.Disclosure of management information to trade unions and employeeparticipationIt was pointed out in discussion that the proposals for providingmore information and for removing the legal barriers to theappointment of trade union representatives to company boards wouldinvolve significant changes in company law, which would require
detailed consideration. It should be borne in mind that the work ofthe joint working group drawn from members of the Government andthe National Executive Committee of the Labour Party, on companylaw in relation to the role of large companies, was also relevant.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the group of Ministers which had considered the draft white paper had concluded that paragraph 44 should make clear that theGovernment had decided that more information should be madeavailable to employees&apos; representatives and intended to consult furtherabout the implementation of this decision, and that paragraph 45should make clear that the provisions in the Industrial Relations bill relating to trade union representation on company boards wouldmake this development possible but not mandatory. The existence and relevance of the Labour Party study might be made clear at a press conference when the White Paper was published.The Cabinet (5) Took  note,  with  approval,  of  the  Prime   minister&apos;s summing up.Trade union membership: recognition, inter-union disputes in discussion, it was suggested that the proposed legal sanctionsto seek to enforce the recommendations of the CIR on inter-uniondisputes would provoke bitter opposition and yet prove totallyineffective. On the other hand, there was a wide measure of support for the First Secretary&apos;s proposals. They gave the TUC anopportunity to resolve the inter-union disputes before the CIR orlegal sanctions were introduced, and public opinion generally wouldfully suport the firm line being taken against the disruptive effects onour economy of stoppages resulting from demarcation and otherdisputes between unions.The Cabinet (6) Agreed to consider these proposals further in the light of thereport referred to in conclusion (1) above.Trade union development scheme in discussion it was agreed that these powers would be particularly important in relation to the training of trade unionofficers and to the development of their research facilities whichshould be given further emphasis in the draft White Paper. Whilethe proposals might be helpful to the CIR in bringing about somerestructuring of the unions parallel to the industrial restructuringundertaken by the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59), itsdirect effect in this field might be limited. There were real problems
of public accountability which would need to be carefully considered when the proposed legislation was drafted; the precise purposes forwhich funds might be used would have to be set out.The Cabinet (7) Approved the proposals referred to in paragraph 16 ofC(68)131.Strikes-cornpulsory ballotsIn discussion some fears were expressed that the proposedcompulsory ballot before certain major official strikes might be rarelyused and ineffective. The proposal would, however, provoke strong opposition in the trade unions and among the government&apos;s supporters generally, and this might jeopardise the success of the otherconstructive proposals in the draft White Paper. The TUC were apparently even more opposed to this proposal than to the compulsory pause for conciliation in unconstitutional strikes. On theother hand it was argued that there was no foundation for these fears.The proposal was for a reserve discretionary power which would beused only where a strike would damage the economy and there wasdoubt about the support it commanded. It was not intended to prohibit strikes but to allow members to express their views before anofficial strike took place, and the draft White Paper would make thisclear. The risk that, if the result of a ballot were in favour of a strike,the leadership would find it more difficult to reach a settlement, couldbe overcome; the White Paper would be revised to make it clear thatthe union would be free to provide in its rules that the executive coulddefer or call off a strike which had been agreed by ballot without theneed for a further ballot. While it was important to stress in the white paper that many unions already included in their rules provision forballoting their members before a strike, it was not the intention to insist that all unions should adopt this practice. The new registrar of Trade Unions and Employers&apos; Associations would have to besatisfied when registering a union that its rules made provision for theproper conduct of any ballot that might be held. While there wouldbe sanctions against any union which refused to hold a ballot when required to do so, there would be no sanctions against any union which went forward with strike action contrary to the majority viewof its members.In further discussion it was agreed that the First Secretary ofState should explain in her memorandum to the ministerial committee on Industrial Relations why she had rejected therecommendation of the Donovan Commission against compulsoryballots. The Commission had examined this point in detail but hadSECRET9793 B
found no evidence to suggest that such a power would serveany useful purpose. On the other hand the Commission had reportedbefore the threatened national strike in the engineering industry; andit must be recognised that while major official strikes were rare, andin some ways a less serious problem than local and unofficial strikes,they could do very considerable harm to the economy, as the seamen&apos;strike in 1966 had done.The Committee (8) Invited the First Secretary of State to explain, in hermemorandum to the Ministerial Committee on industrial relations, why she had rejected the recommendation ofthe Donovan Commission against compulsory ballots of union members prior to official strikes.Strikes pause for conciliationThe First Secretary of State explained that the proposed powerto require a maximum of 56 days&apos; postponement in the case ofunconstitutional strikes would be discretionary. It would not be invoked in respect of very short strikes or those which had no serious repercussions. With the growing inter-dependence of industry,however, comparatively small groups of men could abuse their powerand throw many thousands of others out of work, and could causeinconvenience or hardship to the public and substantial damage tothe economy. It was right that there should be a power, not to banstrikes, but to provide a breathing space in which the normalprocedures of negotiation, or if necessary a court of inquiry, could operate. The proposal related only to unconstitutional or irregularstrikes in which, by definition, the procedures agreed and supportedby the unions concerned had not been followed; they ought therefore to welcome the proposal which would strengthen their hands. Theproposed power could, however, be invoked even where a unioncalled an official strike without having exhausted the normalprocedures, and it would make no difference if a strike were declaredofficial after it had started.The Lord Chancellor explained the new proposals for enforcingthis provision and those described in paragraphs 54 (unionrecognition), 81 (compulsory ballots) and 98 (union registration) ofthe draft White Paper. A new Industrial Board would deal withthese cases. It would sit in panels of three, consisting of the Presidentof the Industrial Court or one of the independent legal members,together with two trade unionists from the employees&apos; panel, or onetrade unionist and one employer, depending on the nature of the case.Whenever more convenient, the Board would sit at the place of dispute. The Board could impose financial penalties recoverablethrough the county courts and by attachment of wages, but without
9793cliability to imprisonment in default of payment or on account of failure to obey an order. This proposal had been discussed with thePresident of the Industrial Court who considered it practicable. Onegreat advantage would be the ease with which proceedings could be discontinued if there were a settlement or a return to work. A newsection would be added to the White Paper to explain this proposal.In discussion, considerable doubt was expressed about the effectiveness of the proposal. Normally the men would already beon strike when the procedure was invoked. They could evade anorder and any penalties for defying it by giving notice, and even ifthey went back to work there was no way of ensuring that theyworked normally. The Donovan Commission had carefully considered the question-of legal sanctions; was there any evidencethat they were wrong or that these powers would be any moreenforceable than the wartime ones invoked in the BetteshangerColliery case? Similarly, was there any real evidence that these powers would be more effective than the Taft-Hartley Act had proved to be in the United States? Once the power was available, the first secretary of State would be under constant pressure to invoke it; andif the first major case was one, such as a Liverpool dock strike, inwhich it could not be enforced, the deterrent effect would be lost. was it worth risking the difficulty and the loss of goodwill within theunions and the Labour Party which the proposal would entail?On the other hand, it was argued that it was essential to take powers to deal with strikes such as the recent stoppage at Girlings(Cwmbran), which caused serious damage to other industries and tothe economy generally? In the long term there might be less needfor this power as the CIR brought about an improvement inprocedures in industry generally, as had already been done with very good results in the coal industry. In the meantime, however, whileit could not be proved that the provision would be effective, therewas a good chance that it would reduce the number of &quot; wildcat&quot;strikes.The difficulties of enforcement should not be exaggerated, andpsychologically the existence of the power might make men morecareful. It would be a discretionary power which would be invokedonly in cases where it was expected to. be enforceable, where nosettlement was in sight, where public opinion was likely to be infavour, and, in the majority of cases, where the action should be supported by the union as strengthening their hand in getting the causeof the dispute considered through the agreed procedures. While everyextension of Government intervention in industrial affairs needed tobe examined carefully, it must be remembered that unofficial strikers
were themselves interfering with other workers, the public and the economy in general. Although in theory the responsibility for avoiding disruption should rest with the employers, in practice the strikes at which this power was aimed often affected others far more seriously than the immediate employer, who might well be preparedto pay more to buy off trouble than the economy could stand. Theproblem of &quot; wildcat&quot; strikes was a very serious one and theGovernment could not afford to appear to be standing aside from it.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the need for the proposed power might well diminish in the longterm. Recently, however, unofficial strikes had become a more serious problem because the unions no longer refused to negotiateuntil the men returned to work and the men no longer automaticallyreturned when a court of inquiry was appointed. Serious economicdamage was being caused. The Ministerial Committee on industrial relations should examine further the arguments for and against taking the proposed new power, and the likelihood of its beingeffective, in the light of the points made about enforceability. TheLord Chancellor should circulate to the Committee a memorandum setting out his proposals for enforcement through a new IndustrialBoard. The First Secretary of State should also circulate a shortmemorandum which might explain how the procedure would workin a typical case, the meaning of &quot; unconstitutional&quot;, and the implications, if any, of a strike being declared official. Thememorandum might also indicate how often in a recent period thepower might have been invoked and give some examples of the damage caused in particular instances. It should also explain the differences between this proposal and the Taft-Hartley Act in forcein the United States together with the reasons for thinking it more likely to prove effective.The Cabinet (9) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations toconsider the matter further on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister in his summing up of the discussion.(10) Invited the Lord Chancellor to circulate to the ministerial committee on Industrial Relations a memorandum explaining his proposals for enforcement.Strikes and the lawIn discussion attention was drawn to the need to protect theposition of the Armed Forces, in respect both of this provision andof others including that dealing with trade union recognition.
9793The Cabinet (11) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 18 and 19 ofC (68) 131.Unfair dismissal, etc.The Cabinet (12) Approved the proposals in paragraph 20 of C (68) 131.Trade union rules and registrationThe First Secretary of State said that the TUC were content withthese proposals, particularly since it had been agreed that tradeunions should not be given corporate status. The CBI, however, had raised the question precisely what body would be registered if therewas no incorporation, and this problem was being examined further.The Cabinet (13) Approved the proposals in paragraph 21 of C (68) 131.An independent review bodyThe First Secretary of State said that while the TUC had expressed opposition to the idea of an independent review body, theydid not feel strongly on the subject. Her legal advisers were in touchwith those of the Scottish Office about the implications for Scotland.In discussion, some support was expressed for the opposition ofthe TUC.The Cabinet-(14) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 22 and 23 ofC (68) 131.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion of C (68) 131 asa whole, said that most members of the Cabinet seemed to bein favour of the First Secretary&apos;s proposals for compulsory ballotsthough some members were still opposed to it and others preferred to suspend judgment for the time being. Opinion on the proposalfor a compulsory pause for conciliation was more evenly divided, andthe arguments for and against it would need to be examined againwhen further consideration had been given to the alternative proposals in Mr. Shonfield&apos;s note of reservation to the Donovan Report. the ministerial Committee on Industrial Relations would meet early inthe following week to consider memoranda by the First Secretary ofState (which would also be circulated to the Cabinet) on this andother related issues and to examine the text of the draft White Paper.
The Cabinet would resume their discussion of the First Secretary&apos;sproposals and the draft White Paper later in the week, when theywould be able to take account of the Ministerial Committee&apos;discussion and of any further views expressed by the TUC. In viewof the continuing Press speculation on the subject they should aim to publish the White Paper as soon as possible after the TUCsconsidered views were known and before the end of the ParliamentaryRecess. But no decision should be taken at this stage about the dateof publication nor should anything be said about it in public whichwould in any way limit the Cabinefs freedom to choose between thevarious alternative courses of action which had been proposed.In the meantime, the First Secretary of State should continueher discussions with the TUC on the same basis as before. she should make it clear, without implying that any radical changes in her proposals were contemplated, that the Cabinet had not yet reached any decisions on them, and would not do so until they had heard the tuc&apos;s considered views. Other members of the cabinet should refrain from entering into any discussion of these matters withthe TUC or CBI and if approached about the First Secretary&apos;sproposals they should avoid saying anything which might weaken her position in her own discussions with them.The timing of legislation would need further consideration.Some anxiety had been expressed about the prospect of a long delaybetween the publication of the White Paper and the introduction ofa Bill to implement the proposals in it. On the other hand the bill would necessarily be long and complex, and it was difficult to see how it could be ready for introduction before October 1969. TheLord President should circulate a memorandum to the Cabinet onthe possibility of introducing legislation in the current Session.The Cabinet (15) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(16) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the first secretary of State, to circulate to the Cabinet amemorandum on the possibility of introducing legislation in the current Session.(17) Invited the Paymaster General, in consultation with the first secretary of State and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to arrange for the preparation of speakingnotes on the issues involved for the use of Ministers whenthe White Paper was published.
CommonwealthImmigrationUnitedKingdomPassportHolders in kenya and uganda(previous reference:CC (68) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary(C (68) 130) and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary(C (68) 133) on United Kingdom Passport Holders in Kenya and uganda.The Home Secretary said that there was a possibility that anadditional wave of United Kingdom passport holders might seek toenter this country from East Africa in 1969, because the Governmentof Kenya did not renew their work permits and because of legislative action under consideration by the Government of Uganda designedto reduce drastically the Asian population in that country. Inaddition, there was a contingent problem of the same kind inthe South Yemen, though the latest (but still tentative) estimate of thenumbers involved there was 7,500 and not the 30,000 mentioned inC (68) 130. It was impossible to estimate at all accurately how largethe influx might be, but it could exceed substantially the numbers ofspecial entry vouchers available for this class of immigrant, and atworst might increase total Commonwealth immigration into thiscountry to 90,000 or more in 1969. This would happen at a timewhen it appeared that Commonwealth immigration would otherwiseno longer continue to increase and might even begin to decline. Nopolicy decisions were required on the handling of this problem at thepresent meeting, but it was necessary to decide on the line to be takenin bilateral discussion of it with the representatives of theCommonwealth countries concerned during the forthcoming meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers. Our objectives in these discussions should be to persuade the Governments of Kenya and uganda to slow down the flow of Asian migrants; to consider with&quot; old&quot; Commonwealth countries the possibility that they might accept some immigrants from East Africa; and to secure thecontinuance of the arrangements with the Government of India underwhich migrants from Kenya who were citizens of the United Kingdomand Commonwealth but who wished to settle in India were allowedto do so on the understanding that they retained their right to enterthis country later if they wished. We should not accept the proposal that had been made for an increase from 1,500 to 2,000 in the numberof special vouchers for Asians from East Africa.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, in additionto the approaches to Commonwealth countries proposed by the HomeSecretary, we should let it be known to countries whose citizens wereentering under the main voucher scheme that our prior responsibilitywas to those entitled to United Kingdom passports and that if wewere pressed too hard the numbers of entrants under the normalscheme might have to be reduced. We should also make it plain to
the representatives of Uganda at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Conference that we were not prepared to accept Asian immigrants from Uganda at a rate of their choosing.In discussion, there was general agreement with the proposals ofthe Home and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries. A pledgehad been given in Parliament during the Committee stage of theCommonwealth Immigrants Bill on 28th February, 1968, that ifholders of United Kingdom passports were expelled from their countries of residence, they would be allowed to come to this country.Our aim must be to prevent any new influx of immigrants from becoming so large that it could not be accommodated by adjustmentselsewhere in Commonwealth immigration, but no decision should betaken at this stage whether any new influx should be whollyaccommodated in this way. One possible way of providing additionalvouchers for Asians from East Africa was by reducing substantially the numbers allocated to doctors under the main voucher scheme.Although these doctors were of benefit to the National Health service in the short run, there would be structural and promotion problems in the Service in the longer term if they were to enter in the very largenumbers that were now in prospect.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals of the Home and Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries for handling the problem of additionalimmigrants from East Africa in discussions during the Common-wealth Prime Ministers&apos; Conference. When the outcome of these discussions was known, the Cabinet would wish to consider the policy issues involved. They were not disposed at present to increase thetotal number of immigrants, but if it were possible to reducethe number of doctors admitted under the scheme the vouchers thusmade available could be used for the admission of additional Asianholders of United Kingdom passports from East Africa. In themeantime, inter-departmental contingency planning should continue in the light of their discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.CONFIDENTIALRace Relations 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeUnited Nations Secretary (C (68) 132) on whether ratification of the United NationsConvention on convention on the elimination of all forms of Racial DiscriminationDiscrimination should De accompanied by a reservation in respect of the(Previous Commonwealth Immigrants Acts 1962 and 1968.Reference:CC (66) 47th SECRETConclusions,Minute 3)
The Home Secretary said that the Cabinet had decided inSeptember 1966 in favour of signing the Convention, subject to a reservation about Rhodesia, leaving the question of ratification for subsequent consideration; the Convention was signed in the followingmonth. The Home Affairs Committee considered the question of ratification at their meeting on 13th December, 1968, and concluded that the United Kingdom should ratify the Convention subject to afurther reservation in respect of the Commonwealth ImmigrantsActs, 1962 and 1968 and that the Government^ intention to ratifyshould be announced at an early date. The principle of ratificationwas not in dispute, and it had been announced in a Written Answer on19th December that it was hoped to deposit the Instrument of ratification early in the New Year. He had, however, felt bound to reserve his position on the need for a reservation to cover our commonwealth immigration legislation and it was on this point thathe now sought his colleagues&apos; views.They had to choose between two courses each of which heldsome likelihood of embarrassment. If the Convention were ratifiedwithout reservation in respect of the Commonwealth Immigrants Actsit would be open to any State Party at any time to complain formallythat we were not giving effect to the provisions of the Convention andto carry the issue to the International Court of Justice for decision.If the Court found the Acts to be incompatible with the Conventionwe would then have either to denounce the Convention or repeal theoffending provisions. If on the other hand we ratified with a reservation in respect of the Acts there would be a period of ninetydays within which any State Party could object to the reservation,and if two-thirds of the Parties objected, the reservation would beregarded as incompatible with the Convention; but otherwise theActs would be secure from further challenge. His objection toentering a reservation was that it appeared to constitute an admission that the Acts were racially discriminatory whereas the Governmenthad consistently maintained that they were not. For this reason hethought that the better course was to ratify without reservation onthis point.In discussion it was pointed out that the form of reservationproposed by officials was in no sense an admission that the Acts werediscriminatory; on the contrary it expressly reaffirmed the view ofthe Government that they were not. Entering a reservation might bethought to betray some lack of confidence by the Government intheir case, but the fact had to be faced that many people both at homeand abroad were convinced that the Acts were discriminatory. If a reservation were entered it would be subject to challenge for only ,ninety days, and a careful appraisal showed that it was extremely
unlikely that the two-thirds majority needed to invalidate it couldbe obtained. If on the other hand we ratified without reservation, wewould be open to challenge at any time by any single State Party; andthe Government were advised that there was a substantial risk thatthe International Court would find against us if the issue came before it. The consequences of an adverse decision would be very serious,whether we repealed the Acts or took the (for us) unprecedented stepof denouncing the Convention. It was for these reasons thatthe Home Affairs Committee had concluded, after extensivediscussion, in favour of ratification with the proposed reservation;this accorded with the views of the Minister of State at the united nations.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feeling in the Cabinet was in favour of ratification with a reservation to cover the Commonwealth Immigrants Acts. The formof words proposed maintained the Governments position that theActs were not discriminatory and this being so it did not seem worthrunning the risks associated with ratification without the reservation;these risks would be increased if pressure to enter this country grew.The Cabinet Agreed that ratification of the United Nations convention on the elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination besubject to a reservation in the terms proposed in respect ofthe Commonwealth Immigrants Acts 1962 and 1968.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd January, 1969
