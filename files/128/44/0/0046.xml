ParliamentaryAffairsHouse ofCommons(redistribution of Seats)(No. 2) Bill(previous reference :CC(69) 36thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered the situation which had been created by the strike of London dustmen and was being aggravated by corresponding action on the part of other public serviceemployees such as road sweepers, lavatory attendants, etc. Theywere informed that the Leader of the Opposition had that daywritten to the Prime Minister asking, among other things, for an assurance that the Government had satisfied themselves that thelocal authorities concerned were able and ready to take measures todeal with the resultant dangers to health.In discussion it was agreed that the dustmen&apos;s strike representedaction which so far was unofficial and unconstitutional. But therewere some indications that more powerful unions than those directly involved were seeking to turn the situation to account and to widen the dispute. The Government could not intervene for the timebeing; but, if the forthcoming meeting on 9 October between theemployers and the unions concerned failed to resolve the dispute over pay, it might be necessary to consider whether intervention bythe Trades Union Congress or the Government would be desirable.In the meantime, although the Governmenfs medical advisers1. The Prime Minister welcomed to the Cabinet those ministers who, as a result of the reconstruction of the Government, were joiningit for the first time or assuming new responsibilities. He invited theattention of Ministers to his memorandum (C (69) 134) explaining the motives which had prompted him in making the recent Ministerialchanges.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theFlouse of Commons in the following week.The flome Secretary said that an application had been made fora writ of mandamus against him and was due to be heard on20 October. It was therefore necessary to consider urgently whether he should lay the Orders implementing the Boundary Commission^recommendations in the near future. He was advised that so longas Parliament was seized of the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill there was a reasonable prospect that theapplication would be rejected. Allowing for the need to providetime for the House of Commons to consider any amendments by theHouse of Lords, the Bill might well be before Parliament until theend of the Session. In that event the interval between prorogation and any further Parliamentary proceedings on the Bill could be critical.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, the liome Secretary, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Lord Privy Seal, the attorney-General and the Chief Whip, to prepare a reporton the courses open to the Government in relation to theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Billfor consideration by the Cabinet in the following week.
confirmed that there was no immediate threat to public health andno local authority had sought advice or assistance, the OfficialEmergencies Committee should meet to consider what precautionaryaction should be taken against a further deterioration of thesituation.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General about the Continuance of the murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 (C (69) 129).The Attorney-General recalled that when the Cabinet had last considered the subject of capital punishment they had agreed thatResolutions to make permanent the Murder (Abolition of death penalty) Act 1965 should not be moved during the current Session ofParliament. Some members of the Cabinet had however expressed concern on the ground that if the Resolutions were defeated in either house, it would not be possible subsequently to introduce a Bill withthe same effect during the same Session, whereas if the resolutions were defeated in the spill-over period of the current Session, no suchconstraint would operate in relation to a Bill in the next Session.The Law Officers had therefore been invited to submit detailed advice on the question whether a defeat for the Resolutions would precludelegislation on the same subject later in the Session.The conclusions which the Law Officers had come to were asfollows:(i) If a Resolution to make the 1965 Act permanent were rejected in either House, it would be possible to legislate during thesame Session to extend the Act for a period of years, though it wouldnot be possible to legislate to make the Act permanent.(ii) If a Resolution to make the 1965 Act permanent were amended by either House in an attempt to extend the Act for aperiod of years, it would be possible to legislate in the same session to extend the Act for a different period of years and such legislation would be necessary to put the state of the law beyond doubt.(iii) A Bill to extend the life of the 1965 Act would be of limitedscope; and amendments to it intended to restore the death penalty forcategories of murder, or otherwise to amend the law, would be likelyto be ruled out of order, though it was difficult to be definite about what might happen in the House of Lords.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the advice of the Law Officers, and agreed that itgave no reason to depart from the decision taken at their previous discussion that the Resolutions on capital punishment should not be moved during the present Session. If during the forthcoming Sessiona Resolution to make the 1965 Act permanent were rejected oramended, the Government would be precluded from taking further action during that Session to give permanent effect to the 1965 Actand would have to fall back on extending the Act for a period ofyears. But this was a risk that could be faced; and the Cabinet took the view that Resolutions to make the Act permanent should be moved towards the end of the year.LegislationContinuanceof the murder(Abolition of death Penalty)Act 1965(previous reference :CC(69) 45thConclusions,Minute 3)
NorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 44thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that Resolutions to make permanent the Murder(Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965 should be moved in Parliament towards the end of the year.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (69) 131) on Northern Ireland; the conclusions reachedwere separately recorded and circulated only to The Queen, thePrime Minister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.SECRETReport of the 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of royal State for Scotland (C (69) 127) covering a draft of a preliminaryCommission on statement of the Government^ attitude to the report of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in Scotland (the WheatleyCommission).LocalGovernment inScotlandThe Secretary of State for Scotland said that when the WheatleyCommission report was published on 25 September a Pressannouncement had been made from the Prime Ministers Officethanking the Commission for their work and promising that thereport would be urgently studied, with early consultations. As soonas Parliament resumed it would be necessary to supplement this announcement with a preliminary statement of the Government^attitude to the report. The basic findings of the WheatleyCommission were the same as those of the Royal Commission on local Government in England (the Redcliffe-Maud Commission):i.e. that local government needed major rationalisation, that thenumber of executive authorities must be radically reduced, and thatthe division between town and country should be ended; and this statement could therefore suitably be on the same lines as thestatement made by the Prime Minister when the Redcliffe-MaudReport was published. But it was important to recognise at the outset that there might be differences between the patterns finallyadopted for Scotland, England and Wales; and the penultimateparagraph of the draft sought to make this clear. Such a statement would come more appropriately from the Prime Minister thanhimself. He hoped that it would be possible for the statement to bemade when Parliament resumed on Monday, 13 October when he had,in any event, to answer a Question by Mr. Gordon Campbell seeking a statement.In discussion it was agreed that the statement should be made asin the draft. But it was pointed out that the main reason for thePrime Minister making the statement on the Redcliffe-Maud Report that it was necessary for him to speak for several Ministers didnot apply in this case.  Furthermore, detailed questions were likelySECRET141771-5 b*
to be asked which would require special knowledge of the Scottishsituation. For these reasons it seemed better that the statement bemade by the Secretary of State for Scotland.It was agreed that it would be inappropriate to make any statement on the implications for the Boundary Commission^proposals until the future of the House of Commons (redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill was clearer. If the Secretary of State forScotland were asked about this after making his statement he would say that he was still considering the matter.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the statement should be made as in the draftbefore them, but that it would be more appropriate for the Secretaryof State for Scotland to make it rather than himself. The Secretaryof State for Scotland should consider further, in consultation withthe Lord President, the most appropriate day on which to make thestatement in light of other business when the House resumed.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to make thestatement annexed to C (69) 127 at the earliest appropriate moment on the resumption of Parliament.SECRETLocal 6.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofGovernment Housing and Local Government (C (69) 125) and the Secretary of reorganisation state for Wales (C (69) 128) on Local Government Reorganisation inin Wales wales the Secretary of State for Wales said that the Cabinet had decided not to include Wales in the terms of reference of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England because they recognised that the need for reform in Wales was particularlyurgent and that proposals for reorganisation were already in an advanced state of preparation. They had set out these proposals inthe White Paper published in July, 1967; and since then, there hadbeen widespread consultations with the local authorities concerned and their associations as well as with other interested bodies. As aresult there was a general expectation that the Government wouldbe moving to implement the proposals, coupled with an inevitablefeeling of insecurity among local authority staff. In his view, theright course was for the Government to legislate during the coming session and he considered that they would be discredited in Walesif they failed to do so; he recognised the pressure on draftingresources and was prepared to do what he could to shorten the Bill,but he felt bound to make the point that Wales was entitled to its share of legislative time. He did not consider that such a courseneed embarrass his colleagues. The Governmenfs proposals for wales and the recommendations of the two Royal Commissions were at one in sharply reducing the number of local authorities; the main points of difference were the retention of the county boroughs ofCardiff, Newport and Swansea and of the present two-tier structure
of local government. He recognised that in principle it was rightto combine town and country under a single authority, but this wasonly an issue in South Wales where special factors applied; hewould be quite prepared to take powers in the Bill to extend the boundaries of the county boroughs for this purpose. It should berecognised that conditions in the rest of Wales bore little relation tothose in England.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he recognised the difficulties of the Secretary of State for Wales; but thecourse which he was proposing was bound to have a damaging effecton the consultations now proceeding with local authority interests on reorganisation in England. The differences between the proposalsof the 1967 White Paper and the English Royal Commission werefundamental; and if it were known that the Government intendedto implement the former during the coming Session, it would undoubtedly stiffen opposition in England both among localauthorities and local Labour parties to the idea of unitary authorities with a minimum population of around 250,000. Moreover, he wasnot himself convinced that conditions in Wales were so different thatit would not be appropriate to adapt the recommendations of theEnglish Commission to the heavily populated area of South Wales.In his view the right course was to confine any reference in the queen&apos;s Speech to a statement that the Government would putforward proposals for the reorganisation of local government in all three countries; and to postpone any statement of their intentionsuntil the discussions about reorganisation in England were complete.In discussion considerable support was expressed for bothpoints of view; and there was general agreement that the Governmentwere faced with a difficult situation. In favour of early legislation it was argued that the Government would be discredited in Wales ifthey failed to implement the 1967 White Paper and instead foistedon that country a set of proposals based on the deliberations of royal Commissions which had taken no account of the specialcircumstances and aspirations of Wales. Conditions in England,Scotland and Wales differed substantially; and the royal commissions for England and Scotland, despite a commondiagnosis, had made differing recommendations. There was no need to strive for identical solutions and in any case the current proposalsfor the three countries had much in common.On the other hand it was pointed out that there was growingresistance to the radical proposals of the Redcliffe-Maud Commissionand in particular to the concept of unitary authorities. opponents of the proposals would be greatly encouraged if it were known thatthe Government proposed to retain the present county boroughs andtwo-tier structure in Wales; and the Association of municipal corporations (which alone among the local authority associationssupported the proposals) would be alienated. The Governmentcould not afford to prejudice in this way their chances of achievingradical reform; and it was argued that there should be no commitment to implement the 1967 White Paper on Wales until they had settled their policy for England and Scotland.  Moreover
it was far from clear that the 1967 proposals were in the best interestsof Wales; they were not the product of any radical rethinking andwould merely streamline the existing system.The implications for the rest of the legislative programme of aBill of the length proposed had also to be considered. Its inclusion in the programme would make it necessary to drop other Bills, suchas Civil Aviation, due for introduction later in the Session. this difficulty might, however, be eased if the Bill could be confined toessentials and presented as an interim solution, leaving minormatters to be dealt with later.In further discussion it was suggested that the best course wouldbe to insert a holding reference in The Queen&apos;s Speech on which thePrime Minister could build in the course of his speech during the debate on the Address. This would allow another three weeks forthe Government to reach a conclusion on whether or not to implement the substance of the 1967 White Paper. If they decidedto do so, it might be possible to have a Bill ready for introductionbefore the end of the Session, even though it could make no substantial progress; this possibility should be explored.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the wisest course appeared to be to confine the reference inThe Queen&apos;s Speech to an indication that &quot; proposals would be putforward &quot; for the reorganisation of local government in England,Scotland and Wales. This would provide a basis on which, in his ownspeech in the subsequent Debate on the Address, he could say thatthe Government hoped that it would be possible to introduce, at an appropriate point in the Session, legislation relating to there organisation of local government in Wales; and that it would bepossible to indicate in advance, by means of a White Paper, theform which such legislation might take. The feasibility of this approach, however, would depend on the Cabinefs being able toreach agreement, before the Debate on the Address, on the content of such a White Paper and the subsequent Bill (which, even if itwas not envisaged as reaching the Statute Book before the end ofthe Session, should be kept as short as possible). The ministers primarily concerned should now give urgent consideration to these issues and should report their conclusions to the Cabinet as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning to arrange for the Ministers primarily concerned to consider urgently whether the proposals inthe 1967 White Paper should be retained or replaced.(3) Invited the Lord President to examine the practicability of drafting a Bill for introduction towards the end of the session.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early date.
secret the Queen&apos;s 7.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President of the speech on the Council (C (69) 126) covering a draft of The QueeiVs Speech on the prorogation     Prorogation of Parliament,ol parliament the Lord President said that the draft had been considered bythe Ministerial Committee on The Qiieen&quot;s Speeches and that so faras he knew there were no points of substance outstanding. he wished, however, to draw his colleagues attention to the referenceto Northern Ireland in paragraph 12 which had been added to thedraft since the Committee had considered it.In discussion it was suggested that it might be better if the paragraph about the Governmenfs application for membership ofthe European Communities made some reference - to the improvedprospects of making progress; but the general feeling of the cabinet was that any such reference would be out of place. The paragraphabout the situation in Northern Ireland was agreed, subject to adrafting amendment.The Cabinet-Approved the draft of the Prorogation Speech annexed toC (69) 126, subject to the amendment made to paragraph 12.Cabinet Office,8 October, 1969.
