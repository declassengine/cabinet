OverseaAffairsActionCommitteefor 11 UnitedStates ofEurope(previous reference:CC(69) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that on15th July he had attended the meeting of the Action Committee fora United States of Europe (the Monnet Committee) in Brussels. TheCommittee was holding a further session that day, at which theMinister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, LordChalfont, was representing the Government, and Mr. Walter Padleywas representing the National Executive of the Labour Party. Themeeting had considered lour reports: on agriculture, institutions,monetary problems and technology. Interest had focussed mainly on the report on agriculture, which had been quite helpful to ourposition, and had emphasised the need to give a new direction tothe Common Agricultural Policy of the European economic community (e.c.). The ensuing discussion had also been useful, inthat it had provided an opportunity of refuting the French contention that British entry into the e.c. was not a practical possibility. in private discussion the Netherlands and Belgian Foreign Ministers,Mr. Luns and M. Harmel, had taken the view that it was becoming increasingly impossible for the French to stand out against theopening of negotiations between the e.c. and the United Kingdom.In the last extremity, the French might find that their partners inthe Community would refuse to meet their demands on agricultureunless they agreed to negotiations with the United Kingdom.In discussion, some concern was expressed over the position which might arise if the French were to exact the concession of their full demands on agriculture as a price for agreeing to negotiationsfor British entry. This would have serious implications for theUnited Kingdom and the Commonwealth. If there were any prospect of such a situation developing, we should have to be onour guard against being over-optimistic in our public pronouncementsabout the prospects of our entering the e.c.. As against this, itwas pointed out that we had in fact been extremely cautious in ourpublic statements, making it clear that our application for membership was on the table and that the next move lay withthe Community. This line would continue. As regards the attitudeof the Five to French demands, the German Foreign Minister,Herr Brandt, had made clear his view that any changes contemplated in the Common Agricultural Policy should be made in concert with us. We should undoubtedly have to pay some price for membership of the e.c., and the financial and economic implications were currently under examination. However, thoughit remained our firm intention to enter the Community, we die) not intend to do so at any cost.10521A 2
Mr. AnthonyGreyBermuda(previous reference:CC (69) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3)GreeceThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theChinese Government had made statements implying that they intended to release Mr. Grey when the Chinese journalists and press workers at present under detention in Hong Kong were released on 3rd October. While too much should not be read intothe Chinese statements, the prospects for the release of Mr. Greynow seemed fairly hopeful.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the BlackPower Conference in Bermuda was now over. Not all the delegates had yet left Bermuda, and the possibility of trouble could not yet be entirely discounted; but there had been no major disturbances, andit was to be hoped that there would be none.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.The President of the Board of Trade referred to reports in thePress of further arrests by the Greek regime of intellectuals, whowere stated to include an economist of international repute. Hesuggested that our Ambassador in Athens should be instructed tomake representations to the Greek Government.In discussion, it was pointed out that since the persons involved were Greek nationals, there was little scope for intervention by our ambassador on their behalf. Moreover, such influence as we had with the regime depended on our remaining on reasonably goodterms with it. There was however a case for considering what action could usefully be taken within these limitations.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the President of the Boardof Trade and of the points made in discussion.(4) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toconsider whether there was any action which could usefully be taken vis^a-vis the Greek Government.LancashireTextileIndustryCONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade about the Lancashire textile industry (C (69) 79).The Cabinet-CD Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.
The President of the Board of Trade said that decisions were now needed on the recommendations of the Textile Council whichhad carried out a thorough enquiry into the industry&apos;s problems.The Council had proposed that, instead of the present comprehensivequota system, there should be a 15 per cent tariff on imports ofcotton cloth from the Commonwealth. The most-favoured-nationjate would remain at 17^ per cent; and imports from the european free Trade Association and the Irish Republic would continue tobe duty free. In accordance with the terms of the GATT long-termagreement, it would be possible to impose quotas on individualcategories of cotton textiles from particular sources, but only wherethere was proof of market disruption, which would be strictlydefined. The economic arguments for protecting the industry bytariffs were strong, and there would be a gain both to the revenue and to the balance of trade in textiles. Moreover, this was thesolution the industry wanted. India would lose by it and it would inhis view be necessary and possible without creating a precedent to compensate her by additional aid. The only other commonwealth country which would be seriously affected would be Canada, whichhad a large annual surplus in her trade with us. developed countries would be the principal losers and apart from India the developing countries would not in general be significantly affected.The Textile Council had also recommended that the industry shouldreceive the higher rate of investment grant payable in thedevelopment areas, but in his view this could not in presentcircumstances be justified. Consideration should however be givento a proposal by the Council relating to depreciation allowances;and the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation should be asked toconsider sympathetically the possibility of using their powers to helpin the restructuring of the industry. The economic and political arguments in favour of his proposals which would have the supportof the Textile Council, both sides of the industry and Members ofParliament from the textile districts were very strong; and he proposed that he should make an announcement early in thefollowing week.In discussion it was argued that the proposal to give Indiaadditional aid as compensation for her loss of exports would create a dangerous precedent, especially in relation to our possible accession to the European Economic Community. The volume of tradeinvolved was small, and India already received a very high proportionof our total aid. As against this, it was suggested that the effect on india and other developing countries had been underrated. Adecision to abandon duty-free entry would represent a marked changeof policy and to do it without compensating India for her loss of exports, despite our contractual obligations to her, would be
inconsistent with the Governments declared policy towardsdeveloping countries.It was further suggested that the abolition of quotas would inpractice lead to a deterioration in the balance of trade, and that,since it would not be accompanied by measures designed to improve the industryS ability to meet competition from imports, it wouldnot be acceptable to the industry. The general view however wasthat, with falling consumption, quotas were bound to become less effective, and that a solution on the lines proposed by the Presidentof the Board of Trade would be generally welcomed in Lancashire.The Textile Councils proposals on depreciation allowances would need further examination, in consultation with the Inland Revenue.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet endorsed the proposals of the President of theBoard of Trade to impose a 15 per cent tariff on imports of cotton cloth from Commonwealth countries. There were divided iews about the need to give India additional aid as compensation for any loss of exports. They could not in any case decide at this stagehow much aid India should receive in 1972-73, when the new tariffwould come into effect; this must depend on circumstances at thetime, including both our own economic position and India&apos;s. in announcing their decisions to Parliament the President of the Boardof Trade could, however, say that when the time came to determine the level of aid to India in 1972-73 any adverse effects on her exports arising from the imposition of the tariff would be takeninto account against the background of her general aid requirementsat the time. He should consult the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of overseas Development about the terms and timing of his statement.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Agreed that the present system of comprehensive quotasshould be replaced by a tariff on imports of cotton textiles from the Commonwealth at 85 per cent of themost-favoured-nation rate from 1st January, 1972.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of overseas Development, to announce their decisions onthe lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.
Social ServicesImplementationof the Report ofthe Committeeon LocalAuthorityPersonal and allied Services(previous reference:CC(68) 36thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET 7CC 33(69)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services about the implementation of recommendations of the Committee on Local Authority personal and Allied Services (C (69) 81).The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the centralrecommendation of the Committee on Local Authority Personal and allied Services (the Seebohm Committee) was thai a unified social work service should be provided at local level by amalgamating thelocal authority children&apos;s and welfare services and certain other local authority social work functions, by providing that a statutorycommittee should be responsible for these services and should be served by a principal officer whose appointment should initially besubject to Ministerial approval. The Seebohm Committee had recommended that these organisational changes should be madeobligatory on all responsible authorities without waiting for localgovernment reorganisation. The Government had made it clearthat they would not reach decisions on the report until they had examined it, with the administrative reorganisation of the health services, in the light of the recommendations in the report of theRoyal Commission on Local Government in England (the redcliffe-Maud Report). The Ministerial Committee on social services had considered all these matters in close association withthe Ministerial Committee on Local Government Reorganisation,and proposed that the Government should announce now their agreement with the Seebohm Committee&apos;s central recommendation;should discuss with local authority and other interests how best togive effect to it against the background of the Redcliffe-MaudReport; and should announce in the autumn their decisions on theSeebohm proposals and the related issue of the future role of thelocal authorities in the health field. He proposed, if the cabinet agreed, to make an early statement in the House of Commons onthe terms of the draft annexed to C (69) 81. The statementcommitted the Government to the acceptance of a single localauthority social services department, and to the intention of makinga start with the implementation of the Seebohm report by introducingearly legislation ahead of the main local government reorganisation.There was no need to take a decision on the method of implementing the Seebohm report until consultations with localauthorities had been completed in the autumn; and the social services Committee were at present divided as between a comprehensive solution which would oblige all local authorities to implement the main recommendation, and a selective scheme whichwould enable the reorganisation of the local authority social services to be linked with the progress of local government reorganisationin consequence of the Redcliffe-Maud Report.
In discussion it was pointed out that the Government faced the likelihood of opposition whatever decision was made in the autumn:from the medical profession, if Medical Officers of Health were excluded as such from senior posts in the local social service departments; and from social workers, if they were brought underthe control of Medical Officer of Health. But there were strong reasons in the interests of children for insisting that the local social service department should have its own professional head,notwithstanding the probable demand from local authorities to beallowed to organise their committees as they saw fit. Localauthorities were already protesting that the time allowed for theconsideration of the Redcliffe-Maud Report was inadequate; and,if they were required to undertake an obligatory reorganisation oftheir social services first, the major reorganisation of local government might be prejudiced. If prior action to implement the Seebohmreport was considered essential, the selective approach was to be preferred to the comprehensive; but it might in the circumstances be better to do nothing to implement the Seebohm recommendations in advance of the reorganisation of local government itself. Further,it would be well to avoid the apparent contradiction between thearguments deployed in support of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) (No. 2) Bill and the decision to implement the main recommendations of the Seebohm Committeenotwithstanding that a major reorganisation of local government wasimpending. This contradiction was liable to be exploited by theOpposition (notwithstanding that a distinction could be drawn between changes in boundaries and the reorganisation of the structure of local government), and to be misunderstood by the government&apos;s own supporters.In discussion of the draft statement it was agreed, that &quot; aim &quot;should be substituted for &quot; propose&quot; in the last sentence ofparagraph 2, and that the second and third sentences of the final paragraph should be omitted.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement appended to C (69) 81, asamended in discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to settle the timing of a statement in consultation with theLord President.(3) Agreed that the method of establishing integrated localsocial service departments should be considered in theautumn in the light of consultations with interested bodies.Cabinet Office, SWA,17th July, 1969.
