CabinetSecurity ofMinisterialdiscussion(previous reference:CC (68) 50thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Minister of Transport drew the attention of the Cabinetto a report in The Guardian of 24th February about Ministerialdiscussion of his Green Paper on the roads programme, in which itwas stated that certain of his colleagues had forced him to agree tothe inclusion of a particular road in the programme. The reportreferred to the Cabinet, but it clearly reflected detailed briefing onthe discussion which had taken place in the Steering Committee onEconomic Policy in the previous week.There was general agreement that briefing of this kind, which led to speculation about disunity in the Cabinet, was much to bedeplored.ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessParliament(No. 2) Bill(previous reference:CC (69) 9thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that, in the face of determined opposition from a minority of Members, the Parliament (No. 2) bill was making only slow progress in Committee. The House hadalready devoted seven days to the subject, including the debates onthe White Paper and on the Second Reading of the Bill, and thefailure of the Governments own supporters to attend late sittingsforced them to waste time that could have been saved by moving the closure had sufficient of their supporters been present to ensurethat they could carry the division. He still thought that it would bepossible to carry the Bill through provided that they were preparedto devote sufficient time to it, preferably in morning sittings; butundoubtedly the time required would exceed the estimate, and it was for consideration whether it was right to persist with the Bill.The Chief Whip said that the Government could have no certainty of being able to carry a Timetable Motion. There wouldbe less opposition to committing the Bill to a Committee upstairs,and this might avoid further expenditure of time on the floor ofthe House.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government had basedtheir plans on the assumption that the Bill would be handled as an agreed measure, but the Opposition had failed to support them;and, in the absence of the usual informal arrangements between theChief Whips on either side and of sufficient voting strength to secure a Timetable Motion, it was impossible to secure the passage of the
Bill against the determined opposition of a minority of Members.In the new situation which now obtained it would be worth considering whether the Bill could usefully be sent to a StandingCommittee, but there might be disadvantages in this solution andthey should also consider whether they should abandon the Billaltogether or persist with its discussion on the floor of the House.To withdraw the Bill in the face of determined opposition fromonly about 60 Members might have a more harmful effect on theremainder of their programme than occupying more time on the floor of the House, because it would encourage the opponents ofother Bills in their attempts to obstruct them. It was important,however, to dispel the impression shared by a number ofback-benchers on the Government side that the Government werenot united in their determination to push the Bill through. It wouldalso be important to deflect the discontent with late sittings from theGovernment to those responsible for the filibuster, for example,by making it clear that failure to support the Governmentin putting their programme through would threaten other Bills towhich Members attached importance, and that time lost on the parliament (No. 2) Bill might be made up by reducing the length ofthe Whitsun recess.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be helpful if the Home Secretary, as the Minister in chargeof the Bill in the House of Commons, would discuss with the lord president and the Chief Whip, and with other Ministers concerned,the proposal that the remainder of the Committee stage might betaken in a Standing Committee. Subject to further considerationof this arrangement, the present feeling in the Cabinet was that towithdraw the Parliament Bill would give dangerous encouragement to the opponents of major Bills in the remainder of the governments programme. They should therefore rally their supporters by making it clear that the Government intended to secure the passage of theBill. Tn particular, Ministers should impress upon their own junior ministers and on Parliamentary Private Secretaries that they mustshow a united determination to push the Bill through, and that thedelaying tactics of the opponents of the Bill endangered the other measures in the current programme. They would consider the matter further in the light of the Home Secretary&apos;s discussion of the proposal that the Bill should be sent upstairs.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the lord president and the Chief Whip, and other ministers concerned, to consider the proposal that the remainder of the Committee stage of the Parliament (No. 2) Billshould be taken in Standing Committee.
SECRETOverseaAffairsVietnam(previous reference:CC (69) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)general de Gaulle&apos;sProposals for Anglo-FrenchDiscussions:european co-operation in the WesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC (69) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in vietnam the Communists had launched a military offensive. TheNorth Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front hadconcurrently adopted a harder line at the Paris discussions. So far,the offensive had not met with much success; and the United states were unlikely to react violently to it, either in Paris by breaking offthe talks, or in Vietnam by an escalation of their military effort.The United States view was that no progress was likely until theNorth Vietnamese were ready once again to talk to them in private.Such advances as had been made up to now had been entirely as aresult of private conversations and not in consequence of anything that had been said in plenary session.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the maindevelopment since he had last reported to the Cabinet had beenthat it had become public knowledge that the talk between HMAmbassador in Paris, Mr. Christopher Soames, and the french president, General de Gaulle, on 4th February, had taken place.We had given a full account to our allies and to the Press: in doing so, we had had in mind the unfortunate precedent in 1966,when the French had given distorted and inaccurate accounts of anglo-French conversations to their partners in the european economic Community (e.c.) without informing the BritishGovernment. HM Ambassador had visited London for consultations and had returned to Paris with a message to theFrench Foreign Minister, M. Debre, to the effect that we wereprepared to enter into discussions, though we could not accept the ideas General de Gaulle had advanced on European &quot; independence &quot;of the United States, the future of the North Atlantic treaty organisation, and e.c.; and that we should have to inform our allies. The French Government had protested against our disclosure of their approach, maintaining, though without justification, that wehad distorted what General de Gaulle had said. We should bereplying orally maintaining our position and refuting the allegations of distortion. In the debate in the House of Commons on25th February, the attack on the Governmenfs handling of thematter had clearly failed; and there had been no speculation aboutthe alleged differences between the Government and HM Ambassador(2) Invited Ministers to make clear to junior Ministers in their departments and their Parliamentary Private Secretariesthe Governmenfs determination to secure this and otherBills in their programme, and the importance of active and united support.
in Paris, whose handling of the matter had in fact been whollycorrect throughout. The French now seemed anxious as we wereourselves to take the heat out of the situation. The action we hadtaken appeared to have been justified by events; and much of thecomment in other countries seemed to bear this out.In the circumstances, it was all the more important to enhancethe importance of the Western European Union (WEU) and makeit into the forum of European consultation which it had originally been intended to be. It was essential for so long as we were excluded from the e.c. that that body should not be the sole focusof European co-operation. After some initial hesitation, theFederal German Government had agreed to our proposal for ameeting of Permanent Representatives to the WEU. The fact thatall members of the WEU except France had attended this meeting was of major significance, and the consultations thus initiated would continue. Besides discussing the Middle East, the meeting had dealtwith the question of Greece, with particular reference to theresolution of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of europe on Greek membership of that body. The general view had beenthat it would be best to await the report of the Commission on human Rights. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would shortly be seeing HM Ambassador in Athens and would also discussthe problem with the Greek Foreign Minister, Mr. Pipinelis, at the spring meeting of the North Atlantic Council. The next topic fordiscussion by the Permanent Representatives to the WEU wouldbe Nigeria. This discussion also would be useful to us. While itwould be unprofitable to speculate about French motives, the 1966episode to which he had referred had to be borne in mind. Hadan inaccurate version of the General&apos;s discussion with Mr. Soamesbeen first in the field and remained unchallenged, the consequences to our relations with our European allies might have been serious.If, as the General had asked, we had agreed to keep the talks withthe French secret until they had actually begun, our allies wouldhave accused us of bad faith, this quite apart from the explosivenature of the French proposals themselves, which were calculated to arouse acute concern in both their economic and their military aspects. In all the circumstances, and given in particular the extremely delicate situation in which the timing of the General&apos;approach had put the Prime Minister in regard to his talks withthe German Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, there was no practical alternative to the course which had been adopted.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Itwas suggested that we might have informed our European free trade Area partners as well as our fellow-members of WEU. Itwas pointed out, however, that the former were not in all casesour military allies and were thus less closely concerned. The point
Visit of thePresident ofthe UnitedStateswas made that the General had not insisted, as a precondition fortalks, on British acceptance of his ideas on the future developmentof the Western Alliance and the e.c.; and we had made it clearthat we could not agree to them. This was largely because wejudged that they would be, as totally unacceptable to our european allies as they were to ourselves. On the other hand, if when our allies had been fully informed of the proposals they were to thinkthem worth consideration, that would be a different matter. as things now stood, there was little chance that the French proposalfor Anglo-French talks would be revived: but in time the episodewould blow over. In the long run, it might have done less harm to Anglo-French relations than might at present be thought to be thecase. General de Gaulle tended to respect those who stood up tohim and despise those who did not.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Prime Minister said that the visit of the President of theUnited States, Mr. Nixon, had gone very well. The President had made an excellent start by emphasising the desirability of muchcloser personal consultation at all levels between the United Statesand the United Kingdom Governments than had been the caseunder the previous United States Administration. President Nixonwas evidently anxious that he and the Prime Minister should keepin touch by means of fairly frequent informal meetings. He alsoevidently hoped that there would be consultation between british ministers and their United States counterparts, and that these consultations would extend beyond the sphere of international relations and into that of domestic problems of common concern.The President also clearly envisaged increased contacts at theadministrative and official level. .On the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and east/West relations generally, the views of the new Administrationwere in close accord with our own. The President desired tostrengthen NATO and accepted the concept of a European identitywithin the Alliance. He had emphasised, and had also made thispoint in public, that the purpose of building up the strength of nato was to create conditions in which a detente would be possible,and had intimated that the ideas of the United States Administrationwere moving in the direction of bilateral discussions with the soviet union on arms limitation. The President was obviously concerned at the prospect of further nuclear proliferation.
In discussion of Middle Eastern affairs, it had become apparent that the two Governments were in full agreement on how thesituation should be handled.The discussion on monetary affairs had been a brief one, andwould be followed up bilaterally. The President had fully sharedour misgivings about a full-scale international conference on thesubject.In general, the Prime Minister had been agreeably impressed by the President^ pragmatic attitude and his evident desire for closer consultation with Britain and his other allies. It seemed unlikely that the new Administration would take any embarrassinginitiatives like the Multilateral Nuclear Force; and it looked as though the new President would be well served by his advisers andwould not allow himself to be insulated from realities. The newUnited States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, did not have muchbackground knowledge of foreign affairs; but he was agreeableand friendly. It seemed likely that the main impetus in the field ofinternational relations would come from Mr. Kissinger and his staff in the White House. For his part, the President had been much impressed by the presentations made by British Ministers inthe formal meeting on the morning of 25th February, by the quality of the contributions made by members of the Cabinet to the informal discussion in the evening, and by the markedly friendly and intimateatmosphere in which the talks had been conducted.The only unsatisfactory feature of the visit had been itstreatment by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Thefact that the Corporation has subsequently volunteered a publicapology for the manner in which they had treated certain aspectsof the occasion was sufficient to disprove any allegation that theGovernment had sought to control or iniluence their presentation of the event. But their comments on the arrangements made for thePresident to meet the Leader of the Opposition and other politicalspokesmen had been the more unfortunate in that those arrangements in fact represented a considerably more generous attitude on thepart of the Government than that adopted by the thenAdministration, now the Opposition, in connection with previousPresidential visits. As a result Press comment had tended to concentrate on the alleged dispute between the Government andthe BBC at the expense of adequate coverage of what had been an extremely successful visit.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.
IndustrialAffairsWageNegotiation inthe motor industry(previous reference:CC (69) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that, as she had forecast tothe Cabinet on 20th February, the Amalgamated Union of engineering and Foundry Workers (AEF) and the Transport and general works&apos; Union (T &amp; GWU) had now declared an official strike atthe Ford Motor Company&apos;s plants. The company were accordinglyseeking an injunction against the unions to desist from acting in breach of the agreement which they had negotiated with thecompany. Fords had done this entirely on their own initiative, thusconfirming that under existing law it was open to any company to seek legal enforcement of contracts entered into by its employees.The agreement, which had been negotiated over a period of nearly three months, provided for an average increase in pay of8 per cent and significant improvements in fringe benefits. Tt wouldprotect the men against automatic lay-offs arising from interruptionsin the supply of components; and would give the company, inreturn, some protection against unofficial strikes. The company&apos;sproposals had been generally welcomed by the trade unionnegotiators, who had not at any stage raised any objection to theprinciple of applying financial penalties to those involved inunofficial strike action. The trade union side of the company&apos;national joint negotiating committee had twice approved theproposals by a small majority but on each occasion the leadership of the AEF and the T&amp;GWU had refused to accept the majorityview. Apart from telling the company, after consultation with theTreasury, that the agreement was acceptable under the governments incomes policy (subject to a review after six months) she had not so far intervened in the dispute. It would now be necessary todetermine the Governments attitude to it. In her view Fords had made a determined effort to achieve a breakthrough in theirindustrial relations and the opposition to the agreement appearedto be based on the realisation that, if put into effect, it wouldseverely reduce the power of the shop stewards. The economic costof a prolonged strike would be substantial but the long-termconsequences of encouraging the company to give way to themilitants&apos; demands could well be much more damaging.In discussion it was recognised that firm decisions could not betaken until the result of the company&apos;s application for an injunctionwas known. So long as the matter was sub judice a government statement on the merits of the case would be inappropriate, thoughconsideration would need to be given at a later stage to the best wayof bringing the issues at stake home to the men on the shop floor.The effect on exports of a prolonged strike could not be ignored butthere were powerful arguments against giving way to politically
motivated pressure from militant trade union leaders. The worstpossible course would be to stand firm initially and then give way.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be necessary to await the outcome of the company&apos;application for an injunction. In the meantime an estimate shouldbe prepared of the possible effects of a prolonged strike on thenext few months&apos; trade figures. The Parliamentary Committeewould keep the situation under review.Inter-UnionDispute withinthe BritishSteelCorporation(previous reference:CC (69) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theParliamentary Committee to keep the situation underreview.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange foran estimate to be prepared, for consideration by theParliamentary Committee, of the effect of a prolongedstrike on the next few months&apos; trade figures.The Cabinet were informed that the British Steel corporation would announce their decision on union recognition in the steelindustry later that day. It would be important to make it clear thatthe Government backed the Corporation^ decision, while avoiding the twin dangers of, on the one hand, appearing to pass judgment on the merits of the decision, and, on the other, encouraging theunions to believe that further pressure would lead to its beingmodified.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the situation.EconomicSituationBank RateCONFIDENTIAL5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatBank Rate would be increased that day from 7 per cent to 8 per cent.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Space PolicyBLACKARROW(previous reference:CC (68) 18thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (69) 20) setting out the main arguments for and againstcontinuance of the national programme of space technology, knownas BLACK ARROW.
The Lord President said that the case for continuing the black arrow programme rested on two main considerations: firstly, ithat it offered the means of maintaining a centre of expertise onspace technology which would be of value to other GovernmentDepartments and to industry, and also in protecting our investment in international organisations; and secondly, that investment in sucha space programme, at a rate of about  3 million in 1969-70 rising to  5 million in 1973-74, would in the long run be justified by economic returns, although these could not at present be quantified.The Ministerial Committee on Science and Technology, with theexception of the Minister of State, Treasury, had been in favour of continuing the programme. The Minister of State, Treasury, was opposed on the grounds that the economic returns from the projectwere highly uncertain and the programme could not be shown tosatisfy the criteria now being applied to new projects.The Minister of Technology said that the BLACK arrow programme as now put forward was a minimum programme whichwould have to stand or fall as a whole. The Ministerial Committeeon Science and Technology had shared his view that the arguments in favour of completing and using the British launcher outweighedthose for switching to a United States launcher. By 1970 therewould be about 75 civil satellites in orbit, communicating with about70 ground stations scattered throughout the world. The black arrow national programme should enable the United Kingdomaerospace industry to retain a share of this rapidly growing market.Our expenditure on national space programmes was small by comparison with the corresponding expenditure of some otherindustrialised countries of medium size; and since he hadincorporated the BLACK ARROW programme into the Category Iexpenditure of his Department, no additional funds would berequired. Finally, a minor point in favour of BLACK ARROW, but one which should not be overlooked, was the political advantageof having ourselves launched an all-British satellite from Woomerain 1970.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that there was no clear-cuteconomic case to indicate whether BLACK ARROW should be supported or abandoned. On the other hand, there was nothing toshow for the expenditure on the programme so far, and it was without question a highly speculative venture. There was no evidence tosuggest that the United Kingdom aerospace industry was dependenton the programme to maintain its competitive position and securefurther international contracts for space equipment in the future.Experience showed that pioneers in new fields of technology oftenlost money, the profits being made by those who stepped in at a
later stage and operated under licensing arrangements. As to thepublic expenditure position, the continuation of BLACK ARROWwould not prejudice other departmental programmes in theimmediate future; but cancellation of the programme would increasethe general contingency allowance. For all these reasons he took the view that the programme should be discontinued.In discussion it was argued that the BLACK arrow programme represented our last foothold in space technology, whichwas a new field that we would be unwise to abandon. Support for new technological projects was often an act of faith, and it wouldbe a mistake to adopt a negative attitude in all such cases becauseof our present economic position. If we opted out of space technology now it was unlikely that the United States would laterbe willing to grant licences to us as potential competitors. It wouldbe helpful if the BLACK ARROW programme could be subject toa more detailed and rigorous economic assessment. Techniques forthis purpose had been devised in recent years, and if necessary wecould seek advice from the United States on how these could beapplied to BLACK ARROW. In 1965, the Space review committee, under the chairmanship of Professor H. Bondi, had given qualified support to the BLACK ARROW programme. Theyhad assessed the economic prospects in different fields of space technology and had concluded that these were most favourable forground stations, less so for satellites and non-existent for largelaunchers. It was consonant with these conclusions that we shouldhave withdrawn support for ELDO but should be willing to continue with the BLACK ARROW programme of space technology.Against this, it could be maintained that, although there was nooverwhelming case for cancelling the BLACK ARROW programme,the resources involved could be deployed to better effect in other fields.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were agreed that the BLACK arrow programme should be continued for a further period of 12 months,during which time it should be subject to a more detailed andrigorous economic assessment. The Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth Affairs should be consulted before any announcement were made about the continuation of the programme in order that our relations with the European space organisationsmight not be prejudiced.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the continuation of the BLACK arrow programme in 1969-70, as set out in paragraph 21 ofthe Appendix to the memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (69) 20).
CC 10 (69)(2) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, to arrange fora detailed economic assessment of the programme on thelines indicated in the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,28th February, 1969.
