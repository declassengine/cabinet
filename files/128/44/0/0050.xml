SubjectCommercial Policy
SECRETCommercial *The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had beenPolicy considering the future of the import deposits scheme and the travel allowance for the period beginning 1st November, 1969. Heestimated that if the import deposits scheme were allowed to lapseon 4th December, 1969, imports in 1970 would be  100 million higher than if it were extended on the present basis for another12 months; and that half this increase would occur in the first quarter of the year. There would in addition be a loss of about 25 million per month to the reserves. This would in his viewinvolve an unacceptable risk to the balance of payments and he had concluded that the scheme should be extended for another year.He recognised that this would provoke strong criticism from theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) and accordingly proposed-that the rate should be reduced to 40 per cent. This would have only a very small effect on imports and would represent a useful first step towards.the eventual phasing out of the scheme at the end of1970.Although he would like to remove the present restrictions onforeign travel as soon as possible it would not be consistent to announce this and the continuation of the import deposits schemesimultaneously. He proposed that there should be no change inthe travel allowance for the time being; but that he should makeit clear that he would keep the matter under continuous review witha view to relaxing the restrictions as soon as there were firmindications of a securely-based improvement in the balance ofpayments. He was satisfied that when the time came to relax therestrictions the right course would be to return to the earlierarrangement under which travellers could take out  250 on everyvisit. It would be pointless simply to increase the annual allowance to  75 or  100 as this would lead to the.loss of virtually all thepresent saving in foreign exchange, which was estimated to be between  15 million and  25 million a year. He recognised that adecision to leave the allowance unchanged, which he wished to announce together with the decision on the future of the importdeposits scheme later in the day, would cause disappointment: butthe over-riding consideration at the present time was the need toavoid giving any impression of premature relaxation until theimprovement in the balance of payments was demonstrably secure.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposalto leave the travel allowance unchanged for the time being. Whilerestrictions on foreign travel were open to objection in principle
and their impact on different sections of the community was uneventhey produced worth-while savings in foreign exchange andstimulated the development of cheap package tours.There was also general agreement that the import depositsscheme should continue, though different views were expressed aboutthe rate. On the one hand it was pointed out that the continuation of the scheme would be strongly criticised at the forthcoming EFTAconference where we should in any case be in difficulty over othermatters. Although there was no firm commitment on our part,EFTA Governments had been led to believe that the scheme would end this year and this was reflected in the resolution which the EFTACouncil had passed when it was introduced. There was a good casetherefore for reducing the rate to 33^ per cent as an earnest of our intention to dismantle the scheme as soon as possible.On the other hand it was argued that to reduce the rate at allwould be psychologically damaging. The Governmenfs supporters would not understand why priority should be given to easing controlover imports at a time when they were being asked to supportcontinued control over wages and the development of policy in manyfields was hampered by the balance of payments constraint. It was essential that on this occasion there should be no prematurerelaxation; and the right course was to maintain the scheme, withthe rate unchanged, until it was clear beyond doubt that our balanceof payments problem was solved. Our trading partners who were inany case not slow to pursue their own national advantage would recognise, even if they did not admit it publicly, that this was intheir interest as well as ours.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas. general agreement on the need to leave the travel allowanceunchanged for the time being and to continue the import depositsscheme for another year. While arguments had been advanced insupport of both a higher and a lower rate of deposit than theChancellor of the Exchequer had proposed, the general view of theCabinet was that, taking considerations of domestic and internationalpolicy together, 40 per cent was the most appropriate figure. TheChancellor of the Exchequer would announce the Governmenfsdecisions accordingly later in the day. Beyond this, it was important that strict security should be maintained about the points raised intheir discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st October, 1969.
