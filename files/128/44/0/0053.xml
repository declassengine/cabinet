ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessLabourtroubles atHMSO(previous reference:CC (69) 51stConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord Privy Seal said that Her rvTajesty&apos;s Stationery Office(HMSO) were unable to print the London Gazette because of labour difficulties; and that he had been asked to approve an approach tothe Civil Service Unions for their agreement to reproducing it onthe Board of Trade&apos;s photocopying press. Although failure to publish the Gazette would cause considerable inconvenience, he had been unwilling to agree to the proposed approach which might well leadto serious trouble with the printing unions.In discussion it was suggested that the situation at HMSO,though still far from satisfactory, seemed to be improving slowly.Delays in both the printing and distribution of papers were likelyto continue; but it would be better to put up with the inconveniencethan to risk prejudicing the outcome of the national wage negotiations with were now going on in the printing industry.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that it would be undesirable to approach theCivil Service Unions about the reproduction of the London Gazettein the manner proposed if this could be avoided. If, however, further examination showed that the Government had a statutory obligationto ensure its publication or that failure to publish it would involve an unacceptable degree of inconvenience, for example in relation tolegal processes, the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Attorney-General, should make thenecessary arrangements, keeping the Lord President informed.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and the Attorney-General, to takethe steps necessary to maintain publication of the LondonGazette if on further examination this proved essential.White Papers The Prime Minister said that after a full examination of theAv&quot;^1    d ProPosa^s Dy me President of the Board of Trade, the Ministerialthe Prison Steering Committee on Economic Policy had approved the terms ofService the draft White Paper on Civil Aviation Policy attached to C (69) 149.10652CONFIDENTIALa 2
Relationsbetween theGovernmentand theLabour PartyThe Home Affairs Committee had similarly considered and approved the terms of the draft White Paper by the Home Secretary entitled&quot; People in Prison &quot; attached to C (69) 151.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange, in consultation withthe Lord President and the Minister without Portfolio,for the publication of the draft White Paper on the workof the prison service attached to C (69) 151.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange, inconsultation with the Lord President and minister without Portfolio, for the publication of the draft white paper on Civil Aviation Policy attached to C (69) 149.The Cabinet had a general discussion of the most appropriate means of fortifying the relations between the Government and their supporters in Parliament and in the country. The following main points were made:(a) Ministers should take pains to keep in touch with the policyGroups of the Parliamentary Labour Party in connection with the formulation and announcement of Departmental policies. Inappropriate cases the Chairmen of the Groups should be allowed tosee the text of Parliamentary statements before they were made,provided that this was arranged on a confidential basis, preferablyby a junior Minister of the Department concerned, not more than an hour or so before the statement was made.(b) Ministers should enlist the co-operation of the governments supporters in Parliament when it was decided that a statement ofpolicy or some other important announcement should be made bymeans of an arranged Parliamentary Question. If such anannouncement affected the interests of a particular constituency or groups of constituencies, special consideration should be given, as appropriate, to the Members concerned.(c) Ministers should also seek to secure, by advice andexplanation, the support of backbenchers in dealing with the government&apos;s Bills in Committee upstairs, particularly as regards thetabling and management of amendments, etc.(d) When Ministers paid visits to constituencies they should try to make time to establish contact with the local Labour Partyorganisation and its supporters provided that, if the visit in question was an official occasion and the cost was met from public funds,party business was seen to be only incidental to the main purpose ofthe Minister^ presence and that such facilities as transport,entertainment, etc., were provided by the party organisation.(e) Labour Party Councillors who constituted minority groupson local authority bodies could not claim the same right of hearingby a Minister as the majority groups.  Nevertheless, their interests
oversea affairs vietnam (previous reference:CC (69) 23rdConclusion,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in his speech on 3rd November, the President of the United States,Mr. Nixon, had suggested either a progressive withdrawal from south Vietnam of both United States and North Vietnamese troopsor, as an alternative if, as seemed likely, this could not be achieved,a progressive withdrawal of United States troops as and when it became possible for the South Vietnamese Army to take their place.The President had firmly rejected the idea of a precipitate andunilateral United States withdrawal from South Vietnam, whichwould have very grave consequences; and it now appeared to becommon ground that the objective in Vietnam should be not militaryvictory for either side, but a negotiated political settlement. the presidents speech had been a genuine and serious contribution towards the achievement of this aim; but there would have to be some response from the other side.In discussion there was general agreement with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary&apos;s assessment of President Nixon&apos;s speech.The talks in Paris between representatives of the United States andSouth Vietnamese Governments on the one hand and representativesof the North Vietnamese and the National Liberation Front on theother, together with President Johnson&apos;s decision not to stand forre-election,   had   to   some   extent   reduced   the   temperature.should not be overlooked; and further consideration should be givento the best means of ensuring that, if they wished to make representations on specific issues, they could be received in circumstances to which no objection could be taken on grounds ofpropriety e.g. in a Ministers room at the House of Commons, wherethe Minister could be supported, if necessary, by his ParliamentaryPrivate Secretary.The Cabinet (5) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the best means of ensuring that relationsbetween the Government and their supporters inParliament and in the country were fortified on the lines which had emerged during their discussion.(6) Invited the Chief Whip, in consultation with theDepartmental Ministers most likely to be concerned, togive further consideration to the most appropriate meansof ensuring adequate liaison between the Government andminority groups of Labour Party Councillors in localauthority bodies.
Nevertheless, Vietnam remained an issue on which feelings in thiscountry ran high, especially among the younger voters. It was clearly not possible for a responsible Government to avoid all comment orto refuse to respond to requests from the Press and other informationmedia for expressions of official views. In the very difficult situation with which the United States was confronted, it would be important to avoid saying anything which might be offensive to United Statesnational pride. However, it would be politically inadvisable for ministers or official spokesmen to go much beyond expressions of sympathy for the United States&apos; present predicament.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that high hopeshad been raised by the Biafran announcement through the MarkpressAgency that the rebel leadership would no longer insist on thecomplete secession of Biafra as a condition of a peace settlement;but the rebel leader, Colonel Ojukwu, had subsequently repudiatedthe statement and had reverted to his previous position. The fact thatthe statement had been made, however, perhaps indicated a divisionof opinion in the Biafran leadership: and this would have to be investigated further. The rebel air forces had carried out attacks onthe Shell/British Petroleum oil installations at Forcados which were likely to affect oil supplies. We had supplied the Federal military government (FMG) with anti-aircraft weapons, but the FMG were having difficulty in finding personnel to operate them effectively.There had been no overall increase in arms supplies to the FMG,which were being kept within the limits laid down. The international committee of the Red Cross were keeping up pressure on colonel ojukwu to allow daylight relief flights, but so far without success.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the meetingof the Warsaw Pact Powers recently held at Prague had ended witha declaration advocating the calling of a conference on european security to be held at Helsinki. The declaration had been unhelpfulfrom a Western point of view, since it had not mentioned the questionof participation by the United States nor had it taken up the offer by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) for forcereductions. The declaration had instead reaffirmed the Brezhnevdoctrine of intervention to preserve &quot; Socialism &quot;; and it had been
couched in terms which implied the recognition by the western powers of the German Democratic Republic. Nevertheless, it wouldbe desirable to discuss in the forthcoming Ministerial Meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council and in the preliminary meeting which wasabout to be attended by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterhow far we could go to meet the Warsaw Pact Powers, not necessarilyon their request for a European security conference, but on measuresto reduce tension in general. It was useful that he would shortly bemeeting the new German Foreign Minister, Herr Scheel.In discussion it was suggested that in the light of the knownviews on the subject of the German Chancellor, Herr Brandt, theinclusion of the German Democratic Republic in any securityconference was not likely to prove a major stumbling-block. Theinclusion of the United States, on which we should have to insist,might cause more difficulty. In general it seemed likely that it wouldbe easier to make progress on force reductions than to secure agreement between East and West on the future of Germany. Itwould be important to achieve an agreed posture in NATO on forcereductions.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was difficult to predict the future course of events with any certainty. the six member States of the European Economic Community (e.c.)would have to decide on what basis negotiations should be opened;and it was unlikely that they would be able to do so until they had made a good deal more progress on their internal problems: and inparticular on the Common Agricultural Policy. It was possible thata date might be fixed for the opening of negotiations with the UnitedKingdom at their forthcoming summit meeting: but it seemed unlikely.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Our own preparations for negotiations were far from complete; and the assumptions on which our calculations were basedwould be affected by decisions yet to be taken by the Six, particularlyin the field of agriculture. These were unlikely to be forthcomingfor weeks, or even months.(b) The Six were clearly in considerable difficulty over their agricultural policy: but for us to attempt to offer them advice or
assistance from outside the Community might be counter-productive.A time might come when we could usefully intervene; but it had not come yet.(c) At the Labour Party Conference at Brighton in October, ithad been made clear that Party and Government policy was to enter the e.c. on reasonable conditions, and that we were trying in good faith to do so. Our conditions could not be laid down in advance;and there would have to be full discussion in Cabinet and inParliament when the point was reached at which negotiations mightbegin.(d) It would be useful if Ministers not only those withDepartmental responsibilities for oversea affairs could make a pointof defending and explaining Government policy in regard to the eec when making public pronouncements.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.New defence force forNorthernIreland(previous reference:CC (69) 46thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C (69) 150) embodying proposals for setting upa new Defence Force in Northern Ireland to undertake the militarytasks at present performed by the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC).The Secretary of State for Defence said that the creation of thenew force presented an extremely delicate problem. The HuntReport (Cmnd. 535) had recommended that the USC should besuperseded; this step was necessary to retain the confidence of the roman Catholic community in Northern Ireland. The new force was needed to counter the threat from the Irish Republican Army,for which purpose an unacceptably large garrison would otherwise be needed. The constitution of the new force must also be acceptable to the Protestants, in order to encourage existing members of theUSC to transfer to it and to minimise the danger that others might,when the USC was disbanded, form a clandestine organisation, taking their arms with them. His proposals were designed to satisfy genuineProtestant needs and aspirations while assuring the Catholics, throughthe provisions which ensured that the force was firmly under thecontrol of the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland, thatthe break with the USC tradition was complete. The Defence and oversea Policy Committee had discussed the proposed White paper on 31st October and had given directions on the line to be taken in
10652Bdiscussing the text of the White Paper with the Northern ireland government. The agreed draft had accordingly been released to theNorthern Ireland Government and discussed with them on 3rd and 5th November. Because of the urgency of proceeding withthe legislation, it had been necessary to adopt a timetable which did not permit the circulation to the Cabinet of a draft setting outall the points still at issue; he would therefore report orally on further proposals which had emerged from discussions in London withMr. Porter, the Northern Ireland Minister of Home Affairs, on 5th November. It would be necessary to submit a draft Bill to theLegislation Committee on 11th November and to publish the white paper on 12th November if the Parliamentary timetable provisionallyaccepted by the Lord President was to be met..The Cabinet then discussed, paragraph by paragraph, the draft white Paper forming Annex B of the Defence Secretary&apos;s paper.The following points were made and amendments agreed:Paragraph  it was explained that the Northern Ireland Government wished the word &quot; Ulster &quot; to appear in the force&apos;s title. On the other hand,in favour of adhering to the title which was used in the draft white paper, it was argued that the word &quot; Ulster &quot; was geographicallyincorrect in that Northern Ireland comprised only six of the ninecounties of the traditional Province of Ulster; and that it carriedassociations which might arouse Roman Catholic hostility to thenew force. Against this it was pointed out that the Police Force was known as the Royal Ulster Constabulary and that the NorthernIreland Government would attach importance to the concession,which was one of form and not of substance. After further discussion,it was agreed that the force should be entitled &quot; The Ulster DefenceRegiment &quot; and the White Paper amended accordingly.Paragraph 5The Northern Ireland Government wished to delete the word&quot; armed &quot; from the first sentence. The Cabinet however rejected the implication that the force might be used against unarmed threatsto security, which were the business of the police; and decided tomake no change in this paragraph.Paragraph 6The Northern Ireland Government had asked for the removal oftwo of the phrases qualifying the statement that the force&apos;s ceilingwould be 6,000 officers and men, i.e., &quot; as the build-up proceeds&quot;and &quot; in any case &quot;.
The Home Secretary said that he had considerable misgivingsabout mentioning a figure of 6,000, which compared with the figureof 4,000 mentioned in the Hunt Report. The higher figure was unlikely to be achieved unless large numbers of the USC joined thenew force and the Catholics might therefore regard it as authorising the perpetuation of the USC. If a figure of 6,000 was to be quoted,the qualifications included in the existing draft, which had been authorised by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee, were essential.The Cabinet agreed that this paragraph should remain unchanged.Paragraph 7This paragraph was agreed subject to a clarification of thebeginning of the third sentence, which should read: &quot; The immediateCommander of the force will be . . . &quot;.Paragraph 8The Cabinet accepted the revised form of words proposed inparagraph 5 (d) of C (69) 150, subject to the following changes to thesub-paragraphs:(i) Delete the first word and substitute: &quot; So long as is necessary and expedient in . . . &quot;.(ii) and (iii) Insert at the beginning of each sub-paragraph: &quot; Forwhole-time service . . .&quot;.These changes aligned the wording of the White Paper with that ofthe draft Bill.Paragraph 10It was agreed that, from the second sentence onwards, the paragraph should be amended to read:&quot; To this end enlistment will be open to all male citizens of theUnited Kingdom of good character normally resident in NorthernIreland, whatever their denomination. All applications will beconsidered centrally by Headquarters, Northern Ireland, which willbe the final authority for acceptance of recruits after strict securityvetting. Like all entrants to the Armed Forces, recruits will berequired to take the oath of allegiance to Her Majesty The Queen.&quot;Paragraph 14The Northern Ireland Government wanted the words &quot;incertain circumstances&quot; to be deleted; but it was agreed that the wording of the paper should remain unchanged.
Paragraph 15The Northern Ireland Government favoured a much lessrigorous training liability than the Ministry of Defence regarded as necessary. Their desire sprang in part from genuine anxiety aboutthe difficulties this would create for farmers in country distrfcts; butthey also wished to preserve a force which would resemble the USCas nearly as possible. The proposed Bill, however, provided thatthe training liability could be relaxed by regulation: and thedifficulties foreseen by the Northern Ireland Government could thus be met, if they proved to be real.In discussion, it was agreed that the first sentence of paragraph 15of Annex B should stand; the second sentence should be amended as proposed in paragraph 5 (e) of C (69) 150, but should continue:&quot;... man concerned; and in exceptional circumstances the requirement for a substantial consecutive period may be varied &quot;;the third sentence should be deleted; and the fourth sentence should stand.Paragraph 18The dates of 1st January and 1st April, 1970, were accepted;but it was noted that a firm date for the disbandment of the USCcould not at this stage be decided.The remaining paragraphs in the draft White Paper were agreed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theWhite Paper should be printed in the form in which the Cabinet had now approved it. Suitable arrangements should be made for a Pressbriefing both here and in Northern Ireland and possibly for an explanatory statement in Parliament on the day of publication of theWhite Paper. The possibility of bringing forward the date ofdisbandment of the USC should be further considered by the HomeSecretary and the Defence Secretary. The Cabinet would wish to note that the financial point raised in paragraph 17 of Annex A tothe paper had been dealt with during the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee&apos;s discussions.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Defence Secretary, in consultation as necessary with the Home Secretary and the Lord President of theCouncil, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th November, 1969.
