MinisterialVisitsOverseasCONFIDENTIAL1. The Prime Minister said that Ministerial travel abroad,particularly by junior Ministers, had been tending to increase. Thiswas to be deprecated, particularly at a time when foreign travel by private individuals was still limited by currency restrictions; and ministers should therefore scrutinise all proposals for overseas visitsmore closely in future. The test should be whether the visit was really required by the public interest, with particular reference totrade promotion; and visits for purely general purposes should be discouraged.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.CONFIDENTIALOversea 2.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the affairs new Revolutionary Council in Libya (RCC) seemed to be nowLibya definitely in control of the situation. Recognition had been accordedPrevious by a number of countries, including the United States and France as reference: well as ourselves. The RCC was a military body which hadCC(69) nominated a generally civilian cabinet but it was not yet clear which42nd would be the controlling force. The Prime Minister from his recordConclusions,    appeared to be strongly anti-Western but the Foreign MinisterMinute l       rather less so.   Our new ambassador was expected to leave forTripoli shortly.   The Libyan Government had not so far raised with us any questions concerning the Anglo-Libyan  defence agreement.Middle East The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePrevious situation in the Middle East was characterised by increasing violence.Reference: We had issued a statement in terms similar to those we had used in C.C(69) respect of Arab actions of the same kind, deploring the Israeli attack39th on the Red Sea coast of Egypt.   It would be important, in theConclusions, discussions which he would have later this month in New YorkMinute 2       with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rogers, and theFrench Foreign Minister, M. Maurice Schumann, to press for there-activation of the Four Power talks.Nigeria The Foreign  and  Commonwealth  Secretary said that  anPrevious agreement had now been reached, though not yet signed, betweenReference: the International Committee of the Red Cross and the NigerianCC(69) Federal Military Government (FMG) which would allow relief39th aircraft for Biafra to take off from points outside Nigeria.   this conclusions,    was subject to the right of the FMG to require random inspectionsMinute 2       on Nigerian airfields.   There were good hopes that the agreement would be brought into force, though the possibility still existed thatthe Biafran leader, Colonel Ojukwu, might make difficulties.As regards the conference of the Organisation of African Unitywhich had just taken place in Addis Ababa, some optimism hadbeen expressed, but it was not clear that this was altogether justified.However, a resolution had been passed which confirmed the principleof a united Nigeria (which would commend itself to the FMG)while urging a cessation of hostilities (which would commend itself
northern ireland previous reference:CC (69)42ndConclusions,Minute 2to the Biafrans): this might lead on to negotiations. It wasencouraging that President Nyerere of Tanzania had sought to play a helpful role since he might be expected to have considerable influence with Colonel Ojukwu.There was no doubt about the correctness of reports that furtherSwedish aircraft had arrived in Biafra and this would certainlyencourage Colonel Ojukwu. The Swedish Government were anxious to prevent the introduction of these arms but found themselves without legal powers to prevent it.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theGovernment of the Irish Republic were seeking to bring the situationin Northern Ireland before the General Assembly of the united nations. He was in consultation with the Home Secretary andthe United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the united nations, Lord Caradon, but subject to this, he considered that our policy should be to resist the inscription of this item on the agendaalthough we might not be able to muster enough votes to prevent it.Had the Security Council agreed to the earlier Irish attempt to havethe matter discussed there, we should have been bound to use ourveto.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.northern ireland previous reference:CC (69)42ndConclusions,Minute 2EconomicSituationBalance ofPaymentsCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet discussed the situation in Northern Ireland;the conclusions reached were separately recorded and circulatedonly to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who hadto take action.The Conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file held by the Secretary of the Cabinet.confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat balance of payments figures which were being published that day would show that in the second quarter of 1969 there had beena surplus on current and capital account, on a seasonally adjustedbasis, of  100 million. The outturn for the first half of 1969 wasa surplus of  93 million on current account and  48 million on capital and current account together.In discussion it was suggested that there would be advantage in publishing the trade figures at quarterly intervals instead ofmonthly as at present. On the other hand it was pointed out that allother countries published monthly trade figures and a change toquarterly publication would be damaging to sterling.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.
SocialServicesArrangementsfor PartialContractingOut of the earnings-RelatedPension SchemePreviousReference:CC(69)35thConclusions,Minute 6CONFIDENTIAL5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (C(69)116) on arrangementsfor partial contracting-out of the new earnings-related pension scheme.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the numberof occupational pension schemes had risen sharply in recent yearsand there were now some 65,000 of them. The schemes variedwidely in their provisions, their methods of financing and theefficiency with which they were run. It was undesirable-andwould not in any case be politically acceptable for the Governmentto compel those in charge of occupational schemes to wind them up when the new State scheme was introduced and it would accordingly be necessary to take them into partnership. As hadalready been announced this would involve arrangements for partialcontracting out, under which occupational schemes- could assume responsibility for providing a proportion of the benefits payable under the State scheme in return for a reduction in the employers&apos;and employees&apos; contributions. It had been agreed with the pensioninterests and other organisations concerned that there should be only one level of contracting out, but agreement had not yet beenreached on what this level should be or on the ratio between the pension abatement and the consequential reduction in contributions.It had at one time seemed likely that agreement could be reached on the basis that a pension abatement of 24 per cent after 30 years(equivalent to 0-8 per cent a year) was reasonable and that this might be offset by a reduction of 1 per cent in employers&apos; and employees&apos; contributions. Opposition to this proposal had howevergrown and it was now being very strongly resisted. It was now accepted by the Departments concerned that a pension abatementof 1 per cent a year would be appropriate. Estimates made by theGovernment Actuary in a report which would shortly be publishedindicated that a corresponding reduction of 1-25 per cent in contributions would be strictly fair and would enable a competentlyrun scheme to make a reasonable profit. The Government Actuary&apos;sreport showed, however, that a large number of middling schemes would probably lose money on this basis and might well be forcedto close down. There was therefore a strong case for increasingthe abatement in contributions to 1 - 3 per cent. The Life Officeswould like a substantially higher abatement in contributions, eventhough this carried with it a higher pension abatement, and nodoubt many employees would take the same view. He estimatedthat the highest figure to which the pension abatement could beraised without breaking the National Superannuation Fund was1-2 per cent and the corresponding reduction in contributions,using the ratio proposed by the Government Actuary, would be1 - 5 per cent. Decisions on the level and terms of abatement were now urgently needed in order to meet the timetable set for the Bill.He would be seeing the organisations concerned next week and asked for authority to conduct his discussions with them on thebasis that the ratio of 1:1- 25 for abatements in pensions and contributions respectively was economically correct but that he could
agree to 1:1-3 if the opposition to the lower ratio was very strong.He would welcome his colleagues&apos; views on whether he should propose as an alternative 1 - 2 per cent pension abatement and I - 5per cent contribution abatement.In discussion the need to maintain a balance between thosewho contracted out and those who remained in the State schemewas strongly emphasised. The ratio between the pension andcontribution abatements was more important than the absolutefigures and there were strong arguments for fixing it at 1:1-25.Objectively these figures were fair and reasonable and in the lightof the Government Actuary&apos;s report they would be open to criticism if they went beyond it. To widen the ratio to 1:1-3 would reducethe period during which the National Superannuation Fund was insurplus; to widen it still further would lead to unacceptabledifficulties for the financing of the State scheme.On the other hand it was pointed out that the proposal toabate pensions by 0 - 8 per cent and contributions by 1 per cent hadaroused fierce opposition from a wide range of interests includingthe nationalised industries and local authorities. This was equivalentto a ratio of 1:1 - 25 which would be equally strongly resisted. Ashad been shown by the debates at the recent Trades Union congress the earnings-related pension scheme was not popular and therewere serious political objections to fixing the ratio at less than 1:1-3.In further discussion it was widely argued that 1:1-3 was themost appropriate ratio. While there was some support for theproposal to offer an alternative of 1-2:1-5, the general view wasthat this would give rise to serious anomalies and would prejudice the Government^ position in the forthcoming discussions withpension interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for Social Services should try to secure the agreement of the organisations concerned to abate-ments of pensions and contributions of 1 per cent and 1 - 25 per cent respectively; but that if this proved impossible he could in subsequent discussions increase the latter figure to 1-3 per cent.It would be helpful if he would report to the Cabinet at their next meeting the initial reactions of such organisations as he had seen by then.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services (a) to be guided in his discussions with the pensioninterests and other organisations concerned by thePrime Minister^ summing up;(b) to report at their next meeting the organisations&apos;initial reactions.Cabinet Office,11 September, 1969.
