CC 14 (69)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the Select Committee appointedto investigate Sir Gerald Nabarro&apos;s claim to have evidence that the tax on motor cars was to be increased in the Budget had reported thatthey found no truth in his allegations. If the House of Commonsdebated the report, Sir Gerald Nabarro would be likely to use the debate to secure further personal publicity. It was not essential togive time for debate, but, since the allegations amounted to a charge that a Budget secret had been disclosed and reflected on the discretion of Treasury officials, the House would be expected to debate thereport, and the absence of a debate might be attributed to a divisionof opinion in the House. The debate should, however, in any case be held over until after the Easter recess, and in the meantime theLord President should consult with the Chairman of the SelectCommittee, Mr. George Strauss.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to consult the Chairman of theSelect Committee on Vehicle Excise Duty (Allegations) aboutthe timing of a debate on the Committee&apos;s Report.The Lord Privy Seal said that Lord Raglan&apos;s VoluntaryEuthanasia Bill was to be debated on Second Reading in the House ofLords that afternoon. It was possible that it would receive a SecondReading, but it was unlikely to make much further progress.The Secretary of State for Social Services reported that the ministerial Committee on Social Services had considered that a free vote should be allowed, since the Bill raised an issue of conscience.Apart from the principle, however, it was unacceptable because of thelegal and administrative difficulties arising out of the form of theBill. The Social Services Committee had agreed that the Minister ofState, Ministry of Health and Social Security (Baroness Serota), should explain the practical objections to the Bill, but should not advise the House of Lords to take a particular line of action; and ministers as well as back-benchers should be left free to vote according toconscience.The Chief Whip reported that the Committee Stage of the divorce Bill was likely to be completed that day. The question arosewhether the Government should give the Bill any further Governmenttime. If they did not do so the remaining stages of the Bill were unlikely to be completed, and it might therefore be appropriate for
SelectCommittee on overseas AidDeclaration ofInterest byMembers ofParliament andthe registration of Agents forOverseaInterests(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 5)the Government to provide time after 10 o&apos;clock and in a morningsession the following day.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Bill should be allowed, in the first instance,to follow the normal procedure, the provision ofGovernment time being considered only if the Bill wereblocked when it next came before the House forconsideration.The Prime Minister reported that the Parliamentary Committeehad agreed that the new Select Committee on Overseas Aid shouldbe given terms of reference appropriate to a &quot; Department&quot;Committee, in this case &quot; To consider the activities of the Ministry of overseas Development, and to report thereon&quot;. In order to minimise the possibility that the Select Committee would causeembarrassment to the Government by the topics they pursued, orby ill-considered visits abroad, it was proposed that a PrivyCounsellor, possibly Miss Herbison, should take the chair, and that theLord President, accompanied by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Minister of Overseas Development, should havean informal talk with the Chairman as soon as the Committee hadbeen appointed.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.The Prime Minister reported that the Parliamentary Committeehad given further consideration, as the Cabinet had requested, to thedeclaration of interests by Members of Parliament and to thedesirability of legislation to compel individuals or organisations acting for oversea interests to register. The Committee considered that the definition of the interests which the practice of the House of Commonsrequired Members to disclose, and the mode of their disclosure, shouldbe examined in the light of modern developments in publicity andpublic relations. They thought that a small Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Privileges should be set up &quot; to consider the rules and practice of the House in relation to the declaration of Members&apos;interests&quot;. They also considered that the operation of public relations agencies working for an oversea client, whether throughcontacts with Members of Parliament or through the media of masscommunication, created a problem in that Parliament and the publichad a right to know in whose interests they were approached.Legislation on the lines of the United States Foreign AgentsRegistration Act seemed however to be too heavy an instrument fordealing with the mischief seen in this country, and the best course might be to ask the proposed Sub-Committee of the Committee of
Oversea AffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC (69) 12thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary referred to thePrime Ministers impending visit to Nigeria, which he hoped wouldresult in a restatement by General Gowon of his readiness to negotiate on all points save that of secession from the Nigerian Federation;to facilitate the flow of relief into rebel areas as well as into distressed areas of Federally-occupied territory; and to give effective guarantees for the safety and well-being of the Ibos after the war.Privileges, when they had completed their consideration of Members&apos;interests, to examine the problem of agents working for foreignprincipals and in particular the desirability of legislation upon it.He had consulted the leaders of the Opposition Parties (Mr. Heathand Mr. Thorpe) informally on both these problems. They had wished to consult their colleagues, but their initial response was notunfavourable. Subject to the agreement of the Cabinet, therefore, he proposed to make a statement in the terms of the draft which had been circulated to the Cabinet (C (69) 34) recommending that the Houseof Commons should set up a Sub-Committee of the Committee of privileges to consider declarations of interest and indicating thathe would initiate discussions with the Opposition Parties on the best way of proceeding with the problem of agencies working for overseainterests.In discussion it was suggested that the pressures and inducementswhich publicity agencies brought to bear on Members of parliament were also used on lobby journalists, who might be covered by thesame investigations. It was generally agreed, however, that this wasnot a matter for the Government. The Press itself should take stepsto safeguard the integrity of journalists, and an explicit reference tothe Press in the Prime Ministers statement might arouse someantagonism. Some slight amendment to the draft statement mighthowever remove any implication that the statement was concernedmainly with Members of Parliament.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in agreement with the proposals set out in the draft statement attached to C (69) 34 and agreed that subject to minor amendments suggested in discussion he should make the statementlater in the week.The Cabinet Approved the statement circulated With C (69) 34 and took note that the Prime Minister would make a statement inthe House of Commons shortly.
The Prime Minister said that, apart from these objectives, whichderived from previous Cabinet consideration of our Nigerian policy,he hoped that his visit would serve to lower the temperature of domestic discussion on this issue.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Prime Minister.Anguilla The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in Anguilla(Previous we were faceci with a major problem of presentation. It had beenCC (69) 13th difficult to secure credence in the island and outside it for our reiteratedConclusions, statements that it was not our intention to hand Anguilla over to minute 2) control from St. Kitts. The position of Mr. Webster, the rebelleader and self-styled &quot; Chief Executive &quot; of Anguilla, was of greatimportance, and it was for consideration whether a Minister shouldbe sent to the island. He intended to send immediately to Anguillatwo senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials, a DeputyUnder-Secretary of State and the Head of the North American and caribbean Department, with a view to their advising him on thefollowing points: (i) the suitability for his post of Mr. Anthony Lee,HM Commissioner in Anguilla. Some doubts had been expressedwhether Mr. Lee had displayed sufficient firmness, and a changemight in due course be necessary, though it was important that no public indication should be given that there was any doubt ofMr. Lee&apos;s suitability for his post; (ii) the security situation, withparticular reference to when the troops could be withdrawn andcontrol handed over to the police; (iii) publicity and propaganda, andthe resources available for these purposes; (iv) development projects in the island. Meanwhile, Mr. Webster had gone to New York,where he had so far had one discussion with Lord Caradon, theUnited Kingdom Representative at the United Nations. LordCaradon had reported that Mr. Webster was taking the line thatSt. Kitts must agree to the immediate and permanent separation ofAnguilla from the Associated State; but that it was hoped that he might modify this view in the further discussions which were dueto take place.In discussion, the point was made that the information on whichthe decision to intervene in Anguilla had been taken appeared to havebeen seriously deficient on several important points. The influence and importance of &quot; Mafia &quot; elements and disreputable businessmennow seemed to have been exaggerated; and the standing ofMr. Webster and the degree of support he enjoyed greatlyunderestimated. We had underestimated the adverse reaction inother Caribbean countries to the use of armed force, even thoughthe attitude of some Caribbean leaders, e.g. the Prime Minister of
Trinidad and Tobago, Dr. Williams, was more forthcoming in privatethan in public; and our plans had been based on the erroneousassumption that there might be bloodshed and casualties. Thesituation was now very different from that we had expected whenthe operation had been launched, and we now had seriously toconsider whether we should not seek some accommodation withMr. Webster. We should have to do so sooner or later; and if wehesitated or delayed, the situation might deteriorate still further.In dealing with Mr. Webster, we should not need either tacitly orexplicitly to admit his claim to be the &quot; Chief Executive &quot; of anAnguillan State. Discussions with him could take place on the basis that he was a leading political figure, enjoying a larger measure of support than any other political personality. This would not imply that Mr. Webster was the only politician who need be taken intoaccount. The fact that he had had to intimidate his opponents wasin itself evidence that opposition to him existed. There was a measureof similarity with the position in Rhodesia, where we did not recognise Mr. Smith as Prime Minister, but negotiated with him asthe leader of the effective and dominant political organisation inthe country, the Rhodesia Front. We did not consider that thisdebarred us from contacts with other elements in Rhodesia; and similar considerations would apply in Anguilla. One basic difficulty was the anomalous nature of the &quot; Associated State &quot; of St. Kitts,Nevis and Anguilla which had been set up in 1967, though it was difficult to see what alternative solution could have been adopted atthe time. It was now clear, however, that the Associated state would have to be dismantled. This could not be done without theco-operation of the other members, and to secure this would take time. It might be useful if a representative of the other CaribbeanStates were invited to Anguilla to assess the situation on the spot.In further discussion it was agreed that the intelligence on which our action in Anguilla had been based had been inadequate, thoughit was pointed out that it was unlikely that our decision would havebeen different even had we been more fully informed. Though thereasons for the inadequacy of our intelligence would have to be investigated, the best time to do this would be when more information had been obtained from the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeofficials who were to be sent to the island. Though it was true thatno opposition had been encountered, it was arguable that this wasthanks to the overwhelming force which had been deployed. Infairness to Mr. Lee, he had had and had expressed misgivingswhich to some extent had been justified by events; but he had not taken a very consistent line: it was doubtful whether the islanderswould now accept him either as an administrator or as an intermediary
with Her Majesty&apos;s Government; and consideration would have to begiven, in the light of the officials&apos; report, to his replacement, or alternatively to the appointment of a more senior official in additionto Mr. Lee. Attempts had been made to enter into discussion withMr. Webster, but had so far failed owing to Mr. Webster&apos;s insistence on his status as a head of government and on our unconditionalacceptance of the immediate and permanent separation of Anguillafrom the Associated State. The latter point confronted us withdifficult problems politically since we had to retain the support ofMr. Bradshaw, the Premier of St. Kitts, and legally, since the formaljustification for our presence in Anguilla was the Order in Council,which referred to &quot; preserving the territorial integrity of the AssociatedState&quot;. In the situation which had now developed, it semedunlikely that the despatch of officials to Anguilla would in itself be enough to achieve our objective of starting a dialogue which might lead to a settlement, and it was generally agreed that the proposal tosend a Minister was a good one. It would be advisable to sendsomeone who had not so far been directly involved: and the mostsuitable candidate appeared to be Lord Caradon.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement that the situation with which we now had to deal was a new one, requiring a new approach. It was clear that it would be necessary to enter into discussions withMr. Webster on the basis which would have to be established fromthe outset that we regarded him not as having any official status,or as the self-appointed leader of the. Anguillans, but as the spokesman of the largest effective body of political opinion in the island. It also seemed to be generally agreed that any discussions with Mr. Webster should be conducted by a Minister, and that lord Caradon would be the most suitable choice. arrangements should accordingly be made for Lord Caradon to go to the island.He should arrive there either with, or as soon as possible after, the senior officials to be sent out from the Foreign and commonwealth office. A decision to enter into discussions with Mr. Webster wouldinvolve a change in our public position; and it would need to bemade clear that this had the full support of the Government.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing upof their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to arrangefor Lord Caradon to visit Anguilla at an appropriate time.
Ely Hospital,Cardiff:Report ofCommittee oiInquiryCC 14 (69)confidential. The Secretary of State for Social Services said that he proposed to publish in full the report of the Committee of Inquiry intoallegations of ill-treatment of patients and other irregularities at theEly Hospital, Cardiff. The Committee was set up in 1967 by the welsh Hospital Board at the request of the Minister of Health toconsider allegations by a former nursing assistant at the hospital.The Committee had found most of the allegations to be well-founded:they had criticised the standards of medical and nursing care, theadministration of the hospital and the quality of the supervision bythe Hospital Management Committee and the Welsh Hospital Board.They had recommended a system of inspection to ensure that those responsible for the administration of hospitals, particularly long-stayhospitals, were made aware of the standards which they ought to observe. He proposed to make a statement on the publication of thereport accepting the findings and recommendations, but in doing so he would point out that the report referred only to a part of onehospital, and should not be taken to reflect on other parts of ElyHospital or on other long-stay hospitals where the generality of thestaff rendered devoted service in circumstances of very great difficulty.He proposed to create, initially within his ceilings of money and manpower, a professional advisory service which would concentrate on raising the standards of long-stay hospitals; and he would review the priorities within the hospital service so as to ensure that long-stayhospitals, which were at present the most deprived section of theservice, were given a larger share of the resources available. Thequality of a hospital depended largely on the effectiveness of theChairman of the Hospital Management Committee, the HospitalSecretary and the senior medical staff, and he was asking regional hospital Boards to review the occupants of these posts and replace those who were no longer effective.In discussion it was suggested that in his statement the Secretaryof State for Social Services should make it clear that the situationcriticised in the report had existed for a number of years and shouldhot be attributed to the present Government, who had taken stepsto investigate complaints and were considering the possibility of extending the sphere of activity of the Parliamentary commissioner to include hospitals. It was noted that the situation could be improved by the appointment of younger and more radical members to hospital management Committees and by the involvement of the local community in the affairs of the hospital.As to the timing of the statement, it was pointed out that itwas desirable to make it before 1st April, when responsibility for
hospitals in Wales would be transferred to the Secretary of Statefor Wales. This indicated that the statement should be made, andthe report published, on 27th March.The Cabinet-Took note that the report of the Committee of Inquiry intoallegations concerning Ely Hospital, Cardiff, would bepublished on Thursday, 27th March, and that the Secretaryof State for Social Services would make a statement on thesame day on the lines he had indicated.AircraftIndustryConcorde(previous reference:CC (69) 13thConclusions,Minute 5)European250-SeaterAircraft(previous reference:CC (69) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Technology (C (69) 27) on the development ofthe Concorde; a memorandum by the Attorney-General (C (69) 29)on the legal position in relation to the Concorde project-; amemorandum by the Minister of Technology (C (69) 28) on theEuropean 250-Seater Aircraft; a note by the Secretary of State for defence (C (69) 3.1) reporting progress on the project for a Multi-roleCombat Aircraft; and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C (69) 30) covering the Report of the Official Committee on theAircraft Industry.In discussion it was pointed out that the Concorde was only oneof three major aircraft projects on which we were collaborating, orconsidering collaboration, with Europe, and that the question of withdrawl had arisen to some degree in relation to each. Thepolitical consequences of withdrawal from all three would be serious;and it followed that a decision to cancel the Concorde would strengthen the case for proceeding with either the European A300B250-seater aircraft or the Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MRCA) or both. The continuation of our financial commitment to the Concordewould preclude a decision to embark forthwith on the A300B, or onthe BAC 311 which might be developed by the British aircraft corporation (BAC) in collaboration with the Lockheed aircraft corporation (Lockheed). On the other hand the legal advice on the risks inherent in a unilateral cancellation of the Concorde now couldnot be set aside, and agreement that the project should be allowedto continue until the end of 1969 might have the merit of enabling usto decline to participate in the development of the A300B withoutseriously prejudicing our future position on the BAC 311. TheMRCA project did not affect this issue, since production of theMRCA would be undertaken much later than either of the two civilprojects. The cost of continuing the Concorde until the end of 1969,instead of cancelling it now, would be about  55 million, of which 45 million would be spent on research and development (R &amp; D)and  10 million on the early stages of production.   The French
Governments concern about its rate of spending on the project wasreflected in its decision to slow down its investment in production.A similar slowing down of production in the United Kingdom shouldbe practicable and would effect substantial savings, although it would undoubtedly lead to some redundancies in the industry. It was forconsideration whether some savings could also be achieved in the 45 million which would otherwise be spent on R &amp; D before the endof the year. However, as much of the R&amp;D expenditure involvedflight trials and testing, there was a risk that such savings might setback the whole programme and deter airlines from placing firm orders.Unilateral action by us in this respect might be regarded as an infringement of the agreement with M. Chamant, the French Ministerof Transport; and such reductions in expenditure would therefore have to be the subject of prior discussion with the French Government.The purpose of slowing down French expenditure on production was probably to make resources available for the French share of thedevelopment of the A300B.On the development of a 250-seater aircraft, it was accepted that the A300B project had little to recommend it to the UnitedKingdom. The scheme was based on inadequate market research,and it had now to be accepted that the national airlines could not be obliged to purchase an aircraft in opposition to their commercial judgment. The BAC 311 project had greater attractions, british european Airways (BEA) had already expressed a preference for it,and Eastern Airlines of the United States had recently indicated thatthey wanted 50 aircraft of the BAC 311 type. Arrangements for jointdevelopment were now under discussion between BAC and Lockheedbut would not culminate in a definite proposal for some weeks, and itwas unlikely that a Government decision on this project would benecessary before the latter part of the year. However, it had to berecognised that the A300B and the BAC 311 would be in competition with one another, and that the Boeing company were almost certain to seek a place in the same market. It could be argued that if Franceand Germany proceeded with the development of the A300Bbilaterally, the market prospects for the BAC 311 would not justify our proceeding with it. On the other hand the involvement ofLockheed in the development of the BAC 311 should ensure asubstantial market for this aircraft in the United States and otherparts of the world, and might so reduce the commercial prospects for the A300B that the latter project would be dropped. WhileFrance and Germany might criticise us if we decided to collaborate with the United States rather than with Europe in this field, it shouldbe noted that they nevertheless intended to make the A300B availablewith American engines, and indeed there was still some possibility
that Lockheed might play some part in the A300B scheme. AlthoughFrance and Germany had said that they were not interested incollaborating with us on the development of the BAC 311, we couldreiterate our willingness to discuss such co-operation if there seemedany likelihood that the A300B project might be abandoned. We should if possible avoid having to give a firm refusal to participate in theA300B while the BAC 311 was being defined and the arrangementsfor its development were being discussed with Lockheed. If theMinister of Technology accepted the invitation of the French andGerman Governments to discuss the A300B with them, his aim wouldbe to play for time by probing the possibilities of improving the consortium^ terms for Government support for the project, and ofa German offset contribution.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that we should not attempt to cancel the concorde project before the end of 1969. However, it had to berecognised that this postponement would not necessarily make thedecision easier at the end of the year, and we should aim to reduce expenditure on the Concorde as much as possible during the perioduntil a final decision could be taken. The French Government hadalready decided on savings by delaying production expenditure andwe should aim to turn this to our advantage in securing savings bypostponing research and development expenditure as well. the continuing delays in the United States programme for a supersoniccivil aircraft made more acceptable some further slippage in the concorde programme. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Technology, in consultation with the Attorney-General,should seek to identify substantial savings by postponement on concorde research, development and production, for which the earlyacquiescence of the French Government should be sought. If the seministers were unable to agree on a savings programme, the matter should be remitted to the Ministerial Steering Committee onEconomic Policy.The Cabinet agreed that the A300B Airbus in the form nowproposed by the French and German Governments was anunattractive project in which we should not participate. There were,however, advantages in not disclosing our position until we could seemore clearly the prospects of developing the BAC 311 in collaboration with the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. The Minister of Technologyshould therefore seek to delay, for another month or so, conveying theGovernments decision not to participate in the A300B to the Frenchand German Governments. If meanwhile the outlook for the bac 311 or the terms on which we were offered participation in theA300B changed materially, the Minister of Technology would be freelo reopen the decision against the A300B with his colleagues; but the
general view of the Cabinet was that even a substantial improvementin the proposed terms of our participation would not make theA300B an attractive proposition for us.The Defence Secretary would bring forward in about a monthrecommendations on British participation in the future stages of theEuropean project for a Multi-Role Combat Aircraft.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to postpone until the end of 1969 a decision on whether or not to withdraw from the Concorde project.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of technology, in consultation with the Attorney-General,to draw up a programme of savings on Concorde research and development and production expenditure for earlydiscussion with the French Government; and, failing agreement on such a programme, to remit the matter tothe Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology to inform the French andGerman Governments in due course of the government&apos;s decision not to participate in the A300B project for a250-seater aircraft.(4) Took note that the Secretary of State for Defence would shortly make recommendations about future british participation in the European project for a Multi-RoleCombat Aircraft.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,25th March, 1969.
