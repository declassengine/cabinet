The Minister of State, Department of Health and social security said that following the discussion in Cabinet on 11th Sep-tember the Secretary of State for Social Services said he had seenthree of the organisations concerned to discuss the arrangements forpartial contracting out of the new earnings-related pension scheme.Their reaction had been much as expected. They had expressedsome satisfaction at the proposal to increase the pension abatementto 1 per cent and there had been no pressure to go above this. Theproposal that contributions should be abated by I -25 per cent had,however, provoked a sharp adverse reaction. The indications were that, while most large and efficiently run schemes would fare reason-ably well under this formula, a large number of small schemes wouldbe very badly hit. It would not, however, be possible to reach a firmjudgment on the consequences of adopting the 1:1 - 25 per centformula until the consultations with interested organisations hadbeen completed. In the meantime neither he nor the Secretary ofState for Social Services had said anything to suggest that the Gov-ernment would be willing to increase the contributions abatementbeyond 1 -25 per cent.In discussion it was argued that there were strong objectionsto abating contributions by more than 1 - 25 per cent and that anincrease to 1-3 per cent should be considered only as a last resort.It was important that before any decision to increase the abatementbeyond 1-25 per cent was taken estimates should be obtained of theextent of contracting out which would be likely to occur on the basisof an abatement of 1 - 3 per cent.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had already decided that, if need be, the contributionsabatement could be increased from 1-25 to 1-3 per cent. Whetherthis would be necessary was a question of judgment which wouldhave to decided in the light of the views expressed by the pensioninterests and other organisations concerned in the consultations whichwere taking place this week. The Secretary of State for social services should consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer before taking a final decision.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer before taking a finaldecision on the level of contributions abatement.141771-4b*1. The Cabinet discussed the situation in Northern Ireland; theconclusions reached were separately recorded and circulated only toThe Queen, the Prime Minister and those Ministers who had to take action.The conclusions are recorded separately in the standard file heldby the Secretary of the Cabinet.
PublicExpenditure1971-72(previous reference:CC (69) 38thConclusions)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer about public expenditure in 1971-72 (C (69) 118).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that although 1971-72 wasthe &quot; focal year &quot; of the current public expenditure survey, in practicedecisions in respect of that year would not have the same degree ofimportance to the spending Departments or the Treasury as those for 1970-71: they were further off and related to a period after theend of this Parliament. He hoped, therefore, that they would not find it necessary to give the same exhaustive consideration to the programmes for 1971-72 as for 1970-71. Nevertheless, it would be essential to show in the White Paper on Public Expenditure to bepublished towards the end of this year that the total, and the break-down, for 1971-72 were consistent with the Governmenfs policies.Total public expenditure for 1971-72 as set out in the 1969 Surveywould involve an increase, on a constant price basis, of 5 - 2 per cent over 1970-71. Including the allowance that should be made for thefaster increase in prices to be expected in the public than in theprivate sector the &quot; relative price effect &quot; the increase would be per cent. This was unacceptably large. Publication in the white paper of such a steep rise in public expenditure would not only haveadverse effects on confidence in sterling, but would also prompt the accusation that the Government had only managed to keep public expenditure within reasonable bounds until 1970-71 by postponingexpenditure, and the associated budgetary problems, until after thenext General Election. He recognised, nevertheless, the disadvan-tages of publishing too low a figure and he had attempted to strike a fair balance. Officials had suggested that a reduction of about 450 million in public expenditure was required in 1971-72 in orderto eliminate a prospective excess of demand of about  350 million inthat year. He considered, however, that a reduction of  300 million in demand terms should just be adequate: if the demand content was sufficiently high, this would be equivalent to a reduction of  350million in public expenditure. Such a reduction would still leavethe total of civil and defence programmes between 3J and 3J per cent higher in 1971-72 than in 1970-71. Including nationalised industries&apos;investment, total public sector expenditure would increase by about-2 per cent over this period-the largest rate of increase whichwould be tolerable in relation to the expected rate of growth of gross national product.Of the  350 million reduction proposed, about  180 million would stem from the decisions which they had already taken inrespect of 1970-71. He suggested that  80 million of the remaindershould be found from the defence and nationalised industries&apos; invest-ment programmes combined. Investment by the nationalised industries would in any event be reduced by  103 million as a resultof the 1970-71 decisions, so that it would be unrealistic to accept anadditional reduction of more than  20 million from this source. Ifthe defence budget could be reduced by  60 million, this would leaveabout  95 million to be found from the civil programmes. If, how-ever, the defence budget and the nationalised industries could not
produce  80 million between them, the civil programmes would haveto be further reduced. If new proposals for additional expenditurein 1971-72 were agreed, these would have to be offset by additionalreductions. He asked for agreement that officials should now be requested to produce detailed proposals for consideration by ministers in the second week of October to achieve a reduction ofabout  350 million in public expenditure in 1971-72 as indicated inparagraph 9 of C (69) 118.The Defence Secretary said that he agreed with the Chancellorsproposal that public expenditure should be reduced by  350 million in 1971-72 and that the defence budget should make a significant contribution. He must point out, however, that the main burdenof finding additional savings would fall on defence. He could not agree to cuts which would involve a new Defence Review, but onlyto savings which could be made by a series of relatively small andunrelated cuts mainly achieved by deferment of expenditure. In1971-72, the defence budget would already have to find reductions of up to  25 million in order to offset the pay improvements whichhad been agreed for the armed forces. In addition, he would cer-tainly find savings of  50 million, equivalent to a 3-3 per cent reduction in a contracting defence budget. The civil programmeson the other hand, which were expanding, would be cut by only 1 -1per cent on the Chancellors proposals. He would try to reduce thedefence budget by  55 million and if possible by  1 million or somore; and since he would in any event be finding  25 million to offset the pay improvements, any shortfall in the cost of the latter would increase the defence savings still further. But he could not provide reductions totalling more than  60 million, i.e.  85 millionincluding provision for absorbing the pay improvements. He was prepared to give similar information to that provided by other spend-ing Ministers about the sources of the defence savings proposed.In discussion, the following points were made (a) Regular resort to cuts in the nationalised industries&apos; invest-ment programmes in order to contain public expenditure as a whole was not conducive to efficient management of this investment. Inany event, it might led to precautionary inflation of individual programmes by the industries concerned.(b) The present civil programmes for 1971-72 made no provisionfor renewal of the existing financial assistance to the coal industry which would be needed, though not necessarily on the same scale as now.(c) The present opportunity should be taken to alter the balanceof public expenditure in 1971-72 so that a smaller share went to assistance to industry and a larger share to social services. Thisswitch had not been a practical possibility for 1970-71 because of thelength of time required to make substantial alterations to expenditureon assistance to industry.(d) The proposal to find a substantial part of the saving on thecivil programmes by limiting the Rate Support Grant for 1971-72would not necessarily reduce local authority revenue expenditure,
which could be maintained by increases in rates. To the extent that local authority revenue expenditure was thereby reduced, it couldprevent the employment of adequate numbers of teachers, whosesalaries formed an important part of local authority current expenditure.(e) There was a difference of view between the Treasury andthe Ministry of Overseas Development about the cost of continuingexisting policy in 1971-72. This would need to be considered further in the course of the preparation of detailed proposals for economies in 1971-72.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the rate of increase in public sector programmes in 1971-72 should be trimmed to reduce demand by  300 million and that the aim should be to do this by a reduction of about  350million in public expenditure in that year. This reduction should be apportioned broadly as the Chancellor had suggested in C (69) 118,but to the extent that, for example, it was not possible to find 80 million from the nationalised industries and defence, there wouldhave to be corresponding additional reductions in the civil pro-grammes. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should now arrangefor officials to commission detailed proposals to effect these reduc-tions for consideration by the Cabinet in the second week of October.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in paragraph 9 of C (69) 118.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to make detailed proposals accordingly for their consideration.Cabinet Office,16 September, 1969.
