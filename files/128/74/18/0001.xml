CONFIDENTIALAFFAl^I&apos;T^R^        1&apos;      The Cabinet were informed .of the business to be taken in the House of Commons during the following week.RePort of  ,parliame THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he had nowB undar ry received and circulated to the Cabinet the report of the Parliamentary ^0lnmissi Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland.     The Commission hadN rthern n ^0r      recommended.that the number of constituencies in Northern Ireland *telarid should be increased from 12 to 17, in line with the requirements ofthe House of. Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1979, and, in a supplementary report, had also recommended that five members should be returned from each of the 17 constituencies to the Northern Ireland Assembly, thereby increasing the total membership of the Assembly from 78 to 85 members.     He was under a statutory requirement to lay these recommendations before Parliament &quot;as soon as may be&quot;, together with a draft implementing Order in Council.     He did not expect the recommendations to the subject of major controversy in Northern Ireland itself, but some of the Government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons might well be critical of the proposal to increase the number of Parliamentary seats while there was still a possibility that the Northern Ireland Assembly would eventually acquire devolved powers. The political effect of the proposed changes was difficult to estimate. They might p,ive the unionists 12 seats and the nationalist parties 5 seats &apos;&apos;including another 2 seats for Sinn Fein); but if there were no especially wide divisions among the unionists, and if, as was likely, the nationalist vote in each constituency was split between Sinn Fein and the Social Democratic and Labour Party, it was possible that the unionists could take all 17 seats at the next General Election.     It would not be practicable to change the Commission&apos;s recommendations at this stage, and he proposed that they should be laid before Parliament as soon as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Home and Social Affairs Committee had already agreed that the reports of the English, Scottish and Welsh Boundary Commissions should be laid before Parliament as soon as possible after they were received in January or February 1983.     Any delay in laying the Northern Ireland report would give the Opposition grounds for arguing that there should be a similar delay in dealing with the other three.     The Cabinet agreed that the Northern Ireland report should be laid as soon as possible.The Cabinet -1.       Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for the report of the Parliamentary Boundary Commission for Northern Ireland to be laid before Parliament, together with a draft implementing Order in Council, as soon as possible.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALBrit il ...THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that it was of the utmost^evi us importance that there should be no debate or statement on the disposalRefete of Britoil until the shares had been allocated.     The Government shouldCC(82) ,?: be ready to ..explain the reasons for this to the Speaker if the^cliio- Opposition attempted to force an emergency debate under Standing Order| ns&gt; No. 9.Vecf raE HOME SECRETARY said that the policy on the Data Protection Bill n Bill     would have to be considered further by the Home and Social Affairs Committee.     A number of difficult policy issues connected with the scope and method of exemption from the requirements of the Bill remained to be settled, and it was now doubtful whether the Bill would be ready for introduction before the Christmas Adjournment.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she would be making a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon on security following the conviction of Mr Geoffrey Arthur Prime the previous day on espionage charges. Mr Priue had resigned from Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) in 1977, but security procedures had not been materially altered since then.     Whether there was a case for more stringent application of the existing procedures would be a matter to be considered by the Security Commission, to whom she would   be referring the case.     Detailed surveillance of the large number of people employed at GCHQ, even if practicable would not be conducive to the efficiency of GCHQ&apos;s work, and in any event no vetting process or other procedures could be fully proof against the activities of someone sufficiently skilled and determined to keep his activities secret, unless the authorities resorted to methods of investigation and surveillance which would be extremely repugnant in a free country. If his superiors had become aware that Mr. Prime was receiving psychiatric treatment in 1972, his position would have been very fully considered;   but they did not become aware of that fact.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL^FAIRs 2.     THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE reportedthat the Soviet Government had now publicly confirmed that   President Brezhnev had died on 10 November.     A decision on hissuccessor would be taken by the Politburo and ratified by the Central ^eath of Committee of the Soviet Communist Party as soon as possible.     The!^esident terms of the messages of condolence which would need to be sent frome2hnev ^ne Queen, the Prime Minister and the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary were under consideration.     The question of attendance at the funeral would also need to be addressed, in consultation with the governments of Britain&apos;s European Community partners.     Since Mr Brezhnev had been Head of State as well as First Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, it would be necessary for The Queen to be represented as well as the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she would be reluctant to attend the funeral, but would be ready to do so if the President of the French Republic, Monsieur Mitterrand, and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Kerr Kohl, went.     It would be necessary to consult the Government of the United States as well as European Community Governments before reaching decisions.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.^?n Jttic THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, said that^otis agreement had now been reached in Washington between the representa-pt tives of the. seven governments concerned, plus the Presidency andI^jV^ Us Commission of the European Community, on the terms of the paper onw otence; East-West economic relations put foward by the United StatesCon     ^&apos;th Secretary of State, Mr Shultz.     Confirmation of this agreement wasHi*    sions subject to arrangements satisfactory to the United States&apos; allieste 2     &apos; being reached on handling and presentation and to a decision byPresident Reagan to lift the United States&apos; sanctions against European firms.     It was accepted by all except the French that the terms of Mr Shultz&apos;s paper should be published and that President Reagan should make only a short accompanying statement.     The President&apos;s decision to end the measures against European firms had been expected that day in the light of a meeting of the American National Security Council earlier in the week, but no announcement had yet been made.In discussion it was pointed out that President Reagan&apos;s intentions were still unclear.     The United Kingdom&apos;s aim was to secure the complete lifting of the United States embargo;   but it was not certain that President Reagan would be prepared to go as far as this.     The Europeans might have to be content with a lifting of the retrospective measures imposed by the United States in December 1981 and June 1982, together with the related Denial Orders.     This would enable British firms to fulfil contracts entered into before the United States embargo had been imposed, but restrictions on subsequent or future contracts would remain in force.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion, said that the news of Mr Brezhnev&apos;s death heralded a testing and uncertain period in East-West relations in which cohesion and unity within the Alliance would be more important than ever.     It was therefore essential that the United States should settle the current dispute with its European partners over economic sanctions without further delay.     An urgent message in this sense should be sent to the United States Government through HM Ambassador at Washington.The Cabinet -2.       Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to send instructions to HM Ambassador at Washington in accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.ImmunityaFpAlRS 3.     THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE, reportedthat the Council had discussed the Commission Memorandum on the &quot;*    Community&apos;s future development policy.     Two Commission proposals,unwelcome to. the United Kingdom, were firmly rejected:    the creation v Ul}cU of of a new target for Community aid as a proportion of gross national.^isterg product and the incorporation of the European Development Fund within8 JVeloPment)        the Con,munity budget.Sonl8heries Pol.       THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the p Xcy   Danish Prime. Minister had spoken to the President of the CommissionHefV^0vi8 to say that the reports that the Danish Government had completelyQC.^rence: rejected the proposed fisheries agreement were exaggerated, but thatCo      ^?th Denmark needed one or two minor concessions to enable the package toHi ^^iotis 1)6 accepted*     The Danish Prime Minister had suggested two possiblenute 3     * concessions which would, in fact, be entirely unacceptable to theUnited Kingdom because, if granted, they would cause the total rejection of the package by the United Kingdom industry.     So far, there was no sign of any break in ranks by the nine member states who accepted the package;   but there was clearly a risk that, sooner or later, one or other of them would put pressure on the United Kingdom to make a gesture to the Danes, whereas the United Kingdom could not afford to make any further concessions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he entirely agreed.     At the last Council of Ministers meeting to discuss fisheries the Government had used up the very last vestige of goodwill of the representatives of the Scottish fishermen.^tiettets T?E SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR ENERGY reported that the Council had made^ Nov81^ distinct progress towards the acceptance in principle of the idea ofember a Community_coal policy.     A further Council to discuss coal would beheld on 10 December.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHlo-PrenSummit THE PRIME MINISTER said that the main outcome of the Anglo-FrenchNovemv, Summit was an agreement that officials would be in more regular contactthan previously, so that each government would get to know more of what the other thought and the possibilities for agreement could be more fully explored.     Some of the bilateral meetings between particular Ministers at the Summit had been business-like and reasonably friendly; others had been rather acrimonious.     Regardless of the atmosphere in each particular bilateral, the relevant French Minister had then at the Plenary Session read out a prepared statement which underlined French difficulties and appeared to take no account of any co-operation that had been achieved in the bilateral discussions. President Mitterrand&apos;s presentation to the Press afterwards had been reasonably satisfactory, and the decision by the French government to abstain in the United Nations vote on the resolution about the Falkland Islands had been most welcome and was no doubt accounted for by the fact that British Ministers were in Paris at the time.The Cabinet -Took note.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAtrial&lt;lFpAlRS 4.       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that progress wasbeing made towards the resolution of the pay dispute in the National jjationai Health Service (NHS).    In the case of the nurses and related groups,alth ser . the revised two-year pay offer and the proposal for consultations abouty DisputeICe      a review body had been announced on 9 November and were being consideredby the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) and other professional organisations, Bteviou8 and by the trade unions.   It was hoped that the RCN Council would laterp eretice- that day decide to recommend acceptance of the settlement package.   They(82) ^y&apos; might, however, decide to consult the membership by a ballot whose costsJ?nclusi0tls would be reimbursed by the Government under the provisions of theltlute 4    8 Employment Act 1980.   In that event, it was hoped that a favourableresult would emerge in time for a settlement to be reached at the next meeting of the Nurses and Midwives Whitley Council on 14 December.    It was also welcome that the RCN had now voted against affiliation to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and in favour of retaining their rule against industrial action.In the case of the remaining NHS groups the TUC Health Services Committee had now entered into negotiations with the Government following the calling off of the National Day of Action planned for 8 November. Following consultations with the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer he had indicated that the Government might be prepared to increase its offer in respect of 1983-84 by half of one per cent for these groups also, provided that the trade unions were prepared to conclude a settlement on this basis.   The majority of the unions represented on the Committee were now in favour of early meetings of the relevant Whitley Councils at which the Government&apos;s revised offer would be tabled and of reaching a settlement on that basis.   So far, however, the National Union of Public Employees had remained intransigent.   The trade unions were holding further discussions that morning with the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service, who were likely to reaffirm that the Government&apos;s position was that no more money would be available in respect of 1982-83 and that there would be a differential pay increase in that year in favour of the nurses and related groups. It was probable that the unions would wish to meet him that afternoon.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that the additional half of one per cent had been made available to the groups other than the nurses and related groups only on the understanding that a settlement would be concluded on this basis.   The negotiations were therefore at a critical stage.    It should also be borne in mind that the proposal for a review body for the nurses and related groups was conditional on acceptance of the Government&apos;s revised pay offer, as the Secretary of State for Social Services had made clear in his statement to the House of Commons on 9 November.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL^dustr   p THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the employers inNegotia^. ^ t^ie water industry would be making their response to the trade unions&apos;l0ns pay claim later that day.   The Minister for Local Government and^vious Environmental Services had explained to them the undesirability of anReference* offer greater than 4 or 4i per cent, and it was hoped that this adviceCC(82) a-,&apos; would be heeded.    Such an offer would probably be rejected and theConciUQ- employers might therefore have recourse to arbitration, to which thereninute 4     &apos; was unilateral access, and which was binding on both sides.   Industrialaction could not be ruled out.    It would be essential to make it clear to the public that the water workers were reasonably well paid and were not doing particularly dirty or unpleasant jobs; fact sheets had been prepared for use by Press Offices for this purpose.   In the longer term consideration would need to be given to the future of the arbitration arrangements, and to seeing what could be done to inhibit the water industry, and other public sector monopolies, from passing on excessive pay increases in higher charges.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.Cabinet Office 11 November 19827CONFIDENTIAL
