CONFIDENTIAL&apos;FAIrs Tne Cal,]net were informed of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week. The House would rise for the Christmas Adjournment on Thursday 23 December and return on Monday 17 January 1983.linn*Ulegration       THE HOME SECRETARY said that the new Immigration Rules were to be debatedm the House of Commons on Wednesday 15 December.    Those Conservative &apos;&gt;revi0Us Members who continued to oppose the new Rules in their present form did soh!^e*ence  reasons opposite to those of the Labour Party, whose home affairs^2) 47^, spokesman was now claiming, almost certainly wrongly, that the Rules would p*Clv,8 0 lead to a reduction in the number of new immigrants.    If the Rules werelImte i   S&apos;     n t approved, a new version would have to be brought forward, which would no doubt be opposed by a different group of Government supporters.    A situation might then arise in which the Government would be able to carry Rules only in a form approved by the Opposition.The Cabinet -1.      Took note..the   ^C       THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he would be making aon ,., PaPerI    et^SS ns of        Parliamentary statement in the following week to accompany the publicationU] Pallcland  f Wn:&apos;-te PaPer on tne lessons of the Falkland Islands campaign.

There was pressure for the order for a further ship, toreplace the other ship that had been lost in the South Atlantic, to bePlaced with Cammell Laird,  in order to protect the employment position onMerseyside.    There were also sound reasons of defence policy for preservingCammell Laird as a viable concern.    But it was expected that an order fromthe British Gas Corporation (BGC) for a new drilling rig would go toCammell Laird, and if it did there would be no redundancies in the yard forthe next year or more.    There would then be a strong case for putting outthe order for competitive tenders from both Cammell Laird and VosperThorneycroft, who were also in need of new work.    It would be helpful forthe position on the new BGC rig to be confirmed before he made hisstatement.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion,  said that the placing of the order for the last replacement ship might well go to Cammell Laird if their bid was competitive, but acceptance of an uncompetitive tender^ could not be justified solely on the grounds of the unemployment situation in Merseyside.    Confirmation of the position on the BGC rig should be sought from British Shipbuilders before the Secretary of State for Defence made his statement.The Cabinet -2.     Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to seek confirmation from the Chairman of British Shipbuilders that the order for the new British Gas Corporation&apos;s drilling rig would be placed with Cammell Laird, and to inform the Secretary of State for Defence accordingly.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL---  j----o I I   --------       &quot;_where the incident had occurred was just outside the army barracks in Ballykelly, and was much frequented by the soldiers, who had been encouraged to mix with the local population, since the recent improvement m the security position in the Province.    It was hard in these circumstances to say that there had been any negligence in security, but security procedures would clearly have to be reviewed.    The incident had inevitably become linked with the invitation extended by the Greater London Council to members of the Provisional Sinn Fein to visit London.    The serving by the Home Secretary of exclusion orders under the Prevention of Terrorism Act  n three of its members would be claimed by Sinn Fein as a moralCONFIDENTIAL!tatus andle of THE CH1EF SECRETARY, TREASURY,  said that discussions had been continuing^niptroii G      over a considerable period with Mr Edward du Cann MP and Mr Joel Barnett MP, and Audit^       3S rePresentatives of the Public Accounts Committee  (PAC) , about their ^neral     *       proposals for changing the status and extending the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General.    The representatives of the PAC had not been willing to accept the Government&apos;s suggestions for more limited changes, and were now strongly supporting the Private Member&apos;s Bill introduced by Mr Norman St John Stevas MP, who had drawn second place in the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills.    The Bill was designed to implement all the PAC&apos;s recommendations.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer intended to bring a memorandum before the Cabinet the following week dealing,  in particular, with the status,   independence, method of appointment,  and scope of the responsibilities of the Comptroller and Auditor General.    In the meantime a meeting was being arranged between the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Lord President of the Council,  and the sponsors of the Bill to try to identify more clearly the points of agreement and potential conflict.    The Bill had wide and influential Parliamentary support, and it was unlikely that the Government would be able to defeat it on Second Reading.    The Government might eventually have to go further than they had originally contemplated to meet the wishes of the PAC.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion,  said that the apparent intention of the Bill was to extend the Comptroller and Auditor General&apos;s Powers and to make them cover any organisation in receipt of Government funds.    This would inevitably lead to more centralised accounting procedures m Government Departments and the nationalised industries, would require a large increase in the staff of Departments, as well as in the staff of the Exchequer and Audit Department, and would seriously disrupt the movement towards more commercial accounting procedures which the Government had sought to encourage wherever possible.    The Cabinet would have to consider the handling of the Bill very carefully in the light of the further discussions with its sponsors which had been arranged,  and of the paper to be circulated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet -3.     Agreed to resume their discussion of the Bill introduced by Mr Norman St John-Stevas at a later meeting.^PA  D 2&apos;      THE SECRETARY 0F STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that, although thes IRS bomb which had exploded at a discotheque in Ballykelly, County Londonderry,L.  n 6 December had been relatively small,  it had brought down a heavybji  elly c ncrete ceiling which appeared to have caused most of the deaths and^utrage serious injuries to the soldiers and other young people present.    The bar
CONFIDENTIALvictory,  and was being distorted by some Official Unionists and others as a tacit .admission that the Government applied different standards to the prevention of terrorism in London from those applied in the Province; but he was convinced that after the Ballykelly incident no other action was possible.    Meanwhile, a dispute had arisen in the new Northern Ireland Assembly because of complaints by the Official Unionists about the appointment of Chairmen of Committees by the Assembly Speaker.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which had been passed by a Labour Administration when the present Leader of the Social Democratic Party was Home Secretary, gave him powers to exclude from Great Britain on the application of a Chief Constable any person who there was reason to believe had been concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.    There was no doubt that Mr Adams, Mr Morrison and Mr McGuiness,  the three members of Sinn Fein against whom he had made orders,  fell firmly within this description.    Not to have exercised his powers in this case would have conflicted with the very strong advice which he had received not only from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, but also from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and would have called in question the continued use of the provisions of the Act.    He did not think that it would have been right to delay making the orders until the Leader of the Greater London Council had decided whether to withdraw the invitation voluntarily following the Ballykelly incident. He did not intend to comment on his decison in the Press or on radio or television, but he would deal with any Parliamentary criticisms by resting firmly on the fact that the situation which had arisen was precisely of the kind envisaged by the Prevention of Terrorism Act,  and that it would have been irresponsible in those circumstances not to have used the powers which it conferred.    He would carefully avoid any suggestion that the exclusion had been imposed because of fears of disorder in London; that would wrongly imply that the Metropolitan Police were not capable of dealing adequately with any disturbances which might have arisen.    It followed from that that,  if the other two members of the proposed Provisional Sinn Fein delegation, Mr Carron and Mr McAllister, sought to enter Great Britain, they would not be excluded,  since there was no reason to believe that they had been involved in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism.The Cabinet -Unanimously supported the decision taken by the Home Secretary, and congratulated him upon his action in the matter.3 CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIS             3.      THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR HURD),  said that in a raid by South African forces on the capital of Lesotho early that %th 4r morning between 30 and 35 people had been killed.    The South AfricanAfrica Government claimed that those killed were African National Congress guerrillas tevin the Lesotho Government maintained that they were refugees.    The Lesotho Highff   US Commissioner would be seeing the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealthhi) IV        Office, Mr Onslow, later that morning.    It would be necessary for the United kli   Kingdom publicly to condemn South Africa&apos;s infringement of Lesotho s^uteS2 nS&apos;     SOvereignty and to deplore the loss of life, and to make a formal protest to the South African Government.3st       THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,  said that action was r*vi0 o being taken to defuse the sharp reaction of the Arab Governments concerned toKete&quot;! breakdown of the arrangements for the projected visit to London by anWl) IV Arab League delegation headed by King Hassan of Morocco. There was as yet no NuJlst firm evidence of injury to British commercial interests, although threatening plUte noises were being made.    There was to be a routine meeting of the ArabBoycott Committee early next week.    Although there was no indication that Proposals would be made on that occasion for action against the United Kingdom, such meetings were unpredictable and liable to get out of hand. Meanwhile Lord Chalfont, accompanied by a senior Foreign and Commonwealth Office official, had gone to Morocco with an oral message to the King from the Prime Minister.    Lord Chalfont was a personal friend of King Hassan and was optimistic that the King would receive him expeditiously.    It was hoped that the delivery of the message would allay the King&apos;s sense of personal grievance.    The Prime Minister had also sent a message to King Fahd of Saudi Arabia which would be delivered in Riyadh on 11 December.    In delivering the message HM Ambassador would propose a visit to Saudi Arabia by the Foreign _ and Commonwealth Secretary early in January.    Contact was also being made with the Secretary General of the Arab League with a view to inviting him to London.    Ideas to be explored in discussion with Arab leaders included the Possibility of inviting a party of Palestinian Mayors (who would not be officials of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO)) to London, to be followed by a visit from the Arab League delegation without PLO membership; the inclusion of one of the Mayors in the delegation; or agreeing to the inclusion of a PLO representative in the delegation on the understanding that it would be received in London only at Minister of State level.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the impact on British trading interests would require careful monitoring.    The United Kingdom&apos;s trade with Arab countries was worth  5* billion in the current year, which represented a 16 per cent increase.    This included a surplus of  2 billion on visible account and  400 million on invisible account.    A visit to the area by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in January,  to be followed by his own visit in February, would help to demonstrate the United Kingdom s continuing interest in the Arab world.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALF* it*THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,  said that the newvious Spanish Government had now decided to open the border with Gibraltar toTerence-        Pedestrians.    The economic benefits of this partial opening would go to Spain Cc(82) 5jV       rather than Gibraltar, and it did not amount to implementation of the Lisbon Illusion        Agreement,  though it was a gesture for which the Spanish Government had I lrmte 2     &apos;     s ught no quid pro quo.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would beseeing the Spanish Foreign Minister,  Senor Moran,  the following day and would.press for the complete lifting of all travel restrictions.tates THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE,  said that the vote bythe United States House of Representatives to deny the Administration funds }fevious ^or the production of MX missiles created problems for the British Government,*ference-        Particularly in view of the Opposition&apos;s hostility to President Reagan&apos;s^9th       Proposals.    Although the vote in the House of Representatives was a greater ?nclusi0n        defeat for President Reagan than had been expected,  it was only the beginning l1i)te 2     &apos;      f a long argument and the Senate could be expected to take a more positiveview.    Meanwhile research and development should continue, and there was some hope that serious dislocation of the production programme could be avoided. There was in any case no need for the British Government to commit itself specifically to support for the MX system as such or the related concept ofdense pack&quot; deployment.    What mattered was the United States Government&apos;s overall decision to modernise the strategic nuclear triad, which was clearly right.The Cabinet -Took note.AIRS THE PRIME MINISTER said that the European Council in Copenhagen had beenLably chaired by the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Schluter.    Two current topics *%Peatl Were of special interest to the United Kingdom, fish and the budget.    On fish,ki C:U tne Danish Prime Minister had said that he could not accept the package on theMember     table and had asked for further clarification.    By this he seemed to mean one  r two concessions outside the package;  it was not clear what they were.    The Prime Minister had made it clear that negotiations on the package itself had come to an end and Mr Schluter appeared to accept that.    No progress had been made on the budget issue, and President Mitterrand of the French Republic had told the press that the United Kingdom was asking for more money as usual, which was not helpful.    The matter had now been remitted to the Foreign Affairs Council and,  if they failed to produce a solution, the next meeting of the European Council in March would be dominated by the budget problem.    This would be unfortunate but might well prove unavoidable.    If lasting solutions could be found to the problems of fish and the budget, a great deal of the anti-Community feeling in the United Kingdom would go away.^n the discussion of the economic and social situation, the European Council ad endorsed the conclusions reached by the Joint Council of Finance, conomics and Employment Ministers.    There was common concern at the absence  f free trade within the Community.    Every country had a list of barriers erected against its exports by every other Community country.    A special meeting of the Council of Ministers was proposed to try to reduce these.    InCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe discussion of enlargement the Prime Minister had called attention to the imbalance in the arrangements governing the trade between the Community and Spain.    This  issue would be followed up at the December Foreign Affairs Council.    In the discussion of foreign affairs,  it had been pointed out that, as Poland had crushed Solidarity,  it could not be said that the conditions for lifting sanctions against the Soviet Union had been met.In general the Prime Minister considered that this had been one of the most constructive European Councils that she had attended.Sonplsl&gt;eries THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that a meeting of seniorI  1 i cy officials had been held in Brussels on 6 December to consider nationalmeasures in the absence of an agreement on the Common Fisheries Policy by the K^ous ex)&lt;^  f tne year.    The Danish official had taken the line that from 1 January,r^erenCe.        &apos;n tne absence of agreement, Danish boats could fish where they liked.    A f   2) 5^&apos;        further meeting had been arranged for 16 December at which it was hoped that [g  lusion        tbe Commission would make it quite clear to the Danes that,  in the absence of &apos;Hutg ^     &apos;     agreement, effective national measures excluding Danish vessels would beimplemented by the other nine member states with the Commission&apos;s approval.&apos; o !Cultural     THE MINISTER op AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the Commission had  Ucy      a      failed to reach agreement on its recommendations for agricultural prices in 1983-84.    This meant that it was unlikely that any proposals from the Commission would be presented before January.ltter-and        THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the French and t^ rts t0        Irish delegations had blocked the formal adoption of the regulationSiS0vi-        implementing the agreement on New Zealand butter ^^aiand that they would on Vl6t        Government had told the Deputy Prime Minister of New Z^land^hat       y continue to block the regulation until the Community was commit secure and substantial quota of butter sales to Russia = *,   k  r,anrP to renege on a commitment, ana tneieunwarranted attempt by France to renege ,major row at the Agricultural Council on 13-14 Dec.jln8d0tn THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MR HURD) ,  said thatESi f there was a risk that the agreement to pay the United Kingdom its refunds for&quot;82     r r      i982 before the end of December would be frustrated by the action of theEuropean Parliament, who were showing signs of wishing to attach conditions to their agreement which would prove unacceptable to the Council of Ministers. Everything possible was being done to put pressure on the Members of the European Parliament.    There might need to be a further meeting of the Budget Council in Strasbourg next week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the proposal for an import ban on products made from seals had aroused considerable public lriterest.    He was grateful to the other Departments concerned for agreement to a realistic brief for the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Department6CONFIDENTIAL

No agreement had been reached and another meeting was planned for the following week.    Meanwhile, the United Kingdom industry had introduced a voluntary ban on imports of these products; but this had not pleased all the conservationists, some of whom were criticising the Government for acquiescing in action which diverted attention from the need, as they saw it, to secure a mandatory ban imposed by the whole Community.5-      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the results of the Royal College of Nursing&apos;s ballot were expected by Wednesday 15 December. etionai rhat could be followed by important developments; no significant events wereealth expected to occur before then.V B ardiat^nsG &quot;5       5THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the President of the National Union of Mineworkers, Mr Arthur Scargill, having failed to obtain the endorsement of the majority of his members for a national strike in the coalmining industry over pay and pit closures, was now seeking to stir up industrial action in the Welsh coalmines,  in the hope that it would spread to the rest of the country.    The National Coal Board (NCB) were at present reasonably relaxed.    Their strategy would be to seek to keep activity going in the English coalmines if industrial action occurred in Wales, and they were not unhopeful of succeeding.-::\Of\l   !2ths*; &gt;n0NTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the NCB had now submitted an application to Leicestershire County Council for a new coalmine at Ashfordby in Leicestershire.    He had asked the Leicestershire County Council not to take any action on the application while he considered whether to call it in.    It would be important that the NCB&apos;s proposals for spoil disposal should be adequate if the development were- to go ahead.The Cabinet -Took note.6:     THE PRIME MINISTER said that Sir Derek Rayner had now told her that, in view of his increasing commitments to his company, he must ask to be releasedname.    She had accepted thisfrom the leadership of the Unit which bore hisCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdecision with great regret, and with warm gratitude for what Sir Derek Rayner had achieved.    Sir Derek Rayner had agreed to continue to be available to offer general advice and complete certain tasks which he had undertaken personally on behalf of some Departments..    The Rayner Unit would continue to operate under the direction of Mr Clive Priestley, who had assisted Sir Derek Rayner in the work of the Unit since its inception in May 1979.In discussion the Cabinet unanimously endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s regret at Sir Derek Rayner&apos;s decision, and expressed its gratitude for what he had achieved.    Working in and through the Civil Service, he had brought about a new attitude to management and efficiency;  it was a remarkable achievement.The Cabinet -Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to convey formally to Sir Derek Rayner an expression of the Cabinet&apos;s regret at his decision to ask to be released from the leadership of the Rayner Unit, and its gratitude for all that he had achieved since the Unit was created.Cabinet Office 9 December 19828CONFIDENTIAL
