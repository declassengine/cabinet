The successful repossession of the&quot; 82^e: Falkland Islands reflected new lustre on British arms and engendered akticl&apos;i    renewed sense of self-confidence in the British people,fusionsTHE PRIME MINISTER said that at 9. 00 pm local time on 14 June the British Land Forces Commander, Major General Moore, accepted from the Argentine Commander in the Falkland Islands, General Menendez, the surrender of all the Argentine armed forces in East and West Falkland Islands together with their arms and equipment.    Full information about British casualties was not yet available but first indications were that they had not been heavy in the final stages.    Press reports that General Menendez had left for Buenos Aires appeared to be inaccurate.    It was estimated that Argentine prisoners of war would number some 15, 000 of which 11, 000 were in Port Stanley itself and 2,000 on West Falkland.    The Argentines had little tentage and food for three to four days only.    British stocks of tents for prisoners had been lost when the Atlantic Conveyor was sunk.    For humanitarian reasons, therefore, it would be necessary to repatriate most of the prisoners at once,    A message would be sent that day to the Argentine Government to indicate that the British Government would be ready to repatriate the prisoners to the nearest suitable port in Argentina using the British ships, Canberra and Norland, provided that the Argentine Government agreed that all hostilities between the two countries were at an end and that safe conduct for the ships would be guaranteed.    It was essential to make certain that a comprehensive ceesation of hostilities was achieved. The Argentine Government would be told that, if they agreed to this, the Government would lift the Total Exclusion Zone and other restrictions and recommend to the other members of the European Community that economic sanctions should be ended, as a first step towards the restoration of normal relations.    As an interim arrangement, as soon as Port Stanley airfield could be reopened, Mr Rex Hunt would return, with powers limited to those of civil administration; the responsibility of Commander-in-Chief would be exercised by the British military commander.In discussion the point was made that, if the Argentine Government were reluctant to agree to a comprehensive cessation of hostilities it would be necessary to retain some Argentine prisoners of war; but conditions in the Islands were such that it would be necessary to repatriate the majority. There would be a strong demand to allow foreign journalists to visit the Islands,    It would be helpful in terms of international opinion to agree to this; but conditions in the Islands might impose some delay.    There would now be renewed demands on the Government to set up an inquiry into the events leading up to the Argentine invasion.    It would be important for the inquiry to proceed expeditiously.    Demands for an official inquiry into the Government&apos;s handling of the press during the operation should be resisted:  but the Select Committee on Defence were likely to1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinvestigate the matter.    The Tightness of the decision to delay publication of the total number of casualties in the Argentine bombing raid on Bluff Cove had been demonstrated by the success of the operation against Port Stanley.    By allowing the Argentine commander to believe that casualties had been much higher than they in fact were, and that the final British assault would in consequence be delayed, tactical surprise had been achieved and heavy British casualties in the final stages avoided.    Press accusations that the intention to conduct operations against Darwin and Goose Green had been leaked in London were totally without foundation.    There would now be international pressure on the United Kingdom to seek a diplomatic solution to the dispute with Argentina, in accordance with Resolution 502 of the United Nations Security Council,    This would heed to be handled firmly.    That Resolution had been passed before British forces had been obliged, by Argentine failure to comply with it by a voluntary withdrawal, to repossess the Islands by force of arms.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet would wish to offer their warm congratulations and grateful thanks to all those in the armed forces, the merchant marine and the civilian support services who had contributed to the outstanding success of the operation to repossess the Falkland Islands, and to mourn all those who had given their lives in the conflict.    Consideration should now be given to the early publication of an official despatch on the operation.    She would consult the Opposition Leaders about the Falkland Islands inquiry, which should not concentrate only on the events leading up to the invasion but should cover the whole background of negotiations with Argentina since 1965.    It would not be appropriate for it to be a judicial inquiry.    In accepting the Lord Chancellor&apos;s congratulations, she would wish to give credit to the Secretary of Stats for Defence and the other Ministers in day-to-day charge, who had enjoyed the full backing of the Cabinet and the British people in carrying out their policies.The Cabinet -1. Warmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s congratulations to the armed forces, the merchant marine and the civilian support services for the successful outcome of the operation to recover the Falkland Islands.2. Noted that the Prime Minister would now consult the Opposition Leaders with a view to proceeding as expeditiously as possible with the proposed Falkland Islands inquiry.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to examine the possibility of early publication of an official despatchon the operation.Cabinet Office 15 June 19822CONFIDENTIAL
