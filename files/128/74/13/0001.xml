CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the revised business to betaken in the House of Commons during the following week.    Subject to the progress of business, it was intended that both Houses should meet at 2. 30 pm on Thursday 28 October for the Prorogation of the 1981-82 Session of Parliament.APFAIRS 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,reporting on his recent round of visits to Middle East capitals, said ^dle g that the United States negotiator, Mr Habib, had worked out a planast for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Lebanon.^t6viou Although the other Governments concerned favoured mutual and*Were simultaneous withdrawal, the Syrians were insisting that theCC(82j 41 : Israelis must withdraw first.    Another problem was the 14, 000^onclUB. Palestinians still in the Lebanon.    There was nowhere for them^inute j10118* to go and they would probably have to remain there.    This couldpose serious difficulties for the process of withdrawal of external forces.    The Arab countries were still sorting themselves out in the aftermath of the Fez Summit.    They were sending a Commission of the Arab League to Washington to explore President Reagan&apos;s peace proposals with the American Administration and would not be finalising their attitude to the Reagan proposals until the Commission had reported.    Some members of the Commission would be coming to London on their way back from Washington: this would provide an opportunity for useful discussions.    Although all the Arab countries, including Egypt, had reservations about the Reagan proposals, all those he had visited except Syria, regarded them as a basis for discussion; and all of them welcomed the role which the United Kingdom and other members of the European Community were playing.    Meanwhile a struggle for the soul of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation was in progress in which, for the moment at least, the moderates - Jordan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia - seemed to be winning.    The mood within Israel was not conducive to an early peace settlement, but in other respects the 8hort-term prospects for progress in the Middle East were not without hope.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he^e^tpU8 nad found no expectation either in Syria or in Egypt of an early end^C(82)n56: to the Iran/Iraq war.    The general view seemed to be that eitherwNus Ayatollah Khome ini or President Sadam Hussain would have to fallltlUte 2 1X8&apos; before the war could finish.    Meanwhile it looked as if the Iraqiforces would continue to contain the Iranians adequately.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Polish Government&apos;s legislation to ban Solidarity and the ensuing disturbance in Poland had made it even more difficult for Western countries to normalise their relations with Poland.    The British, American and French Governments had all made strong statements of condemnation. The United States had gone further by suspending Most Favoured Nation treatment for Poiahd,    Although this decision had caused him some concern, it was probably the least the United States Government could have done, given President Reagan&apos;s personal commitment to liberalisation in Poland.    A special meeting of the North Atlantic Council was being convened on 20 October on British initiative to review Alliance policy towards Poland.    The Informal visit to London by the new Federal German Chancellor, Dr Kohl, on 19 October would be a valuable opportunity to compare notes with him on this and other problems by way of preparation for the more formal Anglo/German Summit meeting in Bonn on 28-29 October.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was continuing disagreement between the United States and her European allies on the handling of East/West economic relations; but at the informal meeting of North Atlantic Treaty Organisation Ministers m Canada on 2-3 October agreement had been reached to study various aspects of the problem.    This was an important step towards closing the gap which had opened up in the Alliance, and Press coverage of the subject since the meeting had been more positive.    At the same time there were evident dangers.    The United Kingdom and her European Partners must be careful not to enter into agreements which could hamper their own trade with the Soviet Union without securing afira quid pro quo from the United States in the shape of a lifting of the United States embargoes.    The latest developments in Poland made this more difficult.    He would be proceeding with great caution and in close consultation with the Secretary of State for Trade.In discussion the point was made that limitations on the right to export oil and gas technology to the Soviet Union could seriously damage the interests of a wide range of British firms.    Attention was also drawn to possible difficulties with the United States Government over exports  f sophisticated defence equipment to certain Middle East countries, where key micro-electronic components were of United States origin. The contracts concerned could be worth as much as  1* billion.    Means of overcoming the difficulties were under active consideration.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that experience had shown that the United States had not always delivered its side of the bargain in negotiations about restrictions on trade and credit for the Soviet Union.    It would be important to avoid a situation in which the United Kingdom was committed to further restrictions without an equally firm commitment from the United States to lift the embargo and end its discriminatory measures against British firms.The Cabinet -2. Took note.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Cranley Onslow, had just completed a very useful visit to the Falkland Islands on which he would be reporting to colleagues separately.The Cabinet -3. Took note.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had had a valuable discussion with the French Minister of the Interior, Monsieur Defferre, in London on 12 October.    It was clear that the French Government were deeply concerned at the prospect of further terrorist attacks in Paris.    Recent events in the Middle East had given a new impetus to international terrorism.    There was consequently a need for even greater vigilance in the United Kingdom, given the ease of access into the country from France through the Channel ports.The Cabinet -4. Took note.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported to    a l50!^!03-! crisis in Denmark had obliged the Danish Prime Minister cancel a visit to London on 15 October.    The crisis meant that Danish meters w uld be in a weak position to deal with the numerous omrnunity problems that were on the agenda for the rest of their Residency.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJji8herie8 THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that licy the cancellation of the Danish Prime Minister&apos;s visit deprived BritishMinisters of the opportunity to try to shift the Danish Government&apos;sj^vi0us position on fish.    The previous day the Danish Government had pub-C^8?^ 4^nd Fisheries Policy,    This was presumably a pre-election manoeuvre,Crence: lished a list of demands for changes in the proposals for the Common&quot;0nclu8iOri8 Dut the prospects for agreement on a policy in the near future had^nute 3    &apos; clearly not improved.p^tur^ THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said thatcUcy the French Agriculture Minister, Madame Cresson, had visited theSoviet Union and was reported to be negotiating an export contract for French grain.    The negotiation of such arrangements fell within the competence of the Commission and, if the story proved to be true, the episode would have profound implications for the Community.j&gt; THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the latest^6vioU8 reports indicated that the prospects for an agreement with the UnitedCCr6tence- States in the steel dispute might have somewhat improved.    It was to beC0   )42nd hoped that this was so, because the consequences of failure for theMinions British industry would be very serious.    The main remaining problemnute 3 iay with the Germans, who were opposing an agreement on pipes andtubes.    Vice-President Davignon, who was in charge of the negotiations was reported to be hopeful that the Germans would eventually come into line.    The Prime Minister&apos;s meeting with the new Federal Chancellor  n 19 October would provide an opportunity to influence the German Government in this direction.    There were conflicting reports about the finai deadline for an agreement: it now seemed to have slipped to 20 or 22 October.    If there was no prospect of an agreement by the end of the week, an emergency Council of Ministers would be called for the folloWing week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that he was becoming increasingly concerned about the consequences for United Kingdom industry of restrictive trade practices by other countries which worked ^ British disadvantage.    One current example was the Press reports, of imports of cars from Spain.    These imports resulted from the ^economic cost structure of the United Kingdom industry, but the episode had called attention to the grossly inequitable tariff arrangements between the two countries.    Under the terms of an agreement made by the Community with Spain in 1970 and applied to the United Kingdom as a result of accession, we were obliged to charge only four per cent on irrCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSpanish cars whereas Spain charged approximately 40 per cent on imports of United Kingdom cars - thus effectively preventing them from entering the market.    In the past the Government&apos;s defence had been that the problem was transient because it would be solved by Spanish accession to the Community.    Now the date of accession was constantly moving off and the Spaniards were fighting hard for a very long transitional period.    The Secretary of State was urgently considering what the United Kingdom could do to protect the position of British industry in the new circumstances.The Spanish problem was only one example of a general phenomenon. A very similar inequity in tariff arrangements applied in the case of Australia, which could export cars made in Australia to the United Kingdom at a very low tariff while protecting its market with a high tariff barrier.    The actions of the United States over steel and the pipeline were further examples.    In general, the Secretary of State was convinced that the United Kingdom&apos;s interests were firmly in the direction of liberal trading arrangements; but these examples all showed that other countries enjoyed the benefits of illiberal practices which discriminated against United Kingdom interests.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the matter should be considered urgently by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy and an agreed line worked out for use in the Debate  n the Address.The Cabinet -Invited the Secretary of State for Trade to circulate a paper recommending action to be taken to protect the United Kingdom industry against the discriminatory restrictive practices of other countries, for discussion at an early meeting of the Committee on Economic Strate gy.^AIRS 4, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCTAL SERVICES said thatthere had been considerable support by National Health Service (NHS)Pr _l _ . - -     -       &quot;---------I---JSety0rial Heaith      ^Ployees for the recent regional Days of Action, although there had VlCe &amp;X8pute     ft66*1 a       excePt^on8 and the response from workers outside the NHS been noticeably less than before.    There were some signs of tWeVl Ui3 8reater reluctance by NHS workers to take industrial action, but it wasC |gteilce. Pr bable that the unions would continue to be able to achieve substantialCon&apos; 42nd ^Sruption in selected districts by withdrawing small numbers of staff.^ute8i ns  the^^1116 talks were continuing with the Royal College of Nursing and* other professional bodies.    It was too soon to judge whether a^cttlernent would be possible with them.    It would be essential for the to Vernment to establish that these bodies would be willing and able both ^ secure acceptance by their members and to make an agreement against opposition of the NHS unions.    Depending on developments he hoped5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALto be able to give the Cabinet a better assessment of what might be feasible and desirable either the following week or the week after that.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the overtime ban imposed by the National Union of Mine workers (NUM) was being followed by its members, but only with some reluctance.    Its effect might therefore be to reduce rather than increase support for strike action in the ballot on 28-29 October.    Although the ban was preventing deliveries of coal to power stations at the weekend, the weekly rate of delivery was at present still in excess of consumption.    The President of the NUM. Mr Scar gill, would be mounting a massive campaign in advance of the ballot to focus attention on closures and on trade union loyalty rather than on pay.    It was essential for Ministers to continue to maintain the lowest possible profile, both in public and in Parliament, on all matters which could affect the outcome of the ballot.The Cabinet -2.
