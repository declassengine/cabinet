CONFIDENTIAL;oreign*PFAIrs 2-     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Arab Governments hadreacted with hostility in rejecting the conditions which the United Kingdom had laid down for receiving an Arab League Delegation which would include a ^dle Eas        rePresentative of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.    There had been fierce Press criticism throughout the Arab world and there were risks of ^tevious damage to British commercial interests.   Action was being taken to avert or&quot;eference.        contain these risks as far as possible.    An immediate problem was how best ^(82) 5Qtb       t0 aea^ with King Hassan of Morocco who, as leader of the proposed delegation, J^lusion        ^ad taken particular offence.    Consideration was being given to the possibil &apos;1lnute 2     &apos;     ltY  f sending a special emissary to Morocco,GibraltTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the newly elected Spanish P,:evious Government had announced that a proposal to open the frontier with^ erenc Gibraltar to pedestrians would be put to the first meeting of the newCc(82) \V        Spanish Cabinet.    This meant that the decision had in effect been taken. SciUsi th      Although it would help to take some of the internal pressure off the ^ute 2 nS&apos;     Spanish Government, it would not amount to a significant move and wouldmake very little difference to Gibraltar.In a short discussion it was noted that the new Spanish Government seemed to be staking out hard-line positions on a number of issues.    The Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, had for example written to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food demanding that the term &quot;British sherry&quot; should no longer be used.    This was not a new issue, but the tone of the letter was unhelpful.C J8 ^ F0REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a statement was to be madeVenti0n b e United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the time beingthe        ttlat afternoon to Parliament announcing the Government&apos;s decision not to sign the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the time because of the unacceptable nature of the deep sea mining provisions.    The Prospects for obtaining improvements to these provisions in the course of ;he next two years were not great, but the effort would be worth making.The Cabinet -Took note.ICONFIDENTIALVFAlRs 1       The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons during the following week.
CONFIDENTIALeelITIE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion,  said that there was ^ei- Us c ^t:^nU^ng Pressure on the Government to stop all steel imports, includingC(&quot;(82)nCe:        not&quot;6 UnnelPful comments from leading Government backbenchers.    The Cabinet ^&quot;0llclu ^t^1      in       tbat there was to be an announcement that day of further redundancies ^inutUS^&quot;0ns      0  th&lt;2 Br*-tish Steel Corporation as part of the plan to get the Corporationad basis and that this, and the continuing grease in steel manufacturing capacity elsewhere in the world, meant that the pressure was iikely to continue.    There would be an opportunity when the Secretary of State for Industry next dealt with steel   in   the House to underline the measures the Government had taken to protect the steel ^ustry     The Cabinet agreed that Government spokesmen    should, if necessary, refer to the ^ited Kingdom&apos;s separate contacts with the United States immediately prior to the conclusion of the Community&apos;s agreement witlCONFIDENTIALImmunityATFaiRs 3*      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at themeeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 29 November there had been no further negotiations on a Common Fisheries Policy.    Nine member  nim0n states had, however, reaffirmed their agreement to the package agreed on^sheries ^ November.    It was noteworthy that for the first time Denmark had not^ Hcy said that the proposals were unacceptable but had merely asked for moretime.    He had subsequently spoken to the Fisheries Ministers of France, ^vious Germany, the Netherlands and Ireland, who had all agreed that the subject&quot;eference.        must be discussed at the European Council, and the Germans had pressed the CC^2) Point particularly strongly in this week&apos;s meeting of the Committee ofM?nclusi0n        Permanent Representatives in Brussels.    The pressure was therefore clearly lHute 3     &apos;     0n Denmark and he was hopeful that the Danish Prime Minister would announce his acceptance of the package, if not at the European Council then before the expiry of the present arrangements at the end of the year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion,  said that this subject should be discussed further at the meeting being held later in the day to prepare for the European Council.    It was uncertain whether Denmark would be prepared to accept the proposals in the Council, and it was therefore important that the United Kingdom&apos;s objective for the meeting should be realistically directed towards pressing for an agreement and, if that failed, towards preparing the ground for national measures.J^ciai UCy THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the Ministerial meeting of thep    _ General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  in Geneva had produced atefV^ Us lengthy and somewhat confused declaration.    It did, however, contain aCCference:        number of satisfactory features for the United Kingdom:    it reaffirmed the C0    ^ 50th      COimiitment to a liberal trading system;    it preserved our right to take Hi     sions       Safeguard action;    and there were to be studies of trade in services and 1ute 3     &apos;     between developed and undeveloped countries which would take account of the special position of the newly industrialised countries.    The area of greatest difficulty had proved to be the proposed study of agricultural trade issues, and this presented the biggest dangers for the future, since there were threats that the United States would take violently disruptive action.    It Was, however, doubtful whether the United States Congress would vote the necessary funds.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet noted the generally satisfactory outcome of the meeting and congratulated the Minister for Trade, who had led the United Kingdom delegation.
CONFIDENTIALrncii *7ir nmen Decembert)THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT reported that the Council of Ministers (Environment) on 3 December would discuss a proposed regulation to ban the import of products from young harp and hooded seals on trade and moral grounds.    It was difficult to predict how discussion would proceed, but there was considerable public and Parliamentary concern on the subject and it was therefore important that the United Kingdom should not be held responsible for any breakdown.    He had put to colleagues the line he proposed the United Kingdom should take;    in his view we should be ready to propose on conservation grounds a ban on the import of hooded seal products and further research to see if there were better methods of culling.    If the meeting ended in disarray, the United Kingdom should say that we proposed to introduce a voluntary moratorium by the United Kingdom industry on trade in harp seal products.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the proposed line for the meeting needed careful examination in view of the possible repercussions with Canada where the trade in seal products was the main support for Canadian Indians.The Cabinet -Took note.AptLAND A.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he hadAlRs addressed the Northern Ireland Assembly earlier in the week.    His speech0n security, which had made no concessions to demands for more drastic action, had nevertheless been politely received.    The Members of the j rthern Assembly appeared to be making a conscious effort to behave responsibly,^e^and and there was some hope that they would in due course settle down to usefulSembly work.    At present he would be making no special efforts to induce thej&gt; rePresentatives of the Social Democratic and Labour Party to take theirConmJ 45th The Cabinet -Mir,  Usionsl^te 2 ns&gt; Took note.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJ&apos;terngj.^F netary THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that good progress was being made inUrid discussions among the industrialised countries towards agreement to anearly enlargement in International Monetary Fund quotas.    Further progress was expected to be made at the informal meeting of the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Presidents of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Japan and Germany - the &quot;Group of Five&quot; - on 9 December, which he would be attending, and at a subsequent meeting of the &quot;Group of Ten&quot;, discussions with the developing countries would follow shortly after that. The progress that had been achieved owed much to the experience, skill and hard work of Sir Kenneth Couzens, who was leading the British contribution to these discussions at official level.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.D-      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he had now ensured that ljat &quot;* ^r Eowry, the Chairman of the Advisory, Conciliation and ArbitrationI^6* Service (ACAS), was aware that the Government would be happy forfavUStry the Water industry pay dispute to go to arbitration.    Although ACAS was:i ns     ^iaes,  it was arguable that the trade unions had in effect already sol^gQj..

Following the rise in interest rates by Barclaysy . Bank which had been validated by the monetary authorities and followed inStjUe, f the market,  the pound had subsequently risen to $1.62 and DM4.01.    TheerUng primary reasons for the pressure had probably been uncertainty about thepr   . price of oil, the reaction to the Labour Party&apos;s economic proposals, andRefVl Us speculation in the Press about the Government&apos;s commitment to firm monetaryCC(Ro\nCe:        anc^ fiscal policies.    The price of oil would next be discussed at the C     &apos; 49th      meeting of oil producing countries in Vienna on 19 December, at which Saudi Usions,     Arabia would be trying to hold the price at $34 a barrel.    The outcome of e 5 that meeting was, however, uncertain.    In public comment, Ministers shouldstress the Government&apos;s determination to maintain its essential policies and should avoid any implication that the Government were preparing to relax financial disciplines.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.
CONFIDENTIAL7.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(82) 39) reporting the conclusions of the Sub-Committee on Telecommunications Policy of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (E(TP)) on cable policy and,   in particular, on what might be said by Government spokesmen in the debate on cable policy in the House of Commons later that day.THE HOME SECRETARY said that when he spoke in the debate he intended to concentrate on broadcasting aspects.    The development of cable systems was inevitable, and it was therefore desirable that the development should take place acceptably and successfully.    Some regulation would be necessary and desirable; but he accepted the view that it would be important that develop ment should not be inhibited by unduly close regulation.    The majority of the population would not, however, receive cable services for many years; and it was necessary to safeguard public service broadcasting.    He intended to announce the following broad policy decisions in the debate -a. that the Government for the most part accepted the recommendations in the Report of the Inquiry into Cable Expansion and Broadcasting Policy under the chairmanship of Lord Hunt of Tanworth,  including certain safeguards for public service broadcasting, although some aspects would need further consideration;b. that a new Statutory cable authority, other than the Independent Broadcasting Authority, would need to be established to award franchises and exercise oversight over programmes and other services, with a light regulatory hand;c      that, although legislation would not be feasible within the current Session of Parliament, a White Paper would be issued in the early part of next year setting out proposals for legislation; this White Paper would take into account the recommendations of the Technical Working Group on Cable Standards established by the Department of Industry;ld.      that the Government would welcome the views of Parliament on the steps which might be taken in advance of legislation, including the setting up of an Advisory Committee as a shadow cable authority; if Parliament reacted favourably, a proposal to this effect might be included in the White Paper for subsequent endorsement by Parliament.The proposal for action in advance of legislation might give rise to some contention.    It would entail the use by himself and the Secretary of State for Industry of existing statutory powers to licence some new systems.    If this course were to be adopted,  it would be important that it should have the approval of Parliament.    It would be undesirable for Ministers to do this without independent advice and expertise from an outside body; but some difficulty might be seen about entrusting such a task to an outside body, even on an advisory basis,  in advance of legislation.    He would accordingly put the proposition in suitably tentative terms.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOn other matters, he would avoid expressing a definite view.    He would draw attention to the difficulties of maintaining standards of taste and decency without imposing an unduly restrictive regulatory^regime; in tins context he would express scepticism about the suggestion in the Hunt Report for installing locking devices which were intended to prevent children from viewing adult material without parental consent.    He would leave open the question of &apos;pay per view&apos;: the British Broadcasting Corporation was strongly opposed to this,  and it was important to say nothing which might prejudice the willingness of the Corporation to join in direct broadcasting by satellite, on which a decision was due shortly.    It would in any event be necessary to ensure that cable companies could not acquire exclusive rights to televise major national events.    It was not necessary at this stage to reach decisions on the difficult questions of restrictions on the amount of programme material from outside the European Community which^ could be used by cable broadcasters; and whether there should be any limit on advertising by cable broadcasters.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that it was necessary to decide the relation between cable systems and other telecommunications networks. British Telecom (BT) and the Mercury consortium had asked to be given &apos;common carrier status&apos; - in effect, a monopoly over the provision of cable systems, although not over programme material.    This was not acceptable.    It would be right, however, to give BT and Mercury exclusive rights to provide links between areas and to provide voice telephony. BT and Mercury should also be free to compete for the roles of subcontractor, cable provider or, in association with others, cable operator. The choice of cable network, design, and so on should be left primarily to the market; but ducts for new systems should be required to be suitable for eventual installation of  &apos;switched-star&apos;  systems; and some incentives, particularly longer licence periods,  should be granted for the installation of more advanced systems.    The report of the Technical Working Group^ on Cable Standards under Dr Eden&apos;s chairmanship, which was expected in March, would also be important to potential investors.In discussion, the following main points were made -a. There would be a difficult balance to be struck between avoiding unduly restrictive regulation and maintaining proper standards of taste and decency in the material broadcast by cable. It was arguable that the existing television channels did not pay sufficient regard to those standards, and that changes should be made in current and future regulatory regimes to deal with this. The Government&apos;s proposal for a new statutory authority should, however, provide reassurance.    It might also be necessary to clarify the law on obscenity, but it would not be easy to secure Parliamentary approval for new legislation in this field.b. It was highly desirable to keep up the momentum of development of cable systems; this was a strong argument in favour of licensing new systems under existing statutory powers before the creation of new regulatory machinery.    On the other hand, Parliament might be unwilling to accept that Ministers should,  in effect, have direct control of part of the broadcasting media.    Moreover,^such direct control would expose Ministers to questioning in Parliament about6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe details of individual programmes.    Although the Opposition was likely to criticise much of what the Government would propose,  it was possible that the issue of a White Paper on the lines suggested in discussion would allow some measure of agreement between the political parties to emerge.    It was desirable to find and demonstrate as much common ground as possible between the main political parties: this would give greater confidence to prospective investors in cable systems.c.      Though the spread of cable systems would be gradual, and some parts of the population were unlikely to have access to them for many years, many new job opportunities would be provided by cable systems, and the services other than broadcasting which they would offer.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet endorsed the recommendations of E(TP), as described in C(82) 39, and agreed that Government spokesmen in the debate later that day should speak on the lines indicated by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Industry.    She would consider what arrangements should be made for resolving the issues which E(TP) had left undecided, and for preparing the White Paper on cable systems which it was intended to issue in the first few months of 1983.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office 2 December 19827CONFIDENTIAL
