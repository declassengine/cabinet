1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that the 1987/88 Session, which had ended

earlier that day, had been unusually full.    A large number of major

Bills had been passed which would have a major impact on the future of

^the nation.    It had been right for the Government to introduce its major

/Bilis on education, housing and the community charge at the start of the

-(^resent Parliament, and the task now was to press on with their .

^mjfteraentat ion.    The Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Leaders of

X^lyi^Wiouses, the Whips and the Ministers responsible for Bills on the

s/jJrceV^fu 1 delivery of the Government&apos;s legislative programme.

^J} ?Cabinet -

Wa^m1^&gt;endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks.

PARLIAMENTARY

AFFAIRS

2.      The Lord P/^s-vdent of the Council informed the Cabinet that, while

the ar rangeraenoa^oVthe debate on the Address from Tuesday

22 November to Tu^^daY\29 November were likely to follow a similar

pattern to previou^-yj^RS, the subjects chosen by the Opposition for

debate would not be  otwjk until the Eve of Session.

3.      THE SECRETARY OF STAT^-TOp^EMPLOYMENT said that the High Court had

the previous Friday unanimou^Vv\^he Id the Government&apos;s judicial review

application against Liverpoor&gt;^CL^7 Council&apos; s withdrawal of grant and

premises from voluntary agenc i^sy^irfr. employer s who had participated in

the Employment Training Scheme, (^ular^ng costs against the council.

This effective use of judicial rey^wjpv the Government should be of

assistance not only in the immediata^e^ont^ext of Liverpool, but also in

serving as a warning to other councrCs^r^rich might have been

contemplating similar action.

C(88) 34.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that th^s^radic industrial

action by nursing staff aggrieved by the gradiVfas Vh-ich they had been

awarded was continuing, although its extent had rra^njareatly exaggerated

in some sections of the media.    The current patteig^gpG) that as soon as

a dispute in one hospital had been settled, a fresh^a^Vp^te broke out

elsewhere.    The industrial action, which was being wb^iS ed\up by local

officers of the Confederation of Health Service Employ^e^YhOHSE) and

the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE), mostly tooK/J&amp;te form of

working to grade rather than strike action.    COHSE and fitWrTwMce not

coming well out of their actions, and he and the Minister^S^fjXalth had

repeatedly made clear that the proper course for nursing sta^Pf^wgrieved

about their gradings was to pursue the matter through the app^a^*/

mechanism which had been agreed with the trades unions.    The Row/Vi

College of Nurses had urged its members not to take industrial accLrfjX


and had intervened effectively in securing the return to normal work of

its members who had taken action at Birmingham Children&apos;s Hospital, but

&gt;   the Royal College had shown an ambivalent attitude by simultaneously

 vvasserting that the nurses did have a genuine grievance.    It was clear

y/that many nursing staff indeed felt that they had legitimate cause for

,/jratoplaint, but that was the inevitable outcome of any major

Oi ive^s^ructuring of pay arrangements.    The new grading structure had been

^ggf&amp;eA with the trades unions and it was always envisaged that

ir/fytfi&amp;ual pay increases would range fairly widely.    His department&apos;s

ass&amp;^mwit was that local management had in general been very

s\ic&lt;&amp;sm&amp;Y in awarding the new gradings, though some errors, which the

appea^ -l5^hanism was designed to correct, were bound to have occurred.

It was^^&amp;ejrtial that local management should stand firm on disputed

gr adings^^mce any failure to do so would encourage the rapid spread of

industrial^action and would undermine the appeals procedure, and nurses

were being warned that they would be disciplined if they failed to work

normally.    Industrial action, which, on the experience of previous

years, was probaKfyNintended in part to influence the outcome of the

nurses pay reviek booy&apos;s recommendations which were due in the following

January for the rreVjP~p[ky round, would probably continue for some time.

However, he was no (La*a*e of any significant damage to patient services

which had occurred as^af/result of the current dispute and at Birmingham

Children&apos;s Hospital, fcc*J/ *ample, the turning away of a single patient

had been sufficient tcr^J*^^ the action there to a close.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR Ef^^xbaid that the National Union of

Mineworkers&apos;  (NUM) delegate corffeyr^Hpe had decided the previous week to

ballot their members on a possibj^&apos;ovp&apos;rtime ban.    The position had been

slightly complicated by the emergen^IrVf a candidate for the post of

General Secretary to the Union of Dem^ratic Mineworkers  (UDM) who was

standing against the present General ^gS^Vtary, Mr Roy Lynk, on a

platform of support for the reuniting dyt)&amp; UDM and the NUM. British

Coal had made clear that their response^o any overtime ban would be to

carry out within the following 12 months^vhe programme of pit closures

which it was currently planned to implement over the following few

years, at a possible loss of up to 20 pits and up to 20,000 jobs. Coal

stocks were extremely high and rising and the D^c^vof oil was currently

very favourable. \S-\5^-v

4.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, as announced by

the Prime Minister the previous evening, the President of the Soviet

Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, would be visiting the United Kingdom from

\\12 to 14 December.    This would follow visits to New York, where he was

Jp&lt;*&amp; to address the United Nations General Assembly, on 7 and 8 December

s&amp;fa to Cuba from 9 to 11 December.    Mr Gorbachev would be accompanied by

^tjiw^Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, and by the Chairman

vrJhfo Central Committee Commission on Foreign Relations, Mr Aleksandr

Yajt&lt;$vL V.    It was possible that the Soviet Defence Minister, Marshal

Dim^Wj^zov, or the Soviet Chief of Staff, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev,

would^i^gJbe in the party.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary

would ^Ja^tyseparate talks with Mr Shevardnadze, and the Secretary of

State fc*/D   ence with any Soviet defence visitor.    Mrs Gorbachev would

also be coping.    This development gave the lie to reports that the

United Kingdom&apos;s relations with the Soviet Union lacked substance and

was an important recognition by Mr Gorbachev of the United Kingdom&apos;s

position in East-Jjgst relations.    Care would be needed to avoid

appearing to uparSkgyv France or the Federal Republic of Germany: the

Federal Chancellor        Helmut Kohl, had only recently visited Moscow,

and the French Pre^s^fSent, Monsieur Francois Mitterrand, was to do so

shortly.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAmKlSEfcRETARY said that Western European Union

(WEU) Foreign and Defence M*Kfr r&amp;rs had met in London the previous day.

The signature had taken place^^K^wie Protocol of Accession by Portugal

and Spain.    The accession nego^a*j yons had been concluded sooner than

expected.    Both countries had swa^^bed to all aspects of the WEU.

There had also been a preliminar &apos;TorASsderation of the application by

Turkey to join the WEU; this would^frav^Wio be handled carefully and no

encouragement should be given to the^we^that early progress would be

made but special consultative arrange, S|^f5 could be considered. The

occasion had provided a useful opportun^^ior Ministers to discuss how

best to enlist public support for defenc&amp;^expenditure and for current

arms control policies. ^

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that thep= had been a warm

welcome for the success of the joint mine-clea/arrTcVN operation in the

Gulf, with which all WEU members had been assoo^tM^this included a

financial contribution from Luxembourg and the reAffplbWment of Federal

German warships to the Mediterranean to make up fo^ppe^absence in the

Gulf of units of other WEU navies.    It was clear f raJjir^Lgpcussion of the

modernisation of Western nuclear forces and the means^o^^immanding

public support for this,  that certain members were insvfl^c^ently robust

in their attitude.

In discussion, it was noted that it would be important to hZs&amp;p&lt;1&amp;$&amp;e

those who were unenthusiast ic about nuclear modernisation tov^e^^it as

an essential element in the West&apos;s overall defence and arras cwJ^tA

strategy.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that some limited advances

Vvhad been achieved at the meeting of the Palestine National Council in

&gt;7AJ.giers from 12-15 November:  there had been acceptance of United

/^(Wtions Security Council Resolution 242 and implicit recognition.of

,\^vs^rfcel.    There had also been some move towards the renunciation of

^yfyzpce, but this had been outweighed by the lionising of Mr Khaled

ApjfelxNasser, the son of the former Egyptian President, who was wanted

by t^JIe^wgyptian Government for the murder of Israeli and United States

diplomas.    It would be difficult to persuade the Palestinians to adopt

a mon^- 5 hcoming attitude towards the Middle East peace process.

;C(88) 34.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister of

Israel, Mr Yitzhak-Shamir, had negotiated a provisional coalition

agreement betweep h4/s Likud Party and the religious parties.    This boded

ill for the prospT5c^rs&quot;Vfor an international conference on the

Arab/Israel dispuryA^Vx*v would be important to persuade the incoming

United States Adminsi^yaVion to apply pressure on the new Israeli

Government to accept a/4w rblement based on land for peace.

Pakistan

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHX^^ffARY said that elections were to be

held the following day in Pak^tajOfor the National Assembly. The

run-up to the elections had bee^ryrX&lt;&amp;onably trouble-free, although the

leader of the Pakistan People&apos;s ^ ^t^\ppp), Miss Benazir Bhutto, had

complained, probably with good rea^n^^iat the Government&apos;s decision,

which had been upheld by the Supreme&lt;^k*uj , that voters must have

identity cards would discriminate againSjC&apos;her supporters.    The elections

could result in a dead heat between thff^P^and the Pakistan Muslim

League, which was led by the former PrimVMinister, Mr Mohammad Khan

Junejo.    There was a danger that the losi g party might allege electoral

malpractice; the army remained in the wings and its eventual

intervention could not be ruled out.    Given Pakistan&apos;s economic,

political and strategic constraints,  it was uny^Reyy that the election

would result in any substantive change in poliW^.^ _

The Cabinet - VT^O

Took note. t/^^

pie Queen&apos;s

speech on the

Opening of

Parliament

5.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Preside^\^Xhe

Council (C(88) 15) to which was attached a draft of The QueenXv$fi ech

on the Opening of the 1988-89 Session of Parliament. ^//^&gt;


THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the draft speech had been

drawn up in the usual way by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation

Committee (QL) and was based on the legislative programme that had been

vprovisionally approved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 10 March

/J^CC(88) 9.5).    Since that time the Broadcasting Bill and the Housing

&quot;&apos;^(Scotland) Bill had been withdrawn from the 1988-89 programme, and Bills

.^on/the admission of supporters to football grounds and on the payment of

V^WOJipntrol charges in European Currency Units were proposed to be added

to^rtvv In the light of the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion it was also now

prop^ye^ to expand the Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Bill so as

to mak^provision for candidates at local elections in Northern Ireland

to mak &lt;a^eclaration against terrorism.    QL also proposed that a final

decisumyon/whether the Representation of the People Bill could be

accommoaar^e&apos;d in the 1988-89 session should be deferred until th.2 New

Year.    In^addition to the customary material, and to the references to

major Bills, the draft Speech included general paragraphs on the

environment, education and the National Health Service.    He believed

that it was righ^bo emphasise in this way the importance which the

Government attaKmecvto those matters.    When the Cabinet had

provisionally app^&lt;5yw\ the 1988-89 legislative programme they had agreed

that it was an exa^4p_MAiially heavy one, at the limit of what could be

managed.    The propgraiMK had grown no easier since then, and it would be

essential that colleaaxH^^should exercise close oversight over the

timely preparation of^tJ^Oi^lls for which they were responsible and do

all they could to avoid a^^2vy burden of subsequent Government

amendments.    The 1987-88 vp&amp;Vsn had demonstrated the importance of

making an early start with^tb /j*ajor Bills, and it would be vital to

ensure that as many main Bil&gt;^a ^poss ible were taken to Second Reading

before Christmas, despite theVsVg^on&apos;s unusually late start. The

pressures for time on the floo^tW/tJae House of Commons in the opening

weeks of the forthcoming session you c\ be unusually great.

In discussion, the following ma^Kpoints were made -

a. The Children Bill, which was aefift^ introduced

in the House of Lords, was a very ^anportant and wide-

ranging social policy measure that jjrovided the main

element of this kind in the legislative programme for the

forthcoming session.    While the Bill should be generally

welcome to all shades of political opinionV^\ raised

a number of difficult issues that both HowesVapuld

undoubtedly want to discuss in depth. y^y)

b. The Government could expect criticism for gpyAacluding

a Bill on the alleviation of human infertility, /Mv^ftplement

the Warnock Committee&apos;s report.    The limits of wr^KVwajs possible

were rapidly being pushed back in this area of sciene^/sand

until the Government introduced its own legislation^fH re\ was

a risk of a Private Member&apos;s Bill seeking to control^h^vN

situation.    It was very desirable that everything shoul^^oe^Odone

to prepare the path for a Government Bill in the 1989-90^/^^ion.


c. Two Bills for which early Royal Assent was essential were

the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Bill and

&gt; the Elected Authorities (Northern Ireland) Bill.    Both these

^        measures would prove controversial in Parliament.

d. Some drafting changes to the Speech were agreed.

^Pm/pfilME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet had

apTrpOv&amp;d the changes to the provisional legislative programme reported

in Cj&amp;Ssb15 and had approved the draft Speech attached to that paper,

subjecfc^ro various points agreed in discussion.    The forthcoming

sessrwfy^wbrogramme was exceptionally heavy, and it would not have been

practicai^e^o include legislation to implement the Warnock Committee&apos;s

report a^Kgside the very important Children Bill.    The time for

legislation on the Warnock Report would have to come, however, and

careful thought should be given to the best way of isolating and

handling the contentious issues concerning embryology research. The

session just conurj^ted had shown the importance of making an early start

with the main Bllls^ and this would be no less important  in the

forthcoming Sess&gt;3Q^^Solleagues in charge of Bills should co-operate

with the Lord ?res\MejxUyof the Council in ensuring that the legislative

programme made as mxiptfafcogress as possible before Christmas.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with ^i^cwal, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the d i s sxsjJTton.

2. Approved the changesVto^fcfte provisional legislative

programme set out in C(8oj$p//\

3. Subject to the changes agn^dvin discussion, approved

the draft Speech attached to C^8^K15.

4. Instructed the Secretary of the/Cabinet to prepare a

final revision of the draft Speec Betaking into account these

changes, for the Prime Minister to^ybmit to The Queen.
