S&gt;h1}hOME SECRETARY said that the debate on the Second Reading of the

^ajy^Xty Service Bill would take place later that day and the debate on

t\i S^pond Reading of the Official Secrets Bill would take place on the

folf^w^M Wednesday.    A couple of Government backbenchers in the House

of CcHjJarorj^  together with some sections of the media, had come out

again&lt;^^re Bills.    While they were unlikely to change their stance,

there wX^&lt;J^:hing to suggest that they would exercise much influence

over otrre^Government backbenchers.    On the other hand, a number of

GovernmenV backbenchers would support the Government during the debates

on the Bills.    The Opposition Spokesman on Home Affairs, Mr Hattersley,

had indicated on  levision on the day of the Security Service Bill&apos;s

publication tha^Tfyk Opposition would not vote against the Bill.

However, as a n^s^jjt of the divisions in the Labour Party over the

Second Reading ofYtlieVPrevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions)

Bill,  the Oppositi&lt;j ^ iro now decided to vote against the Second Reading

of the Security Seryj^a/^11 on the pretext that it failed to make

provision for oversig/ ^J&gt;2{Na committee of Privy Councillors. The

Opposition would also ^bAVeainst the Second Reading of the Official

Secrets Bill. &lt;&lt;&gt;^\

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing^ra^Nbrief discussion,  said that the

position now taken by the Opri^S&amp;bJon on the Security Service and

Official Secrets Bills would^rcpfelftly be helpful to the Government in

carrying both measures. ^/^^^V

Serious Train

Accident at

Clapham

Junction

2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the latest

information was that 33 people had died and. 13/pp&quot;evVple had been injured,

of whom 27 had suffered major injuries, as a r\asulV_of the very serious

train accident which had occurred 300 yards west^yf&apos;Oinapham Junction

Station on the previous Monday.    The track had no^-b  *&lt;Scleared and rail

services were returning to normal.    Following consu^^nwi with the Lord

Chancellor, he had decided to appoint Mr Anthony Hidde4 ra\to chair an

independent inquiry into matters relating to the accxa rt&amp;.sujd he hoped

to make an announcement to that effect later that day.    Ite^pepected to

be able to announce within the following few days the nam^v&apos;ojN the

assessors who would assist Mr Hidden and the date of the f^jf^^tVearing.

The Opposition could be expected to allege that the terms ofr^par^rence

of the inquiry were too narrow:  this was entirely without foo^^^^^n.


The fact was that, as was customary with inquiries into railway

accidents, the inquiry would be held under the provisions of the

Regulation of Railways Act 1871 which would give Mr Hidden discretion to

&apos;Ncall for any evidence which might be relevant.   The role of the inquiry,

J^which would be held in public would be to establish the facts of the

v^^cident and to make recommendations.    Mr Hidden had confirmed to him

Vw&amp;t he would seek to complete the task as soon as reasonably

Vj^v^y c icable.

THZ/&apos;sa|*ETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that staff and

pup^HT^J^ Emmanuel School had been among the first people on the scene

of .tb/^  fiident.    They had reacted very bravely, pulling some of the

injur 3^J&gt;&amp;ssengers out of the wreckage.    They had been faced with some

very diw^^sing scenes and, at the request of the headmaster, his

Depar tmefyC had arranged for counselling to be made available to those

who mightVequire it.

THE PRIME MINISTER^said that the Cabinet would wish to place on record

their condolenc^efpr those who had been bereaved or injured in this

very serious ac^idew^v and their appreciation of the efforts of the

emergency services^rTJnere were already signs of a search for

scapegoats, and irV^jgs^ftaportant that the inquiry should be completed as

quickly as was comme&lt; ^nraAe with a thorough investigation.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMgSff^jid that the unemployment figures

for November would be published late^^naZ day.   The seasonally adjusted

total had fallen by almost 50,000 to^^^M million, which was a larger

reduction than most commentators had ar^^^ated.    This was the twenty

eighth consecutive monthly reduction an^rjjnemployment, which now stood

at the lowest figure since April 1981, hvl fallen by almost 500,000

since November 1987, by around 750,000 since the General Election and by

over 1 million since July 1986.    Long-term unempljovment was falling even

faster than unemployment generally.    The unempfraymaVit rate had fallen to

7.5 per cent in the previous month compared wi -9J2-^per cent in

November 1987 and was now substantially below tha^oTjjnany other

European countries including France, Belgium and VjjeOjfe^herlands. Every

part of the country had benefited, with the largest^aawj^ions having

occurred in the West Midlands, the North West and Wal/^^Xt was

especially encouraging that the number of unfilled vac^a^Ae^ was

standing up well, with 245,000 vacancies at job centres ap&lt;Jx n estimated

700,000 vacancies in the economy as a whole.    In Greater Tya*ragV there

were at least 140,000 job vacancies, of which about one-thi^dv^hild be

filled by people with no previous training, compared with 25^ w)l&amp;

unemployed people.   Those unemployed people who were in need yf^rAining

were able to take advantage of the Employment Training Programme&apos;yjttfjteh,


as he had reported to the Cabinet at their previous meeting

(CC(88) 38.2), had got off to a very good start.

3.     ^H^S&amp;REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the scale of the

disas tely^u&gt;*ed by the earthquake in Armenia was seen to be growing.

The Sovr&amp;^authorities had initially been so overwhelmed that

co-ordination of relief efforts on the ground had been almost

non-existent.    They were now taking steps to improve matters.    The rapid

annoucement of the Government&apos;s immediate  5 million emergency aid had

been very well rgrpKved both in the United Kingdom and in the Soviet

Union.    It was ppobAply the largest donor contribution announced so far.

Very close links^2^ttf3teen established between the disaster unit in the

Overseas Developmet/tAramlnistration and the Soviet Embassy in London, as

also between the BrrtjKuy Embassy in Moscow and the Soviet authorities

there.    The response^DApjj^from the Government and the British public had

undoubtedly done much V^^VM^ngthen Anglo-Soviet relations.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHWQRKARY said that the leader of the

Palestine Liberation Organisaci^jw/RLO), Mr Yasser Arafat, had in his

press conference on 14 December /e^lfct met the three long-standing

conditions for Ministerial contact the PLO.    This followed progress

behind-the-scenes through the goo&lt;N&quot;of ^es of Sweden during the

preceding week.    Similar progress hM^bgfifc registered at the recent

meeting between the Minister of State7yi^eJ.gn and Commonwealth Office

(Mr Waldegrave) and the PLO spokesman,vM^^assam Abu Sharif.    The United

Kingdom had brought strong pressure to oAav on 14 December in Geneva to

push Mr Arafat in his press conference to go beyond what he had said in

his speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in Geneva,

which had contained elements of playing to the  &lt;rblic gallery. Bringing

the PLO to this point publicly was an importanc/sutcess for the

Government&apos;s line and for the United States Seo&lt;Bjt J3Nof State,

Mr George Shultz, personally.    The latter had tolra^hijnj that he saw the

behind-the-scenes contacts in Sweden as opening up*-ajJ^l#.portant

opportunity.    Mr Shultz had been willing to take any^d^i^Xc i sm from

Israel that such a break-through with Mr Arafat mightv #6tttl, just as he

had earlier been ready to take criticism from other quarc r^about his

refusal to allow Mr Arafat to enter the United States to^H^Xss the

United Nations at New York.    The way had now been opened \&amp;))

participation in the negotiating process by the PLO.    The rrex^Msk

would be to extract a constructive response from Israel. vCv/S

Mr Yitzhak Shamir was the most intransigent of Israeli politiMLkasr on

this question.    But it seemed likely that the new Israeli govern^e^rt^y^


would be a coalition between the Israeli Labour Party and Likud, and

this was probably the most hopeful available basis for further progress

from Israel.

 vvln a brief discussion,  it was noted that the rapid evolution of events

^//since the very negative American attitude after the publication of the

^&quot;PWlestine National Council&apos;s communique had been remarkable.    It seemed

\^Twi)piv Mr Shultz had been eager to maintain efforts for progress on major

^^^rf/raational issues right up to the last moment of the present

Af/w^rffXtration and thereby to open the way for President Bush&apos;s

Aami*r ?^ration to get off to a flying start.    It was odd that although

Mr AraJ^c had apparently obtained authority during the preceding weekend

f rom ^Jwj^S^ecutive committee of the PLO to accept the formulation

negotiayyn&apos;vjth the Americans via Sweden, he had nevertheless not made

full usey^r^:his during his speech to UNGA but had preferred to

vacillate\ The obvious danger now was that the opponents of Mr Arafat

would seek to provoke some major terrorist incident thereby undermining

the effect of Mr Arafat&apos;s public renunciation of terrorism.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMfl^E^TH SECRETARY said that the Ministerial meeting

of the North Atlantic p&lt;j cil in Brussels on 8 and 9 December had

concentrated on the mAawjfre^or the forthcoming negotiations on

stability of conventionalNEa ces.    Following the speech by

President Gorbachev on 7 ^fefrgtsber at the United Nations General

Assembly,  the statement is^tfjedyon 8 December by Foreign Ministers of the

North Atlantic Alliance on co^^Vtional arms control had struck a good

balance.    It had proposed an\Xvw^kil limit on the total holdings of key

armaments in Europe and in par^^fAajc a reduction of tanks by some 50

per cent.    The statement had als/^e&apos;tfognised the reductions announced by

the Soviet Union as a modest step i^t^e right direction.    Given the

great preponderance of Soviet conv%nt,,i j al forces, President Gorbachev

had considerable room for manouevre&lt;  ^S^tures of this kind. This

needed to be brought out clearly in Weyysr^public presentation. The

Foreign Ministers had also committed tTrerf^elves to completing before the

next Ministerial meeting of the North AftAantic Council their

comprehensive concept of arms control ana disarmament, the purpose of

which would be to show how the various arms control agenda items could

be pursued consistently with the need for neces&gt;OT  modernisation of

some nuclear forces.    It would be important toj/susijain pressure on other

North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) partXfejts^IJxsecure timely

modernisation of such forces.    The United States faacl/Jeen more

restrained than expected at the recent meeting iTV^S&amp;j&amp;s&amp;ls.   This was

perhaps evidence of the normal hiatus in the transivfaiw&amp;riod between

two Administrations. v/VVv

In a brief discussion,  it was noted that the West was we^^^^ced to

retain the high moral grounds.    President Gorbachev had byrtiipjl

December speech in effect recognised the disparity of forces^rfv^avour

of the Warsaw Pact.    The publication by NATO a few days befcrc\^r^.

speech of comprehensive figures on the conventional force bala^Kjaf/


between East and West had provided a timely picture of the ground rules

which would have to govern the negotiations.    The West needed to

maintain pressure on the Warsaw Pact to reduce their forces to parity

 n with the West and to adopt a genuinely defensive posture.    It needed to

jjjbe pointed out that President Gorbachev&apos;s reductions offer of 7 December

&gt;^Nffected only some 10 per cent of the totality of Soviet conventional

v^Mces.    Even this had been secured only with difficulty, to judge from

**\uj^7resignation of his former supporter and Chief of the Soviet General

Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev.    Those who criticised the Government&apos;s

c^rfti^ae attitude toward President Gorbachev&apos;s recent speech were

son^riA the same people who asked whether President Gorbachev would

survi^^thereby implicitly recognising the need for caution. Even

after&lt;&amp;(Wrecently announced reductions the Warsaw Pact would still have

some 40^j#$W^:anks whereas the West was proposing parity for each side at

current Mm) levels of 20,000.

ibet

THE FOREIGN ANuXDM^JQNWEALTH SECRETARY said that on 10 December Chinese

police in Lhasa hao^Tired on Tibetan demonstrators.    The facts were not

clear but it seem4^- p &lt;S at least two Tibetan monks had been killed. A

Dutch girl had been ^WebXly wounded but the Netherlands Embassy in

Peking&gt; were not convia&lt;p jJ^fchat she had been only a bystander as she

claimed.    The Tibetan ^nwrwtration appeared to have been planned but

the Chinese police had handed it badly and certainly with less skill

than recent Soviet react 5wiGr&apos;&apos;tM demonstrations in some of the Republics

of the Soviet Union.    The IS^raprftnent&apos; s policy should be to avoid being

drawn into controversial dis^s^b^n on the state of Tibet, while

retaining the freedom to crir^CL^/clear cases of human rights

violations, whether in Tibet ov/yl?&amp;*he.re in China.    The prospects of

possible future talks between th^^ua^ayi Lama and the Chinese Government

were something which the Governmer^^ro^ld welcome.

CC(88) 34.3

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Ministerial

meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference on 14 December had provided the

opportunity to express further concern about the case of the former

Catholic priest, Father Patrick Ryan, whose exJ&apos;paTMvtion the Government

had sought.    The Irish side at the talks led bUjhwuTanaiste, Mr Brian

Lenihan, and the Irish Minister of Justice, Mr G M*y~Yjollins, had been

acutely embarrassed by recent events and had acce^tA^without bridling

his candid reproof of the Irish Government&apos;s decisi^^^The Irish were

now looking for other ways in which to co-operate wiLn^fcjKKUnitsd

Kingdom.    The meeting with the new Commissioner of thar^8wc^ had been

positive and constructive.    It would be necessary for the,  yernment to

state fairly and squarely that the Irish Attorney GeneraV^^reteponse in

this case had been very unsatisfactory.    It was not defens^W^^C^at tne

Irish authorities should be able to hold someone subject to /ejjw^dition

proceedings for only three days whereas it took the Irish Atn^rM^w


General two weeks to come to a decision whether or not to back an

extradition warrant.    Invoking categorical assurances given by the

?   Taoiseach, Mr Charles Haughey,  to the Irish Dail, the Government would

J\ now ask the Irish Government to review their extradition legislation.

JOAs for Father Ryan, Irish Ministers were very much hoping to be spared

^&gt;Sorther embarrassment and strongly favoured a British decision to have

 r^^a^her Ryan prosecuted in Ireland in accordance with existing

v^^dfyrarterritorial jurisdiction provisions, since both the British and

tXe^?Wsh Attorney Generals had said there was a case to answer.

THE^ECjJ&amp;TARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that many people were

sugg&lt;  l iNthat events of the previous few days showed that the

Anglo^T&amp;^ri^Agreeraent was worthless and should be torn up.    On the

contraryo^i the Ministerial Conference established under the

Anglo-IriAh Agreement had not existed it would have been necessary to

invent it in order to provide the present valuable forum for blunt

speaking when required.    The Garda had made a real contribution in their

successive discoveries of arms hidden illegally in the Irish Republic.

But they seldon//if  ver managed to arrest offenders, and the Irish

remained as emoYsOiKp^tf s ever in their inhibitions about the idea of

handing over Iristf/citflzens to the United Kingdom for due legal process.

This ingrained resVfrfcj6 9e would have to be broken down.

Extra-territorial juVy^W^tion was not an alternative to extradition.

4.     THE HOME SECRETARY reported^nj^We meeting of Immigration Ministers

and the Trevi Ministerial meetingM^i Artens on 9 December.    At the Trevi

meeting there had been a general di^g^sjjjyn of extradition against the

background of the Ryan case and the TttZfaL of Greece to extradite a

suspected Arab terrorist to Italy.    De\m ^e press reports holding out

such a prospect, and the presence of twi(\15elgian Ministers, no new

Belgian proposals were forthcoming.    There was general acceptance that

there was no need to look for radical change in existing extradition

arrangements.    These were thought satisfactory i -&gt;themselves.    But a

serious effort was required to achieve their implementation.    THE HOME

SECRETARY said at the meeting of Immigration Mv^S Q 5 he thought he

detected greater understanding that action to con/i/at^Oerrorism, drug

trafficking and other serious crime would requireM3wJ^Aintenance of

checks at frontiers.    Lord Cockfield&apos;s approach on wf^^Jccasion had

been less belligerent than in the past.    In the conte&amp;*^ ^controls of

third country nationals,  illustrated by the problem ofvrl&amp;iHj.t of non-EC

nationals through Frankfurt, the Dutch had made clear tha^ftJWy too saw

a continued need to maintain internal frontiers. ^ ))

In a short discussion, the question was raised whether cont(6raP.

terrorism could be achieved through existing laws and procedure/^/

addressed to normal crimes.    Since terrorism was a crime againVt/a^v


indeterminate target, perhaps a new philosophy was required. In

response it was noted that control of terrorism had been a matter for

X   debate at successive Summit meetings.    The essential necessity was to

&lt;^\secure acceptance of the need to take up and sustain firm positions.

^JUnited Kingdom procedures dealt with terrorists under domestic criminal

^^ ^w.    The requirement was not to replace such existing systems but to

^**oJvld adequate bridges between the different legal systems of member

\yc^J*nrtries.    It was against that background that consolidating

Ta^p^^ation was now being put through the House of Commons.    This would

peWmrP^tification of the European Convention on Extradition. The

Eur^eapOConvention on the Suppression of Terrorism already provided

extrac^^Jf-ktorial jurisdiction.    This bridge building process would be

extenc?eTJC2y additional legislation on the production and taking of

evidenceC^^^which a Bill of 20 to 30 clauses might be required and

which it&gt;Sas hoped to introduce next year.

Summing up the discussion,  the Prime Minister said that,  in the

interests of gaining the co-operation of others, it was important that

the United KingiWm&quot;&gt;sViould show that it was doing all it could. In

advance of ratiVJ^nJp-fe^ie Convention on Terrorism, the United Kingdom

could observe its wro^usions.    A high priority would need to be attached

to the introductio\^335^%je legislation required for promoting mutual

legal assistance in &amp;tydj^\ matters.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASW&amp;^ftd that the Chancellor of the Exchequer

individual member states on incwr^pe^iax approximation that had taken

place since the October Council.V^ojrNthe first time he had shown some

negative on the question of zero ratxjSrej  The Chancellor of the

Exchequer had drawn attention to the^e^Ze of practical difficulties

presented by the Commission&apos;s proposal ^*jjPthe need for radical changes

to them.    He had made clear that the Go\&lt;t^nment would in no

circumstances abandon its commitments onMero rates.    There had also

been some discussion at the meeting about proposals for a tax on

savings.    The French had again sought to suggest^that there was a link

between implementation of the directive on lib^STOpation of capital

movements and implementation of such a withholVfaijz^x^x throughout the

Community.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, suppof&apos;tTeVh by colleagues

from the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Denmark had sjadj^rtear the absence

of any such link.    As was not uncommon, the Germans^M^wpt joined issue

with the French on this matter.    In a brief discus siqf ^o\as noted that

9-11 December   Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had achieved a highly successtVufefcome


to a difficult negotiation at the meeting of the Fish Council on 9-11

k     December.    Scientific advice had shown the need for a major reduction in

2&lt;s   the level of allowable catches for haddock.    The Minister had succeeded

^\in negotiating a reduction limited to 60 per cent compared with that

 ^y^p plied to others at 80 per cent.    The British share of the total quota

i^^ d increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent.    The industry had

^Ves*onded constructively to this outcome.    The Scottish Fishing

\&gt;Ji^3*8rration had issued a statement making clear their view that this was

TraWjAst deal that could have been obtained.    For its part, the

pw^ce^iiig industry had recognised the need to achieve protection of

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that tb^^ting of

the Agriculture Council which had begun on 12 December wouldN^ekdfte

again in the coming week.    Agreement had been reached on the 3$^^^


drinks directive which defined quality standards and labelling

requirements.    United Kingdom producers would benefit from this

directive in the adoption of which the Irish Minister of Agriculture had

^proved of particular assistance.    Other issues under discussion of

^/particular interest to the United Kingdom included New Zealand butter

^^od sheepmeat and further reform of the beef regime.    On the latter,

^Considerable reductions in beef support were under consideration. Loss

5.     THE MINISTER OF A^ft^&amp;j^URE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that although

the growing problem of iygpttkon of eggs by salmonella enteriditis PT4

had clearly necessitated tfre^oyblic health guidance that had been issued

on 26 August and 21 Novemb&amp;t^^4 t advice had not been given wide

publicity in the media at th^B^n)^ and the demand for eggs had not been

greatly affected.    He had thexteij c4 hoped that there would be sufficient

time to work up effective programa^Vvfor dealing with this emerging

problem before the public was seifzedj^wiith alarm.    In the event, however,

the sudden public anxiety that th^Cap^net had noted the previous week

had continued unabated, and the pos^ yu ~ as now serious.    While the

situation varied around the country fall in wholesale orders for

eggs was of the order of 25-50 per ceiqpv^tfd major retailers were

reporting a drop in egg sales of 25 percent, at a time of the year when

the demand for eggs was normally increasing.   The egg production

industry feared that sales and prices would continue to fall: the

wholesale price of eggs, which stood at 48 pence.-ger dozen in early

November, had already fallen to 31 pence per d*oz&quot;erV\ while the offer

prices for the following two weeks stood at 1 A^pe,nfrex^and 10 pence per

dozen respectively.    There was no doubt about th^Yvenj serious losses

that were now being faced by producers, many of witgnvpyeYe in a small way

of business.    The prices being offered for eggs didf^rrifyt^over the cost

of feed for the poultry flocks, and feed suppliers w^p^^^fusing credit.

In this desperate situation,  some slaughtering of stoilr^^y.already

taking place, and increasing numbers of producers would a^m^to consider

taking this action over the next few days to cut their lq^aresU In

addition, large numbers of eggs that could not be sold wer^j^&amp;H^g put

into storage.    The advertising campaign to promulgate the f^tt^^which

had been agreed at a meeting taken by the Prime Minister eame/Jin the

week, would no doubt be criticised by the egg producing induswfy^a^.


offering insufficient reassurance, but there was very little room for

manouevre on this.    While he was reasonably confident that the National

^   Farmers Union understood that their cause would not be served by their

 \being seen to press for a degree of public reassurance that the facts

})did not justify, there was a very large number of small producers who

^^re unlikely to refrain from publicising their plight.    Until the

^^^resent crisis he had discouraged the idea of any buy-in programme for

or hens, but in the present circumstances he believed that this

TJnfjl^^bave to be contemplated.   The costing of such programmes was

dWfi,AAt, because the egg production industry was in any event having a

poo^ye,^ and producers might leap at the chance of any form of

compqjjrf^ki-en.    As a rough guide, a buy-in programme for 4-5 million

dozenV^^&apos;a^week would&apos; cost about  1.5 million per week, while a buy-in

program^^^err hens, at  1 a bird, might cost about  11 million.    As for

further a^ion to control the infection, his Department was considering

the need for additional controls on feedstuffs and had been reviewing

whether the voluntary code of practice should be put on a statutory

basis. __^

THE SECRETARY Oi^T&amp;fi. FOR HEALTH said that the note he had circulated

to Cabinet collea/fes)dt the end of the previous week summarised the

Chief Medical Offr&gt;Q0S&amp;^Bssessment of the facts, and it was important

that Ministers shouKp^^iAk closely to this authoritative advice, which

was considerably less(aram^tic than some of the material being produced

by less balanced healtrV^c^s^witators.    There was no doubt that

salmonella associated wiLh^J&amp;fcfi had been increasing throughout the year,

and there was every reasonrVfoJgelieve that this increase would continue.

The attention being given C^4?reNjnatter in the media would undoubtedly

lead to a higher rate of repw&apos;cykTgincidents of food poisoning,  and the

problem would in any event becyM^more acute with the return of warmer

weather in the following year. ^We^fchief Medical Officer&apos;s advice must

remain the cornerstone of the GoWrnrfeNat1 s approach to the health

problem and,  for the time being,  t^e C&amp;^ef Medical Officer could be

expected to maintain the advice tha^i^J^ad first given on 26 A&apos;igust and

which now formed the core of the adv^RSj^eroent that would be put out the

following day.     The Chief Medical Off%cp^&amp; advice had to be

professional and impartial and if the r^tfk of food poisoning from eggs

should further increase,  then this couldMiot be disguised.    Unless an

effective eradication programme was put in hand,  the medical advice was

bound to get more gloomy.    He believed that theabatement in the

advertisement that the Government and the indu/tffyVyere tackling the

problem constituted a new commitment, and woulV^ije^w-idely seen as

offering the prospect of an effective programme m/control the

infection. v-&gt;^)

.   .  . . .

The following main points were made in discussion. Lyy^S.

a.     The egg production industry had pressed for an^ajfeevtisement

that would offer a virtually unqualified assurance tmt u was safe

to eat eggs.    Since the Chief Medical Officer&apos;s advicx^up^N.

inevitably far more cautious than that, the advertisemarf^wv)Bld not

satisfy the producers and it might even stimulate public^aoj yety

and lead to a further drop in egg consumption.    On the oX&amp;erU&amp;ad,

io


a state of widespread confusion and alarm had now been

generated,  and there was an obligation on the Government to

promulgate an unvarnished account of the true facts.    It was not

possible to answer every question and,  in particular, no valid

estimate could be made of the national rate of infection. While,

w   from a presentational point of view, it might be unfortunate that

)X the advertisement could only say that the number of recorded

^outbreaks underestimated the extent of food poisoning from

/^oJmonella,  there was no other scientifically sound comment that

Government could make.

attempt .to eradicate the infection by replacing breeding

sTM^ris*would probably need to be carried out on a very wide scale

ifCpt^dere to have any hope of success, and, even then, salmonella

wouMvremain present in the environment to present a threat of

re-intection. Other countries were facing a similar problem

although comparisons of relative extents of infection were

difficult tp make.    It might be that the infection could not be

totally errauicMted, and that the public would,  in the longer term,

have to gev3&amp;  S^o this idea, in the same way that it generally

accepted tha//shallfish carried some risk of food poisoning.

c. In Sweden V^^eJVnique for treating day-old chicks was being

developed,  and iV^a^Nsossible that this might hold out some hope

for controlling s fmviJpU.a infection.    Urgent enquiries were being

made into this, but J&amp;Vffes far too early to base any hopes on the

technique which,  in arfwjwent, might prove very expensive.

d. The Chief Veterina^OWvicer advised that it was impossible to

detect salmonella in 1iv\tag^*irds.    This together with the

impracticability of detecrlaj^^Afected eggs by random sampling,

made it difficult to see hcv^apvN/alid assurance could be given to

the public that particular eg#s une free from salmonella, or came

from a flock that was free fros^^g ^infection.    Some retailers were

nevertheless offering such assifvqtfj&amp;&apos;s.    There was a need to develop

a protocol to govern testing and ^ye^?dvice that could properly be

offered to the public.

e. Now that public anxiety about eggs had reached the present

level,  it would be impossible to contain the debate. Careful

thought would need to be given to the har/^TTste of the risks from

other animal products. \L^L

f. The Department of Health had been give

advice that

comments about salmonella infection that had b^nVnjade on behalf of

the Department did not give rise to a legally e/jOT^teable

liability. ^^o&gt;\

g. It would be exceptionally difficult to constri&gt;^K^\\

compensation scheme on sound principles, since the p^s^^ev effect

of public health anxieties on egg sales was so specula^w^^ If a

wide-scale slaughtering programme should eventually be^inp wised,

any associated compensation costs could be very high indv rV^


THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there was now a

y  deep-seated and growing public anxiety about salmonella and eggs. The

t^^abinet had agreed that it was right to issue the following day an

isement giving an authoritative statement of the facts, and it was

ial that no time should be lost in tackling the fundamental

m by a programme of action to eradicate,  or at least substantially

,  the degree of infection in poultry flocks.    The immediate

however, lay in the sudden and drastic impact that a sharply

d^demand for eggs had had on the egg production industry. While

it nfigh^^iave been reasonable to expect the industry to adjust over a

longe^P^t^jfi^scale,  it had to be accepted that the present crisis i\ad made

that coM^e^impossible.    It would not be right in these circumstances

for the^Gdyernment to stand by and see producers deprived of their

livelihoods through no fault of their own.    Despite all the difficulties

it was now necessary to devise a support scheme that might be offered to

the industry with as little delay as possible after the issue of the

Government adverjfe^^ement on the following day.    Such a support scheme

would probably pe characterised by more than a little rough justice, but

it was now impoV&lt;2&gt;a&lt;^o act very quickly.

The Cabinet -^y^i)

1. Took note, Xrpfi^Mujroval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of theMiS*u 6ion and agreed that a Government

advertisement of the^rae&amp;s of salmonella and eggs should be

issued on the f ollowitt^dajy.

2. Invited the Minist&amp;jO^Jpigriculture, Fisheries and Food,

in consultation with the^ae^Wtary of State for Wales, the

Secretary of State for NortW* *r&lt;SIreland,  the Secretary of State

for Health,  the Secretary orS^A for Scotland, the Chief

Secretary, Treasury and the J&amp;roip&amp;y General to devise a scheme to

support the egg production ind^^^y -in its present crisis, and to

report his conclusions to the Prt^^rji^iister as a matter of

urgency.
