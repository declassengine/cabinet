1.     The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons until the prorogation of the present Session on

\l5 November.

TuB/tAfaD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Leader of the

Oppos^tTCbn,  supported by most of the Labour Party Members of Parliament,

had^ab- ed an Early Day Motion calling for a reduction in the salary of

the (5 a ^Dlor of the Exchequer.    In his view, which was shared by the

House awfiyiopyties, it was clear that a motion of this kind did not have

the natu&amp;e^of a censure motion expressing lack of confidence in the

Governmeno^as a whole,  for which there was an established convention

that the Government would always find time.    The decision whether to

enable debate of the Early Day Motion was, therefore, entirely in the

Government&apos;s hanrf^jNand he saw no reason why time should be found.

THE PRIME MINISTE^/^iShming up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet

had noted with appWgyVz^that the business proposed to be taken in the

House of Commons dia^rfao include time for debate of the Early Day Motion

in the name of the Leaae^2&lt;\f the Opposition.    The Government&apos;s line

should be that if the \^(%ion wished to return to the matter, there

would be opportunities  injpj^new Session.

The Cabinet - &lt;V-^X\

1.     Endorsed the Prime T*irrt^ber&apos;s summing up of

the discussion. &lt;Si

THE PRIME MINISTER said that on the prA^ptf* Tuesday the House of

Lords had decided not to insist on its amendment to provide for free

dental examinations, and attempts to re-&apos;Qasert the amendment providing

for free optical examinations for all, which had already been overturned

in the House of Commons, and to provide such examinations free for

pensioners had been rejected by large majoritia &lt;--\\The Cabinet would

wish to congratulate the Lord Privy Seal and tnk Cwjptain of the

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that he proposed to make a

statement in the House of Commons that afternoon on the report, which

was being published as a Command Paper that day, of the investigation

Vnder Mr Desmond Fennell QC into the causes and circumstances of the

^ Lre disaster at King&apos;s Cross Underground Station on 18 November 1987.

report concluded that the fire had been started by a discarded match

Wtrwh had fallen into accumulated grease and debris on the track of the

Va&lt;jM^tor an&lt;* that the fire had accelerated up the trench of the

e&amp;e&apos;alatW until it had burst into the booking hall, causing a disaster.

The^epp^t contained very serious criticisms of the management of London

Under^^yad and London Regional Transport (LRT) and he had accordingly

given ^St^Keith Bright, Chairman of LRT and Dr Tony Ridley, Chairman of

London lQm ground, an opportunity to see advance copies of the report.

After havsfng seen the report, Sir Keith Bright, who had first offered to

resign shortly after the disaster, and Dr Ridley had tendered their

resignations which he had accepted.    Sir Neil Shields, who was already a

non-executive memb&lt;r of the LRT Board and effectively the Deputy

Chairman, had a&amp;jfeera to take on the chairmanship of LRT on an interim

basis until a pajHjaAe-fvt appointment could be made.    The Opposition&apos;s

spokesman on Trans/jrforojwas seeking to suggest that the Government bore

some of the responsjJM^pty for the fire by allegedly failing to provide

LRT and London Under^^jrp&quot; with sufficient resources. However,

Mr Fennell&apos;s report maM/Mjsar that there was no evidence that the

overall level of subsid^yyhjjah the Government had made available had

been inadequate to finance^f^essary safety measures,  and it

specifically stated that Ddv?re)jwas no evidence that the reduction in the

number of operating or mainsS^a^ce staff had contributed directly to the

disaster.    The report contaii^J^Bbe criticisms of the Railway

Inspectorate and he would be awrAjWc ing a positive response which he had

agreed with the Chairman of the H^  J and Safety Commission. The

report made 157 recommendations,Wrr^niAlly all of which he would be

accepting.    Some of those recommen&lt;Jaci#Ps na&lt;^ implications for other

departments and he was grateful to c^H3-*33ues f r their co-operation in

taking these forward.    For example, ttt&amp;Atoma Secretary intended to

introduce regulations in response to MK^P^nnell&apos;s recommendation about

fire certification. NA.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the report brought out that there had been

gross inadequacies in the management of London Underground and LRT. The

Cabinet agreed that the Transport Secretary shp/fldMnake a statement on

the report in the House of Commons that afternoitTi^^SjK he had proposed.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the preliminary hearing

of the public inquiry into the explosion on the Piper Alpha platform

v would open on the following day.    The technical investigation which he

nhad established into the explosion had already produced an interim

^ eport, and it would be completed before the main public inquiry got

finder way.   Concern about safety in the North Sea oil industry would no

^Jjdiijbt be stimulated by an incident that morning in which a helicopter

Mia^/g^ane down into the sea.   Reports on this were still coming in, but

tWy&apos;?indicated that there had been no loss of life.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that there had been some

industrial action, the extent of which had been greatly exaggerated in

some sections of the media, by nursing staff aggrieved by the grading

which they had bg n awarded as part of the regrading exercise associated

with the impleirefitaiion of the nurses&apos; pay settlement.   The action had

generally taken\^ia---f&lt;&gt;rm of working to grade as defined by local trade

union officials, vut /pis differed from the work expected of those

grades by local mao2Apwnt.    Any retreat by management on disputed

gradings would encot^aw^pthe rapid spread of industrial action. His

Department was theref4y^^^king to ensure that local management stood

firm on the matter, an^rb^apvnurs ing staff who objected to their

gradings were reminded th^fr^hey could pursue the matter through the

appeals mechanism which haroain agreed with the trades unions.

Birmingham Children&apos;s HosplfcH^^hich had a history of industrial

problems, had been worst afre^fc^a^by the action.    The intensive care

unit there had been closed to\he^Wion-emergency admissions as a result

of action in support of five si^tky&amp;nuho were aggrieved about their

gradings, out of the total of arrmnd^&amp;Q staff in that unit. The

National Union of Public Employees^was-^irery strong in that hospital and

staff there had been in the forefrojj^o^^revious disputes. Nine

members of the Royal College of NurseS^RCN) at the hospital had taken

industrial action during the current d^^Mxe but, following a private

approach from his Department, the General Secretary of the RCN, Mr

Trevor Clay, had gone on record to press them to return to work. He

hoped that the industrial action both in Birmingham and elsewhere would

rapidly come to an end once nursing staff reali*ed that none of them

would be disadvantaged as a result of the pay /sfetnlement.

3.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the election of

Mr George Bush as next President of the United States brought to the

\White House a good friend of Britain and a strong and dependable ally.

//There would be a welcome element of continuity because Mr Bush knew the

Xwckground well on issues such as Europe, the Falklands and Northern

(^rj^and.    Mr Bush would however probably come under considerable&apos;

VBw/sure from Congress on questions such as protectionism, defence

oxpy&amp;tvCshaTing and policy towards South Africa.    The appointnment of

MrJa^Je^ Baker as successor to Mr George Shultz as Secretary of State

was^alao/very good news.    It was likely that Mr Alan Greenspan would

rema w^a-8^5hairman of the Federal Reserve Board.    The position of

SecrerawfVrp&lt; Defense was likely either to remain with

Mr Fran&amp; e flucci or to go to Senator John Tower.    The transitional

period unril Mr Bush had been inaugurated as President and his new

appointees had settled down would not be a good time for British

Ministerial visits to Washington, barring exceptional circumstances.

Sensible planning^for such visits after 20 January 1989 would be needed

in order to maxfimis^ their impact&apos;and he would be grateful if the

Foreign and Comm J&gt;w *ibth Office could be given notice of colleagues&apos;

intentions so that^aj^y^c^e could be given on phasing.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA^^^sfeCRETARY said that he had visited Dublin

on 7 November to sign an a^g^edjient with the Irish Government on

delimitation of the ContineVrtriv^helf.    This was a useful and practical

step which made no change to\ xv6) ing policy on territorial waters but

provided a clear basis for pos4^bjle&gt;^uture oil exploration.    There would

be legislative implications in dn^/f/eurse during the next session of

Parliament, as already foreshadowed /\ he agreement with Ireland had

taken Denmark and Iceland by surprise^/

He had taken the opportunity of his pry&amp;ejyje in Dublin for talks with

the Tanaiste, Mr Brian Lenihan, on othe4&lt;*fatters, and had also called on

the Taoiseach, Mr Charles Haughey, who appeared to be recovering from

his recent illness.    He had pressed for renewal of the Irish legislation

on extradition; had emphasised that the review under Article 11 of the

Anglo-Irish Agreement should be a forward looki/rg^review of the

activities of the Conference rather than of thK^Cotyference itself; and

had stressed the importance of encouraging the^2w^?$N:utional parties in

Northern Ireland to get back into talks about mo^^ne^l towards

devolution.    There had been no complaints from the&quot; J^r aTi side about

recent trials of terrorists including the three terror^^* convicted at

Winchester of plotting against the Secretary of State-^rcfr^Jprthern

Ireland.    This showed the value of giving the Irish Gov e rajrj^nt prior

notice about sensitive developments, for example the Gov^irfneJit&apos; s

intention to change the law on the right to silence.    Mr S&amp;njMan had

asked that the British Government should look again at the^^^\bility

of three judge courts in Northern Ireland and he had not rejecw?jKSthis

request out of hand since a re-examination of the question in^cpl^ejkno

commitment. (j^yK

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the intimation of

possible delays in the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan an*d the

w additional deployment of more Soviet aircraft and missiles seemed to be

npart of the Soviet war of nerves designed to put pressure on Pakistan

the Afghan resistance to strike a deal with the Kabul regime. This

no doubt the negotiating task for which the Soviet Deputy Foreign

w^$7Ster&apos;       ^uliy Vorontsov, had recently been sent as Soviet

Vmyra^ador to Kabul.    His judgment nevertheless was that the Soviet

u4*&apos;f5n^ti 11 wanted to complete withdrawal by 15 February as required

unde^&apos;tJjA Geneva Agreement.    But there could be a good deal of alarms

and ax^drs-ions before then.

ri Lanka

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation in Sri

Lanka was going f^r-om bad to worse.    November 10 was scheduled to be the

last day for thsy&apos;preteentation of nomination papers for the Presidential

election in Sri Vj^anj&amp;a-*.   The Sri Lankan Government were coming under

great pressure fron/tna Marxist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) who were

threatening to calV^&gt;g^&gt;eral strike.    It was unclear whether the

President, Mr Junius&lt;!j^r ^ardene, would allow the constitutional process

to go ahead or would dtyy&amp;i* a clamp-down and the imposition of direct

rule.   The prognosis wa^ryjgru gloomy.

the Maldives

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAL^r&apos;sE^RETARY said that prompt and effective

Indian intervention on 4 NoVearraXhad restored the Government of

President Gayoom after the r&lt;a^ ^ittempt at a coup d&apos;etat.

President Gayoom was due to beVr^irnaugurated on 11 November and

Lord Glenarthur would be attendrn^K^  ceremony.

Israel

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRE^rfRY^aid that after the general

election in Israel on 1 November the  &gt;e-ry5 likely to be some weeks of

haggling before the new government emeTs&amp;ea.^. A coalition between Likud

and the religious parties and the far Mgj r was the most likely outcome.

This would make the peace process more difficult.    The attitude of the

Bush Administration would be crucial if this process was to be seriously

re-engaged.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thaVT^re had been

September with the Iranian Foreign Minister that Embajslfeies should be

re-opened in the two capitals on a reciprocal bas rs-^xTnese exchanges

had now reached a successful conclusion.    The Goverrwfe^t^&amp;ad remained

firm in resisting Iranian attempts to re-establish foXH$ f*V\t.heir

Consulate in Manchester and the Iranians had now accepredvtjro position

that while they could use their building there for tempoii^^visits by

Iranian officials from London,  it would not enjoy diplomaf^^^ymmunity.

The Government had continued to take the opportunity to makV-^t^rong

representations to Iran for the release of Mr Roger Cooper ary^Twc/\

Nicholas Nicola; and were also continuing to urge that Iran shod^Mybfing

pressure to bear for the release of British hostages in the LebajAGijtf^^




THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that under the current

British Presidency, negotiations had been successfully completed for the

admission of Spain and Portugal to the Western European Union (WELL),

% which would be formalised at the Ministerial meeting of the Council of

y\the WEU in London the following week.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that in the margins of the

\mpfi$ing of the Independent European Programme Group the previous day,

&lt;&amp;a^rOhad at last signed the Memorandum of Understanding bringing her

f4fty/^Qto the European consortium for the European Fighter Aircraft.

;ibraltar

&gt;ensions

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, referring to a misleading

article in the press, said that the pensions regime in Gibraltar was in

a state of totaJ^eTraarray.    The Gibraltar Government was not in a

position to mee^it)C__full pension obligations including some extending

to Spanish workers/y^fta himself and the Minister of State (Mrs Chalker)

had had a number o^flta^CNings with the Gibraltar Prime Minister,

Mr Joseph Bossano.   ^KWp*gotiations were likely to be long and

difficult, and the Un^&amp;rVfcingdom would have to accept some financial

liability.    He would cJ^C^Vte a note in due course.

Prime

Minister&apos; s

Visit to

Poland

THE PRIME MINISTER said that \ x^fs\t to Poland the preceding week had

been a fascinating experience. ^C^ra^al Jaruzelski had made it clear

that she would be free to followVKerA^n programme.    No obstacles had

been placed, for example,  in the w f &lt;yy\\\ev visit to Gdansk or to the

Church of the murdered Polish priest^^aJ^her Popieluszko.    She had met

the Polish Solidarity leader, Mr LeclC^J^esa, and a group of

independents.    She had been given an erVprflenis welcome by the Polish

people: 50,000 had turned out to meet h&amp;f at Gdansk.    Singing by packed

congregations in the Solidarity church aVGdansk and in the church of

Father Popieluszko,  including a rendering of the second Polish national

anthem, had been moving moments.

That it had been possible for her to witness al 1 Arnisnwas a great

advance.    She had nevertheless had to walk a tigh^QrO B^throughout the

visit in her talks with the Polish Government on th^^m^hand and with

the Solidarity organisation on the other.    Sol idar it y^v^k^nuch more than

just a trade union:  it was the focus of opposition to&lt; ft^&gt;Mayernment and

to Communism.    It was ironic that the Polish Government s^JrM be

inviting Solidarity to sit down with them at a round tabl^^rojn talks,

while declining to recognise them as a legal organistaion.xr&gt;^\

Mr Walesa himself was a very interesting and articulate manfvfeither

he nor his team of advisers seemed to have a clear idea of tn^Vvagenda

for round table talks, beyond such generalities as trying to gVy/r^\


Polish Government to accept the need for a pluralistic society, which

\   they would not be willing to do.    She had therefore pressed Mr Walesa to

v\devise a clear and precise agenda of demands which it would be hard for

^Jthe Polish Government to refuse, starting with the requirement that

l^^&amp;lidarity should be recognised as legal.    Mr Walesa had told her that

w^pVidarity was insulted by the move to close the Lenin shipyard which

\&gt;J^i regarded not as an economic, but as a political, decision.    It was

Vw^^that the new Polish Prime Minister, Mr Mieczyslaw Rakowski,

sWon&amp;lNi disliked the Solidarity leadership, and that they knew it.

...

She h d^j*i3fc found General Jaruzelski sinister; he was in fact quite easy

to ger^sfavwith.    She had told him that as a politician he could not

afford t&amp;^^gnore the groundswell of opinion which Solidarity

represented; and that rather than face strikes he would do better to

legalise Solidarity, thus providing a proper outlet for dissenting

views.    He had made the point, which churchmen had confirmed to her

separately, that/tjrcre were extremist groups associating with Solidarity

who fomented trp/jbl*) and caused some of the strikes by intimidation. It

was clear to hersiDhtfE^General Jaruzelski, who had a good relationship

with the President((of A/he Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, was trying

to make progress in^-e-p^ying Poland&apos;s problems.    He had said that he was

trying to follow s oxixirdy^f.i t a i n &apos; s economic policies.    The difficulty

was that, as in the Sc4k *Vwiion,  they were looking for the fruits of

economic freedom without p^a^iding the political freedoms that went with

this.    From her talks wit}gvfr(2Kpendents who knew about agriculture, she

had learned that although wf^rAt cent of Polish agriculture was

uncollect ivised and remained ^fvts^e hands of small peasants or yeomen

farmers, these people were nc^Twr^A.    They could not sell their land, or

make purchases without permitsjsVddy^couId not easily obtain equipment

and were subjected to all manner /rf/efenstraints.

The United Kingdom&apos;s position in Polapd^as not as well established as

that of some other countries.    This v i&lt; &amp;rtly still a legacy of the

sense that Britain had let Poland downyur  *lta, despite going to war

over Poland and providing help at the (wMir Df the Warsaw uprising. Thus

while the Government&apos;s robust stance visMa-vis the Soviet Union was

admired,  there was some leeway to make up.    General Jaruzelski had said

that English was no longer the second language in Poland.    Germany was

present in greater force, and the Italians were/^XSbv far behind.

In discussion, it was noted that the Prime Mini ^ ?-s\visit to Poland

had been very successful but that the outlook forU^e/Polish economy was

very gloomy.    The difficulty was that even if the njHin Government were

to identify and implement the right economic measure^//rfj  e in current

circumstances would be likely to lead Solidarity to go&lt;&lt; qOs^r ike again.

The latter for their part needed to understand that largeV^feeedoms went

hand in hand with larger responsibilities.    Whilst agreenj f^/Tto an

International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme would make it^&amp;^^ible for

the United Kingdom to help over such matters as debt rescheduja&lt;^g\ the

Polish Government still seemed a long way from that point. PAnmdSstill

owed Britain money in respect of the abortive experiment over jp&amp;/Ur^us

tractor factory.    There was no point in throwing good money afte^/bajK

Nevertheless every sensible opportunity should be taken to open ma^p^^


up between Britain and Poland, such as the offer to take 200 management

?\   trainees, visits, management consultancies and trade on a firm-to-firm
