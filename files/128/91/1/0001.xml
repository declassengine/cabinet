&apos;that Government business would be taken in the week beginning 14

^tovember and that the 1988/89 Session of Parliament would open on

\fcu  day 22 November.    The House of Lords would consider the Housing Bill

_,e Quesne

Report on

Barlow Clowes

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he proposed to

publish lJAter that day as a Parliamentary paper the report that he had

received from Sir Godfray Le Quesne QC on the facts of his Department&apos;s

handling of matters concerning the Barlow Clowes group of investment

management compaijt^s.    His statement in the House of Lords that

afternoon woula/emjyiasise that the report was one of the most exhaustive

ever volunteereffcb^SNDepartment of State into its handling of such

matters.   Exceptio^alAV, he had decided that a number of internal

submissions made tb-JKa^sters and other material which would not

normally be publishea/jPJjBjvld be included in the published text of the

report.    The matters ai^nsitfwered by the report extended over a period of

years and it was necessary\^t&gt; consider his Department&apos;s actions in the

context of the regulatorj^^^Yem that was in place at the time. For

most of the period, the rMgwt law had been the Prevention of Fraud

(Investments) Act 1958, unae^wtt^ch tighter Regulations had been made in

1983, and which had been sup !TS &lt;Jexl by the Financial Services Act 1986,

which had been brought into er^pdy in instalments from December of that

year.    During virtually all the fl&amp;rdd in question, therefore, his

Department had been operating with^e&apos;sjr icted and inflexible powers.

The licences to deal in securities^yva^Phad been granted to Barlow

Clowes had been issued on the basisM$f-^^surances by solicitors and

auditors on which the Department had^TC^n^Mtitled to rely: the

Department had never had sufficient ev^yrence to justify the refusal of a

licence, and the removal of a licence wb^ld not, in practice, have

represented a clear-cut resolution of the company&apos;s affairs.    So far as

the Gibraltar-based company was concerned, his Department had never had

any reason to suppose that this company required^, licence, since it had

purported to offer services to expatriates andYnot^residents only. No

complaints or other approaches had been made to^HJ^iJepar tment about

this company, and it had only recently become clt^rxKat the company had

operated in the United Kingdom through intennediaVrt^vwho only named

Barlow Clowes to their prospective clients in privarsf^fcSwespondence.

His Department would, therefore, emerge from the Le Q&lt;j jMfl\report with

nothing to substantiate any charges of maladministratioir^a^inst it. He

would nevertheless send the report to the Parliamentary^OTJjarfcsioner for

Administration with an assurance of his full co-operationA^ij/ajw

investigation the Commissioner might wish to make.    He had~&quot;j  &lt;tfOrece ived

clear legal advice that his Department had no legal liabiliBATvo/s

investors who had lost money with Barlow Clowes, and he had a^^mfedv that

it would not be reasonable to use taxpayers&apos; money to fund comp^f&amp;ayion

to them. yy^&gt;


The liquidators of the United Kingdom company hoped that investors would

Y\receive at least 75p in the  , perhaps before Christmas, and even the

//distribution for the Gibraltar-based company would probably be more than

&lt;^jy3op in the  , and was expected to be paid early in the New Year.

A. ^fle*}ertheless, media and parliamentary opinion would not be prepared for

&lt;^ra&lt;/Axoneration of his Department, and the argument would doubtless

acnyti&amp;ie to be pressed that the licensing of Barlow Clowes carried with

it ja^epikcial obligation to the investors.    The facts clearly

demonstrated, however, that the Government had acted robustly throughout

its c^nfi^^i office to tighten up the machinery for the protection of

investor^/^It was not to blame for the shortcomings of the machinery it

had inhM^xed.    The machinery now in place was far stronger than the

arrangements in force during the events covered in the Le Quesne report,

but no law could protect investors who recklessly put their money into

unregulated off-shore funds.    It could be expected that the report would

attract attentLrfjf^bo the role played in the Barlow Clowes affair by

auditors and other professionals .

In discussion theUfjjJW/pwing main points were made:

a. Although the/ $&amp;*ication of internal submissions to Ministers

should be presentg$fj2^a most exceptional decision, not to be

regarded as a precedYjrf^ there was no way of preventing it being

quoted against the &amp;&amp;pt\iment in the future.    Publication of this

material was, howevesVJt^c^pnly way in which the Department&apos;s

actions could be satisflrc^&amp;ily explained.    If this material was

not volunteered straign^away&apos;^there would be sustained pressure for

some more formal investi  jtypjy\such as a Tribunal of Inquiry which

would be bound to publish jmfcw&amp;al papers.

b. Although the Le Quesne repor^provided no basis for charges of

maladministration against the EjeoS^ment, a number of Members of

Parliament could be expected to tpaj^e^p the matter with the

Parliamentary Commissioner for AaTrfrristration, who might well

decide to investigate it. ^

c. The Government would face questioning on whether a Barlow

Clowes affair could happen again.    The anrfjSe^v to that lay partly in

the Financial Services Act, which had no (bevi brought into full

effect, and partly in emphasising to invesiro^s~yhat there was no

substitute for their own prudence.    In part^fcujrafc* investors who

needed the protection of a compensation schemS^y^ould be advised to

deal with members of the Financial Intermediari^r&gt;^tanagers and

Brokers&apos; Regulatory Authority (FIMBRA). ^^\Cv

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thaC/^pe^yEabinet had

agreed that the Le Quesne report should be published thaK^4 Y/^and that

the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should make a^tfattement on

the lines of the draft he had shown the Cabinet.    He shouldV^Vy^Ver,

strengthen the drafting of the statement at a number of point^W *&gt; had

been discussed, to emphasise some key facts that underlay his

Department&apos;s actions.    It would be most important to emphasise thje^^V.

action that the Government had steadily taken towards improved inve  c(r


&gt;    protection, and the reassurance that the public could take in dealing

?vs. with members of FIMBRA.    In addition to the statements in both Houses,

J/ the Secretary of State should arrange for Members of Parliament to be

/^VgAyen written briefing on the Le Quesne report that day.

^w/vThe Cabinet -

yyPqpk note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

sjjmning up of the discussion and invited the

^^gella^tary of State for Trade and Industry to

2.      THE SECRETAKSnOF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he would be

tabling later cnat(jday an Order-in-Council to change Northern Ireland

law on the infererfj&gt;es\which a court could draw if a suspect or an

accused person reoaioad silent when questioned.   He understood that the

Home Secretary woord^be/announcing that afternoon that early legislation

on this subject wouly ^s be introduced for England and Wales.   He was

grateful to the Home T&amp;w(^^ry an&lt;* the Lord Chancellor for their

assistance in developing^K*&amp;r&gt;roposa Is, which enjoyed the full support

of the Lord Chief Justic^roiv\Northern Ireland.   There might be

criticism that the announ\xs*y^\Was being made by Written Answer, but

time would be provided for ^^V^s in both Houses.   This change in the

law was one of the series ofoahVt^atives against Northern Ireland

terrorism, starting with the ^^kijtictions which the Home Secretary had

announced the previous day on aicje-sststo the broadcasting media by

representatives of proscribed orgarf&gt;sSbtions in Northern Ireland or their

political wings.


The Cabinet ^

Took note.

3.    THE MINISTER OF STATE, ^flft^^S AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the

State Visit by Her Majesty TnKMjWen to Spain had so far gone well,

underlining a major improvement /jwl/Mglo-Spanish relations over recent

years.    The Gibraltar issue hadWtt^a\ted media attention: there had

been nothing new on this in speecf es&gt;J&gt; The Queen or by the King of

Spain, although the press had atte ^gd Vo read new significance into

Her Majesty&apos;s words.    The record was^iJe^ng. set straight by reference to

the Prime Minister&apos;s clear statement oX/ycCe. Government&apos;s position in

Madrid the previous month. \X

In discussion, it was noted that the Prime Minister of Gibraltar,

Mr Joseph Bossano, was refusing to accept the ag-teement that had been

negotiated with the Spanish Government over GfKraU:ar airport, and that

he was also taking an intransigent line on otn^3,/aj^ctical issues

involving Spain.    It was in Gibraltar&apos;s in teres tf/tha)u solutions should

be found to these problems and everything possibM^ *f! ld be done to

persuade Mr Bossano to co-operate in this. ^^^^\

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that a

second round of talks with Vietnam had been held on 11-12 October to

) discuss the return of their boat people from Hong Kong.    It had been

 ^greed that comprehensive arrangements were needed for all who, under

\^OTg Kong&apos;s new policy, failed to qualify as refugees; that the first

^^Jyiority should be to return all those, currently 350, who had asked to

b^K^matriated to Vietnam; and that modest assistance with

reme^rat ion, through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees

(UNflCR^ should be provided for those returning.    The outcome had been

we 1 K^ee^&amp;ved in Hong Kong.    In responding to allegations that our

policy^3ra4-inhumane,  it was being stressed that this policy was in

accordafte^with international practice on the treatment of illegal

immigrant&apos;s, that it commanded the support of the UNHCR, who would run

the repatriation programme, and that boat people were being screened

according to UNHCR criteria to distinguish political refugees from

economic migran -s^\ Only 23 boat people had arrived in Hong Kong over

the previous month!) a considerable drop in immigration which

demonstrated tfted E&gt;rrent effect of the new policy.

THE MINISTER OF STATE^^M*kj.GN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that

instability in Yugoslavia w Js increasing, due largely to the ambitions

of the Serbian Party lea^^^Hr Slobodan Milosevic, the growth of

Serbian nationalism, a deW^lae) in living standards and the bankruptcy

of the Yugoslavia Federal rtr^a^y^hip.    At the Party Central Committee

Plenum that had just ended, N^ebVe^ntatives of other republics had

resisted Mr Milosevic&apos;s dematKCa^^ar-change.    A demonstration in Belgrade

planned for 22 October had been /a&amp;i&amp;ially postponed but protests by

Mr Milosevic&apos;s supporters were like^r\fo take place. Changes had been

made at the Plenum in the YugoslaV^le^fJership but their implications for

future policy were at present unclev &lt;^Lt was essential to eschew

political bickering and to tackle theyfauo&lt;ry*s economic problems; there

was a danger that the measures recommended by the International Monetary

Fund might not be implemented.    There wn no sign of the Soviet Union

seeking to capitalise on the current unrest.   The West could do little,

but it was important that we should continue closely to monitor the

situation with our Allies. /^-\\

In discussion, it was noted that the federal sx2y&lt; Eftce of Yugoslavia

compounded the problem of dealing with her ser ioiEsec/bnomic

difficulties.  &quot;y^tl

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE sa^^^at the

discussions in Harare on 15 and 16 October between Dr Danrt^KMven, the

President of the South African Rugby Board, and the Africal\iHroiOTal

Congress designed to bring about a non-racial South African i^mMaain,

were a welcome development.    It remained to be seen whether thiis^arove

would be successful.    If so, it could have implications for other//^

sports.    But there was some resistance within the South African RughV/


^    Board and the South African Government had objected to being by-passed.

^\ Anti-apartheid movements outside South Africa were suspicious of any

)) attempt to dilute blanket sporting boycotts and the implications of the

 ^?iSjtest developments for the Gleneagles Agreement were not yet clear. If

V^\tKa agreement on rugby football were to come to fruition and were

^/raplicated in other sports, it would be necessary to review within the

OxTOaafswealth the existing policy of discouragement of sporting links

witpt^d^ith Africa, although new Commonwealth members might follow the

lifreDemoted by the anti-apartheid movements.    In the meantime, our

publ&lt;  -rfi&amp;ponse should be cautious.

It was noted that press reports suggested that the Rumanian Government

had cancelled ni-ji&amp;fi to destroy villages occupied by Hungarian nationals

within their tefrri^ory.    If so, this would be good news.    The reports

should be checR 2Jy^tth the British Ambassador in Bucharest.

the Foreign and Commonwealth ;^ /*t^ry had attended an informal meeting

of EC Foreign Ministers in YannftrgKoli 15-16 October.    The subjects

discussed had included East/West nz^fQions, Lebanon and Chile. While

some had suggested it would be deViraj re to give Mr Gorbachev

encouragement to further reform, tH ^F&lt;E &amp;ign and Commonwealth Secretary

had argued that the success of perescyffica^would turn on Soviet domestic

events, not gestures from the We81.

Agriculture

Council,

17-18 October

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOaTs^Ld that the only

decision reached at the meeting of the Agricurfe3j?^ J uncil on

17-18 October related to a reduction in the olivfe^ojWx on sumption

subsidy.    The cut agreed would reduce the budget ^^i&amp;f million in the

coming year.   This saving would be on top of the reavf^mn of  170

million secured by the management committee in the dV&amp;^vector. The

achievement of continuing downward pressure on the budgeT/fajd been

supported by the United Kingdom and owed much to the rob^^&apos;performance

of the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Andriessen.   The CouhXiJ/had also

considered an income aid scheme put forward by the CommisstM^\

in response to a remit from the European Council. He had exj&amp;ees M the

view that the Commission&apos;s proposals were wrongly directed,

transitional in character and bordering on a social security sjre^mC^for

producers.    He had himself opposed the scheme for some time.    It ayit^

appeared to be attracting criticism from a number of other member


countries,  including the French.    The issue had been a major topic in

O^iis bilateral discussions the previous day with the French Agriculture

/Minister, Monsieur Nallet.   The Council had given initial consideration

^&gt;fi\a further group of items: a revision of the support regime for beef,

Cnfcw^roposals on sheepmeat and the agreement with New Zealand. These

Vr^yyfe* were likely to occupy much of the time of the Council over

faa/ ho&amp;ming meetings.
