1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

Social \^

Security &lt;

Announcements

^pffi SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that he proposed to make

/^fc^tement in the House of Commons that afternoon announcing the level

tyy/t^A annual uprating of social security benefits.    The Retail Price

Ynd^jc^wad risen by 5.9 per cent in the twelve months to September 1988

but i^^fiad earlier been subject to an error which had been corrected

durr^^filt period.    The main rates of contributory benefits, including

retirem&amp;m^&gt;ensions, and benefits for war pensioners, disabled people

and otnV^s would be increased either by 5.9 per cent or by the amount

arrived j$ by recalculating the benefit from the last correct rate in

July 1986 using the adjusted movement in prices since that time,

whichever figure was the higher.    Income-related benefits would also be

raised and thev^-T*5suld be additional help for disabled people,

improvements inthv scheme for exceptionally cold weather payments and

adjustments to rra^fiiaSsupport levels to help with the minimum 20 per

cent contributioi\Wt&gt;iZX recipients would be required to make to the

community charge. ^reJwewer, attention would undoubtedly focus on the

decision to leave the/*jfertd benefit rate unchanged while devoting

substantial additionaV^As^arces to lower income families with children.

If child benefit had been^raxeased, the whole of that increase would

have been offset by autos^%c\Veductions in family credit and income

support for families in re^^Vfc^pf those benefits, with the result that

th poorest families would hatfja^^ined nothing.    He had therefore decided

instead not only to uprate raVM^credit and income support in line with

inflation, at a cost of  135 xsf&amp;flAtty per annum, but also to increase by

50 pence per week the child cre^&lt;c AhS.family credit and the child

allowance in income support at a o&amp;Cy&gt;   70 million per annum. Those

arrangements would provide extra ben^ fts for 3 million families most in

need.    It would be important to encc^rfSS^r people eligible for those

benefits to claim them and he was cons&gt;yrfe,^ng measures to improve

take-up.    By targetting child support  m^the way he had described, the

substantial additional resources which w^re being provided would be

directed to those most in need.    He was making arrangements for the full

details of the uprating to be circulated to his Ministerial colleagues

and a brief would also be provided for backberyrft^Ktavernment supporters.

In discussion, it was noted that,  in presenting~Xfae&apos;~&quot;stecisions on child

support,  it would be important to stress that a &amp;ka raA uprat ing of

child benefit, far from providing the same level ol^ if/nort across the

board, would have had the perverse effect of providin^p^aTiitional

resources for higher income families, who had already^jjen^&amp;itted

substantially from the reduction in income tax in that ye^K&amp; Budget,

but no extra money at all for those most in need.    The G?ffl^f^mVent were

instead providing an additional 50 pence per week for chiiQ&amp;gA/iri poorer

families on top of the uprating of family credit and income^*v p^rt

inline with inflation.    It would be important to emphasize aw^/fflat a

family with two children aged, say, 12 and 14 would be eligibKryfij^*

family credit even if they earned as much as  9,300 per annum.  \s /\


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that while the

Government had pledged that it would maintain the value of certain

benefits, it was not committed in any way to the indexation of child

benefit and the Secretary of State for Social Security&apos;s proposals were

I fully in line with the Government&apos;s manifesto at the last General

^Election.    The Government could be proud of its record on child support,

oJ! ich was a great deal better than that of the previous Labour

, .^ministration.    The Cabinet agreed the Secretary of State for Social

C&apos;Sjpe^&amp;aty&apos; s proposals and that he should announce them in the House of

vtmim^mB that afternoon.    In presenting the proposals as a whole, the

Gc^ernj^nt shoud emphasise the main points which had been made in the

CabitjJe^&gt;%discussion and make clear that it was increasing in line with

infli^Spy those benefits whose value in real terms it had pledged to

maintay^^^

The Cabinet -

HOME AFFAIRS

Unemployment

in London

2.     THE SECRETARY OF^^$^ OR EMPLOYMENT said that he would be

publishing the following&gt;^e &amp;\two surveys concerned with unemployment in

London that showed that lrf^hajprevious summer 288,000 people had been

claiming unemployment beneis *^Jj\London even though there were some

150,000 unfilled vacancies, w\^eM t one-third of which required no

previous experience or knowletjfe^^y Many of the longer-term unemployed

had good qualifications, with alra^oone in ten having gained a degree

and nearly one-half having achieVed^OTje academic or vocational

qualification.    Around one-half oS^ohe^longer-term unemployed in London

were unmarried, about seven in ten ^^J* y had no dependant children and

the majority were below the age of 4B?&gt;^JmLle just over one-half of them

visited Jobcentres on a weekly basis, w*J*rio 70 per cent had never

approached a private employment agency.NATwo conclusions emerging from

the surveys were that there was a well-developed black economy in London

and that a large proportion of unemployed people were not looking for

jobs in any sustained way.    There was accordineLy^&gt;a strong case for

taking further steps to encourage them back in^t^wwrk.

In a brief discussion,  it was suggested that whei/Auneraployment had been

lower, vacancies had also been lower.    If this was^2&amp;*dj.rmed, it

supported the conclusions of the surveys.



THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he hoped that thV-ej^ f

Secretary, Treasury, would be able to bring the results of t^Tv^S

Public Expenditure Survey to the Cabinet at their next meeting^W.

Tuesday 1 November.    He believed that it would be unwise to hoIcyA^e^.


the Autumn Statement for as long as a week after that meeting and, on

the assumption that the Cabinet approved the proposals that they would

be considering on 1 November, he believed that he should make the Autumn

^   Statement on that afternoon.    This followed a precedent set on a

&apos;?\previous occasion.    The necessary supporting material and briefing for

vO^jje media could be organised on that timetable, and the printed copies

yytffy the documents would be published a week later.

q5*E^KJME MINISTER said that the Cabinet agreed with the Chancellor of

the^Jrohequer1s proposals for handling the 1988 Public Expenditure

Surv^/&apos;jtjul the Autumn Statement.    It was regrettable that speculation

abou^T?ra&apos; timing of the Statement had appeared in the press; pending

CabineY^^greement to the figures, the Government should take the line

that th^Statement would be made in the following month in the normal

way. V

THE HOME SECRETAW^i\d that various questions of interpretation had

been raised on tn^-^ra^hces that he had issued to the Chairmen of the

British Broadcastin^&lt;f|6p oration and the Independent Broadcasting

Authority on 19 Octol/^^^fluiring them to refrain from broadcasting

direct statements by x f)rew&gt;ntatives of organisations proscribed in

Northern Ireland and Greaivjkitain and by representatives of Sinn Fein,

Republican Sinn Fein and^n*ejp\ls ter Defence Assocation.    In particular,

questions had been raisedN TOjJ V:he way in which the notices might apply

to interviews with Sinn Fei^Couwcillors in Northern Ireland when they

were speaking about matters b^J^ffad nothing to do with terrorism. The

key to this issue was whether VheM&amp;dividual was involved in his

representative capacity.    Thus afri^^xviev with a Sinn Fein councillor, .

speaking in his capacity as counc^lor^\ would be prohibited by the

notices he had issued, though there^^^aothing to prevent a broadcast

interview with the same person speal^rt^fs a private individual on, for

example, his hobbies and pastimes.    Thw^^fould doubtless be those who

would try to fabricate specious borderMne problems.    But he believed

that the principle he had outlined woulo^keep his orders to the

broadcasting authorities safe from any challenge by way of judicial

review or under the European Convention on Human_Rights.    He was taking

steps to ensure that the basis of the distinctyyo&apos;nyjas understood by the

media. V^/^-^

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visits to

Moscow by the Prime Minister of Italy, Signor Ciriaco De Mita, from

13 to 15 October and by the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of

\   Germany (FRG), Herr Helmut Kohl,  from 24 to 26 October had produced some

 /*Sconfused comment in the media.    Talk of the Soviet Union receiving aid

-sS^Virough a second &quot;Marshall Plan&quot;, emanating from a chance remark by

v^  gnor De Mita, was exaggerated.    it was the provision of credit for

v^y^BlJitercial deals that was intended.    Also, talk about a human rights

(&amp;&lt;mQ\ence in Moscow was premature.    Some Governments were too ready to

gitfejpaje Russians the benefit of the doubt;  in the same way, the Italian

and^jRGjCovernments had previously been over-optimistic about the

pros ^S*?/ for an early convention on chemical weapons.    Herr Kohl&apos;s

report /Cj*^previous day that the Soviet Government was to release all

politic^C prisoners illustrated the unwisdom of speaking out euphoricly

before trre facts were fully established.    The report had not been

confirmed by the Soviet Government spokesman and it would be important

to see exactly what was involved before passing judgment.    The comment

by the Pres idewf&quot;~&lt;!  the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, that Herr

Kohl&apos;s visit h\^d.tt^ ken the ice showed how far the FRG&apos;s bilateral

relationship witrf/th^jSoviet Union lagged behind ours.    Herr Kohl had

raised the questr&lt;Jrr^K^German unification, which Mr Gorbachev had

predictably rejectQ&amp;y/2Se most illiberal feature of the &quot;European

House&quot; to which Mr G/pfeaphev was prone to refer was the Berlin Wall.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTtf^j^ETARY said that the Anglo-Italian

Summit on 21 October had bee^a^adessful and that a number of objectives

had been achieved.    He had sigMe^P^*th the Italian Foreign Minister,

Signor Giulio Andreotti, a new WT.aJrencal Convention on Double Taxation.

The Italians had confirmed that t^y w^uld not sell arms to Libya or

torpedoes to Argentina and had agr^jjd^tl** importance of the early

completion of a financial package if^^m^&gt;ovt of the sale of Tornado to

Jordan.    They had also confirmed thei^A^ricipation in the planned

route survey in the Gulf by vessels of^estern European Union states.

Signor Andreotti had agreed that there was no prospect of changing the

Italian Government&apos;s position on South Africa by pressing for further

sanctions.  v

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that tKe^/jpad been

interesting developments in the Baltic States of the^&amp;jj^&amp;t Union.

Following the recent founding congresses of People&apos;s Vr^^^vin Estonia

and Latvia,  the first congress had been held the previou^^^kend of the

Lithuanian Movement for Perestroika.    More than 1,000 detf gaj)ds had

attended.    The local Communist Parties were swimming with^lij^X

nationalist tide and President Gorbachev had expressed gene^rt^s^pport

for the popular movements in the Baltic States.    But it was fys^iyiear

how far they could be allowed to develop.


In discussion,  it was noted that the Soviet Government had stepped in to

quell unrest in the Trans-Caucasus Republics and that similar action in

the Baltic States, which had lost their independence as recently as

H   1940, could not be ruled out.

SerwCS^fationalist aspirations had made no headway at the recent plenum

of the^/C^B^Kral Committee of the Yugoslav Communist Party at which the

leader &amp;r the Serbian Communist Party, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, had been

rebuffedV   The Government was now beginning to concentrate on economic

reform, although past policies had run into the sand.

had been very low.    In the white elections, tlyr^rwht wing Conservative

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the State Visit by

Her Majesty The Queen to Spain had been most successful, consolidating

the Prime Minister&apos;s earlier visit.    There had been moving moments, such

as the ceremony of Beating Retreat by the Royal Marines and, in

^particular, Her Majesty&apos;s address to the Cortes, who had given Her a

^Standing ovation, underlining the identification between monarchy and

^^amocracy.    The visit had not been overshadowed by the Gibraltar

/p&amp;tAon.    He had discussed with the Spanish Foreign Minister,

^^PSv^&quot; ernandez Ordonez, the Gibraltar Airport Agreement, stressing that

tl^^GotfJernment was committed to the Agreement and that it would continue

to {j^Jj^^in pressure on the Gibraltar Government to implement it.

Council,

24-25 October

4.    THE FOREIGN AKfl) \V)MMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been a

useful informal avfcsJxfs^ion at the Foreign Affairs Council on 24-25

October of the pro&lt; eycrcy ve agenda for the Rhodes European Council. . The

outlook was reasonab^y^^aightforward.    The agenda was likely to

include a progress repi^^M the Commission on the single market, the

environment, and the Comsrf&amp;jftky&apos; s relations with the outside world. On

the latter point, there w&quot;*s 9ome disturbing evidence that the United

States and home countries NdJjj/^ \growing impression of a fortress Europe.

In response, the tide amongOjfuXagean foreign ministers was at present

flowing towards a liberal, OMWM-fl facing approach.    This view extended

to the attitude taken to the mxd^^^m review of the General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade Uruguay RoundSrl*Othis context, agriculture remained

a difficult area and it remained ^6 hg seen to what extent the outlook

he had described was reflected in q w? &gt; ic proposals.    The Commission

had meanwhile issued a very helpful^fijrtrement on the external aspects of

completion of the single market. ^S^^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,Continuing, said that the

Council had also considered the regulations to govern the operation of

the increased structural funds.    A number of issues remained

outstanding,  involving several member states.//Thg main area of

difficulty for the United Kingdom was a draft^^t*rte on additionality.

Other northern countries, who were not net benef/Vcia/gies from the

structural funds, were concerned that the flow ox^Zpiffy to southern

member states should not be used by them as a sour^^^J^eeneral

budgetary support.    However the existing draft also ^aj i *Ad unwelcome

implications for our own public expenditure control arra^gjMients. The

regulations were subject to qualified majority voting. J&amp;p \er

improvements were being sought. j\

In discussion it was noted that in the past the position ha1^^^. that

if the United Kingdom benefitted from Community receipts, acluMmy could

be taken of that by adjusting our own expenditure: structural

expenditure was financed partly by the Community and partly from


national resources.    The Commission appeared now to be taking the view

that if a member state received structural funds from the Community,

^   there should be no reductions at national level.    If this view were

&apos;/^maintained, the public expenditure consequences could be very damaging.

Owe position was complicated by the possibility of differences of view

^be^ween the Government and local authorities on the priority to be given

^m/j\articular projects.    If a local authority regarded a project as not

A^irt&apos;rYing a high priority, there would be the danger of a loss of

r&amp;mM5 which might otherwise be forthcoming from the Community. This

and a^tfer issues would be of concern to a number of Departments.

THE PRTME/^INISTER,  summing up the discussion of the additionality

article^/said that the United Kingdom was a major net contributor to the

European\Community budget and an outcome would not be acceptable that

involved increases in the structural funds causing a substantial further

increase in total United Kingdom public expenditure.    The Foreign and

Commonwealth Si^r^tary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in

consultation ^/appropriate with the other Ministers concerned, should

seek to negotiaTy^dTs^f t ing amendments to protect the United Kingdom&apos;s

position. v ov&apos;&quot;)

BROADCASTING

WHITE PAPER

5.      The Cabinet considered ayReAfopandum by the Home Secretary

(C(88) 12) submitting for their^a^ppowal the text of a White Paper

&quot;Broadcasting in the  &apos;90&apos;s: CompeJ^fiwfl, Choice and Quality&quot;,  that he

proposed to publish in the week begirt^ing 7 November.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that major br^Mp^tting legislation would be

needed in the course of the present Pa^Vfament to meet the commitment

in the last Conservative Party General c&amp;ection manifesto. That

legislation could be no later than the 1989-90 Session in order to

establish the framework within which new independent television

contracts should operate as from the end of 19^7v\The time had now come

for a White Paper, so that responses to it cottd fcgtaken into- account

in preparing the legislation.    The proposals foTy^rh~rcjh he sought the

Cabinet&apos;s agreement had been developed in the MiWs^/p&gt;ial Group on

Broadcasting Services and represented a radical app^jriLeaJ. of the whole

broadcasting scene.    This scene was changing very fa/e^J^fdeed with the

developement of new technologies, and many new oppor t^JnX i s were

becoming available.    The thrust of the White Paper was to^^courage an

environment in which these opportunities would be capturaa/o&apos;inbehal f of

consumers, who should be enabled to exercise much greaten^ci^ee over

that they heard and saw.    More radio and television channeLaOoato^

national and local levels, together with a steadily increasme~jey).e for

subscription financing of broadcasting and greater separationCeyYtfJte

different activities involved, would bring the broadcasting systemy\

closer to one that was based on consumer choice. ^^^^


While some important positive programming obligations should be

retained, and standards of taste and decency should be protected, he

proposed a substantial deregulation of the present public service

broadcasting regime, particularly as it affected the independent

-television sector which would operate under a new Independent Television

^^&gt;mmission (ITC), replacing both the Independent Broadcasting Authority

va*i&lt;l the Cable Authority.    This stimulation of a more competitive

^OimAvative and efficient broadcasting industry, and reliance on consumer

ycrafiye rather than regulatory imposition, might lead to accusations from

son^^ar ter s that the Government was not concerned to protect the high

qualj^y^of British broadcasting.    It was vitally important that the

Whit^-taSer should provide a sound defence against that criticism, and

he bely&amp;vpA that it did.    While he proposed that the British

Broadca/^mg Corporation (BBC) should be moved forward towards

subscription financing through pressure on the licence fee, the present

form of finance would remain for the time being and any substantial

change in it was a matter for the future.    The White Paper gave a clear

commitment on tfii^oeed for Channnel 4 to retain its distinctive remit,

though it lefrf(ope(jjl the question of the most appropriate financial

structure for rh^etr^nnel.    The ITC would apply a quality test before

awarding a contri t^/6nvChannel 3 (which would replace the present

independent televiS^&amp;a&apos;/channel) or on the proposed new Channel 5, and it

would monitor contraoTK^rol subsequent compliance with quality

requirements.    Taken^og^^r, these proposals put the Government in a

very strong position on tr^Oauestion of quality.    The second matter on

which it would be essenB^M^Mr the White Paper to allay public concern

was the question of conce\Kr^aV&gt;&lt;?n  f ownership, since there was

considerable and genuine anx^fO)\about the possibility of the television

and other communications mea^aM^Sthis country becoming concentrated in

very few hands.    The White Pa^^rXwpyld therefore make it clear that

limits would be imposed on the tokc&amp;\tration of ownership and on

excessive cross-media ownership,  arfS^vould invite comments on ways in

which those controls might be framed/^^Reshaping the broadcasting scene

for the 1990s in the way that he pr^S^ would be a very major

undertaking, but he believed that the\Knj^ Paper represented a

comprehensive, well-balanced and forwar^looking review which would

enable the Government to approach these^fhanges positively and

confidently.    Subject to his colleagues&apos; approval, he proposed to

publish the White Paper in the week beginning 7 November and

considerable public interest could then be exp^S^^l.

In discussion the following main points were ma ^^\

a. Many members of the House of Lords had ar1&lt; pl\i interest in

broadcasting matters, and the House might wellvj&amp;y-to debate the

White Paper during the period within which the Iggjj^r^ent invited

comments on it. &lt;!^^\

b. Subscription financing was inappropriate for raAip^/^Dpening

up the question of replacing the licence fee by subscri^&amp;^o

financing for BBC television services therefore raisedN^ntfp^ered


questions about the way in which BBC radio services might then be

financed.    The White Paper acknowledged this issue, however, and

. made it clear that it was not one that needed to be resolved for

11 some years to come.

&apos;vXv      c.     The increase in the television licence fees in line with

^yyfl    movements in the Retail Price Index was to be announced by way of

v&apos;yx^Xwritten Answer in the House of Commons that afternoon.    It would be

\S&gt;^nelpful at all times to emphasise that the licence fee went only to

^-&lt;w/ The position of the Welsh language had been covered but there

w^X^Kcase f r a reference to the potential for the use of local

seVi/ices for programming in Gaelic.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the White Paper

had been worked jjld over a long period during which the commercial and

technological /fecraaround had been changing rapidly.    Subject to any

minor and dran^^&amp;^goints, which might be communicated direct to the

Home Secretary, tftfeuabinet now approved the White Paper annexed to

C(88) 12 and the^QrjM^Secretary should proceed to publish it,

accompanied by an o^ay^rtatement in the House of Commons, during the

week beginning 7 Nov^^ct\

&lt;^&gt;

The Cabinet -

Approved the White Pa^I^^Knexed to C(88) 12 and

invited the Home Secre^fl^vp proceed with its

publication as the Pr im^oM4ji7ster had indicated in

her summing up of the disty^^wn.
