2.    THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, subject to the approval

of Cabinet, an announcement would be made later that day, by means of a

Written Answer fcom the Lord President of the Council, of the

Government&apos;s pr^p&apos;oaaJs for increases in the salaries of Ministers and

other paid offi^e^n&amp;lsters.    At the beginning of the present year, MPs

had received a ve/ylarge increase of 21.9 per cent, as a result of the

full implementaticV^rj^X^ House of Commons resolution which linked MPs&apos;

pay to 89 per cent ar^^ng^maximum of the scale for Grade 6 officers in

the Civil Service.    Tl^ ^J&amp;j&amp;inet had agreed at that time that it would

not have been right to&lt;h1rv^^increased Ministerial salaries by such a

large percentage and that&gt;&lt;0$5rfc. should instead be increased by  4,048,

the same increase in cash^smns as that for MPs.    Although nothing had

been said publicly,  it was^gjjg&apos;&amp;lly expected that Ministers&apos; pay would

in future years increase by Ofe^same percentage as that for MPs.

However, as a consequence of tyip^iZexible pay agreement for Civil

Service Grades 5-7, MPs&apos;  pay vouY$/pkse by 6.9 per cent with effect from

1 January 1989.    He had discusses^theNnatter with the Prime Minister,

the Leaders of both Houses and the&lt;xThi#J Whip who had agreed that it

would be unsustainable to increase t^f^&amp;a-laries of Ministers and paid

office holders by as much as 6.9 per^c^5 p and that they should instead

be increased by  1559,  the same overal^/p^arh increase as that for

backbenchers.    In the interests of redu^vng the differentials between

the remuneration of Ministers in the House of Lords and that of their

counterparts in the House of Commons,  it had also been agreed that there

should be special supplements, on top of the genatal increases, of  800

for Ministers of State in the Lords and the Goj^rntotent Chief Whip,

Lords, of  400 for Parliamentary Secretaries is^h&gt;e^fcords,  the Deputy

Government Chief Whip, Lords and the Leader of tW&lt;^Op)pJosition in the

Lords, and of  200 for Government and Opposition Wbjis^n both Houses.

Under the package of proposals which he had describ^dyfafe average

increase in Ministerial salaries would be 4i per centO^iX the highest

increases going to the Whips in both Houses and the pay^o^jpabinet

Ministers rising by only /Va\

3 per cent. &lt;X ))

In discussion, the following main points were made: \0v^X

a.     While it was clearly right to hold down percentage irTc/je^ s&lt;as

in Ministerial salaries for the following year in the way wWiob/Che


Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed, any entrenchment of the

practice of raising Ministerial salaries only in line with the cash

increases awarded to MPs would artifically compress the

&quot;V differentials between the various levels of pay.    The large

J\ increase in MPs&apos;  pay for the following year was attributable to a

once and for all restructuring of the pay arrangements for the

relevant Civil Service grade, and in future years it should be

\&gt;Syf]   possible to increase Ministerial pay by the same percentage as that

/1/^$S&gt;1C MPs.

b/^   There was a long-standing problem over the pay and allowances

&lt;^ jtvnisters in the House of Lords.    Most House of Lords Ministers

W^G&amp;&apos;in practice obliged to run a home in London in addition to

th^n^/family home but, although MPs with constituencies outside

Lorrd/on received a special allowance to compensate them for having

to run two homes, no such allowance was payable to Ministers in the

Lords.    The supplements which they would receive on top of the

general incj e-ases would go some way towards meeting that point, but

there wasnasYVong case for reviewing the remuneration of Lords

Ministers -vD/^IN

c.      There wa _^msure from some MPs for London constituencies for

the special al oyjp*$=&gt; currently payable only to MPs with

constituencies o\j^i^ , London to be extended to all MPs. However,

such pressure shdwlovhje\ firmly resisted since the allowance was

designed to compensa &lt;f/ ivose who were obliged to run two houses, a

factor which clearlywTid/hot apply to London MPs.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing ^ip\ frk discussion, said that the Cabinet

agreed the Chancellor of the K^^^quer&apos; s proposals,  and the Lord

President of the Council shoula^6fr jrf ince them later that day. Briefing

material on the proposed increas s^^ould be made available to

Government supporters in the Hous^^^^Jbmmons.

The Cabinet - &lt;~^/s&gt;

1.      Agreed the Chancellor of the xkchequer&apos;s proposals for

increasing the salaries of Ministers and other paid office holders,

and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord President

of the Council to proceed as the Prime Minis^r had indicated.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he &lt;toMd2be announcing

over the following weekend that 100,000 people had jcl^Ma^wie Employment

Training Programme since its inception three months earl*Wj&gt;   It was a

very considerable achievement to have reached this miles m* vS\0 soon

after the Scheme&apos;s introduction.    A number of highly rega^edy

  y//\\


companies were participating in the programme, and it was manifest that

the opposition of the Trades Union Congress and of the Labour Party had

had little or no effect on its implementation.

I Eggs

THE S^JeEgrARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the prevalence of salmonella

infectipnMK^ eggs had been a cause of concern for his Department and the

Ministry^! Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in recent months. Guidance

had been issued on 26 August and 21 November, and the Ministry of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had agreed a voluntary code of practice

with the poultry-breeding industry designed to reduce the risk of

salmonella infee^roji in poultry-breeding flocks.    News of the impending

issue of this qdde (and answers given to reporters by the Parliamentary

Under-Secretary oy^8Tate, Department of Health, raised the profile of

this issue.    In revMy^Ag. to a Private Notice Question on the previous

Monday he had explai^^dythat the risk of an individual consuming an

infected egg was very / m  \. and that the risk of harm to any healthy

adult was very small lqr^eAp^   Nevertheless, as he had explained,  it was

advisable for vulnerable new&amp;e,  such as the elderly, the sick, babies

and pregnant women,  to cc rimme\\only eggs that had been cooked until the

white and yolk were solid^X^SyABX his reply to that question he had

arranged for the Chief Medica^^^icer to take the lead in offering any

Government comment on salmoneWa/^d eggs and to clear any references to

the matter that were to be madeC^y^ipis Department or by the Ministry of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.^/tfe^noped that this method of handling

would succeed in taking the heat oirf/o^.the issue and getting the

problem into perspective.    There wasv^rowever, genuine public concern

and the media might add fuel to this^J^^^ny time, especially by

publishing alarming estimates of the ptfe^a^ence of infection.

In discussion the following main points wfcre made:

a. While the claims of a drop in egg sales of the order of 40 per

cent at the beginning of the week may welV^hctye been exaggerated,

the full picture would not be available utjfcil^the following week.

In any event, a drop in sales of a much 1 oweiv&apos;oraker could be a very

serious matter for the industry because of ti^e--^eicheads involved

in maintaining egg-producing flocks. &lt;y/J/&gt;

b. The advice to caterers to use liquid pasteur^aii^^gg was right

but it created a presentational problem with the gene^a^\public, to

whom this produce was not available. ^Vv-^y

c. Although it was recognised that salmonella was an

international problem, there was a clear public perceptvtyj&amp;kt its

successful control in England and Wales was deterioratingv&apos;yagj&amp;nst

that background it was open to question whether a voluntaryC^od^Nof

^2&gt;,


conduct with the industry would be sufficient to maintain public

confidence.    Market pressures would however give the industry a

strong incentive to put its house in order.

^V.        d.      If it turned out that a programme to eradicate infected flocks

was needed,  then the potential compensation costs could be very

\^V/s large.

TOJv^KVIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Chief

Medi^kvOfficer&apos;s advice to the public had been very sensible and

werT-^aged, and this would assist in keeping the matter in proportion.

Nevei^rlJiyss, there was a very genuine public concern on the matter, and

the rea^lvex^ent of the infection among poultry flocks did not appear to

have bevtv^established.    Further Ministerial consideration, involving

representation from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,

would be required.    In the meantime,  the Secretary of State for Health,

whose officials should consult the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries

and Food, shouLd^Jjrculate to members of the Cabinet before the weekend

a factual notefand^ brief on the line they might take if questioned on

the matter.

The Cabinet ^~^/fJys

3.    Took note, wigjJ\&lt;af^roval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of

the discussion and m^&amp;ed the Secretary of State for Health to

circulate a note on&lt;^K^^ines that the Prime Minister had

indicated.

3.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that .^^^Soviet Ambassador, Mr Leonid

Zamyatin, had called on her earlier &gt; t morning to convey President

Gorbachev&apos;s apologies that his sudd^r^TTtirn from New York to the Soviet

Union because of the earthquake on 7 Ue&lt;ej=alber in Soviet Armenia obliged

him to postpone the visit to London whj&apos;evrl had been planned for the

following week.    Before the Ambassador&apos;aocall she had spoken on Briitsh

radio welcoming President Gorbachev&apos;s major speech of 7 December to the

United Nations General Assembly and expressing sympathy over the

earthquake tragedy as well as understanding ahrflSx^he postponement of

the visit.    She had also sent a letter to Pref(deiVt Gorbachev via the

Soviet Ambassador.    The United Kingdom needed roy e&quot;&quot;~Yn a position to

offer rapid aid to victims of the Soviet earthqula^g^^aster. The

Foreign and Commonwealth Office Disaster Unit had |5 jMt/activated. The

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, who was in Bruss/H^was in touch

with the European Commission and the United Kingdom Pgfaran^nt

Representative to the European Communities, Sir David Hatfa^-would raise

the matter at the Committee of Permanent RepresentativesV/xbAwas

important to identify what kind of help was most needed, food,

drugs, or even toys for children.    It should also be possibl^^X

despatch teams of surgeons should that prove necessary. ItNwaar/%

important after the Government&apos;s prompt reaction to news of XM^rJI/y

earthquake to keep up the initiative and to offer practical helo^^Ys.


THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE (MRS CHALKER)

said that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were in touch with the

British Ambassador in Moscow and were ready to put together an

\ appropriate aid package, both on a national and a European Community

//basis.    The scale of the earthquake had apparently been enormous, with

y^y^t least two large towns devastated and reports of tens of thousands of

^^eaths.    An early opportunity would be taken to explore with the

v^rf/sians possible dates for the reinstatement of President Gorbachev&apos;s

yi ^K\to the United Kingdom.

The^Mi/f&amp;ter of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, said that

Pres^^Jajrt^Gorbachev&apos;s important speech to the General Assembly had been

very weyyoma, although it contained some element of playing to the

galleryN^^fe had promised unilateral reductions of Soviet armed forces

by 500,0tMlmen over the next two years, and six Soviet tank divisions

would be withdrawn and disbanded from the German Democratic Republic,

Czechoslovakia and Hungary by 1991.    Altogether he had announced

reductions of IJKS&amp;D tanks, 8,500 artillery systems and 800 combat

aircraft in Eas^er^)Europe and the European part of the Soviet Union.

He had also uncfeN^^S*K that there would be a restructuring of remaining

Soviet forces in E^sj&gt;etn Europe so as to bring out more clearly their

purely defensive i^ttrei/   Over the same period unspecified reductions

were also promised rn/jWJ^-Soviet armed forces in the Asian part of the

Soviet Union.    In his^^^reX^nces to Afghanistan during the speech,

President Gorbachev hadcVw^d for a complete ceasefire from 1 January

1989; the cessation from^^/!^ame date of arms supplies to all

belligerants; the despatcfvXtjvAiighanistan of a contingent of United

Nations peacekeeping forces;v rt ^bolding of an early international

conference on the neutrality^Anw^femilitarisation of Afghanistan; and

the creation of a United Natio^ ^^ untary international peacekeeping

corps to assist in the revival cvr/Ar hanistan.    All this no doubt

reflected the intense pressure bei^/f lt by the current regime in

Kabul.    Mr Gorbachev&apos;s speech had als^contained interesting allusions

to the process of restructuring witrr^r^i^ Soviet Union and to human

rights.    He had made proposals about rVpoe^Lng the debt burden of poorer

countries, but these were only superficially attractive given that the

Soviet Union was not a major lender.    Th^re had been positive references

to relations between the Soviet Union and the United States as well as a

handsome tribute to the American President, Mr Ronald Reagan.    In sum it

was an important and fascinating speech, the im j?isations of which would

now need to be studied in detail. (( v

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he t(^^&gt;comed the speech

particularly its recognition in effect that the Sovi^^/Union did possess

a huge superiority of conventional military force.    Th /$ f\fer of

unilateral reductions might reflect pressures to relea^g^iysources from

defence for use elsewhere in the economy.    But caution was/Jraeded at

least until more detail was available about the precise fe^rfe\of the

reductions and the extent to which the forces to be reduce^-WpjKid be

disbanded.    Even taking the reductions at face value the War^s&apos;w^act

would still have a numerical superiority over the North Atlan^itXfVeaty

Organisation (NATO).    There would be 41,500 Warsaw Pact tanks ^&lt;5BMa ed

with 16,500 NATO tanks; 35,000 artillery systems compared with ]^t5o&gt;\


for NATO; and 7,450 combat aircraft compared with 4,000 for NATO. The

reason for the sudden resignation of the Chief of the Soviet Armed

Forces, Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, was not entirely clear,; it was known

\ that his health was not good, but other factors might well have also

^contributed to the decision.

T^FnOj^STER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that because

of%\L^t minute hitch at the recent round of negotiations in

BrazMJ^EDe,  the expected signature of a protocol covering Cuban troop

withdrayal\^rom Angola and independence for Namibia had not yet taken

place, disappeared that there was concern in some quarters of the South

African G^yernment and the South African defence forces at the pace at

which events were moving.    This had led the South African State

President, Mr P W Botha, to recall his delegation from Brazzaville for a

meeting of the S^Sfce Security Council.    It seemed that moderate views

had since prevafledj    According to the South African Department of

Foreign Af fairs ;^-M e-^k&gt;uth African Foreign Minister, Mr Pik Botha, and

the head of the SoCtJyAfrican force, General Malan, were prepared to

sign the protocol rrp^Wzzaville provided the South African Government

could be satisfied on/frda$|\aspects of the verification provisions. A

final decision by Soutrf &amp;A^ca would be taken at a further meeting of

the State Security CounciYx&amp;20 December.    It was possible that there

could be further delay b&lt;&amp;H e&quot;VKuban troop withdrawal and implementation

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN^j^C^MMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the

final round of negotiations with th^Cwief Minister of Gibraltar,

Mr Joseph Bossano, had taken place op/&gt;^December.    The outline of a

solution had been agreed without a nt^rrt^^risis in relations with

Gibraltar.    The total cost of this tophe^TOnited Kingdom would be about

 50 to 60 million over five years, whicn^corapared with the original

estimate of  257 million for Spanish pennons.    The solution had been

arranged carefully so as to be completely consistent with the

requirements of European Community law.    She had announced the agreement

to the House of Comfipns on 7 December in a Wrib^eijNAnswer to a

Parliamentary Question.    She proposed to brief(far vichael Colvin&apos;s

Parliamentary Group on Gibraltar on 13 DecemberS^^Pft&quot;fc\Fore ign and

Coramonweath Secretary had informed the Spanish Fcw _i*n^-Minister,

Senor Fernandez Ordonez, at the recent meeting of tTj^EAaropean Council

at Rhodes.    The latter&apos;s reaction had been calm.    Mr mmno,  for his

part, was getting together with neighbouring leaders T$^payn on the

matter.    Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials were in/M&gt;uch with

the Treasury about the precise financing arrangements.    %^/Fyreign and

Commonwealth Secretary had also told Mr Bossano on 1 Decem^e^A)* the

Government&apos;s intention to restructure the Gibraltar garrisooj^lS^had

agreed with him that the timing of an announcement on this sT^urdO&gt;e

deferred.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had taken th^yIsy

opportunity to press Mr Bossano over the airport agreement and ^&quot;^^^^


co-operation with Spain.    There was a long way to go on both these

matters, but some encouraging signs.    The Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary would follow up during his visit to Gibraltar at the end of

k\/2 &amp; SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the

Mic^Ta^jir Meeting in Montreal of the General Agreement on Tariffs and

TradVjJrjfiSuay Round had started well with a general agreement to reduce

importywst ictions on tropical products.    Framework agreements should

also be^ef^fablished for further negotiations on trade in services and

intellectual property.    For the present, however,  these agreements were

subject to reservations by the United States.    Agriculture remained the

area of greatest difficulty.    Although the United States had dropped a

target date of iJiS^ear 2000,  they had so far stuck to their insistence

on total elimiMti^i of support in the long term.    They had refused to

discuss anythiivg3ai5 \including further action in the short term. On

the latter point.((tliV/European Community for their part were prepared to

contemplate furtheV-jSwi/t term support reductions.    In discussion it was

noted that it reraairreV/jJiraJear whether the American position reflected

tactical consideratio rj^afl^whether, as Vice President Bush had

suggested to the Prime Mrnj^ier during her visit to Washington, they

might be prepared to make^ &lt;$jne\move at a late stage in the negotiations.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that his Department

previous week to the Prime Minister by President Mitterrand that any

problems over the export to France of cars manuT^^feTnhed by Nissan UK

Limited (NMUK) had been resolved.    As reported tcU^o^iaagues earlier,

problems had also arisen in relation to exports to~^0jlxi and Italy. He
