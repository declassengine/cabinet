1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the opening weeks of the new Session would

&apos;be unusually busy, with a succession of Second Reading debates,

/beginning in the week of 5 December, on the Government&apos;s main programme

J^&amp;lls, and the Committee Stage of the Security Service Bill which would

n^A. to be taken on the floor of the House of Commons.

Ienefits for

ensioners

THE STCRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that during his speech

later CTiat day in the Debate on the Address he would announce the scheme

to improve the benefits received by poorer pensioners that had been

foreshadowed b* &gt;the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the House of Commons

on 7 Novembe/wT ^mder present arrangements there was a premium for

pensioners ag^dytrft^and above on income support, and a higher premium for

such pensionersfVageja 80 and above.    He would announce the creation of a

new,  in termed i aW^ xel of premium to be paid to pensioners aged

between 75 and 19^oaLi^^orae support.    That group would receive an

additional  2.50 pe\^**? .for single pensioners and  3.50 for couples,

and the same increasVsxJ&apos;Qi^d be paid to those in receipt of the existing

premium at age 80, toge^ r owith all disabled pensioners over 60. The

same increases would alM aJ ly to those pensioners,  slightly above

income support levels, wrre^M^in receipt of housing benefit.    In all

2.6 million pensioners, ou^Ccn^^Jn total of about 10 million, would

benefit from these changes  HwWSr. would be  195 million in a full

year, but it would not be poss/e^Cto bring the changes into effect

until October 1989, and the Chance^i^r of the Exchequer had agreed that

the cost of about  100 million vn 19&lt;C -90 should be met from the

Reserve.    These benefits were verjC^^j^ully targetted on the groups of

pensioners about whom there was conca^fV^yid he would present them

extremely positively.    He would circwl^e details of the package to his

colleagues later in the day and would Nrnsure that full briefing material

was available to Government supporters in the House of Commons. He

would also deposit technical details in the Library of the House when he

made his announcement, but it was important tbrff^the new scheme should

not be trailed before then. (( \j

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was a highly iftejryjxe scheme to

assist the groups of pensioners who were in need r~-^f^f. the r 1989 was the

earliest practicable date to implement the scheme !lv// m&gt;. pensioners in

question would receive two upratings during the courS9^^(f\\989-90: this

was the essential point to stress in response to any pre^we for the

scheme&apos;s earlier introduction. ^V^/V

The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of State for Social Security ^li/y

to announce the scheme of new benefits for pensioners

in the way he had indicated and noted that the cost

in 1989-90 would be charged against the Reserve.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the price

of shares in British Steel had been announced the previous day. The

final date for bids to purchase shares would be 2 December and it was

Wery important that, during the offer period, Ministers should not say

^nything in public that was relevant to the prospects of the shares in

market.

Inemployment

Iference:

!C(88) 28.1

THE MP^TARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment figures

for 0\&lt;fober had been published the previous week.    The unadjusted total

had fallen by 192,000 since September.    That exceptionally large

reduction could be attributed partly to the effects of the ending of the

postal dispute--and to the impact of new regulations for those below the

age of 18, baciYialso reflected underlying reductions in the seasonally

adjusted tota^oj&gt;^3,900 in S|p)ejtember and 31,500 in October. The

seasonally adjue[ted)jtotal had fallen for 27 consecutive months and

unemployment, wVvtC&amp;^/d fallen by about 700,000 since the General

Election, stood a^^A^million, which represented a rate of 7.7 per

cent.    He would be &amp;&amp;fi&amp;\ing later that day figures on long-term

unemployment which wwuroYaveal a fall of 60,000 in the quarter to

October, a fall of 300^# $ ^n the 12 months to October and a total

reduction of 450,000 in^fieygrevious two years.    Long-term unemployment,

which was falling at a fais^$&lt;^oate than unemployment generally, stood at

886,000.    It was estimatedxo^tjxacancies in the economy as a whole,

which had risen slightly in^t^tprevious month, stood at 700,000: this

indicated that there was scope /fc^rcfurther reductions  in unemployment.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY sa&gt;d^.hat the decision on

23 November by the South African President, Mn/P M Botha, to reprieve

six black Africans sentenced to death for mura^Jk^E^H Sharpevi1le Six)

had followed surprisingly quickly the rejection mtAfe final plea on

their behalf by the South African Appeals Court.of progress had

also been made in the negotiations about Angola ana^ayinAla. The

agreement between the Angolan, Cuban and South Africv^G^&gt; rnments on a

timetable for Cuban troop withdrawal from Namibia was*a (M&gt;r

breakthrough.    With any luck the withdrawal of Cuban trqg {^3Kd the

implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolur^MnX|/35 on

Namibian independence would both get under way during the rr^&gt;\alf of

1989.    There was still a real risk of things going wrong, buATK^Ms

good news as far as it went.    A successful outcome on Cuban tNyjJw/^

withdrawal and independence for Namibia would mark a retreat by/rafyv.


Russians and the Cubans from military adventurism in Africa and the

acceptance by South Africa of a relative decline in its military and

political influence in Namibia and Angola.    The agreement on Cuban

\   troop withdrawal was an achievement of dialogue between the United

States and the Soviet Union.    It was also a very considerable success

X/for the British policy of continuing diplomatic engagement and

^^iWolvement in the region.    The Government&apos;s representations on behalf

\So&amp;\he Sharpeville Six had been made privately and the outcome was not

^ 6rna#hing to boast about publicly.    The United Kingdom had also been

h^J*^J^ involved behind the scenes in support of the negotiations on

Arfg^Cyand Namibia since the United Kingdom had an Embassy in Angola

when^^tiie Americans did not.    The results were also a personal triumph

for H^fchester Crocker, the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs in

the American State Department, whose patient policy of constructive

engagement had finally borne dividends despite the way in which it had

been denounced aver the years by left-wingers.    Developments over

Namibia heldArjutnthe possibility of further reform in South Africa. The

South Africa&apos;SQ^pjrsqsnment had apparently feared that international

pressure on behfalfJaf the Sharpeville Six might lead the new United

States Congress^3^*Sturn to the issue of sanctions against South

Africa.    Whether vrt^jgjjrigress would now be less pressing on this issue

and whether furtherC^I/ewial change would be forthcoming in South

Africa, remained to Ye\|eAi,    But the value of the Government&apos;s own

policy of patient engag^KjSejaX in Southern African was clear.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH slkft&amp;toRX said that other Republics within

the Soviet Union such as Georgia w^r^ beginning to show interest, in

asserting local autonomy,  follow^fig^&amp;e example of the Baltic States.

The Supreme Soviet in Moscow seemd&amp;^wjjS^ear about precisely what signals

it wished to convey to the Baltic STtf ^&gt;in its current discussions of

amendments to the Soviet Constitutiofv^rfpa how far it was prepared to go

toward meeting Baltic concerns.    The despatch to the Baltic States the

previous week of members of the Soviet leadership had not removed this

ambiguity.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^   /5ring the National

and Provincial Assembly elections in Pakistan on lo&apos;VjjJ^Lfl November, the

process of forming a new government was taking longev^J(raV\expected.

Miss Benazir Bhutto remained the most likely candidate rwp^rime

Minister.    If the results of the elections were to be frag  ?^ked the

United Kingdom and the West generally would face difficuN^j^abJems in

the handling of relations with Pakistan. y^C\\


THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the result of the

Canadian General Election had been a personal triumph for the

Conservative leader, Mr Brian Mulroney, who had a majority of 45 seats

V in the new House.    The most important issue for Britain&apos;s relations with

V Canada was the outstanding Canadian decision over the acquisition of

^^luclear attack submarines for the Canadian Navy.    He would be pressing

^^SLjoe Clark, the Canadian Minister for External Affairs, on this when

(y^thASlatter visited the United Kingdom in December after the meeting on

&lt;^fie^mprthern Atlantic Council.

Th^^MML MINISTER said that she had pointed out in Washington that it

woulA/jraife been very difficult if the new Canadian Government had

decid^o not to ratify the new free trade agreement with the United

States^iven that Mr Mulroney had, by his signature,  fully committed

Canada to it.

THE PRIME MINISvEI^&amp;frd that during her visit to Washington from 15 to

17 November she hvfy^to^erved with great interest how well President

Reagan and Presider^f^^Lo^ Bush were handling the transition between the

outgoing and the incxmr^g^dministrations.    President Reagan intended to

make three major speech^fc^&amp;tting out the achievements of his period in

office.    There would be^greal benefits in the continuity that

President-Elect Bush&apos;s sactej&amp;Si^n would bring.    Those appointed to major

office already by Mr Bushw^^Vell known and respected in the United

Kingdom.    Mr Bush would maK&amp;jptkry good President.

The Chairman of the Federal Reyerjj^Aoard, Mr Alan Greenspan, had told

her that there was no inflationavyo^ssure in the United States

economy.    It seemed that there wasf^^jjwrxe natural understanding in the

United States than in the United Krrrarafa .about the role of wages as an

element in costs and prices.    HavingCoejyer had a prices and incomes

policy,  the Americans faced much less wessure over wages.    The budget

deficit, though large in absolute terms, was less than 3 per cent of

American gross domestic product.    Mr Bush recognised the important of

taking measures over the deficit, but would taJee-&gt;his time and discuss

matters fully first with the new Congress.    We Americans were also far

ahead of the British in their attitudes towarYcjp^S&amp;te benefaction. It

was accepted than many aspects of public life ci/ldMe funded by private

giving,  for example the universities and even thV~-iwj!J:bishment of

public buildings such as the State Department; andv-o^t^it was not for

government alone to take on all such responsibilitie\s^^v*\

During her visit the Prime Minister had welcomed as encgwjagong signs

the recent moves by the Palestine National Council and t^^^&apos;pl/.est ine

Liberation Organisation in accepting United Nations SecurN^C/i^cil

Resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for an international coriver^irp-e and

thereby implicitly recognising Israel.    In this her attitudeVW&gt;fi4j:ed

slightly from that of the United States Secretary of State, Mr  e f^ e

Shultz.    But this was not a major bone of contention in Anglo-Afneci^&lt;^

relations.    It was clear that Mr Bush well understood the importarfee^p?


according the Middle East its due place on the international agenda. As

for American preoccupation with developments in Central America and

their close neighbour Mexico, the United Kingdom made a contribution the

. region by maintaining troops in Belize and this was welcomed. During

*\this visit she had also met again Senator Daniel Quayle, the

/^ice-President Elect, who had been present during her discussions with

yA^Zush and the Secretary of State-Elect, Mr James Baker.    She had been

(ydzpk^k by how well briefed Mr Quayle had been on Congressional

a^^iMwdes.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he had recently returned

fro^a visit to the Gulf States and to Saudi Arabia.    He had found

everywhere he went very strong admiration for the United Kingdom. The

role of the AfarttvVa Patrol in Gulf waters was particularly appreciated.

Relations wiojtSaVdi Arabia were extremely good.    He had concluded an

offset agreemen&apos;wyc&apos;owkr ing Stage 2 of the Al Yamamah project. The

potential benefR^s-^ro&apos;Vthe United Kingdom were very considerable.

4.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONW^^^ECRETARY said that there had been a

satisfactory meeting of the Fo^fgiVAffairs Council on 21-22 November.

XTh^e was general agreement on the^fporoach to the Rhodes European

Council on 2-3 December which seems^^ijtely to be a low key occasion.

The intention was to keep the agencfe^J&amp;rt and operational and no

decisions were required.    The impleme^^Jg^regulations for the

Structural Funds had been put in placevf/n a satisfactory basis. As

regards the additionality provision, thVChancellor and he had

considered the position further and had been satisfied that the

regulation would not require any change in the existing public

expenditure treatment of European Community rafoeTa^s and that the text

did not compromise the priority attached to c^Lrai-^i United Kingdom

public expenditure.    The Council had also discus/eojpe prospects for

the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade mid-teV^ ^M^iew in Montreal

on 4-8 December.    The Council&apos;s conclusions had ina@ity/yp*ted the

excellent text negotiated at the Agriculture Council/oH^^15 November

which provided a strong and flexible position for thev^JjnMLsion.

Agreement had also been reached, not without difficulty,yd&amp;Che 1989

Community Generalised Scheme of Preferences on a basis cT^^atj^ble with

what the United Kingdom wanted to achieve for less develop&lt;d^ dfrntries.

There had also been a good political co-operation meeting, tK&gt;/^f/

satisfactory text had been agreed on European^Commiooion/UniteYf&apos;ffi^es

relations.    The statement agreed on the Palestine National Coun&amp;a&lt;f tA|X


Budget O

also been consistent with the United Kingdom&apos;s position despite the wish

of some member states to be more fulsome.    It was not impossible that

the Greeks might announce recognition of the Palestinian state. There

had finally been a clear restatement of the Community&apos;s position on

&gt; Afghanistan.

CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Paymaster General had

 ^reA^esented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Budget Council on

NJavember.    There had been a reasonably satisfactory outcome to the

Cfljjff^iv s consideration of the Community budget for 1989.    A procedure

hatC^j^Ti agreed for negotiation with the Parliament on provision for

vioxi-Dzv^A&amp;ged non-obligatory expenditure which implied a growth above

the iTOvlmum rate.    However the amount involved was relatively small.

The overall outcome was well within the agriculture guideline and the

ceiling agreed in the inter-institutional agreement, and consistent with

the budgetary discipline guidelines.    A small increase  in the United

Kingdom&apos;s abiiremaW had been negotiated for the first time in budgetary

discussions. \S-\ j  v

In a short disc !^*J&gt;fO it was recalled that the United Kingdom&apos;s net

payments to Commuiisr^v^nsti tut ions in 1989-90 were expected to amount to

over  1.9 billion. (5jJ&amp;^,ni ted Kingdom faced a continual need to resist

expenditure bids,  fo^a^apole to take advantage of the savings that had

been made on the agr icu^fcJ&amp;NLl budget or, at the research Council&apos;s

meeting on 17 November &lt;pr Expenditure on aeronautical research, again

largely related to the aNwT^j uNjity of funds.    The extent of the United

Kingdom&apos;s net contributiorM^N^uxd lend authority to its position on such

issues.
