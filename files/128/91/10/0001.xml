1.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that a Boeing

747 aircraft of Pan American Airways, believed to be carrying 243

passengers and 15 crew members, had crashed on to Lockerbie in Scotland

.the previous night,  killing all those on board.    Substantial parts of

1} the aircraft had fallen on to Lockerbie, causing the destruction of

/^bout 20 houses, a petrol station, and cars on the A74, and substantial

*^ cKther damage from fire.    While the full extent of casualties was not

^&gt;JfvN known, present estimates were that around 15 persons on the ground

^&amp;jkmen killed by the crash.    Five people had been taken to hospital,

oNr whpA. two had been discharged,  two had suffered very serious burns,

andXonp^had suffered relatively minor injuries.    The flight, which had

orig^r? t ik in Frankfurt and had been bound for New York, had taken off

from n^CZnrow Airport,  following a change of aircraft.    Shortly after

7.00 pn\r/ ire aircraft had been seen very clearly on radar screens at an

altitudeN^f 31,000 feet but the radar image had then disintegrated,

indicating that the aircraft had broken up at that height.    There had

been no difficulties associated with air traffic control,  the aircraft

had been followiaj^ normal route, and there was no indication of any

other aircraft/Waving been in the vicinity at the time.    The wreckage

had been strewrK2K/rfI3a.n area some 10-15 miles long, and there were at

least six impact Bate*) in the Lockerbie region, of which two were very

large.    The armedN&amp;s^raa were providing personnel,  including a medical

team, and helicopterey^ajftl the emergency services had responded with

great skill and effic\ rc^\  Investigators from his Department&apos;s Air

Accidents InvestigationBvajreh had arrived at the scene of the crash the

previous night and had b^ $&amp;rking since dawn that day but it would be

some time before it would^ei^ssible to reach even a preliminary view

of the cause of the crash.was bound to be pressure for a public

inquiry into the disaster buXV^mler the relevant Aviation Regulations,

if such an inquiry were estabV^nbrc^now, the present investigation would

have to be discontinued.    He acco ^M&lt;ftgly believed that the best course

would be to allow the present iiwesT^ation to get as far as it could,

and then to decide whether the Ai^^c^pttents Investigation Branch should

itself carry our a full inquiry, orWD*Hter there should instead be a

public inquiry.    In either case,  the^&amp;port of the inquiry would be

published.    He believed that it wouldWg^rfnwise to announce the form of

the full inquiry at least until the Ain&amp;ccidents Investigation Branch

had submitted an initial bulletin setting out the facts revealed in the

first stage of the investigation, which he expected to receive within

the following 10-15 days.    He would be making in-^statement about the

crash in the House of Commons later that mornm. \)

The following main points were made in discussio^^^^

a.      It was essential that the cause of the acxfi^ajSk. should

be established as authoritatively and as quicklyx^re^Wsissible, and

this would be a highly technical undertaking.    The lftrp urator

Fiscal for Dumfries would need to hold a fatal acci^feS^vinquiry in

due course, and it was not clear at this stage whetKk^ayv further

public inquiry would serve a useful purpose, provided^-tjw^othe

results of the technical investigation were published.v3wjj neral,

it was important to avoid a plethora of inquiries that cwdttA-

distress for individuals while unearthing no new facts. TJfte/^^


Opposition spokesman on transport, however, appeared to be under

the mistaken impression that it was the routine practice for major

^ accidents in all sectors, including aviation, to be the subject of

 \ public inquiries as well as immediate technical investigations. In

)} fact, that procedure had been followed for very few aviation

accidents.

\&gt;/^/ b.     There were reports of some confusion whether Pan American

//^Xirways or the police were responsible for confirming the names of

&gt;^ resengers on the aircraft, and of difficulty in obtaining this

v^irj^rmation.    It would be desirable, at the very least,  for it to

&lt;  ^aGIde clear when and how the names of passengers would be

CT&gt;fiJtrmed.    On the other hand, passenger lists were subject to

vax^^fon until the moment when flights were closed, and it was

understandable that airline managers were reluctant to be rushed

into confirming names because of the risk of mistakes and the

distress they would cause.

c. If ir//xranspired that the cause of the accident was

sabotage, l D ^SbJ.ications for airline security at Heathrow would

depend on thifwayjin which the transit of passengers and luggage

from FrankfurV-4wo7been accomplished.

d. There wouldCfe0 ^mteneral expectation that a disaster fund

would be establisrredvpa^respect of such a major incident, and that

the Government would^ jOT&gt;oribute to it.    It would be a mistake to

prevaricate over thisG^JTj} the other hand, neither the aircraft nor

its passengers were Br&quot;t M\ and it was not yet clear that many

people on the ground wo^O^r^&amp;quire assistance.    The private

houses affected would pre^jjajferolv be covered by insurance. Two

local councillors had on thyfe^aoio that morning criticised the

media for exaggerating the ext/p^of the damage to Lockerbie.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the t^s 3fi^Bion, said that the Cabinet

would wish to put on record their conaylfenAes for those bereaved and

injured in the disaster at Lockerbie. vsjj&lt;r had already sent a messge to

this effect to President Reagan.    They vwuld also wish to express their

appreciation of the swift and effective operation which the emergency

services had mounted.    It was essential that the cause of the disaster

should be identified as soon as possible, and t&gt;rj&gt;. indicated that the

present investigation by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch of the

Department of Transport should be pressed aheaoi2y&lt;E&gt;was not clear that

any further public inquiry would be required in i/di^lon to the local

Procurator Fiscal&apos;s inquiry,  and no commitments abejjr^such a further

inquiry should therefore be made.    The appropriate %o$?Minent

contribution to a disaster fund could not be settled Vam^ttXthe full

effect on the local community was somewhat clearer, ana wysOeum would

need to be settled in the light of recent relevant precertfeJrcSS,.

Nevertheless, there would be a widespread expectation tha^\^ra&apos;

Government should make such a contribution,  and the SecretaTr^^rfXstate

for Transport should make it clear that if a disaster fund v^WoMned,

then the Government would make an appropriate contribution to^fizi/SLri

the short term, it needed to be clarified who was responsible f/^yv


confirming and releasing the names of those who had been passengers on

the aircraft.    More generally,  the Secretary of State should give as

much detail as he could about the major operations that were being

&quot;n- mounted in response to this tragedy: his statement would be listened to

^ias much in the United States of America as in the United Kingdom, and it

&gt;^hjs important that it should be as positive as possible.    The Secretary

v*OoWState for Scotland had been quick to visit Lockerbie, and had told

^\b jyby telephone that morning that the response of the emergency

Ms p &gt;^es had been superb.    She herself would visit Lockerbie later that

?ijHel&amp;abinet -

1. ^A^ecorded their condolences for those bereaved and injured in

theMfir crash at Lockerbie, and their gratitude for the work of the

emergency services.

2. Invited 4^he Secretary of State for Transport to make a

statement /yff~ahe disaster in the House of Commons later that day,

and to be Vgjy.&lt;J kin it by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the

discussion. (( ))

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FQR^JXIHERN IRELAND said that the decision of

the Northern Ireland Appe^^Xourt overturning a recent Coroner&apos;s ruling

there that he did not have^Hiw^jJWer to order certain police officers to

attend an inquest was a veryy^e^r us development which had potentially

far-reaching implications for\bJ?j ^r inquests in Northern Ireland still

to be held.    This was primarily^^iakter for the Attorney General but

his own view was that the GovernWnt  ould have to take the matter to

the House of Lords.    As the AppealT^Cfourt1 s decision stood, members of

the security forces in Northern Ire^^(yL-*K3uld in future be required to

appear at inquests into deaths causea&apos;S^uy terror is t incidents, even

though they could not be obliged to majre^Catements which might have the

effect of incriminating them. vT

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE, agreeing with the Secretary of State

for Northern Ireland, said that the problems of^grotecting the identity

of members of the security forces from disclo9vrewuring inquests in

Northern Ireland would be much more difficult \hj^K-i~t had been at the

inquest in Gibraltar into the deaths of three IriBh iepublican Array

terrorists.    The potential damage arising from dv&amp;ipjfyre of the

identity of security forces in Northern Ireland was&gt;^^ &gt;greater.

2.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the positive vote

by the Israeli Labour Party on 21 December had guaranteed the formation

of a further broad coalition between Likud and the Labour Party,

\ following the recent Israeli elections, With his move to the Finance

/Ministry,  the influence of Mr Shimon Peres over foreign policy had been

&apos;xi^Kluted.    His successor as Foreign Minister was Mr Moshe Arens, a

^a&amp;d-liner.    The prospect was not therefore for a very positive response

^^XjXe peace process but an aggressive expansion of settlements in the

o *2*pj e^d territories would probably also be avoided.

revious

eference:

C(88) 34.3

THE FORE^dflAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the former Prime

Minister^Mr Ranasinghe Premadasa, had won the Presidential election in

Sri Lanka.    It had been a relatively peaceful and fair poll, despite the

claims by his opponent, Mrs Sirima Bandaranaike, that there had been

foul practice. prospect was for some continuity in policy.

Mr Premadasa wa/plyldged to seek the departure from Sri Lanka of Indian

troops but it wow^d^S^ difficult to achieve this at an early date.

China

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOKJftE ENVIRONMENT said that, during his recent

visit to China,  the Chinet&amp;K&amp;iVernment had indicated that they would be

prepared to participate in\Xh^/&gt;nternational conference on the

protection of the ozone layep^wfvch the United Kingdom was convening.

If confirmed,  this would be aoAHrLe&apos;bme development since the issue was

clearly a difficult one for Ch^JraTA^ a developing country.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVi #fSENT said that while he had been

in China it had also been announced J$*t China and the Soviet Union

would meet, probably in the followin^&apos;H*^  to discuss future relations

between the two countries.    It was expWx^iA that this would lead to a

normalisation of relations but that tno/bvo countries would not become

anywhere near as close as had been the c$ee during the 1950s.

3.      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE FISHERIES and FOOD J^X^fcat no

decisions had been reached at the resumed meeting of the^M^culture

Council on 19-20 December.    Discussions would be taken uV^ga^Mi in

January.   Major outstanding issues included the beef suppaVt^^^gime an&lt;*

imports of New Zealand Butter and sheepmeat.   The Irish Miny^t^\&gt;f

Agriculture, Mr O&apos;Kennedy, had threatened to invoke the Luxe^rooura

Compromise in relation to the Commission&apos;s proposals on beef, ^jj^

I ) Decembg^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at its meeting on

19 December the Foreign Affairs Council had reviewed the outcome of the

General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Mid-Term Meeting in Montreal.

\The discussions had strengthened recognition of the need for flexibility

/from the Community in the resumed negotiations on agriculture in April.

^isN^regards the proposed ban on imports from the United States of meat

^yrexted with hormones, a derogation for pet food had been agreed which

y$ffd*}imit the scope of the dispute.    It had also been possible to

av/iftJrQ. decision to undertake automatic counter-retaliation following

expecApe^United States trade action when the ban came into effect on

ew

i ommission:

illocation of

Iortfolios

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the allocation of

portfolios amongst the members of the new Commission had now been

completed.    It wa^very satisfactory that Mr Brittan had been given

responsibility not ^ly for Competition Policy but also Financial

Institutions, sraZSa^Efth were areas of particular importance in the

run-up to 1992.    TnefioJrmer single market portfolio had been split into

three.    Financial s^irjftfjes, as noted, had been added to Mr Brittan&apos;s

portfolio.    Madame ScTip^ttT would have responsibility for tax issues.

The remainder had beenv^Hjrroated to Herr Bangemann, whose approach as an

economic liberal to tecfinrea-o s ingle market issues was likely to be

satisfactory.    Mr Millan J *$K&gt;  n allocated regional policy, an area of

considerable United Kingdom^Qjvcerest and major Community expenditure.

Other welcome decisions incM *wie allocation to Mr Andriessen, the

former Agricultural CommissioSrervpA external trade policy. Less

satisfactory was the allocation^^/rasponsibility for relations with

Latin America and Mediterranean mra, to Senor Matutes and for social

affairs to Mrs Papandreou.    The allo a\j.on of the agriculture portfolio

to the Irish Commissioner, Mr MacSfraxr^!^ was particularly unwelcome.
