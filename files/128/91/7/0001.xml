[f Patrick

Ryan

3^ ATTORNEY GENERAL said that he understood that the Opposition were

 J5r a ing for him to make a statement in the House of Commons about the

the former Roman Catholic priest, Patrick Ryan, and that if a

sta^eme^t were not volunteered the Speaker was likely to grant a Private

NotifyWfistion.    His own preference would be to deal with the matter

throuqjE^rVPrivate Notice Question, since he did not wish to appear to be

respondX/g^o a misguided comment attributed to the Speaker that the

House ofS^Commons should have been informed of facts given to the media.

WhicheverVroute was adopted, however, he would welcome the opportunity

to give a full account of the events in this case since the previous

Friday, when theBelgian Government had refused the extradition request

for Ryan and hay^mtead repatriated him to the Irish Republic.    A great

deal of distor\kd information was being put about in connection with

this case, but  n /^af\i.c facts were simple.    Ryan, who had been picked

up by the Belgian\^H*3y ftities ^n tne summer, was wanted for trial in

this country on a ni^JH^a^/jpf serious charges reflecting deep involvement

with the Provisional /wJrfNiiepublican Army (PIRA).    When it began to

appear that the Belgia^a^rnorities might not accede to the extradition

request, preparation was vwJeXtaken of the papers that would be needed

to support a request to CW^Inish Republic in the event that Ryan was

sent to that country.    As \bM^i it was learned that Ryan was, in fact,

being sent to the Irish Repu^^&amp;Vall the necessary documentation was

immediately sent to the Irisn\Ap irney General to enable him to take the

necessary steps for a provisiorraYArf^rant for Ryan&apos;s arrest to be

executed by the Gardai.    These dtcume^ts included warrants for Ryan&apos;s

arrest; a statement of facts alleged; &gt;r&gt;statement of the law; and a

certificate by himself of the inten^^*jL-fro prosecute Ryan, based upon a

sufficiency of admissable evidence. *^X$re documents were sent to the

Irish authorities by fax transmission pm on Friday 25 November,

and the original documents were deliver^if to the authorities in Dublin

on the following morning.    He himself covrld not get a response to

telephone calls to the Irish Attorney General during the weekend but

eventually succeeded in speaking to him at 10.30 am on Monday

28 November to stress that speed was of the esaenca if Ryan were to be

arrested before he went to ground:  in the event^j^Ryarv. le f t hospital at

noon that day,  though the British authorities hadf/nombeen informed of

this until five hours later.    Although it was beiivg^^gested that there

were defects in the documentation that had been supfJ-^/dpto the Irish

authorities, that was not the case.    Two incidents wey^&lt;^V wever, being

misrepresented.    First, the useful working practice ha^Tg^ajWi up of

sending the Irish Attorney General&apos;s office draft warranfr^J^X

extradition cases for any comments they might wish to of re^in) advance

of the actual warrants being prepared.    That practice had b^e^^ftillowed

in this case, and the Irish Attorney General&apos;s Department hao^m^a^two

minor suggestions, which were both taken into account in the x^rfay

warrants.    Second, when the warrants were certified at iow Stree/*^C e


Clerk of the Court had failed to date the certificate: an Irish official

had given an assurance by telephone on Saturday 26 November that this

&quot;!&gt;    defect was not serious, and could be rectified on the following Monday,

? A but,  in the event,  it was rectified immediately, on the same day. The

^//overall situation,  therefore, was that the Irish Attorney General had

/^^f 5i days been in possession of all the documents enabling a

vTwptfyisional warrant to be issued for Ryan&apos;s arrest, and had failed to

^^dJ^^any action whatsoever, even to the extent of making comments or

cwu^We on the documents.    Effective extradition arrangements required

swi^^J&amp;cision-making, as was exemplified by the fact that provisional

arrest/^Jar rants only had a validity of 3 days.    The Irish authorities&apos;

total^ttTABility to act in a timely fashion in the present case made it

clear  ypi/fe had been on sound ground when we had objected at &quot;he time

to the  l*t that the Irish Attorney General was given a role in the

Irish exfr^dition legislation in 1987.

In discussion, the following main points were made:

a.    It apof/arelj) that the Belgian courts were prepared to authorise

Ryan&apos;s surre^?r^v and that the Belgian Cabinet had decided the

matter on ma\olj/Ael it ical considerations.    This was deplorable,

and was in mar^jfr/ontrast to the way in which the Home Secretary

had dealt with tair^xtr adit ion to Belgium of those charged with

offences in the frg^Vl^football stadium disaster.    It should,

however, be borne in nttd that the religious dimension loomed large

in Belgian politics Cmrep&apos;Wiat the Belgian Government was a new

coalition that had ncV^ejs^/pvience in facing up to tests such as a

hunger strike by a forma^^ls^an Catholic priest.    With hindsight,

it might have been bettew&gt;Vji^without trespassing on the proper

rights of jurisdiction oIQmd^p 1 gian authorities in this case,

more had been done to brief^&gt;rie%elgian and other governments in a

similar position about the na^^VeVof the terrorist threat and the

vital need to stand up to it.   JPj e Home Secretary had earlier that

week left a visiting delegation^rff^Relgian parliamentarians in no

doubt about the strength of the G*ye^taent&apos;s feelings, but the

delegation were muddled and understandably defensive.

b.    Ryan&apos;s arrival in the Irish Republic came at an awkward time

for the Irish authorities, since it happened late on a Friday and

the Taoiseach and the&apos; Tanaiste were both B^rtyk recovering from

their illnesses.    Initially, the Irish auWhorVfcies may also have

felt that the action taken by the Belgian GotoeThhaent indicated that

there was some major flaw in the case be ing Vixje^Afi^ed for Ryan&apos;s

surrender.    Since then, however, Ryan&apos;s importjrf&gt;y&lt;/had been made

quite clear to the Irish Government and it had hfefl^^ftointed out to

them that he was undoubtedly in possession of a g^alvdeal of vital

information for combatting terrorism in the Irish Re (j&amp;P\ic as well

as the United Kingdom.    Depite this, the Irish autho^ciete had

allowed Ryan to go to ground and it now appeared unlTb^fcf/bhat they

would reach a decision in the case at least until the dr^Ar^s in

the Dail on the renewal of the Irish extradition legisla\ipjW)n


the following Tuesday and Wednesday.    This behaviour raised

doubts about their compliance with the spirit of the Anglo-Irish

Agreement, and made it difficult to defend the Agreement against

a growing number of critics.

c.    Extradition was a peculiarly emotive matter in Irish politics

^    and the Ryan case contained all the ingredients for a major

political dispute, which would delight PIRA.    While&apos; the Government

/vsould clearly not betray any hint of weakness in pursuing the Ryan

,/^C^se, it was equally important that the damage to broader

&apos;  ff&amp;ectives should be limited so far as possible.    Our larger aim

^wsS^o ensure that the arrangements for bringing terrorist suspects

tyyfr^al worked efficiently throughout Europe,  including the Irish

Remjciic.    It should also be borne in mind that the Anglo-Irish

Agreement had led to much improved cooperation between police

forces on a range of security matters not involving extradition.

Against that background,  it would be best for any account offered

by the Att^Sbey General to refrain from speculating about the

motives &lt;/( th(^ Irish authorities and to limit itself to a cool

recital o^S^Kle-^Sacts, which spoke for themselves.

d.    Some Gover^Wt supporters had spoken of Ryan as though his

guilt had been Bn&lt;5$j ^  anc* this had been used to support claims

that Irish terrcr^rc^uspects could not expect a fair trial in the

United Kingdom.    In^w&amp;wering questions in the House of Commons on

29 November the Priraj^MYtoister had been careful to make it clear

that it was for the^o&gt;rzsv to pronounce on guilt and innocence, and

it was important that ^JHJ^W speaking on behalf of the Government

should be scrupulous on^TrLs^poin t.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up ^^e^ys cuss ion, said that the behaviour

of the Irish authorities in the Rv^/f&apos;vase sapped confidence in their

willingness to combat terrorism in !&gt;Hjr spirit of the Anglo-Irish

Agreement, and made that Agreement^jrfifia^ to many as a hollow sham.

Excuses made on behalf of the Be lgi anvand^Ir ish authorities for failing

to take the action that had been requev5&gt;ea of them in this case showed

an under-estimation of the terrorist threat.    The Government should not

be deflected.    The Cabinet agreed that, in order to dispel widespread

misinterpretations,  it would be helpful if the Attorney General could

that day give the House of Commons a factual a e*fcint of the handling of

the request for Ryan&apos;s surrender that had beeHmave to the Irish

authorities.    The Lord President should arrangS-^fleTVthe Speaker of the

House of Commons to be informed that the Attorno^G^jnpjral would be glad

to answer a Private Notice Question on the matter .syl /

The Cabinet - &lt;iwCv

1.    Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of tft &lt;^/\\

discussion and invited the Lord President of the

Council and the Attorney General to proceed according]LV^O\




THE HOME SECRETARY said that the European Court of Human Rights had

ruled earlier that week in the case of Brogan and others v the United

Kingdom that detention of a terrorist suspect for four days and six

hours under the Prevention of Terrorism Act was contrary to Article 5 of

k the European Convention on Human Rights.    This represented an even

^stricter view than that of the European Commission on Human Rights which

(Oi^d advised that detention was permissible for up to five days.    He was

&gt;j^xfSar that a solution would need to be found which would, con t inue to

terrorist suspects to be detained for an adequate period. He

\p&lt;flA\end the Prime Minister a note of the options, which she might

wi^^tj^yiiscuss with colleagues most closely concerned.    He would be

expefl^a^to give a broad indication of the Government&apos;s intentions in

the oqg ^V on the Second Reading of the Prevention of Terrorism

(Temporor^provis ions) Bill on Tuesday 6 December.

In discussion the point was made that a number of members of the

European Court of Human Rights were not from judicial backgrounds. It

was open to question whether it was acceptable for members of the Court,

which exercisejy^nyimportant judicial function, to include persons with

no judicial expAij:il c^ in their domestic courts.

THE PRIME MINISTElQ^^rtftiing up the discussion, said that the European

Court of Human Righ^^fa^ld not be relied upon to bring to bear a full

appreciation of the hg^fe^for some of the United Kingdom&apos;s legal

requirements.    The Hom^S^c^tary should bring forward proposals for

responding to the Court&apos;s^&amp;xrvement on powers of detention,  in the way

which he had indicated.

decision not to grant a visa to the leader of the P^Ta^fe^ne Liberation

Organisation, Mr Yasser Arafat, permitting him to go (J^I&amp;Vj York to

address the United Nations General Assembly, appeared xfoviwe been taken

personally by the United States Secretary of State, Mr Gsw^^Shultz,

without consultation with others in the Administration,   ^^hjajd since

been discussed in the United Nations.    The United Kingdom rvad^&amp;Btained

on the General Assembly Resolution condemning the United Sta^Ses^because

the language of the Resolution was too strong.    It was imporrwprt^trhat

the United Kingdom maintain a reputation for balanced judgment a/*i^J^


thereby preserve its ability to influence the thinking of the United

States Administration.    There had been some disappointment among .the

Arabs at the United Kingdom&apos;s abstention.    It now seemed probable that

!\  the General Assembly would transfer its debate on the Palestinian issue

Jj to Geneva in order to permit Mr Arafat to participate.    The United

;XVVingdom would attend the Geneva session and would treat the agenda there

 \pK*.its merits.    The member states of the European Community had all

v^rd/pted the same position on the substance of the United States

avy&amp;xon, subject only to the United Kingdom&apos;s reservation on the

ran &lt; tge of the Resolution.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the current meeting of

the Supreme Soviet in Moscow was a substantial session.    It would

consider the constitutional changes proposed by President Gorbachev at

the party confe^Sb^ of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in June:

that is to sayfche{Jelec t ion of an Executive President, the establishment

of a new styleNJeb^re^s of People&apos;s Deputies, provision that the new

Supreme Soviet shrajj^/peet for two annual sessions each lasting three to

four months,  and th^ tk at i on of committees to monitor constitutional

questions and foreig^/jrajairs.    Elections were scheduled for spring

1989.    On the quest ion^^&amp;^Jianges touching devolution of responsibility

to individual Republics wvfc^pbi the Soviet Union such as the Baltic

States,  the response by Of ^5wiet leadership in Moscow had to strike a

balance between not opposlAg^jA* t ides of local nationalist opinion too

strongly and not peraitt ing s^tfmich autonomy and independence as to

threaten the integrity of thaN.Swy&apos;ftet system as a whole.    They did not

yet seem to have got the balan&lt;tfgyrn^\t.    In the Transcaucasus the

trouble between Armenia and Azeiro^W^an was worse than ever.    There had

so far been 28 deaths  including fo^^&apos;sAldiers.    There were signs that

Islamic  fundamentalists were invoived^^A refugee problem was fast

developing, with thousands fleeing i^SS^i directions between Armenia

and Azerbaidjan.    The West had no inteVf^jeOin seeking to exploit these

events politically.    Given the GovernmetV^s position on non-recognition

de jure of Soviet rule in the Baltic Stages it would be necessary to

steer a careful course between low key support for Baltic

self-determination and inflammatory or unhelpful statements in a

delicate situation.

In a brief discussion,  it was noted that there wa^&apos;ayJanger that the

nationalities issue in the Soviet Union, if it go^od^of hand, could

derail the reform programme of President Gorbachev.y^^aa\eav\y wanted

to go a good deal further down the path of reform wh Lc^v^SKh ad charted.

But failure to master the nationalities question as i^iwsviow

developing in the Baltic States as well as in Georgia, Aze&gt;  &gt;*id j an and

Armenia, might well be exploited to his disadvantage by ^y/^y\

President Gorbachev&apos;s internal opposition.

THE SECRETARY FOR EMPLOYMENT said that his discussions earlier

in the week with ^ne^foanish Employment Minister, Senor Chaves, had left

him with the impres^raj)l/that Spain would not press social issues unduly

during their forthcom/jre^Presidency.    There might be more difficulty in

this area with the suCro^n^g French Presidency.    In the immediate

future, the Spanish GoverftajJ&amp;t faced the prospect domestically of a

national strike linked tcvjtfp/fato objections to a youth employment

programme.    In discussionN^t^aA noted that the United Kingdom&apos;s

approach to the social dimena^wv^jn the Community laid stress on

training and employee share 6^&lt;n&gt;^j?^iip schemes.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIR^Jrtleftfr&apos; said that Lord Caithness had

represented the United Kingdom at a suida^^ful meeting of the

Environment Council on 24 November.    Tfie^way had been cleared for

implementation of measures for further reduction in exhaust emissions

from small cars.    Agreement had been reached on a directive regulating

discharges of titanium dioxide.    The legal base for the directive would

be one of the environmental articles introduced^TKVer the Single

European Act requiring unanimity.    The Commission&apos;Vbid for a Community

directive on wild life habitats had been rejecteajy^mis very

satisfactory result had been achieved without i s cvta&amp;^AH\ o f the United

Kingdom.    The United Kingdom initiative in calling &amp;fi/iynji&amp;rnational

conference on the protection of the ozone layer, and /to^jta tent ion to

host the second meeting of the parties to the Montrea^&amp;roty&amp;col in 1990,

had been warmly welcomed except by the Belgians, who had t-Jtaaeelves been

preparing to offer to be hosts at the latter occasion.




THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND .-INDUSTRY said that there wore

persisting problems over the export to France of cars manufactured by

Nissan UK Limited (NMUK).    The French Government had taken the view that

these cars would be counted against the limit of 3 per cent imposed by

v France on direct imports of cars from Japan.    There had been recent

/indications that Spain were proposing to follow the same approach. It

&apos;Vwis possible that the Italians might do so as well.    The Nissan cars

vp^yduced in the United Kingdom had at present a 70 per cent local

^ro/t*nt which would rise to 80 per cent by the first half of 1991.

TrreKC&amp;rs therefore fully satisfied the requirements of Community origin

rulfj^^Local content of 60 per cent was sufficient to permit duty free

imporjs^tnto the Community of cars produced even in European Free Trade

Asso wrCS3n countries.    In a brief discussion it was suggested that

there v&amp;eVV^ome doubts about the French position and

Presideiyt^wi t terrand had indicated on the previous day that it had not

been brou^it to his attention.    Nevertheless the French would be in an

indefensible position if they were taken to the European Court of

Justice on this issue.    The Commission had so far not responded to a

direct questioiy^iS^ther they regarded NMUK cars as of European Community

origin.    It wai(poaiible that the present Commissioner was seeking to

play out time orr-^J^vyestion.    If there were to be a question of a

Court action,  it iroyjra/ie desirable for the Commission&apos;s position to be

clearly establisheap^^/hat leverage could in turn be put on the French

and others.    A successrrJH^resolution of this issue would improve the

prospects for future JV^roe^e investment in the United Kingdom.

Summing up the discussio Prime Minister invited the Secretary of

State for Trade and IndustS^L-^A^prepare a note on the current state of

discussion on the basis of wT*o&lt;$v^he and the Foreign Secretary could

pursue the matter with the FrAnVh^overnment and the Commission during

the forthcoming European CouncCj&apos;^rt&apos;pRhodes.

THE SECRET/^B^ STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he proposed to make a

statement irm(5^Mlpuse of Commons on the following Monday about the

White Paper oi^remMoyraent which he would be publishing that day. The

White Paper woU^^At out the Government&apos;s proposed action to combat a

number of the ma^Kp:riers to employment.    The subjects covered

included the abol^^^flkof Wages Councils,  on which he would publish a

consultative docume^^m^^iltaneously with the White Paper; possible

further legislation ikajJ^ on industrial relations,  for example to make

unlawful the pre-entry^Ko^ed shop;  action in the forthcoming Social

Security Bill to encourage those who were not actively looking for jobs

to take up work; and new arrangements for training.    The proposals on

training were the most important feature of the White Paper and included

the establishment of new employei^led local Training and Enterprise

Councils to plan and deliver t^^Emng and to promote the development of

small businesses; consul tat ion ^B^O^a view to moving the Industrial

Training Boards onto a non-statu^^^^masis;  and the privatisation of as
