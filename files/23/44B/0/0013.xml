Kerr thro^i KerrSSrgmann, both of which -are substantially the some.lord D*Aborncn   then read out a nsmorastduti on the purport.of theseconvernations   .a follows:-:rr.  -;chroedi;r asked to sec me thia morning and oaidthat the German Delegation   as surprised at the bad rs-cspticn their proposals hud not with on Tuaaday.     Hethcigit they h-d not been fully understood, and thatth-^y visvs less far removed from the iJnris proposalsthan had been thought.     Vhere could be no questionno to the rsadineoa of the German Government to payup to the limits of its capacity, and xhe suspicion that Stinnes and other big in duct rials had had * dcter-mining influence on the German proposals win quitesrronecus.On specific points the German Govarn-D^nt had con-aidarad th it thair offer guvs tha Entente, for thefirsst five years, practically the same aum as thatwhich accrued to the-0, anisr the-^ario proposals.Thus -^ariaS mil Liarda a year for C y sara )3 milliards a y aar for 3 years)whareas the Gar/nan proposal, wr.a13 milliardB.1 milliard a year for b y eax*s, *. *. 0 milliards plusan iy milliard lo&amp;n paid at once,which would, therefore, equal 10 Milliards(deferred paymant)equals - lb sillierdeas compared with 13 milliards.
 the difference of 2 milliards being a representation of the fact that in the German proposal there was no 12 per cent exports tax.

 I gathered that the German view was that the real meaning of the German proposal had not been properly brought out in Dr. Simon&apos;s speech - notably, that the acceptance by Germany of the principle of an increasing payment with increasing prosperity had not been sufficiently made clear.

 At the end of the conversation Dr. Schroeder said -

"The two stand-points of French public opinion and German public opinion are so diverse that no agreement appears possible as regards capital sum. We are therefore, thrown back on some provisional arrangement. Cannot a provisional arrangement be made on the following basis?

"The Reparation Commission to act under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles to fix the total of damage and also to examine Germany&apos;s capacity to pay (see Article 234 and paras. 9 and 12b of Annex II of Part VIII). Pending the result of this enquiry Germany to pany reparation on the basis of the Paris decisions for five years; it being understood that Germany has the right to borrow to complete the payment of these annuities if her Budget resources are insufficient; it being also understood that Germany would give up none of her rights under the Versailles Treaty, notably Articles 234 and paras. 9 and 12b of Annex II, and that she would count on the Allies, through the Reparation Commission, fixing the total indebtedness before the end of the five years, giving Germany a just opportunity to be heard."

 Dr. Simons was very anxious to see me to discuss matters. I replied that I thought there was no good in our meeting unless there was some agreement as to a general basis, but I would take the instructions on H.M.G. on the matter.

 Monsieur Briand said that this proposal was tantamount to going back to the idea of making arrangements for five years and leaving the rest indefinite. Simons had suggested seeing him, Monsieur Briand, this morning, but Monsieur Laurent had seen Von Simson instead, whose story was such the same. The Prime Minister said that what the Allies wanted was cash and not a new surrender on the part of Germany. He was therefore, in favour of doing his utmost to come to an arrangement. This could not be done by means of formal
 speeches like those of yesterday. Private conversations were essential. It would be a great misfortune if Dr. Simons reappeared on Monday with a new proposal which might be better than the original one, but still one which the Allies could not accept. He was in favour of informal conversations provided the Allies were agreed as to what they wanted. The best plan of all would be if we could get the German Delegation to agree to something which was equivalent to the Paris proposals. It would, however, be very bad if we had another breach, because what we wanted was not more trouble but actual payment from Germany. At Spa, the real business had been done at private meetings between himself and Monsieur Millerand and Dr. Simons. He was, therefore, in favour of Monsieur Briand and himself seeing Dr. Simons the following day.

Monsieur Briand said that he agreed to this proposal.

 The Prime Minister then said that he thought that a part of the arrangement might be that each country might accept a method of payment by Germany which suited itself: for instance, France might accept a large proportion of payment in the form of labour and material: Great Britain might accept payment in the form of reduction on debts owed to Germany. It would clearly be very difficult to find any method which suited all countries equally.

 Monsieur Briand agreed and said that he was perfectly agreeable to such a scheme provided there was agreement.

 The Prime Minister then asked Monsieur Briand&apos;s view as to the suggestion that the Allies might agree to accept the Paris terms for, say, five years, leaving the Reparation Commission to fix the total amount at a later stage, or, to an alternative suggestion made by Lord D&apos;Abernon that the Germans should 
accept the Paris terms as a whole new, subject to the right to reopen the question five or ten years hence.

Monsieur Foucheur pointed out that the French Government had the greatest difficulty in securing agreement in Paris. If they could make an arrangement with the Germans now which was equivalent of it, the French Parliament would accept it, but if it involved concessions, they would reject it without the least hesitation.

Lord D&apos;Abernon said that in his judgment it was equally impossible for the German Government to accept the Paris proposals as they stood.

Monsieur Foucheur said that what was necessary was some method of transforming the Parish proposals so that they remained equivalent in substance, but different in form. He objected to the idea of permitting the Germans to reopen the question after five years, for if so, the French Government would equally claim the right to reopen it. What everybody now wanted was finality. The French Government would accept nothing else but the equivalent of the Parish proposals.

The Prime Minister said that he thought it only added to the difficulties if we insisted on the Germans accepting the Paris proposals without modification. It simply meant another Versailles Treaty, which the Germans would accept under dictation, but which would not have the moral force and sanction of a bargain. It would be far better to make an arrangement as the result of a certain amount of discussion leading to modification which would be of value to Germany but not of serious moment to the Allies, which the German parliament could accept as a voluntary agreement, than to impose another settlement by force.

Monsieur Briand said that the Germans came to London in order to 
- b -haggle.     They wanted to find the weakness of th* Alii adcaae.     If the Allies had not reject ad their proposals atthe outsat, they would already hare bean n -istsra of theConference.     If the Allies remain firm, the Gexwano will realise that concession is impossible and thay will accept our proposals.     The Prime &quot; ininter&apos;s speech had had a greateffect in spite of previous propaganda in favour of notaccepting responsibility for the war.J.t was than agreed that Lord 3&apos; Abarnon and TfonoieurLoucheur should seat in the course of tha evening to findjo-ia equivalent that could be suggested to Dr. Simons the
