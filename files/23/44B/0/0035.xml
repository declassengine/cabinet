THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Conference that hewas to meet L. Clemenceau on the following day, and he wisheto consult his colleagues as to the line that he should takeHe himself thought it -sight be best if he net IU Oleneneeauilone,  in order that they might clear the air by 3. franktalk before any Conference waa -held with other AlliedMinisters,,    It would probably be necessary to invite SignorScialo^a to soiae of the meetings,  and his own opinion wasthat it roi^ht be as well to send an invitation to the Aineri-can Ambassador.    Unfortunately, the conversations which hadhithe go taken place with Sip,nor Scialoja had proved absolutly fruitless, as the Italian Foreign minister neither hadany suggestions to make himself, nor had he any authority toaccept any suggestions of ours.    Mr Lloyd George said thathe attached the greatest importance to a very early meeting,in Italy, Eh&amp;lahd, or elsewhere, of really responsible Minis-ters with authority to sign Agreements.THE SECRETARY OP STATF FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreedthat an invir it ion should be sent to Mr Davis to &quot;be presentat meetings when Signer Scialoia attended., but he was quitecertain that &apos;Jr Davis would be party to no decision.    Hethought that a number of talks with       Olemenceau might bemore profitable than one prolonged Conference.It was agreed  That invitations should be sent to theAmerican Ambassador and Signor Soialoiato attend certain Conferences to be heldin the course of the next few days, whenthe questions of the Adriatic and Turkeyvt***e dmpcussed.THE PRILIF MINISTER then asked what he should say to 15.Clemenceau.THE SECRETARY. OP STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS  suggestedthat he should speak rather on the lines on which he hadspoken to ii. Loucheur when the latter had lunched with hi arecently, when the Prime L-inis-te ^ had pointed out how thingswere drifting and how the United States were practicallydropped out..   He had further complained of the tons of the
French Press, which was inspired by the Quai d&apos;Orsay and which was to be deplored at a time when things were so critical. How was it possible to make Peace in the Middle East when the atmosphere was poisoned by Allied Press attacks? The second point was that things were drawing to a hand in Morocco. The French thought that they had Syria in their hands, that they had squared Feisul, and they now intended to turn Tangier into a French Naval Possession. A third point to which the Prime Minister might refer was the question of the guarantee of the integrity of French soil. This was our strongest weapon, and should be kept in reserve. Parliament had accepted the guarantee so long as the United States were associated with us, but if we came in alone it was doubtful whether it would be approved. He hoped that the two Prime Ministers would not get tangled up with the narrower Issues involved, i.e., the borders of Palestine, the Dan-Beersheba line, or the limits of Arab sphere. As regards Constantinople, was it to remain with the Turk, and, if not, what kind of administration was to be his setup? The French had recently changed their attitude; at first they had wanted to take over the administration of Constantinople. They had then receded from this position, and then, after the withdrawal of the United States, they had revived the proposal for an Anglo-French administration with an Anglo-French Police Force, and so on, leading to a condominium, which would be a certain source of friction,in his opinion, out of which we should eventually clear with disgust. Lord Curzon said that he was in favour of an International Commission administering Constantinople and the Straits. If it were necessary to make concessions to Moslem and Indian sentiment, he would transfer the capital of Turkey to Asia Minor and leave the Sultan in a "Vatican" on the Straits. Two further proposals had been made; one was to have definite spheres of economic control for the French, the Italians and the Greeks; and the second, to
have mie 3?nwer tc control the gendar. -arijg;.  ft not he s* theCus+oms, so forth. &quot;THE LOHD PRESID&apos;&quot;LIT CP TH? COUi-OIL said that his ownplan was  (a) The Greeks to have Smyrna,and(o) The Italians to be granted priorecononie concessions in the areaallotte* to them under the S,-kes-Picot. As?&quot;eerient.    /He did not think it t^b necessary to work out the detailsof this at present.    &apos;ffhat &apos;fwe ourselves really wanted wasfree ingress for our goods.    He reminded the Conference thatwhat we had obtained in I-lesopotamia was. enormous, whereasthe Italians were in reality  recei^ina very little.   He sug-gested that ve should follow roughly the lines of the Agree-ment of 1916, which -^ave ilesopota. .im to the British, Syriaand Gilicia to the French,  and South Asia llinor to the Ital-ians.    His o&quot;:n vie*r was that the Italians would accept muchless than t-..ey were entitled to claim.THF SWG^TARY OF &quot;TATg FOR INDIA thought that muchdepended upon the way in which the negotiations were conduct-ed.    He suggested that, in granting concessions t* the Itali-ans, care should be t alien to - avoid any appearance of parti-tioning up Asia Elinor among the Allies.    If it was intendedto turn Turkey out  of Constantinople, he did not think theso-called &quot;Vatican&quot; solution was any real solution so far asLloslem sentiment was concerned..    The Hoslems did claim thesovereignty, however titular and shadowy, of Constantinople.He agreed that an International Commission was the rightsolution, but ha would have a Treaty with the Turks forcingthe Sultan to ha^e Constantinople and. the Straits adminis-te-ed by a Commission in the Sultan&apos;s na. e.    He wag -anxiousto kno&quot;&apos; ^hat it. was proposed to do with Adrianople.   The   -further one went North of the Straits the more Turkish thepopulation became.    Briefly, he agreed entirely with l&quot;rBalfour about Italy,  and he did not quarrel with the sug-gestion that the Greeks should be given Smyrna,  and he agreed
with the areign Secretary ah put an international egntralof the Straits so long as the titular sovereignty of Oon-stantinople remained with the Turks.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said that he earnestlytrusted that the conversations with M. Clemehoeau would beprofitable.   Any solution was better than no solution.    He,. thought that the Prime Minister should say that, as theUnited States have now gone out, the roatter is simplified;and if only France and England can reach agreement on Turkishpolicy* with a fair recognition of Italian claims, we couldmake that agreement effective.    France would be consternatedif she learned that  it was by no means a foregone conclusionthat we would guarantee her integrity,  and he agreed withLord Gurson that this was a very powerful weapon in our hands.Today the Turkish control wag passing from cur hands,   !&quot;econtrolledf Constantinople on both sides of the Straits, butnot the huge territories lying outside it.    There was a realdanger Q.f Bolshevist penetration,  imperilling our interestsin the Kiddle East.    Another reason why it was important tocome to an early agreement with the French was that ourtroops in Turkey were deteriorating in quality and they hadto be relieved by young, immature men.    The French had greatinterests in Constantinople, and so we ought to be able tosquare them.    It was vital to come to some definite agreementbetween the two Great Powers concerned.    He was in favour ofwhat would virtually be an Anglo-French Administration, withcertain concessions to other Powers.    Next, he had reason tobelieve that k. Glemenceau Intended to discuss Russia.    Thesituation there deteriorated every day.    If nothing could bedone we ought to clear out.    He reminded the Conference thata month previously the Prime minister had practically givenan assurance to the House of Comiaons that the Russian questionwould be finally settled at this Conference.    As with Turkey,so with Russia;    there zmist be a joint definite Anglo-Frenchoolicy.   rfe must decide  
(a) -.7hat prders were to be given to theBaltic States:(b) vThat we were to do in regard toPoland:(c) Are we to adopt theSafcinkoff policyof a Conference between the ant i-- Bolshevik States and the loyal Rus-siansywith Great Britain and Prancesupervising?If there were much further delay, Lenin and Tro*sky wouldprevail.    England and Prance must speak with one voice in^esneet of Finland, the Baltic States, the loyal  Russians,and so on.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD (*F EDUCATION said that hewas much attracted by Mr Balfour&apos;s suggeetion&apos; for South Asia. Minor, but as regards North Asia Minor and Armenia we hada strong oody of opinion in England which was anti-Tur.^which we mi^ht attract by showing &apos;tg-at we had taken properprecautions to ensure the protection of Armenia.   As regardsConstantinople and the Straits, he favoured an InternationalCommission to control the Straits and to exercise effectivecontrol over Constantinople, with the Sultan in nominalcontrol.    Indian students with whom he had come in contactwe^e very awehensive of the effect in India of the expul-3ion of Turkey from Constantinople.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat if the French regained in Asia Minor we might arguethat it was up to their- to look after the whole of theArmenians on the coast and in the strip connecting withRussian Armenia, near Erivan.   An alternative had beensuggested by Lord Brvce, who had said that if we couldpersuade some great or small Power to take charge ofArmenia the United States would supply the necessary funds,although they sight shrink from political responsibility.As regards Mr Fisher&apos;s other point, he did not believethat V&apos;-ere was any serious or lasting sentiment in Englandabout expulsion.
THE LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL a aid that MrChurchill&apos;3 view waa that the Prime Minister should come tosome agreement with 11. Cleneneeau, and then       say to therest of the world that we could not tolerate anarchy in theMiddle East, that France and Great Britain were in agreement,and that the other Powers must conform.    This would involvethe exclusion of the Italians, who might be a great nuisance,but it was not wise to ignore them.    Owing to their greatincrease of population as compared with France, they imaginedthemselves to be a Great Power,    moreover, they felt ill-usedovev the Treaty of London, and there was no doubt that theFrench had behaved badly towards them.    TCe could not,  inhis opinion, settle Asia minor without reference to Italy,and it would be impolitic to thrust he?&quot; ostentatiously intothe background.    He agreed that there could be no Inter-AlliedConference in London during the next two or three days.    &quot;hat &apos;was required was a Conference of much bigger scope than waspossible here, with more extended time. mifht tell thePrench that they had made Faris impossible, that we do notinsist troon London, and that we suggest that the Conferenceshould meet at Brussels.   As regards Constantinople he wasinclined to agree with Lord Curzon.   The place was rio partof Moslem religion, but only of Moslem sentiment.    In anyAgreement he hoped it might be possible to exhibit Italy,at any rate nominally, on equal terms with Prance;   herIntrigues would no doubt continue, but they would not be-effective.     Some Agreement which could be reached with VL.Olemenceau was devoutly to be desired.THE LOHD PRIVY SEAL said he ag -eed with Mr Balfouras regards the Italians.   We ought first to come to someclear agreement with U. Clemenceau, and then bring in theItalians.    In regard to Constantinople, both the Aga Khanand Lord Slnha in Pa-*is hid attached gr-sat importance to.
Moslem sentiment-.     There was no object, he thought, intaking it from the Turks and handing it over entirely tointernational control,,    we could get all we wanted by anInternational Co..-mission working through a titular Sovereignin Constantinople.TErn PRIME MINISTER thought that about 30,000 inter-national troops would be required to occupy the Straits.    Itwas undesirable that the Sultan should hav? anything morethan a handful of Guards himself.   r/ere we to make the Sultanlike the Khedive,  or was he to be independent, like the Shahof Persia?    The latter alternative he thought was dangerous.Although, as M-1 Montagu had said, the population northwardstowards Adrianople was mainly Turkish, the people outsideConstantinopie proper were overwhelmingly Creek.    He thoughtthat we should treat the Sultan as another Xhedive, and keephim in Constantinople.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR&apos; FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat if the Sultan was left in Constantinople the Moslemworld would a ay that :we had never really defeated him, andhe would become at once the centre of reaction and futuretrouble&apos;.    tfe thought we should try and settle the future ofConstantinople, not from the point of view of India, but ofthe future of the -world.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL did not agree, but thought thatwe should look at the question mainly from the point of viewof the future of, and how it affected, the British Empire.If we could satisfy -the Turks that we intended to treat themwell, it would benefit us in India, Mesopotamia and Egypt.THE PRIMS MINISTER thought that they should considerthe practical result of the policies suggested.    If theSultan was at Constantinople,  his ministers must be there.He would then govern Turkey from Constantinople, where wecould onlv allow him a email bodyguards    This would meanthat he would -be the creature of what was really a foreignjunta.    There was the danger that the French --&apos;ould always
try to influence him, and v-&quot;e should have a revival of the oldG-eek ***mi&quot;*e in a nuch wo&quot;se form.    Constantinople wouldbecome a -source of infection and war.    In his view the Turkought to have a chance of making a Turkish Kingdom or commu-.nity.    This he could not do if-he remained under an Inter-national Commission, the effect of whioh Would be to turnTu.rK.ey into an Egypt worse than the Egypt of *he old days,as the Italians as well as the French would be concerned withits administration.    He admitted the peril of Moslem andIndian sentiment, but he would say to the Turk:- &quot;Go toBrusa, where you can be independent.    As Turkey must governthe Straits they \ ust be guarded, by an international force.The closing of the Straits by Turkey during the ;?a? had pro-lorwed 4he &quot;rar by two years, and Turkey had thus signallyfailed in he&apos;1 duty to the wo&quot;ld*,    The Turk was in a minorityin Constantinople itself, and much 2uore so in the suburbs.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FO&quot;: INDIA asked whether thePrime Minister would considen a plebiscite of the populationof Thrace, on the lines of the Polish plebiscite.THr PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the cases wererather different.    Danzig was 95 percent. German,  but as itwas the door of Poland we could not leave it to Germany.Constantinople was the door between Europe and Asia, and mustbe inte .-nationalised.    Further j with her great populations,Turkey was a different problem from Egypt, where the pooula-tion was o&quot;*aetically entirely on the banks of the Nile.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said he wished itplaced on record that all Indian opinion in London and India,official and native, was against the proposed solution.    Itwould be quite impossible to use Indian troops to enforce aPeace of this kind.THR LORD PRIVY SEAL again emphasized the importanceof conciliating Turkish opinion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE, FOR WAR said the Conference hadformed certain quite clear proposals:-
(a) That Constantinople should be inter-nationalised:(b) That the Sultan should reside there asa titular head:(c) That the government of Turkey should beexercised from Brusa, where the Sultan&apos;sMinisters would be, with Allied Gommis-sioners to advise them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in this way the YildizKiosk would be the Sultan&apos;s Vatican,    He reminded the Con-ference that today there was a Commission governing Constanti-nople in the Sultan&apos;s name,THE PRESIDENT CP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION said he agreedwith Mr Churchill&apos;s suggestion as tending to conciliate Turk-ish and Moslem sentiment.    It would be a great advantage tous if we could make the Turks feel that we had played upfor them.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whioh solution was likely togive less trouble to us in Egypt,  India and Mesopotamia?THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said he would with-d^aw his objection if the government was to be from Brusain the name of the Sultan, who would have power to reside inConstantinople,    He again enquired what was to be done aboutAdrianople.THE, SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS repliedthat early in the year it had been proposed in Paris thatthere should be an international State there.    In regard toMr Montagu&apos;s statement about the unanimity of Indian opinion,he said that all the Indian officials in the Middle Eastwere strongly in favour of the dissolution of the TurkishEmpire and of turning the Turks out of Constantinople.THE SECR TARY OF STATE FOR WAR foresaw danger inletting the Sultan be in Brusa, where he would graduallycollect round him Mustapha Kemal, Enver, Trotsky and others,who would help him build up a huge hostile force,  and turnAsia Minor and Arabia into a seething cauldron of trouble.
It would, be wise, in his opinion, to keep him in Constantinople, under our eye. However, he was quite prepared to support anything that was agreed upon by the Prime Minister and ? Clemenceau.

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought that the Prime Minister might put it to M. Clemenceau: "What is most likely to bring peace in the British Empire and peace in Europe?".

THE PRIME MINISTER said the point was that the Alliance that won the War was now falling to pieces. The United States were dropping away, Italy was recalcitrant,and France and ourselves were agreed on no subject. France wanted to adopt Bismarck&apos;s attitude, which nearly brought on war in 1874. It was essential for us to have a complete understanding with France on all these vital problems. It was disastrous that the Peace Conference had been held in Paris, where a Press campaign against us had been sedulously worked by the Quai d&apos;Orsay, and even M. Clemenceau had been overborne. Moreover, Signer Orlando&apos;s constant absence, with his Foreign Minister, meant that popular opinion in Italy had gone to pieces. He would like to revert to the practice adopted by the Supreme War Council, which was, that the Allied Ministers met in their several countries in turn.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thought that M. Clemenoeau&apos;s point was that he must keep up the prestige of France by having the Conferences in Paris, especially because the British were everywhere en evidence in the Middle East; but he agreed with the Prime Minister that Paris as the meeting place had really smashed the Alliance. He himself would like to have the Conference somewhere where could be assembled all the Ministers who could decide fundamentals. The fundamentals to be decided were:-

(i) Our general policy in Russia:

(ii) Asia Minor and the question of Mandates:

(iii)  Is the Turk to be in or outside Constantinople?
As regards the Conference to settle these questions, he wouldlike to see it meet in London.THE SECRETARY CP STAT&apos;&quot;&apos; PGR WAR agreed with thislatter aupptesitibnj on the understanding that the finalsible to get really responsible Italian Ministers to come toLondon.    The first point he would make with M. Clemehceau,he thought, was the necessity of bringing the Alliancetopethm&quot; apain.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OP EDUCATION thought thatthe Conference were generally agreed,  except for a differ-ence of opinion as to the extent of the nominal power tc bevested in the Sultan.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat it was agreed that the Sultan should live in Brusa, withpower to cross to the Royal  Residences in Constantinoplewhen he desired.ratification should take place in Paruris.THE PRIME MINISTER wondered whether it would be pos-ie 0onfe renoe endedat 7- -15MM)Whitehall Gardens,, S Mml,December.10, 1919.
