5 CMINUTES of a MEETING held at 23 Rue Nitotat 3 p.m. on Monday May 19th 1919.PRESENTFRX.IN13TERJfQURJRZONLORD MILNERMR. WINSTON CHURCHILLMR. MONTAGUSir ;-aurice HardceyMr. Philip KerrTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the Council of Pour had been forced to abandon provisionally proposals which had been madein regain i to the division of Anatolia into a number of areaseach of wnich was to be held by one of the greater rowers ara mandatory.     The Council of Four had been driven to tfc*,edecision by Mr. Balfour&apos;s paper and partly by the argumentsofthe Indian Delegation.     He had therefore persuaded ther at tnemorning&apos;s meeting tc re-open the whole Turkish question, and what he wanted this afternoon was to learn the views of hiscolleagues as to the future of all the territories comprised in the late Turkish Empire.MR. balfour asked if this meant that the agreement of 1916was to be scrapped.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that Signor Orlando had made it clear during the recent talk that he was far more interestedin Piume than in Asia Minor and that   if he could satisfyItalian aspirations on that point he would probably be willingto abandon Italian claims in Asia Minor altogether.MR. MONTAGU asked whether thi3 meant that the occupationof Smyrna by the Greeks wao not final.THE PRIME MINISTER replied that it would probably be verydifficult
difficult to get the Greeks out of Smyrna again, hut thatwe still had a free hand.     The Council of Four had made itclear to Monsieur Venezelos that the landing of Greek troopsthere did not prejudice the ultimate political destiny of thedistrict.KR. MONTAGU urged strongly that looking at the question from the Mohammedan point of view, neither France nor italy should be given any mandate in Anatolia*     Moslem gpinion wasbitterly opposed to Turkey being brought under the mandatorysystem at all.      -he Mohammddans could not persuade themselves that the mandatory system v/as not annexation in disguise.The real question, however, was who was to be placed in charge.If a Power with a clean reputation were given the Mandatehe did not think it wo Id matter so much.     We had a goodreputation, and so had the United States, but the French were very unpopular because the Indian Mohammedans believed that france had used her power both in Morocco and in Algeria tocrush and exploit the inhabitants.     As to the Italisnd theMohammedan world detested them because of their unprovokedattack on Tripoli.      They were convinced that Italy would never go into Anatolia for the benefit of the population, butonly for what could be made out of it. -   Italy had not evenmoney with which to develop the country.     This was a veryserious matter from the British Empire point of view, becausethe division of Turkey on the lines which had been proposed would provoke grave Mohammedan unrest and would probablyland us in very&quot; heavy military costs.LORD CURZON said that he had no desire whatever to dealgently with the Turks.     The Turks had voluntarily aided withGermany;    they had treated our prisoners with unexampledbarbarity;    they had massacred hundreds of thousands of theirown
subjects.     They therefore deserved any fate which was inflicte*upon them.     He thought that they should &quot;bd deprived of allthe iff outlying provinces,  that is to say Arabia, Mesopotamia,Palestine, Syria and Armenia.     He was further in favour oftheir being turned out of Constantinople.     The Turks werenot an absolute majority of the population there.     So longas they were there they continually intrigued throughout the balkans and among all their neighbours.     Above all unless we turned the Turks out of Constantinople the East would neverbelieve that the Turks had been defeated in the war.     Thepresence of the Turk in Constantinople was an outward andvisible sign of his dominance.     Constantinople,  the ancientcapital of the Eastern -Jnpire, was a military outpost of turkey in Europe.     He was therefore strongly of theopinion thatConstantinople should be taken from the Turks.       hen, however,it came to Italy he agreed emphatically with the Secretary ofState for India that it would be fatal to partition thecountry.     If we deprived the Turks of all their outlyingprovinces and of Constantinople, we were surely hitting themhard enough.     Further,  so long as you left Anatolia to theTurks in full soveriegnty you did not touch on the almostinsoluble problem of the Caliphate.      If Asia Minor   were tobe divided he did not think it possible for the Turks toretain the Caliphate.      If we had any alternative that mightnot matter so much, but we had not.     We ought,  therefore,  toleave the   Sultan a kingdom of his own, subject to suchmeasure oS control as would prevent him from misgoverning his people or making mischief outside.As to boundaries he thought that Turkey ought to extend to the Aimenian border.     He was personally opposed to puttingGreeks in Smyrna, wnich opened the way to friction and graball
all round.     He w;uld turn them out again if it were possible.     As to the Italian claims, he would get rid ofthem out of Anatolia altogether.     They had been invited togo the Caucasus, a very rich country, but were apparentlyalready getting cold feet.     Would it not be possible forall the powers to enter upon a consideration of theproblem ofAsia Minor on tne basis of a general renunciation of their claims, in order to leave the Turks a sovereignty of theirown.MR. liALFUUR pointed out that the 1916 Treaty gave theItalians rights in -Oiatolia, hot if Great Britain and Franceextended their influence in Asia Minor, but in the eastern mediterranean.LORD CURZON felt the flifficulty and thought it wasosential to leave Anatolia to the Turks if we were to restore confidence in the East.     He would give Armenia and Con-stantinople and the Straits to the United States, unar themandatory system, while he would reimpose in a somewhatextended form the system of dontrol of Turkey which was inoperation before the war.THE PRIME MINISTER asked what he meant by this.      Was thecontrol to be international or by a single Power?LORD CURZON replied that he was in favour of the advicebeing given by a single Power, preferably the United States.He was opposed to its being given by Prance, because Prancewas singularly unscrupulous in her diplomacy and beoauseahehad historic ambitions throughout the East, which she was anxious to satisfy.     If she were given the mandate she would rapidly become the dominating Power in the eastern mediterranean.     The Italians in any case were hopeless forthe Turks would rebel against them.LORD MILNER
LORD MILNSR aeked if tho United States were to begiventhe mandate for Constantinople and to ho the controllingadviser for Turkish Anatolia, why it was necessary to turn the Sultan out of Constantinople. The removal of the Sultancreated many difficulties. If the United States was to he responsible for both Constantinople and Anatolia, hs was infavour of lraving the Sultan at Yildiz Kiosk.MR. MONTAGU said that if we turned the Sultan out ofConstantinople it would draw to him   the sympathy of thewhole of the Mohammedan.^  By cutting off the Turkish provinces and placing Constantinople and Anatolia under the UnitedStates the power of the Sultan as caliph would be immenselyweakened.     It surely was not necessary to rouse the indignatiorof the whole Mohammedan^for the sake of transferring him from constantinople to Broussa or Konia.LORD CURZON replied that all the experts were in favourof turning the Sultan out of Constantinople.      In his own opinion it was essential to deprive the Turks of hxx their twosymbols of victory - Constantinople and Mecca.      It   was not enough to take away from them subject peoples which were notTurks.MR. CHURCHILL expressed himself in favour of givingAnatolia and Con3ttantinople to tho United States, - Constantin-ople under a United States mandate, Anatolia to be underTurkish sovereignty subject to their accepting United Statesadvice and assistance.     He thought it would be easier to getthe United States to take on a big job such as this, and itwould appeal to their idealism.      In the   event there would beno question that the Turks had been thoroughly defeated.     Onthe other hand if either Ifranoe or Italy were placed in ohargethey
they would very likely before long begin fraternizing withGermans.MB. BALPQUR said that he was in favour of the Turks being left their true homeland, which was the central block ofAnatolia.     They should not be   placed- under any mandate but should have imposed upon them a sort of international control which existed before the war.     For instance there had been an international body to deal with debt, of which France had had the ciiairmanship, but the   British had run $he Customs.He was in favour of placing Turkey and Asia Minor underthis kind of international tutelage., in w-which all the great powers could share.     He would turn the Turk altogether outof Constantinople, and he was in favour of leaving the   Greeksin Smyrna.     His principal difficulty lay that in Article of the Treaty of London of 1915, undoubtedly gave Italy rights in the south of Anatolia if Prance and Great Britain extended or gained possessions in the Hear East.THE PRIME MINISTER asked if the acceptance of the mandatoryl^did not modify the Italian rights under the Treaty.LORD CUR20N asked if we were not committed to consulting the people as to whom they wanted to act as the mandatory power.Could we not send out the Syrian Ooinraission to find out if tapopulation in the neighbourhood of Adalia wanted the   Italiansor not?MR. balfour -replied&apos; that even if we described it as &quot;zones of influence&apos; the   Italians claimed ouch a zone in Anatolia underthe 1915 Treaty.ME. CHURCHILL recalled the Prime Minister&apos;s statement about Piume and urged that by meeting the Italians in the adriatic we might get them out of Asia Minor altogether.MR, BARNES
MR. BARNES said that he was not an export on the subjectbut he felt a bias in favour of turning the Turks out ofConstantinople.&apos;    He had, however, been considerably influenced by the Mohammedans representations, and that if the whole area was to be placed under the United States he did not taink itmattered very much whether the Sultan was turned out ofConstantinople.MR. MONTAGU reminded the meeting that the Indians hada claim to have their views very favourably considered aa thyhad supplied the majority of the troops through whose agencythe Turks had been overthrown.     They had sent no less than amillion and a quarter men from India to tho Eastern theatres ofwar.     The Primo Minister&apos;a declaration in regard to leaving the Turk in Constantinople had been largely used during theecruiting in 1918.THE PRIME   MINISTER then read out the figures of thepopulation in Constantinople as follows :-   308,000 Turks,235,000 Creeks, 132,000 Armenians, 131,000 foreigners, 38,000minor races.MR. CHURCHILL said that the groat thing wan to arrive ata simple solution which all could understand, and the onlysimple solution was that the United States should take chargeboth of Constantinople and of Anatolia.LORD CURZON asked if the United States was willing to do this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he really did not know whetherthey would do so or not.     He doubted whether the French could undertake the work owing to the size of the .debt and the numberof people they had lost in the war.LORD MILNER asked whether it was not   possible to giveCilioia to the Italians.THE PRIME MINISTER
THE PRIME MINISTER then summarised the opinions expressedby various minister a, and said that there was no doubt thatthere was practical unanimity among those present that thebest solution,  if it were practicable, was that the UnitedStateB should take over both Anatolia and Constantinople,While there was general objection t o putting the French aswell as the Italians in charge.
