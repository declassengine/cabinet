THE PRIME MINISTER said that, since their last meeting, certain documents had been exchanged by both parties, and he asked whether the Emir Feisal wished to make any statement.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that he had received two communications since the previous Conference, one from the Prime Minister (G.T.-8312) and one from the Foreign Office (G.T.-8310). He had prepared a reply (Appendix "A") to the Prime Minister&apos;s letter, which he had brought with him to the meeting to hand over in person. He hoped to have his reply to the Foreign Office communication ready in the course of the next few days. He wished to express his gratitude to the Prime Minister for all the trouble he had taken, and especially for the suggestion contained in the penultimate paragraph of his letter to him, which stated that the British Government would be very glad to arrange an immediate meeting between the Emir, a French, an American and a British representative, to adjust, in the most amicable manner to all concerned, the problems involved in the impending withdrawal of British troops from Syria on November 1st.

(The Emir Feisal then handed his reply to the Prime Minister.)

(The Prime Minister read out the reply to the Meeting.)

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped the Emir Feisal would excuse them if he and his ministers withdrew to a separate room for a short time, in order to give the Emir&apos;s repl? their careful consideration.

(The Prime Minister, Lord Curzon, Lord Allenby, Sir Henry Wilson, Sir Maurice Hankey and Colonel Stor? then withdrew for a period of twenty minutes, when the discussion was resumed.)

THE PRIME MINISTER stated that the difficulty about the suggested Conference was that, owing to the unfortunate illness of the President of the United States, which precluded the President from transacting any public business, the United States could not be properly represented, as there
was no-one with authority to issue the necessary instructions. He had been conferring with his colleagues during their absence from the meeting, and they had decided that the best thing to do would be to invite General Gouraud, the new French Commander in Syria, to come over to England to confer with the Emir, Lord Allenby and the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, either tomorrow or the following day. The most suitable military representative of the United states would be General B1iss, who, however, it was to be regretted, would not be in an authoritative position if he attended the Conference, as he would be without instructions from  Washington.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that he accepted Mr Lloyd George&apos;s proposal, but he hoped that the Conference would not confine its discussions to military questions only. He would particularly like an American representative to be present to hear the discussions, which might bear upon administrative as well as military questions. Moreover, the Prime Minister had particularly mentioned an American representative in his letter to him.

THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that, as he had said, owing to the President&apos;s illness and the difficulty, in the circumstances, of securing a properly accredited American representative, it would be impossible to settle the whole question of the future of Syria now. The Emir Feisal would, of course, understand that this did not  mean that His Majesty&apos;s Government had any objection to America being represented. On the contrary, they would welcome an American representative, and, if the Emir approved, they were prepared to ask Mr Polk to send either General Bliss or some other responsible American officer to attend the Conference.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that he would be most grateful if this could be arranged.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in that case, a telegram would be sent at once to Paris, asking Mr Polk if he would very kindly take the necessary action. The result of this
communication would be at once communicated to the Emir. In the meantime, he wished to ask His Highness whether Arab troops were available to relieve the British directly the latter withdrew.

THE EMIR FRISAL said that he hoped that the Conference might assemble with the least possible delay. In regard to the other point raised by Mr Lloyd George, he said that he had a certain number of troops ready, and that, as the evacuation would start from the oath and would only proceed slowly in a Southerly direction, he proposed to recruit fresh troops to relieve British garrisons in the South.

LORD ALLENBY, in reply to a question by the Prime Minister, stated that orders had been sent to British Headquarters to be ready to start evacuating from the North on November 1st. It was improbable that the withdrawal from Aleppo, for instance, could be completed before the end of that month. His intention was to withdraw first from Aleppo and East of the Euphrates, and enquired whether the Emir had sufficient troops there to relieve the British.

THE EMIR FEISAL replied that, in all probability, in six weeks&apos; time he would have sufficient detachments there to take over from the British garrisons. He would, however, require equipment for the new fresh troops that he proposed to recruit. As he had said, his wish was to raise sufficient new troops to garrison in particular the four large towns.

LORD ALLENBY, in reply to the Prime Minister, thought that between 5,000 and 6,000 Arab troops would be sufficient for the purpose, and their duties would really be those of Military Police.

The EMIR FEISAL thought that this would not be sufficient, and expressed the view that not less than 15,000 would be necessary.

LORD ALLENBY pointed out that he had not more than from 7,000 to 8,000 men performing these duties, and he thought that the Emir should be able to do with the same number.

APPENDIX "A".

London, October 11th, 1919

To His Excellency the Prime Minister,

Your Excellency:

I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated the tenth of October. I have also received a communication from the Foreign Office to which I shall reply in detail.

Allow me to submit a formal protest in the name of Arab Nation against any change which may be desired to introduce into the present form of government in Syria. As I have already stated in my previous correspondence and interviews, I consider that no changes should be allowed before the final decision of the Peace Conference as to the future form of government.

My protest is based on three main points:

1: I withdrew my agents and troops without bargain from the Coast, and at the same time the Commander-in-Chief made a declaration through me to the Syrian people that he intends occupying their provinces by his troops and forming a provisional administration depending directly on him acting on behalf of the Allies, which administration shall continue to exist until a final decision is given by the Peace Conference as to the future government of this country. This ledge must not be thrown aside for reasons which are outside our power and knowledge, and for which we are not responsible in any way. If the Peace Conference has delayed its final decision it is not the fault of the Arabs, and it is not an offence for which they deserve the punishment of repudiating a pledge most solemnly made. If it is absolutely necessary that the British troops should be withdrawn, the Syrians naturally expect that the French troops will be withdraw at the same time and the coast handed over to the Arabs as it was before the British occupation, thus awaiting the final decision of the Peace Conference. This
will also conform to the promise made by Great Britain to the Syrian Committee in Cairo on 11-6-17.

2: I understand that His Majesty&apos;s Government in withdrawing their troops have regarded the obligations they have incurred to both their Allies, the French and the Arabs.

In addition to the engagement referred to in the preceding paragraph I beg to again call attention to the telegram addressed by the High Commissioner in Egypt to the King at Mecca, which runs as follows:

Bolchevics found in Petrograd Foreign Office record of all conversations and provisional understanding (not formal treaty) between Britain, France and Russia made early in war to prevent difficulties between Powers in prosecuting war with Turkey. Jamal either from ignorance or malice has distorted its original purpose, has omitted its stipulations regarding consent of native populations and safe-guarding their interest, and has ignored fact that subsequent outbreak and success of Arab revolt and withdrawal of Russia had for long time past created wholly different situation.

This telegram was sent to the King in reply to his protest against the secret treaty between Great Britain and France which Jamal Pasha divulged in Damaseus for propaganda purposes. It was quoted in my letter to you dated September 21st 1919, and has reminded unanswered.

Has the different situation affecting your agreement with France and referred to in the above telegram been since modified in any way? Has the opinion of the people been taken as to the new proposed occupation?

The stipulation regarding the consent of the people was confirmed in November 1918 by the formal declaration made conjointly by Great Britain and France, whether the occupation is temporary or otherwise.

3: The over-excited feeling now prevailing in the Arab provinces as well as all Moslem provinces of the Ottoman Empire in Asia, and caused by unwise foreign interference, as no longer a secret. Any person having the slightest
knowledge of what has been going on in the Syrian provinces is undoubtedly convinced that there will be trouble and in different quarters, if the statue que of the present administration is changed.

I therefore beg you in the name of Humanity and public peace, in the name of the Arab Nation, in the multitudious interests of Great Britain and France in the Eastern World, as I have already asked previously, that no new doors should be allowed to be opened for further troubles and to leave the present situation as it is.

I beg also that ? measures be taken to assemble a commission of the interested Allied Powers and breth? in arms to consider the interests of each Nation according to the requirements of justice, for the aim of which we have fought together.

If however the British Government remains unchanged in her decision to withdraw her troops after due consideration of this expose of my case, I shall be glad to accept your kind offer for me to meet representatives from Great Britain, America and France to consider the problem involved in the impending withdrawal of British troops from Syria and to give a final decision regarding the same, so that these problems may be solved in a way which will keep public peace and safeguard the interests of all. Anticipating that this conference may be assembled with the least possible delay.

I have the honor to be,

Your Excellency&apos;s

Obedient servant,
APPEFDIK *3&quot; .7ELE3RA.L to:    Lord Derby (Paris).October 13, 1919, 5.10 p.m0 9 * IPRIVATE AhD PEn30&quot;AI..In oonneotion with message from the Pri. ;e Minister toL.Cle..-ienceau, vhich is bein7, transmitted - hroueh ^-ou, oleasask approval of Trench Government to proposal that anAr.e**ioan Offioer be invited to attend, and if they arr.reeconsult Hr Polk as to whether he v,in bo willing to deputeGeneral Eliss or, if he is not available, another AmericanOffioer for the purpose.
