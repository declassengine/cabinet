Lord Robert Cecil emphasized the effect upon Rus3,opinion if no Allied troops were present at the seizing ofVladivostock.    The Russians weuld imagine that the Japanese
were endeavouring to oa-ry out the designs they had in the.Russo-Japanese War.   Also, the Biitish Government desiredto obtain the control of the Siberian Railway, and if theJapanese went alone to Vladiv6stock it would make this operation much more difficult *The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed theWar Cabinet that  it would take four or five days to move the British troops, which were now at Hong-Kong., to vladivostock-vostoak.The War Cabinet instructed:-The First Lord of the Admiralty to send the &quot;SUFFOLK&quot; to Vladivostok in any case,and any decision the War Cabinet arrivedat with regard to the despatch of troops would not affect the First Lord&apos;s iristruc-tions.GERMAN DIVI- (3) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated thatSIGNS ON TH&quot;WESTERN FRONT, the Germans had reorganised their army on the Western Front,and the formation of additional Corps and one additionalArmy had now given it the character of an offensive force.No more Divisions had, however., been moved over from Russiarecently, though the Germans had S3 more Divisions on theWestern Front than they had this time last year.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that poland..

(5) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed theCondition of     War Cabinet that General Guillaumat had reported that  theRussian Troops.condition of the Russian units at  Salonica was most unsatis-factory, and that he (General Guillaumat) suggested sending the se unit 3 10 Tunis.Health of (6) Lord Derby stated that he had received a disquietingTroops.telegram from Sir lionald Ross (the tropical disease expert)regarding the health of the troops at Salonica,    The tele-gram stated that the men were saturated with malaria, and
B615,000 of them should be removed immediately.   At presenttrooos xjould not be relieved in that theatre at a rateexceeding 3J000 a month,(7) A suggestion was made that the Weekly Casualty Reportdid not give sufficient details regarding, the&apos; number ofsick.Sir Edward Carson stated that he had asked theDirector-General of Medical Services to rectify this severalt ime s, but w ith no re suit. -Lord Derby promised to look intothe matter.Lord Derby addrd that the hospitals at Salonica were very good indeed, and, although there was a shortage of doctors,, it was not a serious one,-(8) With reference to War Cabinet 305, Minute 4, thePrime Minister stated that ?ae had received further communi-cations from M. Clemenceau with regard to the extension ofthe British Front in France.   U. Clemenceau evidently seemeddissatisfied with the way in which the subject stood atpresent,Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig stated that&apos; he proposedto take over a two-Divisional front from the French in a fewdays * time,.and a further two-DivisiGnal front by the endof the month,, which would involve our right flank restingupon the River Oise.    General Retain seemed to be quite satisfied with this arrangement, and&apos;correspondence had passed on the subject&apos;between the two Commanders-in-Chief.Lord Milner stated that he understood that M. Clemen-Clemenceau wanted the matter settled not merely by the Commander-in**Chief. but. by. the two Governments,Sir-Douglaa Haig thought that there was somethingfurther in the minds of the French Government&quot;*, - they wereapprehensive lest a big German attack would be made against&apos;the French lines,, and wanted the question $f a still further extension of the British Front considered.
v.. * 3/Lord iviilher stated that a study of the matter wasbeing made at Versailles.Captain Amery reported that all Sections had put inreports upon the subject,, which would be ready for theconsideration of the Cabinets by the end of that week;Captain Amery added that he had seen General cadorna&apos;sreport, which concluded with a suggestion that our line should be extended to a point somewhere between Barissy andBerry-au-Bac.The Prime Minister pointed out that it. was impossi- .ble to settle this question until there had been a full discussion With our Allies of cur future military policy for the year 1918.    The situation was now fairly clearly defined, and it should be possible, to arrive at.a defini-tion.    He gathered that M. Clemenceau still persisted in .the suggestion that the British had not been and.were not doing their share, whereas it was common knowledge thatthe brunt of the fighting in 1917 had been borne by theBritish, thus enabling the French Army to recover *    A simi-lar attitude to that adopted by M. Clemenoeau was beingspread in the American newspapers, largely by M. Tar-dieu.Sir Douglas Haig added /that he had issued instruc--tions for carrying out all that General Petain had request-ed him to do, and that it was impossible for him to do moreat present without incurring grave risk.The War Cabinet instructed:-The Secretary to draft a telegram (Appendix)for the Prime Minister to send to M. Cleiaeh-oeau,and directed thatA copy of this telegram should be sent tothe British Military Adviser to the supreme war Council at Versailles, asking&apos;him tosubmit reports for their guidance at the.earliest possible date.Situation on . (9) Sir Edward Carson asked,Sir Douglas Haig whether,?&quot;, ir.the british front. his opinion, it would be possible for the Germans to.br-.:ak
through cur lines in France in the near future.Sir Douglas Haig replied that nothing &quot;was certain inwar. &apos; A longercontinued offensive &quot;by the Germans would use.up all our present reserves, and our losses would continueto be heavy;    but, after consultation with his Array Oownand-e?s, he was satisfied that the condition and moral of theBritish Arisy was such as to give him every confidence thatthe British Army would hold its own, as it had always donein the past.Sir Edward Oars on added that he gathered from, thereport on the rec ;nt actions in the Gambrai sector that theGerman successes were due, in part, to the inability of ourMachine Gun Corps to hold the German attack.   A number ofthe officers were yoxirg and inexperienced in defensive war-fare, and he would be glad to know whether there was a dangerof something similar happening on other    sectors of the FrontSir Douglas Haig replied that he did not feel appre-hension upon this point.    The situation at Cambrai had been somewhat unique in character, owing to the rapidity withwhich we were confronted with the necessity of employingdefensive tactics when all the thoughts and experience ofthe officers concerned had been directed to offensive tacticsHe had recommended the appointment of extra officers to the machine Gun Corps, and efforts were being made to work outdefensive plans in detail on every section of our Front.The Geman machine-gunners were a Corps d&apos;Elite, consistingof picked officers and men who fought to the death after the infantry had retired.    During our offensives the Germans had had long experience of the defensive employment of machine-guns .The Prime Minister, asked whether steps had been takento make our Machine Gun Corps similar to the. German.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied thatthis was being done, and every effort was made to inspirethis arm with the highest degree of efficiency and moral.
(    .eral Mill- Sir Edward Carson asked Sir Doxiglas Haig whethertary Situation.he thought that the military position in 6 or IS months&quot;time would show improvement from our point of view.Sir Douglas Kaig replied that he had not the factsor figures upon which to base a reply to this general ques-tion.    He had&apos; not seen the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Man-Power, and,  from his point of view, much depended upon whether his units could be kept up to establishment.The Prime Minister directed that:-&quot;Sir, Douglas Haig should be shown a copyof the Report of the Man-Power Committee.AMERICAN (11) With reference to War Cabinet 307, Minute 4, and inMILITARYASSISTANCE.       reply to a question regarding the possible co-operation of american and British troops, Sir Douglas Haig stated thatGeneral Pershing appeared to be somewhat slow in the pre-* paration of Staffs and training for the American Divisionsnow in Prance.    He had, however,  agreed with General Per-shing to the.establishment of a Training Camp in the Britisharea near Amiens, to which British and American troops shouldbe sent,.  His proposal v/as that a certain number of british divisions should be Americanised;    that is to say, that an american Regiment &amp;f three or four Battalions should be ih-oluded in the Division.    He gathered, from General Pershingthat the&apos; Americans in France were anxious to co-operate with and to  join the British Army, but that the american authorities in the United States were still anxious thatthe Americans should co-operate with the French rather than with the British.-   The French authorities had always taken the line that the Americans were to be regarded as beingprimarily disposed for assisting the French rather thanthe British, and therefore he had not thought fit to press&quot;suggestions upon the Americans.Mr Bonar Law stated that it had been reported to him that General Pershing was most anxious to have a oonsulta-tion with Sir Douglas Kaig and General Petain together.
If&apos; &apos;r Lord Curaon pointed cut that the Restriction of Ira-ports Committee had been considering a proposal for the cutting down of imports during the earlier part of thisyear, with a view to utilising more ships in the transportof American man-power to Prance.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated thathe was going over to Prance on the following day to seeGaneral Pershing with a view to discussing the whole ques-tion with him.The Prime minister expressed the view that it wouldbe desirable that General Pershing should meet the membersof the Supreme &apos;7ar Council and their Advisers at the coming&apos;Conference at Versailles..Captain Amery stated that he understood that GeneralBliss was attending on behalf of the Americans.PREPARATION (12.) With reference to Sir Douglas Haig&apos;s Report (PaperOP DEFENSIVELINES. G.T.-3211), the Prime Minister stated that he attached theutmost importance to the preparation of adequate defensivelines in case of a German attack,    He wished to draw .parti-&apos;cular attention to two points in their preparation:-(a) The fortification of the lines with aview to their being held:(b) The construction of &quot;pill-boxes&quot;, dugoxits,etc,, for the purpose of saving life.We were now hearing the end of our resources in man-power,and it was essential that we should, use our remainingreserves with the utmost economy.    It therefore behoved usto examine the German methods fo-r protecting their troops from the effect of artillery bombardment, and so to do. all.that was possible to minimise our losses before and during a German .attack.   He gathered that the line now being held ,by the British troops was very largely a new line, and thatit would be necessary to construct new works, whether ofearth or concrete, on that line, as well as to maintainthe old lines upon which we could fall back if compelled
to do so.-   He knew that it was difficult to get into the minds of the  rank and file of the troops who had been vaii-predominantly and successfully advancing from one position to another,the idea that it was necessary to devote more attention todigging and protection.Sir Edward Carson add*d that, if this Tar was to goon,  it* was essential that we should save men.Si 1 Douglas Kaig pointed out the position of theBritish lines upon a map, and stated that he had given ordersfor the preparation of defensive positions in depth and theimprovement of ou&quot; trench systems;.    In certain areas it wasvery difficult to dig deep dugouts,  owing to the prevalence of waterlogged ground.    With regard to &quot;pill-boxes&quot;, weshould be able to utilise a certain number of those taken from the Germans, but the construction of &quot;pill-boxes&quot; was rendered difficult owing&apos;to the great quantity of material required, namely, ten tons for one man.    The whole . difficulty,presented to him was on:- of labour..   If he had more men toconstruct defences, the latter could be still further im-proved.   He had re-organised the system of working-parties,.with a view to avoiding loss of time, and was continuallyadvised regarding the  state of the defensive works by hisEngineer-in-Chief, General Heath.    This officer had experiencEngineer Officers in all sectors of the Front, who reportedto him how the Work was proceeding.    Sir Douglas Haig explain-.ed the system whereby responsibility for the  proper mainten-anoe of defences was. delegated to the Infantry Commanders in.each particular sector, -who&apos;were advised by the Royal Engin-volunteers upon the technical aspects of the work.   He gathered that the French had not kept&quot; up their defensive lines as wellas we had, and -that there was great need for their improvemerLord Derby stated that he was sending out on a temper-&apos;ary mission to Sir Douglas Haig&apos; an experienced Civil Enginee
for- the purpose of advising whether new labour-savingdevices and machinery could be employed upon the construction and improvement&apos; of defences,    He also hoped that it might bepossible to obtain some Labour Companies from.Italy for assisting in the work,Sir Douglas Haig added thai a new edition of GeneralInstructions regarding the Preparation of Defences was about to be issued to all. concerned,  and he would embody in this issue, the two specific points emphasized above by the PrimeMinister .PROSPECTS OP (13) Mr Bonar Law asked Sir Douglas Eaig the following a GERMAN :OFFENSIVE. question:-    &quot;If you were a German Commander, would you think there was a sufficient chance of a smashing offensive tojustify incurring the losses which would be entailed&quot;?.Sir Douglas Haig replied that it seemed to him thatan expensive offensive would not pay the Germans.    If theyfailed, they were so much the worse off, while the presentposition gave them little hope of substantial success. Therewere two ways of effecting victory in a V?ar like this:-(a) By destroying the enemy&apos;s Army:(b) By destroying the moral of the enemy people.The latter course had proved successful in Russia, and seemednow to be the enemy&apos;s game.    However,;&apos;he was taking nochances, and was making every preparation in case the much-advertised offensive materialised.   :We were now in possessionof all the main ridges which the Germans had held last year,and we were therefore in a much better - position to deal withan enemy offensive.-   He was somewhat apprehensive of theeffect of German propaganda in the Belgian Army,, and thoughtthat this matter should be; drawn to. i the attention of theGovernment.Lord Robert Cecil added that he had evidence of con-siderable dissatisfaction among the Belgians in London,
(14) The War Cabinet invited the views of Sir ^D-ouglas Haigin regard to the use of Cavalry.Sir Douglas Haig stated that he considered the value and importance of the Cavalry to be very great not cnly inoffensive but also in defensive operations.    This was due totheir superior mobility and the ease with which Cavalry could&apos;   &apos;&quot;fHfilJJU&quot;,..,r1 &apos;1 &apos; one sector to another and then used dismcaurtedj-He pointed&apos; out that the British Cavalry resembled highly-trained mobile Infantry rather than the old Cavalry arm.The. Prime Minister pointed out that the Cavalry ques-tion vitally affected shipping, and that, in vie&apos;? of theshortage of shipping, he hoped that every effort would bemade to economise the requirements of our Army in the matterof horses and their maintenance.    It would be most helpful if some of the *j ships now utilised in the transportof horses and hay could be used for the purpose of bringingover American troops.Lord Gurzon added that it would appear that the char-acter of wa^fa-e during the ensuing few months would presentfewer opportunities for the use of Cavalry.Sir Douglas Kaig stated that once the Cavalry had beendisbanded it would be very difficult to build up again sohighly-trained and technical an arm, and it would requiremany months before the Cavalry,  once dissipated, could be re-created,.(15) The &quot;far Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on thesubject of the troops required for home defence (Paper G.T.-3212) by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The latterreported that Conferences had taken, place between the Admiraand the War, Office upon the subject, and that the matter was now submitted for the.consideration and decision of the WarCabinet..   The risk to be taken must be taken by the Governmeas it was not possible for either the Admiralty or the WarOffice to take the risk entailed.
The First Sea Lord stated that too much importance shouldnot be attached to the question of the number of men which theGermans might or might not be able to bring to our shores.    Thematter had to be examined from a broad point of view, and in hisopinion the risk for the enemy was such that he advised the Cabinet,to take the responsibility of reducing the number of mobile troopsretained for home defence, as suggested.Sir Eric Geddes agreed with the view put forward by theFirst Sea Lord* and added that the matter- could not be considered as a purely Naval one.    It might be from 36 to 4=8 hours before theGrand Fleet or a Naval detachment could reach the threatened pointon our coasts, but, given the assistance of shore defences, hethought that the risk of a landing was sma11.The War Cabinet decidedTo take the risk of reducing the forces allocated to Home Defence to such strength as would deter anenemy force up to 30,000 men from attempting a land-ing in this country, and they authorised the Army -Council to make the reductions in the strength ofthe Home Defence force indicated in the Memorandumby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (paper g-.T-.-3SI -.(16) Lord Robert Cecil reported that l r Lockhart,,  our lateConsul-General in Moscow, waa now in this country, but would beproceeding to Petrograd at the end of that week, to take up his duties as the channel of communication with the Bolshevik party.In the meantime, Led Robert Cecil had given instructions to our embassy at Petrograd to get someone outside the Fjmbassy into touchwith M, Trot ski, the selection being&apos;left to our present Represen-tative at Petrograd.   He added that a difficult sitxiation was be in-created in London by a demand that  the funds and documents of theRussian Embassy should be handed over to M.. Litvinoff.    Lo&quot;-d robert cecil was strongly opposed to the idea, as the funds of the Embass-wculd probably be spent by M. Litvinoff in spreading Bolshevik propaganda in this country.    He understood that no fault could befound on personal grounds with M, Litvinoff.
The Prime Minister drew attention to a Press report which went to sliow that M.. Trotzki was quarrelling with theGermans, a&apos;nd that the  Social Revolutionary Party, who werethe only alternatives to the Bolsheviks, were quite as likelyif&quot; not more likely,  to give in to German demands as was M.Trotzki.(17) Lord Robert Cecil reported that&apos; information had beenreceived that some of the present Roumanian Ministry were anxious to make a separate peace.    The King of Roumania was prepared to dismiss these Ministers if we wished him to do soM. Cleraenceau was in favour of this course.    Lord robert cecil gathered that the Chief of the Imperial General Staffdid not anticipate any Austro-German advance against the-Roumanian Army, at any rate for two or three months.    He had little faith in the abilitjr or determination of the Ukraineto resist such an advance, and the 15 good Divisions of theRoumanian Army constituted the only military force which prevented the  Germans advancing into the Ukraine and obtain-ing supplies.    He added that if we left it to the discretion&apos;of the Roumanian Government it would seem inevitable that&apos;they would make a separate peace.   They could only be kept in the war by pressure from Us and from Prance..Lord Milner pointed out that,if Roumania stayed inthe field, a certain number of Austro-German Divisions, whiolcould otherwise be released for service elsewhere, would be tied up upon.that front.    It was doubtful whether it wouidsuit German policy to over-run Roumanian territory by force,as it appeared inevitable that,  sooner or later, Roumania wcform part.of the Central Bloc.    He agreed that the Ukrainewas a feeble reed upon which to lean, but there was an outsitchance of something materialising in that-country if Roumanj theld on;   whe-eas if Roumania went out, any idea of rallyin-the Ukraine would be at an end.
The Prime Minister added that the retention of theRoumanian Army in the field gave the -Austrian3 an excuse^ for resisting the German demands for the transfer of Austritroops to other theatres of war.The War Cabinet decided that:-^The Acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should communicate the view of theWar Cabinet-?-viz.that we should do&quot; all inour power to keep Roumania in the %ry-to the French Government, with a view tojoint   representations being made to Roumaniato this intent.(Sir Edward Carson wished his dissent fromthis decision to be recorded,  and express-ed the view that the Roumanians ought nowto be allowed to make a separate peace.)NEXT MEETING (18)  Captain Amery reported that three important ReportsOF THE supreme war COUNCIL,    now being prepared by the Military Advisers to the supreme war Council,  namely:-(a) The Turkish Situation;(b) The Western Front;(c) The General Military Situation)would be read;; by the end of that week.-The Prime Minister pointed out that it would not be feasible to hold a meeting of the Supreme War Council until these Reports had been received and considered by the WarCabinet.    He therefore proposed that the next Meeting of thnot beforeSupreme War Council should/be held cp. Thursday week next,January 17, 1918,Thi3 was ag re ed to.2, Whitehall Gardens, S .W .,January 7,  1918.

WAR CABINET 316.

DRAFT MINUTES of a Meeting held at 10, Downing Street, S.W., ON MONDAY, JANUARY 7, 1917, at 11-30 a.m.

SUBMARINES.

(1) The First Sea Lord of the Admiralty stated that there were no great changes in the Naval situation. An explosion had occurred whilst a patrol boat was attacking a submarine, but it was not yet known if the submarine was sunk.

 A Hospital Ship had been torpedoed off Havre, but there was no loss of life, with the exception of three Lascars.

STOKES AT VLADIVOSTOCK.

(2) (With reference to War Cabinet 309 A.,) the First Sea Lord stated that the "SUFFOLK" had been ordered to Vladivostock, first calling at Sasebo, with instructions to act with the Japanese authorities and report on the situation.

 Lord Robert Cecil said he thought that the Japanese ultimately intended to seize Vladivostock, but that they would not do so at present.

 In this connection, attention was called to telegram No. 7 from Sir C. Greene, Tokio, dated January 5, 1918, which stated that the Japanese had complained of a want of frankness on the part of the British Government, and that the Japanese did not propose to act independently at Vladivostock.

 Lord Robert Cecil emphasized the effect upon Russian opinion if no Allied troops were present at the seizing of Vladivostock. The Russians would imagine that the Japanese

L.P.1-W.O.G

 
 were endeavouring to carry out the designs they had in the Russo-Japanese War. Also, the British Government desired to obtain the control of the Siberian Railway, and if the Japanese went alone to Vladivostock it would make this operation much more difficult.

 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that it would take four or five days to move the British troops, which were now at Hong-Kong, to Vladivostock.

 The War Cabinet instructed:-

 The First Lord of the Admiralty to send the "SUFFOLK" to Vladivostock in any case, and any decision the War Cabinet arrived at with regard to the despatch of troops would not affect the First Lord&apos;s instructions.

GERMAN DIVISIONS ON THE WESTERN FRONT.

(3) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff stated that the Germans were reorganising their army on the Western Front, and the formation of additional Corps and one additional Army had now given it the character of an offensive force. No more Divisions had, however, been moved over from Russia recently, though the Germans had 28 more Divisions on the Western Front than they had this time last year.

POLAND.

 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that (4) A French report from Russia indicated that difficulties were being encountered in the formation of the Polish Army.

SALONICA.

Condition of Russian Troops

(5) The Chief of the Imperial General Staff informed the War Cabinet that General Guillaumat had reported that the condition of the Russian units at Salonica was most unsatisfactory, and that he (General Guillaumat) suggested sending these units to Tunis.

Health of Troops.

(6) Lord Derby stated that he had received a disquieting telegram from Sir Donald Ross (the tropical disease expert) regarding the health of the troops at Salonica. The telegram stated that the men were saturated with malaria, and 
Lord Milner stated that a study of the matter was being made at Versailles.

 Captain Amery reported that all Sections had put in reports upon the subject, which would be ready for the consideration of the Cabinets by the end of that week. Captain Amery added that he had seen General Cadorna&apos;s report, which concluded with a suggestion that our line should be extended to a point somewhere between Barissy and Barry-au-Bac.

 The Prime Minister pointed out that it was impossible to settle this question until there had been a full discussion with our Allies of our future military policy for the year 1918. The situation was now fairly clearly defined, and it should be possible to arrive at a definition. He gathered that M. Clemenceau still persisted in the suggestion that the British had not been and were not doing their share, whereas it was common knowledge that the brunt of the fighting in 1917 had been borne by the British, thus enabling the French Army to recover. A similar attitude to that adopted by M. Clemenceau was being spread in the American newspapers, largely by M. Tardieu.

 Sir Douglas Haig added that he had issued instructions for carrying out all that General Petain had requested him to do, and that it was impossible for him to do more at present without incurring grave risk.

 The War Cabinet instructed:-

 The Secretary to draft a telegram (Appendix) for the Prime Minister to send to M. Clemenceau, ? and directed that:-

 A Copy of this telegram should be sent to the British Military Adviser to the Supreme War Council at Versailles, asking him to submit reports for their guidance at the earliest possible date.

Situation on the British Front.

(9) Sir Edward Garson asked Sir Douglas Haig whether, in his opinion, it would be possible for the Germans to break       
CAVALRY.

(14) The War Cabinet invited the views of Sir Douglas Haig in regard to the use of Cavalry.

 Sir Douglas Haig stated that he considered the value and importance of the Cavalry to be very great not only in offensive but also in defensive operations. This was due to their superior mobility and the ease with which Cavalry could be moved from one sector to another and then used dismounted.

 He pointed out that the British Cavalry resembled highly-trained mobile Infantry rather that the old Cavalry arm.

 The Prime Minister pointed out that the Cavalry question vitally affected shipping, and that, in view of the shortage of shipping, he hoped that every effort would be made to economise the requirements of our Army in the matter or horses and their maintenance. It would be most helpful if some of the ships now utilised in the transport of horses and hay could be used for the purpose of bringing over American troops.

 Lord Curzon added that it would appear that the character of Warfare during the ensuing few months would present fewer opportunities for the use of Cavalry.

 Sir Douglas Haig stated that once the Cavalry had been disbanded it would be very difficult to build up again so highly-trained and technical an arm, and it would require many months before the Cavalry, once dissipated, could be recreated.

TROOPS FOR HOME DEFENCE.

(15) The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum on the subject of the troops required for home defence (Paper G.T.-3212) by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff. The latter reported that Conferences had taken place between the Admira and the War Office upon the subject, and that the matter was now submitted for the consideration and decision of the War Cabinet. The risk to be taken must be taken by the Government as it was not possible for either the Admiralty or the War Office alone to take the risk entailed.


The First Sea Lord stated that too iauch importar.ce shouldnot be attached to the question of the number of men which the. r Germans might or might not be able to bring to our shores.   Th:-matter had to be examined from a broad point of view, and in hisopinion the risk for the enemy was such that he advised the Cabinetto take the responsibility cf reducing the number of mobile troopsretained for home defence, as suggested.Sir Eric Goddcc agreed with the vi-.vw put forward by theFirst Soa Lord, and added that the matter could not be considered as a purely Naval one.    It might be from 55 to 48 hours before theGrand Fleet or a Naval detachment could reach the threatened pointon our coasts, but, given the assistance of shore defences, hethought that the risk of a landing was small.The War Cabinet decided:-To take the risk of reducing the forces allocated to Home Dofsnce to such strength as would deter anenemy force up to 3C,CCO men from attempting a land-ing in this country, and they authorised the Army -Council to make the reductions in the strength ofthe Home Defence force indicated in the Memorandumby the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (paper g.T.-321fI.RUSSIA.

Lord Milner stated that a study of the matter was being made at Versailles.

 Captain Amery reported that all Sections had put in reports upon the subjects, which would be ready for the consideration of the Cabinets by the end of that week. Captain Amery added that he had seen General Cadorna&apos;s report, which concluded with a suggestion that our line should be extended to a point somewhere between Barissy and Berry-au-Bac.

 The Prime Minister pointed out that it was impossible to settle this question until there had been a full discussion with our Allies of future military policy for the year 1918. The situation was now fairly clearly defined, and it should be possible to arrive at a definition. He gathered that M. Clemenceau still persisted in the suggestion that the British had not been and were not doing their share, whereas it was common knowledge that the brunt of the fighting in 1917 had been borne by the British, thus enabling the French Army to recover. A similar attitude to that adopted by M. Clemenceau was being spread in the American  newspapers, largely by M. Tardieu.

 Sir Douglas Haig added that he had issued instructions for carrying out all that General Petain had requested him to do, and that it was impossible for him to do more with the ? at present in ? without incurring grave risk.

 The War Cabinet instructed:-

 The Secretary to draft a telegram (Appendix) for the Prime Minister to send to M. Clemenceau, and directed that:-

 A copy of this telegram should be sent to the British Military Adviser to the Supreme War Council at Versailles, asking him to submit reports for their guidance at the earliest possible date.

Situation on the British Front.

(9) Sir Edward Carson asked Sir Douglas Haig whether, in his opinion, it would be possible for the German to break  


 through our lines in France in the near future.

Sir Douglas Haig replied that nothing was certain in war. A long-continued offensive by the Germans would use up all our present reserves, and our losses would continue to be heavy; but, after consultation with his Army Commanders, he was satisfied that the condition and moral of the British Army was such as to give him every confidence that the British Army would hold its own, as it had always done in the past. ?

 Sir Edward Carson added that he gathered from the report on the recent actions in the Cambrai sector that the German success were due, in part, to the inability of our Machine Gun Corps to hold the German attack. A number of the officers were young and inexperienced in defensive warfare, and he would be glad to know whether there was a danger of something similar happening on other sectors of the Front.

 Sir Douglas Haig replied that he did not feel ? apprehension upon this point. The situation at Cambrai had been somewhat unique in character, owing to ? were confronted with the necessity of employing defensive tacties when all the thoughts ? of had been directed to an offensive ?. He had recommended the appointment of extra officers to the Machine Gun Corps, and efforts were being made to work out defensive plans in detail on every section of our Front. The German machine-gunners were a Corps d&apos;Elite, consisting of picked officers and men who fought to the death after the Infantry had retired. During our offensive the Germans had had long experience of the defensive employment of machine-guns.

 The Prime Minister asked whether steps had been taken to make our Machine Gun Corps similar to the German.

 The Chief of the Imperial General Staff replied that this was being done, and every effort was made to inspire this arm with the highest degree of effiency and moral.

  
General Military Situation.

(10) Sir Edward Carson asked Sir Douglas Haig whether he thought that the military position in 6 or 12 months time would show improvement from our point of view.

 Sir Douglas Haig replied that he had not the facts or figures upon which to base a reply to this general question. He had not seen the Report of the Cabinet Committee on Man-Power, and, from his point of view, such depended upon whether his units could be kept up to establishment.

 The Prime Minister directed that:-

 Sir Douglas Haig should be shown a copy of the Report of the Man-Power Committee.

AMERICAN MILITARY ASSISTANCE.

(11) With reference to War Cabinet 307, Minute 4, and in reply to a question regarding the possible co-operation of American and British troops, Sir Douglas Haig stated that General Pershing appeared to be somewhat slow in the preparation of Staffs and training for the American Divisions now in France. He had, however, agreed with General Pershing to the establishment of a Training Camp in the British area near Amiens, to which British and American troops should be sent. His proposal was that a certain number of British Divisions should be ? Americanised. He gathered from General Pershing that the Americans in France were anxious to co-operate with and to join the British Army, but that the American ? in the United States were still anxious that the Americans should co-operate with the French rather than with the British. The French authorities had always taken the line that the Americans were to be regarded as being primarily disposed for asisting the French rather than the British, and therefore he had not thought fit to press suggestions upon the Americans.

 Mr Bonar Law stated that it had been reported to him that General Pershing was most anxious to have a consultation with Sir Douglas Haig and General Petain together.
 to do so. He knew that it was difficult to get into the minds of the rank and file of the troops who had been valiantly and successfully advancing from one position to another, the idea that it was necessary to devote more attention to digging and protection.

 Sir Edward Carson added that, if this War was to go on, it was essential that we should save men.

 Sir Douglas Haig pointed out the position of the British lines upon a map, and stated that he had given orders for the preparation of defensive positions in depth and the improvement of our trench systems. In certain areas it ? to dig deep dugouts, owing to the prevalence of waterlogged ground. With regard to "pill-boxes", we should be able to utilise a certain number of those taken from the Germans, but the construction of "pill-boxes" was rendered difficult owing to the great quantity of material required, namely, ten tons for one man. The whole difficulty presented to him was one of labour. If he had more men to construct defences, the latter could be still further improved. He had re-organised the system of working-parties, with a view to avoiding loss of time, and was continually advised regarding the state of the defensive works by his Engineer-in-Chief, General Heath. This officer had experience Engineer Officers in all sectors of the Front, who reported to him how the work was proceeding. Sir Douglas Haig explained the system whereby responsibility for the proper maintenance of defences was delegated to the ? Commanders in each particular sector, who were advised by the Royal Engineers upon the technical aspects of the work. He gathered that the French had not kept up their defensive lines as well as we had, and that there was great need for their improvement.

 Lord Derby stated that he was sending out on a temporary mission to Sir Douglas Haig an experienced Civil Engineer      


 for the purpose of advising whether new labour-saving devices and machinery could be employed upon the construction and improvement of defences. He also hoped that it might be possible to obtain some Labour Companies from Italy for assisting in the work.

 Sir Douglas Haig added that a new edition of General Instructions regarding the Preparation of Defences was about to be issued to all concerned, and he would embody in this issue the two specific points emphasized above by the Prime Minister.

PROSPECTS OF A GERMAN OFFENSIVE.

(13) Mr Bonar Law asked Sir Douglas Haig the following question:- "If you were a German Commander, would you think there was a sufficient chance of a smashing offensive to justify incurring the losses which would be entailed"?.

 Sir Douglas Haig replied that it seemed to him that there were two ways of effecting victory in War:-

(a) By destroying the? enemy&apos;s Army:

(b) By destroying the moral of the enemy ?. (A)? was taking no chances, and was making every preparation in case the much-advertised offensive materialised. (B) He was somewhat apprehensive of the effect of German propaganda in the Belgian Army, and thought that this matter should be drawn to the attention of the Government.

 Lord Robert Cecil added that he had evidence of considerable dissatisfaction among the Belgians in London.

The First Sea Lord stated that too much importance shouldnot be attached to the question of the number of men which theGermans might or might not be able to bring to our shores.
