THE PRIME MINISTER said that since the last Meeting he and his Ministers had carefully examined various papers, in particular a translation of Arabic excerpts sent by King Hussein to the Emir Feisal on the alleged treaty of His Majesty&apos;s Government and himself, which His Highness had been good enough to send viz.l8/Q/252 (Appendix). These extracts came upon them all with a great measure of surprise, and he had at once communicated with Lord Curzon, the present Foreign Secretary, though he had no connection with the Foreign Office at the time the Treaty was alleged to have been agreed upon. He would say at once that he and his advisers knew nothing at all about the alleged Treaty, and he proposed to invite Lord Curzon to explain to the Meeting the result of the researches he had made into the Foreign Office records.

LORD CURZON stated that the first thing the Foreign Office did when the? saw the translation of the excerpts of the alleged Treaty was to ask Sir Henry McMahon, who had been High Commissioner in Egypt when the negotiations were first conducted with the Sheriff of Mecca, if the Treaty was in any way authentic. Sir Henry wrote in reply, "I have read alleged Treaty with amazement; bears no resemblance to the original document."  This statement of Sir Henry McMahon led him to look exhaustively into tho whole correspondence between the Foreign Office and King Hussein. He found that the alleged Treaty was almost identical with an enclosure sent in a letter from King Hussein to the High Commissioner in August 1918, which was King Hussein&apos;s own version of various agreements concluded between himself and ? Government. The High Commissioner,
on receiving the said communication, realising that he was not in a position to deal with the matter, referred it to London. H.M. Government had not considered it necessary to put forward any considered reply to King Hussein for the following reasons:-

(a) The whole draft was erroneous in almost every respect, and (b) the declaration made in November 1918 by the French and ourselves, which followed almost immediately upon the receipt of the letter, and which was familiar to His Highness, was regarded as a real and effective reply to the contentions put forward in the alleged Treaty. He proposed to point out ? how erroneous the whole document presented by His Highness was:-

Para. 1. From the words in the 9th line "the Arab Government" to the words "or an individual" at the end of the paragraph; this was quite new, and appeared in no agreement concluded with King Hussein.

Para. 2. There was no truth in this at all, and it appeared in no arrangement or agreement that had been made with King Hussein. H.M. Government had never at any stage presumed to interfere in tho internal affairs of Arabia.

Para. 3. Sub. Para. 1. No time was ever set by H.M. Government in regard to the occupation of ?.

Para. 3. Second Sub-Para. This was the interpretation put by King Hussein on the grants of money and it was never accepted by us.

Para. 4. Arms were not given by H.M. Government to the Arab Government but to the Sheriff ?, as spokesman of the Arab people.

Para. 5. This was quite untrue. King Hussein on April l8th, 1916 wrote to us saying that he thought it necessary that we should land troops and occupy the railway connecting Syria with Anatolia. The High Commissioner on the 19th July, 1916 replied that the military situation was such as to render any such step unnecessary.

It was therefore clear,  in respect of the document under discussion, that there had been a serious mistake.
The document in question represented what the Arabs had been crossing, and not what ? Government had accepted.

THE ? FEISAL stated that before he got to Europe, he had never referred to any agreement with Great Britain with anybody. He had regarded the agreement with Great Britain as a "moral" agreement, and he had depended on the word of British officials. His expectation had been that the Arabs were entitled to be rewarded for all they had done in the war, and he left the issue to British justice. Just before leaving Damascus to come on his present mission, as he had never seen the text of the agreement, he had applied to his father for a copy of it. The excerpts which he had submitted to the Prime Minister had been sent to him by his father. On his arrival at Marseilles he found a communication in the French press which contained a reference to a previous document referring to the agreement and the correspondence exchanged with the High Commissioner.He had at once telegraphed to his father to send him two copies of the agreement to be certified, before despatch, by the British official at Jeddah. Until he had received these copies ho did not feel that he was in a position to discuss the matter further.

LORD CURZON said that there never had been any signed agreement between H.M. Government and King Hussein. The discussions between the two parties had been carried on by means of correspondence. This correspondence he had himself examined most carefully; and, if necessary, it could all be printed and laid. It was no use to ask King Hussein for copies of the agreement, as it did not exist. The "understanding" between H.M. Government and the King arose from a
series of letters, copies of which H.M. Government would gladly produce for his Highness&apos;s perusal.

THE EMIR FEISAL asked whether the Prime Minister had a copy of a certain letter from King Hussein to the High Commissioner, bearing the date about thirteen months previously.

LORD CURZON pointed out that this was the letter of August 1918 which had already been referred to in the discussion.

(At this point, 12.30 p.m., the discussion was adjourned, while the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law, Lord Curzon and Lord Allenby, which Sir Maurice Hankey, withdrew for a private conversation).



(The Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law, Lord Curzon, Lord Allenby, and Sir Maurice Hankey rejoined the Meeting at 12.50 p.m. when the discussion was resumed).


The Prime Minister said that he and his advisers had again considered carefully the documents relating to the question under discussion, and also the statements which had been made that morning at the meeting. A satisfactory solution of the question was of the greatest importance to the relations of the Arab people and the people and the people of this country. The British Government were rest anxious to be on the best of terms with the Arab race whom they admired so much, and who in the last ?ruggle had ben so exceedingly helpful to the Allies. With a view to reaching a satisfactory solution, the British Government proposed to give a written answer to the document submitted to them by His Highness. In the meantime he would like to make one or two observations. His Highness had referred to the Aids-em? which he (Mr. Lloyd George) had submitted to His Highness and to Mons. Clemenceau, as an "agreement". The document was in no sense an agreement. He had not submitted it to Mons. Clemenceau as such, but merely as an indication of the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in respec t of the occupation of cilicia, Syria and Palestine, after a long consultation with Field Marshal Lord Allenby. Mons. Clemenceau had told him in Paris that he could not accept the aids_? as a final settlement of the questions which affected the future administration of territories concerned. When the time came, Mons. Clemenceau would put the case from the French point of view before the Peace Conference. He himself thought that the French view was that ?, ? Maria and Aleppo ought to be in the French sphere and occupied by French troops. This, however, the British Government had refussed to accept, and he had pointed out to H Clemenceau that we had entered into definite engagements with King Hussein that these towns were to be


under the Arab Government and that re proposed to hand them over to the garrisoned by Arab troops He only wished to point out that this was not the fault of negotiations between Mons. Clemenceau on behalf of the French Government and himself on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government, but merely an indication of our intetions regarding future temporary arrangements. The Aids-? had been prepared by Field Marshal Lord Allenby, ? Bonar Law, and himself before he ever saw Mons. Clemenceau in Paris. There was no alteration of a single word in the document he had prepared for presentation in Paris, and the document he had handed to the Emir Feisal. He wished the Emir to understand thoroughly that it was not the result of negotiations with the French Government behind the back of the Arab representatitives.

A second observation he desired to make was that His Majesty&apos;s Government were bringing home troops from every country where we did not intend permanently to remain, e.g.- Archangel, the Caucasus, France, etc. as rapidly as they could on account of the great expense entailed in their maintainance. As the British Government saw no prospect of peace being signed with Turkey until February of March of next year, and as they did not wish to maintain bug garrisons in the middle East until then, the proposals contained in the Aids-? had been submitted to Mons. Clemenceau. Both in the Caucacus and in North Russia strong appeals had been made to us not to evacuate, as we were assured that if we went there was bound to be trouble. To stop in all those places however, would involve so gigantic a burden on the British taxpayer, that this country would never tolerate it. When we decided to evacuate Cilicia and Syria we arranged to do it in such a way as would conform with the arrangemnts made by us with King Hussein,


as not in the correspondence with His Majesty. When the ? treaty with Turkey came to be discussed, the French would put forward their claims before the Inter Allied Council, and it was open to the Arabs to do the same; and it would be for the Council to decide upon those respective claims. In the meantime the British Government could only make provisional arrangments in conformity with the Agreements by which they were bound. Further, he would like to say that, had it not been for the gigantic sacrifices made by France as well as by Great Britain in fighting Germany as well as Turkey and Austria, Aloppo, Damancus, and Arabia itself, would not to-day be free. They were free because Great Britain with all her might fought Turkey, and also fought Germany lost she should come to Turkey&apos;s assistance. The French nation alone had lost 1,400,000 dead in the great struggle, and the British Empire had lost nearly 1,000,000. However, he loss to both countries in treasure was incalculable. It was this that had enabled the Emir Faisal to win freedom for his race. It was this great effort of the ? races that had enabled the gifted race, of which the Emir was no distinguished a representative, to free itself from Turkish thraldom. He hoped the Emir would bear this in mind, both in dealing with us and also with France which had suffered even more than the British Empire.

In conclusion he would say that the written reply to the Emir&apos;s document which he had promised would be submitted shortly, would be in His Highness&apos;s hands convenient to His Highness, and would fully explain the position. The Emir Faisal said there was only one thing that he would like to submit to the meeting before it adjourned.


as set forth in the correspondence with His Majesty. When the peace treaty with Turkey came to be discussed, the French would put forward their claims before the Inter-Allied Council, and it was open to the Arabs to do the same; and it would be for the Council to decide upon those respective claims. In the meantime the British Government could only make provisional arrangements in conformity with the Agreements by which they were bound.

It was this that had enabled the Emir Faisal to win freedom for his race. It was this great effort fo the Western races that had enabled the gifted race, of which the Emir was so distinguished a representative, to free itself from Turkish thraldom. He hoped the Emir would bear this in mind, both in dealing with us and also with France which had suffered even more than the British Empire.

In conclusion he would say that the written reply to the Emir&apos;s document which he had promised would be submitted shortly, would be in His Highness&apos;s hands by Thursday or Friday of this week if that would be convenient to His Highness, and would fully explain the position.

The Emir Faisal said there was only one thing that he would like to submit to the meeting before it adjourned.


To ^egin. with.,, had Lt not been for -the. 3r*Ltl&amp;b^. perhapsno Arab power would exi :t to-day.   The arab nation - as most grateful for all the assistance that Great Britain iu*d -gir^on them, and they fully roocgni-sed what they owed tc the PvrrLtisii-nation,    rle personal!,-- owed everything to Great Britain, buthe Mau no-&apos; speaking, not for hi\solf only, but for the -wholeArab nation, and he hoped that Syria would not be considered in the same way as -forth Russia.   On the solution of the syrian question   depended the whole Moslem movement through-out the vfov,ld.   .- arabia had fought with Groat Britain andnot with the other powers.    He himself had fought under thePlaid Marshal Coronanding in Chief.   The Field Marshal had occupied all the places referred to and he had made adeclaration that the present occupation of Syria shouldcontinue, Until the Peace Conference should make a final settlement, and also that the British troops should not beIthdrawn.    Ho felt much with France and her sacrifice forher existence.   The Arabs had also been fighting for their existence; but he was astonished that a great nation fightingfor Itc existence should now try to encroach upon a smallnation.    It was not right that Frenchmen l-hould live and thatthe- Arabs should die.    He left the issue to the British nationThe Field Marshal was there present at the meeting, and he had occupied the country and had made the declaration to which he(the Frnir Faisal) had referred.    He himself was very muchafraid that., if the British troops were withdrawn, anarchyand a gancal rising &quot;oulei ensue*   Ha left it- to the Britishnation to judge his cause..    Ha was so much attached to thatgreat friendly nation that Ma did not wish to hear from GreatBritain the sentence of death.    If it --as to be pronounced,lot it be by an international council, and not by hia friends.The Prime Minister said that the final decision must
be made by some international Council. The Field Marshal equally with them all, had thought that peace with Turkey would be signed by August or September of this year. He desired again to impress upon the Emir that public opinion in this country would not permit, now that war was over, H.M.G. to maintain British troops all over the world. The delay in obtaining peace was due to no fault of the British but to ? United States, who have not yet made up their minds to the acceptance of mandato?. The circumstances, therefore, had changed since the Field Marshal had made his declaration. As soon as the Emir had received the written answer to his declaration, he and his advisers would be very pleased to renew the discussion.

The Emir Feisal said he would await the British Government&apos;s written reply and then he very glad to confer again with them. The proposed evacuation of troops seemed to him to be based on the 1916 agreement between the British and the French, which to the Arab nation was a sentence of death. That sentence he hoped would never be pronounced by his friends.

Lord Curzon, in reply to a request by General ? Pasha undertook to send to the Emir Feisal copies of all the correspondence which had taken place between the High Commissioner and King Hussein, as well as a copy of the Sykes-Picot Agreement.

(The Meeting adjourned at 1.35 p.m.)
