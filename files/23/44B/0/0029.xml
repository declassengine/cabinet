SITUATION The &apos;^ar Cabinet had before them an Admiralty memorandum in THEBALTIC AND       on the necessity for a polioy in the Baltic Provinces (PaperNORTH RUSSIA.    - ^ , ^   &apos;M-G.T.-6969), and Memoranda dated March 14, 1919, oxroulatedby the Secretary of State for War, dealing with (a) thesituation in North Russia, and (b) the situation in theBaltic Provinces (18/J/44).Lord Curzon said that it was useless for the War Cabinetto take pieoemeal decisions with regard to military, navaland finanoial assistance to Ruaaia until there waa a defi-nite Ruaaian polioy.   At present there was no policy.   Apolioy could not be evolved in London:   it muat be framedin Paris.   Some two or three week a ago a division of respon-aibility for aaaisting certain territorie8 had been propoaed,namely, Poland to Prance, the Baltic to Great Britain, andthe other border state to other powers.   The First lord had come to him and asked if the Navy could proceed on thebaais of this division.    He (Lord Curzon) had telegraphedto Paris, with very unaatisfaotor:&quot; resulta.    It had beensuggested from Paris that a loan ahould be made to Eathonia,but this had naturally been real ated by the Treasury.    Itwas necea8ary to know preciaely for what reaaona we were,or ought to be, asaisting the varioua Ruasian elements.   Wewere asaisting Kolchak in Siberia, General Denekin in the don country, a so-called Government at Archangel and Mur-manak, and the Baltic state.   All theae were in different circumstances and had varying aim8.    Denekin and Kolohakwere Imperialista seeking to revive the old Ruasian regime.Similarly, General Yudenich waa organising Ruasian forcesin Finland, and General Leven in Lithuania al80 repie sentedthe Ruasian Imperialiat Party;    and any asaiatanoe given tothem would be used to revive the old monarchical Russia.They undoubtedly meant to attempt to recover the border state
A further difficulty lay in the fact that, while Esthoniawas now holding its own, the neighbouring Stat es were onlykept from Bolshevism by the aid of German forces.   InLatvia there were&apos;12,000 efficient German troops, which hadbeen transported by sea to Libau, opposing the Bolsheviks.We were refusing to give them help, and at the same time were refusing to send our own troops to oppose the Bolshe-boisheviks.   The Secretary of State for War now came forward witha scheme to organise Russian officers and prisoners, but such a scheme was useless until we defined our generalpolicy, and that policy could only be defined in Paris bythe Peace Conference.(At this stage MR Churchill entered.)Mr Churchill stated that he had circulated the two memoranda in response to the desire of the General Staff,but had not put them forward as his policy.    He felt thatthe War Cabinet decision with regard to Murmansk andArchangel, when known, would deal a considerable blow tothe Russian cause generally.   At the same tine the Murmansk-Archangel line was so unpromising in a strategic sense that he did not think it wise to press the Russians tomake special efforts to defend it, as efforts there would lead to nothing.   He had just heard from the Chief of theImperial GeneralS taff the result of conversations he had had in Paris with our Prime Minister and with MarshalPoch.   Marshal Poch was opposed to encouraging the russians to go in at this point, and the Prime Minister similarlyfeared tliat the policy suggested in the War Office Memo-randa would only lead to costly enterprises like that inwhich we were participating with General Denekin. general wilson went on to suggest that before sending a mission to the Baltic it was necessary to wait for a decision on Russian policy from the Supreme War Council;   but when that would be obtained he had no idea.
Mr Churchill, continuing, said that the War Cabinet mustface the fact that the North of Russia would be over-run by Bolsheviks, and many people would be murdered.   He was increasingly distressed with the way the situation had developed since the Armistice.   Everything was going wrong.The continued dishearteninr, of the Russian forces friendly to us had led to a great falling off in their moral.    &quot;henfiring stopped,  the Ukraine was occupied by the Germans.We requested them to withdraw, but we put in no allied force there, and now that area, rich in food, was in thehands of the Bolsheviks.   The Bolsheviks were takingMioholiev and Kherson, and were advancing on the black sea.    Odessa might soon be invested.   Pour months had passed in a policy of drift, and great, potential resources which might have helped us were being dissipated.    It wasidle to think we should escape by sitting still and doing nothing.    Bolshevism was not sitting still.    It was advance-ing, and unless the tide were resisted it would roll overSiberia until it reached the Japanese, and perhaps driveDenekin into the mountains, while the border haltic states would be attacked and submerged.    So doubt when all theresources friendly to us had been scattered, and when india was threatened, the Western Powers would bestir themselves and would be prepared to put forth ten times the effortthat at an earlier stage would have sufficed to save thesituation.    He could only express the profound apprehensionwith which he awaited what was coming.   He had beenbackwards and forwards to Paris in vain.    He had dis-cussed the situation with Marshal Foch, who had a definiteplan for action without /
the use of British and French forces, or money, but only by guaranteeing loans to the smaller States:

Both the Prime Minister and President Wilson were against a intervention

The First Lord said that the Admiralty had suggested the formation of a Committee, similar to the Eastern Committee, which should advise upon the policy for the Baltic Provinces, and should review this policy from time to time. Such a Committee could at least formulate questions for the Supreme War Council, to which the War Cabinet could request an answer. Possibly in this way definite pressure could be put on President Wilson. He agreed with the Secretary of State for War that we were running the risk of grave disaster, and we should be confronted with questions in Parliament to which it would not be easy to reply.

Admiral Fremantle urged the need for some co-ordinating policy. We were at present rendering naval and military assistance in a thoroughly unsatisfactory fashion. We had lost a valuable Light Cruiser, with eleven lives.    If the Bolsheviks increased their concentration on the Esthonian front we might lose everything we had put there. While this expenditure and loss were being incurred, the Treasury were refusing to advance loans to Esthonia (on the security of flax, and to Latvia (on the security of timber). He thought there should be a Committee co-ordinating our policy in the Baltic Provinces, and containing representatives of the Admiralty, the War Office, the Treasury and the Ministry of Food.

Mr Bonar Law asked whether such a Committee could say what we ought to do to protect the Provinces and also furnish an estimate of the cost.

Lord Curzon said that it was not surprising that the Treasury were obdurate on the question of loans to the
Baltic States.   The representatives of Rsthonia and Latviahad each asked for a loan of  15,000,000, which was anabsurdly large sum, and which the Treasury had properlyrefused.   He had a Note in preparation for the War Cabinet,recommending, subject to the policy to be decided on, a loan of  2,000,000 to each State, to he shared between us and the Allies.Mr Bonar Law asked was it not impossible for us to go onundertaking to help one part of Russia after another whileAmerica definitely stood out?The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated that the UnitedStates would do nothing to help such a policy.   The Frenchborrowed what they were lending^for spending, and the burdenin effect fell on us.   He h3d just returned from Paris,where the French had asked him to assist them at a rateequal to our total pre-War expenditure.   The Americans ex-pressed their disinclination to do more for France or forus than assist with purchases made in the United States.There was no way out for a ruined Europe unless the UnitedStates would untie her purse-strings.    It was impossiblefor Europe to shoulder these ever-accumulating burdenswithout the assistance of the United States.   On the otherhand, there was something to be said for working out theproblem in London, so that a careful statement could besent to Paris to the Prime Minister.    Our naval and mili-tary experts could aay definitely what steps might beundertaken, and give some estimate of the cost.Mr Bonar Law said that he saw no objection to a Commit-tee considering the question of protecting these borderStates, but he would be against spending a penny on suchprotection without the participation of President Wilson;because even if we got the French to share, in fact weshould have to pay.Mr Long said that unless some large organised polioy
were pursued by the Allies, Russia would be reduced for along time to anarchy and misery;    and, with such a prospecthow could the Powers sign a Treaty of Peace in Paris?Mr Chamberlain said there was not the slightest chanceof securing financial help from Pranoe or Italy for under-takings against Russia.    If, therefore, it meant that thewhole burden of resisting Russian Bolshevism was to be thrown on this oountry, we should break down under the strain.   That was a very real danger.   He thought it wouldbe useful to learn from the proposed Committee what exactlywas involved in carrying along esthonia and Latvia.    He had seen no calculation of what would be required in the way ofmilitary, naval and financial assistance.   He had expressed his willingness to give them oredit to cover the provisionof machinery, but had made it plain that for other assist-ance they must tu*n to the United States.Lord Curzon S3id the Eastern Committee had been usefulbecause it had been presided over by a Cabinet minister with power to hear Departmental views and to take decisionsWhat was now needed was to bring pressure on the paris conference, and he proposed that the Foreign Office should draw up a despatch for submission to the Prime Ministerand our representatives in Paris.    It should deal only withthe Baltic Provinces.    He was willing to draw up the des-patch, but would like to receive the written views of theWar Office, the Admiralty and the Treasury.Mr Bonar Law asked whether it was possible to put down with any definiteness the probable cost in ships^ men and money.Admiral Fremantle said the answer would depend upon whattroops the Bolsheviks would concentrate in any particularplace.   esthonia had been able, with the help of Finnishvolunteers, British arms and British ships, to clear their territory of Bolsheviks;   but Latvia had been over-run.
We were at present helping Latvia with the moral supportof our ships, and our coal, oil and military supplies were really now being used to the advantage of the Germans.Mr Churchill said we were really helping the Germans,because in this case the Germans were helping us.   We were able to control the Germans, but we were not able to control the Bolsheviks.to allowMr Chamberlain pointed out that Marshal Poch had refused^further reinforoements of Germans to be landed.Mr Churchill said that our representatives at Spa werebeing pressed by the Germans as to what exactly we wantedthem to do.Lord Curzon said he wished to obtain a decision from thePeace Conference.   He doubted whether the appalling aharacterof the situation was fully realised in Paris.Mr Churchill said it was difficult to frame estimateswhen there were so many uncertain counters and factors ofevery degree of variation in the situation.    If, for,in-stance, we decided to wage war on the Bolsheviks, then thestock of Denekin and Xolehak would immediately go up;    so would that of the Esthonians and the Letts.    One could notcalculate the cost exactly until the Allies made up their minds whether they were out for a vigorous campaign or not.Mr Bonar Law said that an effort must be :aade to disting-uish our activities in the Baltic States from the largerRussian policy .   We had undertaken to support the baltic states against the menace of Bolshevism.Mr Chamberlain said we had decided that we were not going to fight the Bolsheviks all along the line. It wasbeyond the capacity of Prance and Britain to do so, and theUnited States would not co-operate.   That could be made plain to the General Staff.   They should address themselvesto the question of what was necessary to prevent the Baltic
2=7-ft!States from being submerged.Mr Churchill said that the General Staff could onlyproceed on certain hypotheses, and he wished again to impress the War Cabinet that the danger was growing everymoment and spread/ing with extraordinary rapidity.The War Cabinet decided that  (a) The War Office, the Admiralty, and, ifthey wished to do so, the Treasury,should 8end Memoranda to the ForeignOffice, dealing with the assistancerequired to protect the Baltic Statesfrom Bolshevism, and the probable costof such assistance:(b) On the basis of these Memoranda, the acting Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should prepare a despatch tothe Prime Minister, ashing for thedirection of the Supreme War council as to the policy to be pursued inregard to the Baltic Provinces:(c) In the meantime, no Naval or military mission should be sent to this area.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1March 17,  1919.

were pursued by the Allies, Russia would be reduced for a long time to anarchy and misery: and, with such a prospect, how could the Powers sign a Treaty of Peace in Paris?

Mr Chamberlain said there was not the slightest chance of securing financial help from France or Italy for undertakings against Russia. If, therefore, it meant that the whole burden of resisting Russian Bolshevism was to be thrown on this country, we should break down under the strain. That was a very real danger. He thought it would be useful to learn from the proposed Committee what exactly was involved in carrying along Esthonia and Latvi?. He had seen no calculation of what would be required in the way of military, naval and financial assistance. He had expressed his willingness to give them credit to cover ? but had made it plain that for other assistance they must turn to the United States.

Lord Curzon said the Eastern Committee had been useful because it had been presided over by a Cabinet Minister with power to hear Departmental views and to take decisions. What was now needed was to bring pressure on the Paris Conference, and he proposed that the Foreign Office should draw up a despatch for submission to the Prime Minister and our representatives in Paris. It should deal only with the Baltic Provinces. He was willing to draw up the despatch, but would like to receive the written views of the War Office, the Admiralty and the Treasury.

Mr Bonar Law asked whether it was possible to put down with any definiteness the probable cost in ships, men and money.

Admiral Fremantle said the answer would depend upon what troops the Bolsheviks would concentrate in any particular place. Esthonia had been able, with the help of Finnish volunteers, British arms and British ships, to clear their territory of Bolsheviks; but Latvia had been over-run.

S. of S.1* I attach herewith a draft telegram&quot;!?! reply to General Iron-side&apos;s last wire (sco copy attached).I sent a copy of this draft to C.I.G.S. in Paris last nighttelling him that I was sending you a copy, and asking him if heapm^oved of the idea, to approach the French forthwith and gettheir approval to the scheme in which they should of course heartheir share.The question of organizing Russian personnel to take theplace of our troops if and when we wlthdravT is most urgent and ist^o onl-&quot;- Possible chance of keeping) the Archangel Government onits legs,2, There Is reason to believe that if a great effort, is madethe troops could be ready in time, but there are only two clearmonths available for collection, organization and the littletraining 5.t will be possible to give.3. On account of political difficvilties the Idea of gettingJu.de nitch&apos;s troops can only be regarded as a second string to ou.rbow, but it is worth trying and I have proposed to C.I.G.S. thatwe should send a small mission to investigate possibilitiesforthwith,4. The main effort must be made in Prance,        Steps are be5.n&apos;rtaken to find out the exact situation as regards the Russianprisoners both In Germany and in tho h ct.ds of the French,The best course would be to organize the forces somewhere inFrance and ship thorn direct when ready from that countryj     weshall have to overcome any French objections.5. But apart from the larger scheme there are two others whichare already in preparation, but which arc being hold up for wantof
of Treasury sanction :-(A) Maynard asked early in January for 2,000 Russianprisoners to be organized and sent to him, halfi ofwhich were to be technical personnel for railway workand the remainder fighting; troops *The French are getting these men and it Is expected thatthey could be ready long before those now contemplatedin the lai^ger scheme.(B) General Henderson in Paris with the approval of theFrench, got together some time ago a list of selectedRussia.n officers in France whom it was proposed to send- to various Russian theatres.        This scheme was blockedearly In January by the Treasury, who refixsed tocontemplate it &quot;except In furtherance of a definitepolicy adopted by the &quot;!ar Cabinet&quot; .Both the above schemes now work in absolutely with thelarger schpme now contemplated and it is urgently necessary thatthe War Cabinet should agree to them and overcome the Treasuryobjection, in order that no time may be lost.(Sgd).

March 10th,H.M, Government would view the downfall of the North RussianGovernment and collapse of all anti-Bolshevik forces in NorthRussia with great regret, not only because of the moral advantageswhich would accrue to the Bolsheviks, but also on account of themoral obligations we have undertaken.They realise that the Russian forces now in being in NorthRussia are not sufficiently strong to stand by themselves,  thusinvolving the collapse of the Government in event of withdrawlof Allied troops.There are available in France and Germany large numbers ofRussian officers and other ranks, and immediate steps are beingtaken to ascertain whether it would be possible,  in the shorttime available to organise under Allied and Russian Officerssuch Russian forces as would be sufficient to maintain themselves,both on the Murman Railway and on the Archangel front, after with-drawal of all Allied forces.In addition to the above, there are certain Russian forcesunder General Yudenich,  now organising in Finland, and it mightbe possible if you consider it advisable, to persuade him to allowhis forces to be transferred to North Russia.    I should likeyour opinion on this point.If the above scheme is found feasible it might be possible toland the necessary forces at Murmansk and Archangel as soon asWhite Sea opens, or at any rate shortly after, say end of Juneor beginning of July,Problem would then be reduced to a relief of Allied byRussian personnel and the placing of North Russia on the samefooting as Siberia and Sottth Russia.
Allies would be represented by strong Military Missions atArchangel and Murmansk.       Such Volunteer officers and otherranks would be left or provided as necessary for instructionaland supply purposes.Political representatives would remain together with thenecessary staffs to deal with the food problem.To assist us in getting ahead with the collection andorganisation of the necessary forces - Murmansk and Archangelshould wire as soon as possible :-       Units by arms whichshould be raised. This should be followed in duecourse by:-(A) Estimates of material of all kinds which it would be.necessary to send, to supplement the military storeswhich would be left behind by the Allies.(B) Estimate by mnks, numbers and arms of allied volunteerpersonnel which would be required by the proposedMilitary Missions at Murmansk and Archangel,Do not start transferring SB Legion to Russian Army for thepresent until we can say definitely prospects of above scheme,8.

In my opinion, the state of the Russian Commandnext June will not be such that it can continue defenceunless strengthened by a large number of good Russianofficers to replace British administration and alsoRussian troops.     Are there any Russian Officers andRussian troops available to fill the ra^s made by thedeparture of the Allies who could be drawn from Franceand England.(5)    To take away the Slav-British Legion would be to deprivethe Russians of experts in essential servies such asOrdnance, A.S.G., Signals, of which they have nonethemselves.    Shall I therefore start transferring theS.B.L. to   the Russian Army as I can transfer the lot,practically without exception, with persuasion and alittle pressure but morally this should only be doneif we are certain that defence can be continued as other-wise it is simply betraying them to have their throatscut.(6)    The defence will not be possible after our departureif considerable help in officers and troops is notsupplied to the Russian Command, and it will then bemorally necessary to remove so many people that thetask will be a great strain on shipping.
