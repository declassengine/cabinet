OF     It had oeom.eC. clear to the Prime Minister and himselfCOM.. negotiations.that tho adverse vote the previous afternoon on the AliensRestrictions Bill was due to a misunderstanding.   ThoHouse generally had evidently not realised that tho BritishGovernment were bound by the Convention of 1913 to safe-guard tho interests of certain French pilots antl, further,
that in ordinary circumstances the defeat of the Government would have involved its resignation. It was in order to remove this ? that the Prime Minister had decided to invite some of the more prominent critics of the Bill to meet himself and his Ministers that afternoon. They hoped that a frank discussion would clear the air, remove misconceptions, discover a means of agreement on the points at issue and, possibly, open up a way to obviate similar difficulties in the future, by means of Parliamentary discussions between Ministers and members of the House.

The Prime Minister said that he was sure that there was no substantial difference in principle between the Government and its critics in the present instance, and he was confident that they would find agreement also in regard to the method to be adopted to deal with the situation. He further emphasised the necessity of avoiding anything which might offend the amour propre of the French at a time when diplomatic negotiations of a most delicate c?aracter were in progress. It was important that the Government should be able to reassure the French nation at once that we had no intention of going back upon the Convention of 1913.

Considerable discussion followed, in the course of which the Members of the Commons present laid stress upon two points: first, the Government did not seem to be properly aware of the strong feeling in the country against the employment of aliens; and, second, the strong dislike of Parliament, particularly now that the War was ended, to procedure by Orders in Council in place of ordinary Parliamentary procedure by Statute. General agreement was expressed with the Prime Minister&apos;s view that Parliamentary conversations between Ministers and Members would be helpful in securing in the future the smoother passage of Bills through Parliament. The discussion also revealed the fact
that in the debate of the previous day, a largo proportionof the Commons had no clear perception of what the position was and v?fcdt the various clauses of the Bill actuallyinvolvedvTH&quot;   iOHFEREHCS AGREED : -(1)   That 3ir Auckland Goddeg, Hr.
