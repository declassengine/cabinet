THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was anxious to see H.H. the Emir Poisal because the present situation could not be permitted to continue any longer. The British Government had already informed the ? Feisal, as well as M. Slemenceau, that Great Britain could not accept a ? for Syria, on the ground that they would create unpleasantness with their neighbours if they did so.  Hitherto, we had been keeping our army in Syria and Cilicia in the hope that the Treaty would be concluded with Turkey during the present month, and, therefore, we had expected to clear up the whole Treaty at once. This could not be done, however, until we knew whether the United States of America was prepared herself to take up a mandate in Turkey. It had been hoped that president Wilson would give a decision by September, but now it seemed certain that we might have to wait, some time longer for his decision, and there was some doubt as to whether the American Senate would agree to accept any mandate. In the meanwhile, the British Government had had to maintain very large forces in the Caucasus, in Syria, in Cilicia, that is to say, in territories, which they had no intention of occupying  themselves on the conclusion of peace, and the British people were complaining of the burden of expense. The British Government had, therefore, decided to withdraw their troops from all these territories, except Mesopotamia and Palestine. The question arose, therefore, for decision as to whom Field Marshal ? should hand over the garrisons of the territories evacuated, and that was the question on which he wished to consult with the Emir Feisul. Great Britain had entered into obligations with the King of the Hejaz, and with the President of the French Republic -they had entered into two distinct sets of engagements, and they
were bound to respect both equally. What he was now saying to the Emir Feisal he had already said to H. Clemenceau, and he had told M. Clemenceau that it was his intention to say the same to the Emir Feisal. The British Government considered their engagement with the King of the Hejaz to be of the same value as their engagement to the President of the French Republic, and they considered their engagement to the President of the French Republic to be of the same value as their engagement to the King of the Bejaz. Both engagements would be treated as of equal valve. Both these sets of engagements had been entered into by his own predecessors. They were recorded in writing, and he was bound by the engagements entered into by his predecessors in this Chair. He then preceeded to read the engagement entered into with King Hussein, a copy of which he handed to the Emir Feisal:-

"The districts of Mersina and Alexandretta, and portions of Syria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Rama, and Aleppo, cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries. With the above modifications, and without prejudice to our existing treaties with Arab chiefs, we accept these limits and boundaries; and in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment in regard to these portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment in the name of the Government of Great Britain to give the following assurances, and make the following reply to your letter:-

&apos;Subject to the above modifications, Great Britain is prepared to recognise and support the independence of the Arabs within the territories included in the limits and boundaries proposed by the Sherif of Mecca.&apos;

With regard to the vilayets of Bagdad and Basrah, the Arabs will recognise that the established positiion and interests of Great Britain necessitate special measures of administrative control in order to secure these territories from foreign aggression, to promote the welfare of the local pupulation, and to safeguard our mutual economic interests."

The point about this engagement was that Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, were recognised as being within the Arab


State. King Hussein had been told that the district of Mersina and Alexandretta and portions of Syria lying to the west of that line could not be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from the proposed limits and boundaries of the Arab territory.   The agreement entered into with the French in 1916 also provided that Damacus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo should be Arab, but that the area to the west of these towns should be subject to such direct or Indirect administration or control as the French desire and as they may think fit to arrange with the Arab State or Confederation of Arab States. The ultimate settlement of these territories the British Government were not now attempting to determine. All that they now proposed was to evacuate these territories and hand over their garrisons in accordance with the agreement entered into with King Hussein.   The eventual settlement would be determined by the Treaty of ? with Turkey.   At present, only the arrangements for military occupation were under discussion.  Consequently, Field Marshal Allenby, in conjunction with whom this document had been prepared, he himself, had both seen M.Clemenceau, and had informed him distinctly that they could not hand over Damascus, Horns, Hama and Aleppo to French troops, and that when the Field Marshal ordered his troops out of these places he would hand over the towns to the Emir Feisal to hold until the Pence Treaty finally decided their disposition. ? of that line the Field Marshal would retire in favour of French troops, who would occupy the country until the Peace Treaty decided on its eventual disposal. The evacuation would begin on November 1, 1919. He wanted the Emir Feisal to arrange with the Field Marshal as to how he would occupy these places. This was a matter not for the British Government but for Field Marshal Allenby. The same applied in the case of the handing over to the French, and tho Field Marshal had already seen M. Clemenceau. The British troops, after their withdrawal from Syria and Cilicia, would hold the line of Palestine and
Mesopotamis (including ? until the Peace Conference decided what the future of ? territories was to be. His intention was to band to the Emir Feisal the said aide-memoire which he had handed to ... Clemenceau, and this contained certain subsidiary questions which he wished to discuss, e.g., he would ask for the right to make a railway and oil pipe line through the Arab State from Mesopotamia to the Mediterranean. This was a question which could be discussed with his Highness whenever convenient. He would only say one further word before handing him this document, namely, that whatever views the Emir Feisal might hold about the final dispositions, he hoped that he would fall in with these temporary arrangements. Later he could put any further points he wished to raise, such as the question of access to the sea, to M. Clemenceau, when the Treaty with Turkey was discussed. This, however, would not be until it was known whether President Wilson could accept a mandate, and this would probably not be before November.

THE EMIR FEISAL asked that he might be permitted to ask certain questions in order to make everything clear.

THE PRIME MINISTSR agreed.

THE EMIR FEISAL expressed the gratitude of His Majesty his Father and his own feelings of gratitude, as well as those of the Arab nation to the Prime Minister himself, to the Field Marshal Commanding-in-Chief, and to the British nations for all that they had done. This being a question on which the whole future of the Arab nation depended, he wished to make certain observation. When the present rising against the Turks had originally taken place, the Arabs had known of only one great Power, namely, Great Britain, whose representative had acted for Mr. ?squich, whom the Emir did not know personally. There had been no question of France, or the United States of America, or of any other Power connected with the engagement which his Father had entered
into. Consequently, he had ? certain agreement with Great Britain, as the result of which the Arabs had taken up arms against Turkey, basing themselves on the pledge of Great Britain. The Arabs were a very small nation, but they had done their very best in this matter. (THE PRIME MINISTER interjected "Quite true".) They had full hopes that Great Britain would help them to realise their aspirations. He now wished to put this question:-

"Did Great Britain, France, and the United States of America, that is to say, the Great Powers, still maintain the words they had uttered to small nations, and, more especially, the Anglo-French Declaration of November 9, 1918"?

He wished to know whether this Declaration still held good?

He wished to say that his father had nothing to do with the Peace Conference, but he had cert in engagements with Great Britain. with regard to the new arrangements proposed he wished to ask two questions:-

(1) Will the subsidy continue to be paid from the British territory or not?

(2) will the British Commander-in-Chief continue to exercise his command over the districts from which the troops were withdrawn?

He asked this because, when the Syrians had hoisted the Arab flag and actually proclaimed the Arab Government in the Coasts, the Commander-in-Chief had divided the country into districts and had insisted on the withdrawal of the Arabs into certain districts as a temporary arrangement. It was important to know, therefore,whether his command was to continue or not.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he had better answer these questions at once. The first question was as to whether Great Britain stood by her engagements to His Majesty King Hussein, - the answer wan that at Great Britain stood by every one of them. The Arab forces had redeemed the pledges they gave to Great Britain, and we should redeem our pledges. For this Great
Britain had been attacked somewhat fiercely in the French Press. It was because Great Britain was redeeming these pledges that he had been so anxious to see the Emir Feisal, and he was most grateful to him for coming to this country He had wished to explain to Him that the arrangements for military occupation were being mace in accordance with the pledges given.

THE EMIR ? said he had something to say about these engagements. First a Treaty had been made with the King of the Hejaz, and then there had been a preliminary letter. Then came the latter of October 24, 1915, in which the interests of France had been referred to. There was on record an official letter from the King of the Hejaz that he did not accept any charge in the original agreement, and that if any change in it were made he would withdraw, He promised to forward a copy of this correspondence.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was the first time that he had heard of any definite Treaty with King Hussein, other that the correspondence that he had already referred to. Colonel Cornwallis informed him, however, that he knew of the letter which His Majesty the King of the Hejaz had written to Sir Henry McMahon, and he reported that Sir Henry McMahon had replied that he also stood by his letter of October 24, 1915. The King of the Hejaz reiterated his claims but it was considered unnecessary to reply.

(MR.BONAR LAW entered at this point and the PRIME MINISTER explained to him how matters stood).

THE EMIR FEISAL said that the whole correspondence would be submitted to the Prime Minister officially, He felt sure that this further letter had been sent by his Father, who had said that he would not consent to my alteration in the original agreement.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he would await the receiptof the correspondence from the Emir Feiaal.     He would nowanswer the other questions which the Eir-ir had asked.    Afterho had done ec, he would give the Emir time to consider &quot;beforethe next meeting the reply he would make to the proposals that had teen laid before him.      He would also like theField Marshal to have a discussion with the Emir Peiaalatout the military arrangements.THE EMIR FEI3AL, reverting to the question he had justraised, said that the first agreement had teen entered into byhis Father alone, and His Majesty had never shewn it to anyone.He had always said that if there were any difference of opinion in regard to it, he would settle it with Great Britain.   He didnot mind alterations being made as long as they wore made by great Britain alone.      THE EMIR FEISAL had himself never seen the full agreement, and had only seen certain articles of itabout ten days before leaving Pamanous.    His Father had neverwanted tc make the agreement public.      Later on, hia Father had heard cf the Anglo-French Agreement of 1916, and he had thenwired to hie representative at Cairc who then communicated with the High Commissioner of Great Britain, protesting against it and saying that he would never recognise any agreement with France.THE PRIME MINISTER Paid that it would be advisable tohave copies of all the documents before continuing the die-cussion.      He then handed to the Emir Feiaal the aide memoirewhich he had handed to X. Clemenceau on September 13, 1919,and atpted that he had handed it to the representative of theUnited States of A^eripa, Mr. Polk, on September 15-Replying to th^ Emir F*iBal&apos;s questions, he said thatas r-garde th** subsidy, the suggestion had been made that the should toko responsibility for half.    The French:Government&apos;French Gov^rrmvnt/were pr**pnrrd to do so, th.* othT halfcontinuing to b* paid by Great Britain.
The other question the Emir had asked was in regard to the command. After the evacuation of Syria and Cilicia, Field Marshal Allenby would cease to command in that area. The Emir Feisal would command in Damascus, Homs, Hama, Aleppo, and the whole of that area, and the French would command in the rest of Syria. Field Marshal Allenby would continue to command in Palestine and Egypt and General Marshall would continue to command in Mesopotamia, including Mosul.

GENERAL HADDAD said that the Emir Feisal&apos;s question had referred rather to the question of administration.    At the present time, the administrators took their orders from the Commander-in-Chief. If complaints were made, these went eventually to the Commander-in-Chief. He wished to know whether this arrangement would continue.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that his interpretation was that in districts occupied by the Emir Feisal he would be responsible until the Peace Conference had decided the future of these regions. In the districts occupied by the French, the French would be responsible.

GENERAL HADDAD asked if the Emir Feisal would have the right to ask for assistance where he wished? He had lately been asking for certain assistance, for example, rifles, arms, ammunition, the loan of officers and 

officials, including officers to organise gendarmerie for the maintenance of order.

FIELD MARSHAL ALLENBY said that, of course, he could not nominate advisers outside the British sphere. The Emir Feisal wanted a financial adviser, a political adviser, and one for gendarmerie. If he were ? asked to supply these in the zone occupied by the Emir&apos;s troops he would have to refuse.

THE PRIME MINISTER said it appeared that in the areas opposite the ? zone, temporarily and provisionally occupied by the French, the Emir Feisal would have to ask for The Emir Feisal wishes it to be recorded that he himself never contemplated all "adviser" for the gendarmerie.
French advisers. In the area temporarily and provisionally occupied by the British, he would have to ask for British, he would have to ask for British advisers.

GENERAL HADDAD said that the district would, therefore have to be divided into two parts as regards requests for assistance.

THE PRIME MINISTER said this was the case. It must be understood, however, that this was only a provisional arrangement, pending the final settlement by the Peace Conference. The Emir would have to refer to the British in the district opposite the zone occupied by the British armies and to the French in the districts opposite the zone occupied by the French armies.

GENERAL HADDAD asked if it would be necessary to refer to the French for any assistance in the zone opposite the French?

THE PRIME MINISTER said if assistance were required in the district opposite the zone provisionally and temporarily occupied by the French, application could be made to the French.

THE EMIR FEISAL remarked that this was the agreement of 1915 between Great Britain and France.

THE PRIME MINISTER replied that, under this agreement, the Emir Feisal was not bound to ask for assistance unless he wished it.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that up to now the maintenance of public order in the Near East, or, he should rather say, in that special province of Syria, was first with the Prime Minister and the Commander-in-Chief of His Majesty&apos;s Army. Field Marshal Allenby would be able to tell the Prime Minister what was the state of mind of the population towards the French in certain districts, even though these were occupied by British troops and under an administration.
supervised, by the Commander-in-Chief. What he himself thought was that on the evacuation of the western zone by the British troops and their replacement by French troops, there would be great trouble and a rising if there was no British administration to appeal to. Then the French Catholics on the frontier of Lebanon would make great trouble in his own districts, and there would be a general rising against the French occupation of the coast. In his view Great Britain would be responsible for any bloodshed that might ensue.

THE PRIME MINISTER said he would be greatly distressed but he was in the position of a man who had inherited two sets of engagements made by his predecessors. He was bound to keep both sets of engagements, those to King Hussein and those to the French. He regarded the King of the Hejaz just as much as an ally as he did the President of the French Republic. He did not distinguish between the two as allies. He was trying loyally to interpret his engagements to both. Although he deplored bloodshed, he could only do his best to keep the engagements which had been signed under the authority of the Sovereign.

THE EMIR FEISAL said it was true that the Prime Minister had two sets of engagements. He believed, however, that the first was that to King Hussein, and this must be properly interpreted. In this connection he would reduce certain documents.  One of these sets of engagements had been based on the principles on which the war with Germany had been based, namely, justice and the freedom of peoples. The other set concluded with tne French Government had been on the basis of colonisation.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had a hard decision to make. But the British Government has passed its word both to the French Government and to King Hussein. They could not

THE PRIME MINISTER said he would be greatly distressed but he was in the position of a man who had inherited two sets of engagements made by his predecessors. He was bound to keep both sets of engagements, those to King Hussein and those to tho French. He regarded the King of the Hejaz just as much as an ally as he did the President of the French Republic. He did not distinguish between the two us allies. He was trying loyally to interpret his engagements to both. Although he deplored bloodshed, he could only do his best to keep the engagements which had been signed under the authority of the Sovereign.

One of these sets of engagements had been based on the principles on which the war with Germany had been based, namely, justice and the freedom of peoples. The other set concluded with the French Government had been on the basis of colonisation.

THE PRIME MINISTER said chat he had a hard decision to make. But the British Government had passed its word both to the French Government and to King Hussein. They could not
depart from their word.    The Peace Conference might make other arrangements. But as between King Hussein and the French Government, he was bound to stand by his engagements to both  The Emir Feisal could plead his case as an ally before the Peace Conference. He had a perfect right to ? his case there. He might receive satisfaction from the Peace Conference. But as a provisional arrangement, with the knowledge of the Supreme Council, he was bound to report his engagement to King Hussein and his engagement to the French Government.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that the Prime Minister could not decide what his engagements were until he nad seen the documents which ne would produce. This gave as the boundaries for the Arab Provinces the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, and did not exclude any province at all right up to the Taurus Mountains. As regards the west coast, it included everything.

COLONEL STIRLING said that the Emir Feisal claimed that it included, as its western boundary,  the Red Sea, the boundaries of Egypt and the Mediterranean.

THE PRIMS MINISTER said that this question had better be deferred until the documents were available. In the meanwhile, he hoped that the Emir Feisal wouldd examine the documents that he had presented. The Field Marshal night also discuss with him the question of the provisional boundaries before they met again.

LORD CURZON entered at thie point).

THE PRIME MINISTER explained to Lord Curzon the questions that had been put. First, in regard to the subsidy he had replied that ? Clemenceau was offering to pay half. As regards the nation to whom the Emir Feisal should lock for assistance, he had stated his view that he should apply tothe French Government in the district opposite the zone
Temporarily and provisionally occupied by French troops, and to the British Government in the district opposite the zone temporarily and provisionally occupied by British troops. As regards the temporary and provisional boundaries, he had informed him that a Cabinet Committe, composed of Lord Curzon, Lord Milner, and Field Marshal Alleby was examining the question, and he had suggested that he should meet Field Marshall Allenby on Monday afternoon. He described the correspondance which the Emir Feisal stated had passed between King Hussein and Sir Henry McMahon.

Lord Curzon said that he believed the Foreign Office had all the documents. Speaking from memory, he thought that King Hussein had made certain claims which we had been unable to accept. To avoid further difficulty the matter had been left as shown in the correspondence, that is to say, King Hussein had stated his claim and we had stated our claim.

GENERAL HADDAD promised to forward the correspondence by the following afternoon. He said that the Emir Feisal protested vehemently about the agreement. The other questions were all subsidiary to this. In 1916 there had been an agreement between the British and French Governments which the Emir had always repudiated. There had been an official telegram from the British Government to King Hussein stating that the settlement must depend on the wishes of the people. He inquired whether the people had been asked whether they wanted the French? The American Commission had visited Syria and the people had made it clear to the Commission that they did not want the French. Now the British Government wanted to impose the French. This was the main point and everything else was secondary to it.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was now asking the Emir Feisal to assent to a provisonal agreement. M. Clemenceau did not accept the whole of the aide memoire which he
had presented, and had stated that he ? not accept the part of it relating to occupation if he was to be bound by the whole of the conditions. But he was ready to accept the occupation on the understanding that the remainder of the proposals stood over until the final settlement of this question.

THE EMIR FEISAL said that he did not think that ? Clemenceau need to say this when the Germans were very near to Paris. He considered that he himiself and the Arab nation were being very badly treated in having a Power thrown on them when it had been promised that they should select for themselves, and he was certain that every Arab would shed his last drop of blood before he admitted tho French. He himself had drawn the sword basing himself on the promise of Great Britain. He had had ? interview with any other Power. He was a descendent of one of the oldest Arab families which traces its descent to the Prophet. He had taken up arms against the Kaliph on behalf of the Allies and with full confidence in Great Britain, and he felt sure that Great Britain would not allow a Power to stop in that was not wanted. The aspirations of all tho Arabs were for unity. In order to keep his honour he must be prepared to die for this unity, and not to allow any division to be made.  King Hussein hud never wanted to show the Treaty to anyone else. He was sure that he would receive fair treatment. He did not object to any interim arrangement so long as it did not prejudice the final settlement.(The Interpreter mentioned at this point that the Emir Feisal had been greatly worried about this and had not been sleeping for some nights).

He could not stand before the ? world and say that he had been asked to wage a war against the Kaliph of the Moslems and now see the European Powers divide tho Arab country.
If the French could take the responsibility for Palestine, Mesopotamia, Arabic up to the Red See, and Mediterranean, they would accept this, for they had no special hatred to the French. But there must be one Power only, and in his view that Power should be Great Britain. There had been a definite agreement, though it was true that Sir Henry McMahon had made certain objections and had quoted something about the French rights in Syria, but King Hussein had refused to make any alteration in the agreement. When Sir Henry McMahon had written and asked to exclude Syria, King Hussein had not accepted and did not consider himself bound.

THE PRIME MINISTER, after conferring with Lord Curzon and Field Marshal Allonby, observed that he did not think there was any definite sealed agreement as the Emir Faisal had stated.

GENERAL HADDAD said that Sir Henry McMahon had sealed it. He had a copy of it, but the Emir Feisal had never seen it before.

THE PRIME MINISTER asked if it was among the documents to be handed in?

THE EMIR FEISAL said chat in the Middle Ages a boat slave had had the right to demand to be sold to another master. He hoped that in the 20th century at least that right would be preserved.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the documents had better be first communicated, after which a further meeting could take place.

THE EMIR FEISAL said he was sure that there was great agitation throughout the Near East on this question, and a word was awaited from him. What should he say?

THE PRIME MINISTER said that this was only the first conference, and it was not possible to settle the question in one meeting. Consequently, he thought he had better say nothing.
1(oTHE EMIR FEISAi, said that this v;us the first time hohud &quot;been informed of the proposed agreement.
