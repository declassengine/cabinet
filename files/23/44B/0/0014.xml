I    LICATION (l)    The Conference agreed  OP CANNESRESOLUTIONS. That the Cannes Resolutions, togetherwith, the explanatory Merorandum, paper c .J&quot; .-3657 (excluding those portionsdealing with. Reparations), should bepublished as a Cosxsand Paner as soonas possible, in view of the forthcomingrjfthatft on the Oenoa Conference.
-2-*   10LUTI0H (2)  The Priite Minister said that he contemplated aTo BE MOVEDIK THE HOUS0, simple Resolution approving the Genoa Conference; approved-OP COMMONS.ing the Cannes resolutions as the basis of the Genoa Con-^reference**t    and pledrrincr support to the Government in carry-in^ this out.   He did not contemplate any Vote of Confi-denc e.The Lord Privy Seal agreed in this proposal.The Prime Minister pointed out that Sir W. Joynson-Hicks had put down a Motion to ho discussed two days afterthe Genoa resolution, when the question of confidence couldbe dismissed,  if necessary.
THK GENOA 3. THE PRIME MINISTER said ho did not know if a generalCOtfFERiiilCE.statement was required in regard to the Genoa Conference,which was already clearly overdue.     He drew attentionto a document recently circulated hy the President ofthe Board of Trade (C.P.08VO) which contained most dis-quieting information about the future prospects of thetrade of this country.     This Memorandum confirmed theopinion he himself had formed as the result of his ownenquiries.     It was clear that we were in for a periodof bad trade for t o years or longer.     This was due partly to the impoverishment of the world.     As yet ithad&apos;proved impossible to start European trade.       Therehad been one Conference at Brussels, whioh had produced a very complete report.  However, nothing had oome of it.The reason for this was that the Governments had been represented only by experts.      xt was now essentialthat the political representatives of Governments should meet and endeavour to arrange something to re-establish the trade of Europe.     Owing to the sttitude of theFrench Government, one of the questions affecting theexchange, namely, reparations, was ruled out of the GenoaConference.     Lio doubt this would have to be taken up oneof these days.     Whether it could be settled withoutthe co-operation of the United States of Amerioa, howeverwas doubtful.      In any event, Prauee had made it quite clear that she would not discuss the question in thepresence of nations that had been neutral in the War.-Chare remained, however, the important questions ofexchange, transit, reconstruction, and dereliot Europe,more particularly Austria and Russia.      These were very important questions.     Perhaps the most difficult wasthat of the exchanges.     On this it would be necessary totake the advice of experts.     Whether ,the question wouldbe dealt with by a stabilisation of the exchange or bysome less variable medium, being taken as a basis, he was
unable to say.      On these technical questions he did not anticipate any difficulties beyond those which wereinherent in them.      They were not beset with political difficulties.     The most difficult question that ^enoahad to deal with was that of Eussia.     As regards Russia,the Allied experts had been meeting for some days.     Hethen drew attention to the fundamental conditions laiddown in the resolution reached by the Supreme council at Cannes on January 6th, 1922, which he proceeded to read as follows .-&quot;1.     nations can claim no right to dictate to each other regarding the principles on whichthey are to regulate their system of cvner-ship, internal economy and government.      Itis for avery nation to choose for itself thesystam which it prefers in this respect.2.      Before, however, foreign capital can be made available to assist a country, foreigninvestors must be assured that their property and their rights will be respected and the fruits of their enterprise secured to them.3.     The sense of security cannot be re-es^ab-lished unless the Governments of countriesdesiring foreign credit freely undertake ;(a) That they will recognise all publicdebts and obligations which have beenor may be undertaken or guaranteed by the State, by municipalities, orby other public bodies, as well asthe obligation to restore or compen-sate all foreign interests for loss or damage caused to them when theproperty has been confiscated orwithheld.(b) That they will establish a legal andjuridical   system which sanctions and enforces commercial and otheroontracts with impartiality.4.     An adequate means of exchange must beavailable, and, generally, there must befinancial and currency conditions whichoffer sufficient security for trade.5.     All nations should undertake to refrain from propaganda subversive of order and the established political system in othercountries than their own.6. All countries should join in an under-taking to refrain from aggression against their neighbours.&quot;
Those decisions which had been reached at Cannes had beenaccepted by the convening Boveraments and implicitly bythe German and Russian Governments when they accepted the invitation to Genoa.     Ha agreed, however, that this wasnot sufficient.     It would be necessary to have a clear and fiefini-ce acceptance of these principles.     The questicnow arose as to the line to be ta^en by the ^ritish Dele-gation at Genoa.      The Allied experts had reached con-ditional ad referendum conclusions in r-jgard to Russia,including such matters as the conditions for trade, access to the Courts, the protection and legal status of tradersTHiS CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that as regardsthe private debts, the Allied experts had recommended,as a condition of recognition, that Russia should agreeto pay debts and compensation.     They had also proposed the establishment of tribunals.      The arrangements pro-posed for the payment of Allied debts were rather elabor-ate.     Tne soviet Government had seised a great deal ofprivate property and would be asked to make arrangementsfor compensation.     Many bonds of the Russian ImperialGovernment were held in Paris and the experts proposedthat the Soviets should be asked to issue new bonds inplaoe of them.THfcl PRIME MINISTER said he did not even know ifthe Soviets were prepared to discuss such questions.If they could not be induced to accept the necessary con-ditions, the question of recognition could not even beconsidered.      If, however, the Soviet accepted the cannes conditions, the question would arise as to whetherthe British Delegation was precluded from recognisingthem under nny oircumstances.    -Another question was asto whether there should be a probationary period in order
to establish whethew the Russian acceptance was merelya paper acceptance.     His view was that the Cannes resolu-tioa would give the AliieB power to consider the questionof recognition and to    taie   their decision according tothe view they formed from the conduct of the Russiandelegates as to whether they had practically abandonedCoiumuiaistio principles in dealing with foreign Powers,or not.       fixers were two parties in Russia, one entirelyCommunistic, and the otner prepared to abandon Communismin dealing with foreign countries.     Ke did not know whichwas on top at present.      If, however, the latter was in the ascendant, he thought it would be a mistake tosend theu away with a refusal to do business.,    In fact,it would be useless to go to Genoa with instructions thatin no case would recognition be granted.     He could not undertake to go with these terms after agreeing to the cannes resolution as a basi3 for the Genoa Conference.Assuming, therefore, that the Bolshevist   Delegatesaccepted the conditions;    assuming that the Allies were convinced that they really intended acceptance,and thiswas largely a question ox their demeanour and the deolara-tioss tuey made in the hearing of the world;    the question would then arise as to whether recognition should beimmediate, or for a probationary period.     He understoodthere was a strong feeling among his colleagues and in theHouse of Commons against recognition.     Personally he was prepared to respect the view taken by several of his col-leagues and he was very anxious that they should marohtogether on this question.      In faot, he was prepared tomeet that view provided he was not asked to go back onsomething he had already agreed to and which had been allowed to stand as the basis of the Genoa Confirenoe.-    -
It was clear that it was impossible to trade in Russiaunless the traders had some status in the Courts and thesame was true of Russians in Allied countries.     It was even more importunt and indeed absolutely essential to trade,to hare peace ia Europe.      At present there was no peace.It was only accessary to read the Russian wireless newsor the telegrams from Poland, Roumania, or Finland to seethat their armies were mass lag.     The Poles were convincedthat the russians were arming; the Russians were convincedthat the Poles vere instigutiag a revolution in theircountry;    Roumania was anxious about the position ofBessarabia, and Finland about Karelia.     So long as this wasthe case there could be no trade in Russia, Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia, or Finland.     A firm peace was indispensable.Russia must recognise the boundaries of Bessarabia as partof ficumenia.      All parties must agree to respect the boua-daries.     Otherwise there would be no trade.      If some suchPact as this were signed, his idea was   and later he wouldgive a precedent for it   tktt Allied agents. Consuls addso forth should enter Russia and that Allied subjectsshould have a status in the Courts.     Similarly, russia should have agents and representatives in Allied countries. -As a matter of fact, they had trade agents already inGreat Britain.     Full djjfeceratic representation, however,must be postpoaed until the Pact was in the main and sub-stantially given effeot to so far as Governments are in aposition to control these matters.     For this suggestion
there was the German precedent. After the signature of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany had for some months been represented in London only by a Chargé d&apos;Affaires. Similarly, Great Britain had been represented in Berlin by a Chargé d&apos;Affaires. The delay in appointing ? Ambassadors had perhaps been unduly long but this was due to the French. It had been postponed until Germany had shown that she was ready to carry out the Treaty. His proposal was to take the Cannes resolutions as the basis, with the commentaries of the Allied Expert Conference, which were not yet available to the Cabinet, to add to this a European Pact of Peace, which would have the effect of guaranteeing peace in Eastern Europe. The full diplomatic recognition of Russia to be postponed until the Allies were satisfied of the bone fides of the Russian Government. Until that time Russia would be represented only by a unofficial Chargé d&apos;Affaires, who would have access to the Foreign Office, but not to the Court. When the Powers were satisfied that Russia was carrying out her engagements, full diplomatic recognition would be given. In reply to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Prime Minister said he thought it would be better not to fix a period for this.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thatM. poincare had suggested a period of six months.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR WAR pointed out that somemonths would be required for the Russians to fulfil the terras of the Cannes resolution to set up Arbitral Courts,etc.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH raised the question as towhether the Germans had not already recognised the SovietRepublio.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that since the murder of aGerman Ambassador, they had never recognised them.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH asked how, therefore, theGermans ware able to do trade?THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed out thatGreat Britain had already done  5,000,000 worth of tradewith Russia.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thathe had raised this question at the Cabinet on 16th December,1921, when the Cabinet had agreed  fa)    &quot;That in the conversations with M. Briand andM. Loucheur the Prime Minister should beperfeotly free to examine all aspects of proposals for dealing with the problem ofGerman Reparations and inter-alia a schemefor the formation of a syndicate of theWestern Powers (and possibly the UnitedStates) for the economic reconstruction ofRussia, subject to possible conditions, e.g.recognition of Russian debts, the controlof Russian railways and Customs and diplomaticrecognition of the Soviet Government;(Tb)    &quot;That before the diplomatic recognition ofthe Soviet Government was agreed to, theCabinet should be consulted, and that inthe meantime Ministers were in no way committed&quot;The Secretary of State for ,the Colonies wished his view recorded, that while he regarded a tripartitetrade agreement as premature at present, he had noobjeotion to it in principle.     He dissented, however,from any decision being taken at this stage, and,in the absence of several colleagues, to aooorddiplomatic recognition to the Soviet Government.&quot;Then/
Then had followed the Cannes meeting, where theresolutions already referred to had teen taken.     The cabinet had not been consulted in regard to these.     It was true that be himself had made no protest at the time.     He had nevercontemplated that the question of his personal position onthe subject of the diplomatic recognition of the SovietGovernment could arise In its present form.     In the ordinary course of events, the Prime Minister would have gone to Genoato discuss the question there on the basis of the Cannesresolution.     Before a decision had been taken the cabinet would have been consulted.     That would have been the moment at which anyone who disagreed with tne policy would havemade his protest.     How, however, it was contemplated topass a resolution through Parliament whioh would commit tothe discretion of the British Delegates at Genoa the ques-tion of the recognition of the Soviet Government.       TheCabinet,  therefore, were getting no opportunity to givefinal consideration to their decision.     He could quiteimagine that the House of Commons would give the PrimeMinister and his collsagues full liberty.     He, however,would expect reference to be made to the Cabinet from Genoabefore final decision was taken.     It was not a question ofwant of confidence.     He himself had the greatest confidence in the Prime Minister, but he knew exactly what the PrimeMinister wished to bring about.     He felt that the decisionto pass this resolution in the House of Commons bound theCabinet in advance without their having formed their ownestimate as to whether the Soviet representatives would carryout their bargain.     The matter^lns now transferred to theHouse of Commons.     Referring to the Cannes resolutions,he expressed the gravest doubt as to whether the Soviet oouldever/
ever carry out those conditions.     He recalled that at aConference of Ministers held on 10th February, li)22, thePrime Minister had stated to Mr. Chamberlain and lord curzon that  &quot;It was his intention to make it clear toM. Krassin that it was not much use theSoviet Government sending representatives to Genoa unless they wore prepared to acceptthe conditions of January 6th.&quot;At a subsequent interview on the same day whioh the PrimeMinister had had with M. Krassin, the latter was reported,according to Sir Maurice Hankey&apos;s notes, to haTe said  &quot;The Russian Government regarded the CannesClauses as a basis of possible agreement,  butif the signature of the Russian Government tothe clauses as drafted was demanded as a oon-dition of their attendance at Genoa, the RussianGovernment would be placed in aVery difficult position.     They regarded  the spirit of theoonditions as one-sided   ....     If the french proposals were adopted that the Russian Governmentshould accept the resolution of January 6th as it stood, his Government yd uld be placed in anextraordinarily difficult position.&quot;The Prime Minister had said  &quot;He had always thought that Russia must acceptthe conditions which were laid down in the cannes Resolutions.     After all they were onlythe conditions on which every civilised Govern-ment conducted its affairs    ....   He hoped,therefore, that Russia would say definitely thatshe accepted the Cannes conditions of January 6thand was willing to discuss their application.   Hebegged that whoever was responsible for the reply would not give a qualified answer, but would saythat he accepted the oonditions    ....     he hoped that the Soviet Government would give a simple answer to the effect that they were willingto accept the principle of the Resoltition ofJanuary 6th and to oome to Genoa to discuss its application    ....     Their (the Russian) reply should be to acoept the principles of the CannesResolution and to state that they were prepared t odiscuss their application.&quot;M. Krassin had said  &quot;There were Juridical objections to adopting thiscourse.     If they accepted the oonditions ofJanuary 6th they would be in the nature of a contract.&quot;&quot;In reply to a further appeal from the PrimeMinister for a simple acceptance of the CannesResolution on the lines he had proposed, M.Krassin had said -1&quot; ^Russia/- 11 -
&quot;Rusaia had her own public opinion, which might change,  but changed Tory slowly&quot;&quot;The Prime Minister had urged strongly that theRussians should adopt the Cannes principles and state that they were ready to discuss their application.&apos;^THE SECRETARY OP STA0.E FOR THE COLONIES then roadevidence to show that M. Krassin before his meeting withMr. Lloyd George had informed his Government that the recognition of the Cannes Resolution, at any rate In theform In whioh it was published, could not for one momentbe contemplated, and that a** that meeting he had warnedthem that in Mr. Lloyd george opinion the Soviet Govern-ment would have to declare its agreement with the principlesformulated at Cannes, and its readiness to disouss its practical application.Continuing, he pointed out that on the 13th February,1922, the Prime Minister had stated in the House of commons that  &quot;Russia has accepted the invitation of theItalian Prime Minister.     In the invitationsent to Russia, speoial attention is called to the paragraphs mentioned in the question.An acceptance has been received without anyprotest or qualification in respeot of thoseparagraphs.&quot;On the 25th February,  1^22. the Prime Minister had met M. Poinoard at Boulogne.     According to Sir maurice hankey*s notes, M. Poincarrf had said -&quot;He himself had. taken care some days ago tohave Mr. Lloyd George informed that,for amonth past, The Government of the Republichad been sounded from various very seriousquarters, by representatives of the Sovietwho wished to engage in conversations inregard to Genoa, and he was sorry to saythat the proposals of the Soviet had beenvery clearly against Great Britain.   * If hehad adopted a selfish and nationalisticimpulse to trade, he might have listened towhat they had to say.     As a matter of faot.however, he had refused absolutely to listen to them.&quot;&quot;Later/
Plater, M. Poincare had raised the question of       .the recognition of Soviet Russia. **The Prliaa      /  minister; &quot;refer red to the following suggestionc*oTrt^Tned lr* a paper which had been sent to himby Dr. penes -&apos;ln the next place the political conditions for the de jure recognitionof Russia would be laid down.   Thequestion of actual de jure recognition to remain open and to depend on theresults achieved by the Conference.1This had not been his original idea, but on thewhole he rather liked it.&quot;   He did not want theAllies to make up their minds In regard to the recognition of Russia until they had seen how theRussian Delegates behaved at Genoa.   They might find the Russians were impossible to deal with.If It was found that they insisted on Impossibleconditions, and that they were people with whom it was impossible to do business, then they wouldnot be recognised.   1.1. Krassin was the only one that he himself had met personally.   This led himrather to like Dr. Benes^ Idea to reserve the grantof de Jure recognition until it had been seen how the&quot;Fcussfans behaved themselves at Genoa, andwhether we were satisfied with their bona fides,prance, Italy, Belgium and Great Britain couldconsider on the basis of the Russian attitude at genoa whether they could be recognised.&quot;M. Poincare had said -&quot;He wished to define what Dr. Bones had said more closely.     He thought In addition It would benecessary to take further precautions.     AtCannes the French Government had reserved to itself the right not in any event to recognise the Soviets da jure.     They had 3aid they^might,if the Soviet accepted the conditions, but fullliberty of action had been reserved to them bythe Cannes Agreement.&quot;Thns,?/.r. Churchill continued, the French claim that even if the Cannes conditions were accepted they were not boundto recognise the Soviet Government, and we were no more boundthan France by the Cannes Agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER said he agreed with this.   7/e had theright to judge whether the Russians werj accepting the conditionsbona fide.THE SECRETARY 07 STATE FOR THE COLONIES continued, thatthe &quot;pravds.&quot; (the official journal of the Communist Party) hadrepeatedly made clear that Soviet Russia refused to adhere tothe Cannes conditions.     He then read, the-fo-H 1 awing extract froma very remarkable speech made by M. Lenin at the Congress of metal Workers on the 6th March, 1922, in which he was reported
by the Bolshevik V?ire less Press to have spoken as follows&quot;T hope personally to speak to Lloyd George at genoa, and to tell him that it Is not worth whiletrying to frighten us with trifles.     I hope Ishall**not be prevented from doing so by rayIllness, which for several months past h*.s keptme from taking a direct part in political affairs,and prevents me entirely from carrying out theSoviet duties to which I have been appointed.....&quot;Later on he declared that -&quot;The most correct definition of the situation from the point of view of practical tasks hasbeen made by Comrade Trotski, -*      *Ewery Red Army soldier should be made tounderstand that the postponement of the genoa Conference means the danger of war.&quot;e shall finally make every Red Armysoldier know this.    In the question ofGenoa one must differentiate 3triotlybetween tha essentials of the matter andthose press  &apos;canards&apos; which are launchedby the Bourgeoisie.   All attempts to forceconditions on us a3 though we were a con-quered nation are an absurdity to which Itis not worth while replying.....       7Ce can say with complete confidence that the retreatwhich we began, can already be stopped by us and is already being stopped.     Enough.   Wequite clearly see and do not conceal that thisis ar retreat.     We advance to positions that wecould (not?) hold.1    &quot;The speech ended with the following:-&quot;Again,&quot;Pnough, no more concessions.   If the capitalists think they can delay further,they must be told:     Enough, to-morrow youwill receive nothing.     If the history ofthe eictories of the Soviet Government hastaught tham nothing, then they can do as theyplease.     T hope the Congress will alsoconfirm the fact that we&quot;are not going toretreat any further *   The retreat&quot;&quot;has ended.1    &quot;
Mr. Churchill stated that if M. Poincare&apos;s viewof the Cannes Resolutions was taken and compared with theviews expressed by M. Krassin, it would not be correct tosay that the Cannes Resolutions had been accepted by theRussian Soviets.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that if the view wastaken of M. Lenin&apos;s speech, that it was intended that theSoviet would not recognise the Cannes conditions, then thequestion of the recognition of the Soviet Government wouldnot arise.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthis was why he felt the position was so unsatisfactory.The British Government appeared to be moving from point topoint without ever obtaining a definite answer.THE PRIME MINISTER said, that if this was the ca3eit was only because of the frightful prospect of international trade.    In any event these prospects were sufficiently badfor any Government, but they were hopeless unless peace couldbe established In Europe.    His position was somewhat similarto that of Mr. Pitt who, In the year 1797, had adopted almostprecisely the same attitude towards the French Revolutionas he vras adopting towards the Russian Soviet:    that is tosay, he hated their doctrines but thought only of establishingpeace in Europe.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES stated thathe had set forth the argument summarised above in order toshow that the British Government were still uncommitted asregards the recognition of the Russian Soviet.   Now, however,they were going to ask Parliament to pass a resolution whichwould have a binding effect on themselves.   Mr. Bonar Law had told/
told him that although he was not taking a strong lineagainst the Genoa Conference, he felt that Parliament oughtto be consulted in regard to it.   He had also felt the sameas regards the granting of credits, namely, that parliament should first be consulted.   The British Government were nowgoing to pass a resolution through Parliament which wouldhand over the decision to the British Delegates at Genoa -one of whom at any rate was passionately in favour of acertain course.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that at Cannes the wholeof the proposals had been telegraphed every day to London.THE MINISTER OP HEALTH said, he could not understand why the British Delegates should reach their final decision without consulting the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointed outthat in the House of Commons the Government would be askedwhether the resolution bound them to recognise the SovietGovernment.THE LORD CHANCELLOR pointed out that certainly it did not.    In any event it was only contemplated to grantsuch recognition as was necessary to give effect to theresults of the Genoa Conference.   If recognition was granted,it was only proposed to allow a Charge d^ffaires to beestablished In London.    He thought the House of Commons wouldbe satisfied with this.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH pointed out that most peoplethought that M. Krassin was already recognised.    The fact thathe dealt with the Prime Minister instead of the Foreign Officarather had the effect of enhancing his prestige.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that this rais not the casein the House of Commons who knew the true position.   The moment the/
the Government^ resolution was tabled an amendment would beput down raising the question of recognition.   Perhaps theycould be anticipated In the Debate by a statement on thelines of the explanation given by the Lord Chancellor.   Atpresent there was a tendency in certain quarters to weaken the hands of the executive.     The prime Minister had said toM. Poincare at Boulogne, that anything he signed at Genoacould only be subject to confirmation by the House of Commons.That made the position quite clear as regards the House ofCommons.   The Cabinet and House of Commons however were notin quite the same position.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the Cabinet wouldbe informed every day from Genoa.    That would be the positionof the Secretariat.   The Cabinet had been kept very fully informed of what had happened at Cannes.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said he hadnot realised this.   At any rate, the Cannes Resolutions had notbeen discussed at a Cabinet Meeting.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that the Cabinet hadbeen scattered.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that Lord Curzon, whoseview did not differ widely from the Secretary of State for theColonies1, would be at Genoa.    He was glad to say that theLord Chancellor would also be in the neighbourhood and he proposed to take the opportunity to consult him.    It was difficult to take a decision of this kind in advance.    Itdepended upon the circumstances of the moment.   For example,the Soviet Delegates might accept the Cannes Resolutions, but their demeanour might be so unsatisfactory as to cancel thisout.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL pointed out that there was noquestion/
question of giving unfettered discretion to the british delegates at Genoa.   On the contrary, their discretion viaslimited and guarded.   The Prime Minister had said he wouldnot discuss or consider the recognition of the Soviet Govern-ment except on their acceptance of the substance of the cannes conditions.    In addition there had been no questionof full diplomatic recognition, but merely such limitedrecognition as was required to render business possible.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s summary made it easier for him to accept.The argument he had wished to state was, that to give fullsovereign recognition was to take sides against Russia as awhole in favour of a band of dastardly criminals.   That weshould give independent recognition was out of the question.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said, the main object was toavoid disagreement while the British representatives were at Genoa.    It was Important to define the limits of their authority.THE PRIME MINISTER said that In any event they wouldnot grant full diplomatic recognition.   They would wait untilthe Soviet Government had proved their bona fides.   He pro-posed that the Cabinet ?,&apos;meeting,  vhich had been fixed for11.30 the following day, should be postponed until noon, andthat the Lord Privy Seal, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Eyre Crowe and himself should meet at 12 noon to draft a formula relating to the limitedrecognition contemplated.This was agreed to.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL asked whether the proposedNon-Aggression/ll
Non-Aggression Treaty would be free from any guarantee ofthe territories of countries in Eastern Europe?THE PRIME MINISTER said, there would be no guarantee of any klndoTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL then asked If it was clearthere would be no guarantee of any Government loan for any foreign exchequer.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ViAR said, that no such proposal had ever been considered.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said, he presumed that the Cabinet could reserve discretion of judgement in regard to the conditions if they were not carried out ina manner which they felt they could agree to.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Prime Ministerrealised that the Cabinet were verv stiff about the conditionswhich had been laid down.    He then read the followingresolution for submission to Parliament, which he had drafted:-&quot;That this House approves the resolution passed by the Supreme Council at Cannes as thebasis of the Genoa Conference and will supportHis Majesty&apos;s Government in giving effect tothem.&quot;It was agreed to submit this to the Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.28th March, 1922o
