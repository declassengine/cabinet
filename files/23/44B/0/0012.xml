(Secretary:-andIntorp ret-cr)&quot;  -GERMANYDf. Simons,Minister fory$5reign AffairsThe meeting began by tho Allied Rnprc3entativeogiving answers to tne various points of the Germanproposition (see Annexure I).Clause 1.     The Prime Minister said that the allies had agreed to thi3.DR. SIMONS said that Germany had not promised to deliver coal, but only to make- it available to the Alliesbecause there was some question as to whether their transportsituation made it possible for them actually to deliverthe coal in Allied countries.Clause 2,    The Prime Minister said that this was thepropooition which had caused tne Allies most concern.     it involved an alteration of the Treaty which prescribed theprice which Prance had to pay for her coal.      The Germanproposition,  therefore,  could only be carried1 out if the.French Government went to the Chamber of Deputies and asked ]for a modification in the law.    AThio it was impossibleto do.      The Allie&apos;a had come to the? conclusion tnat whatGermany v/as really eoncemod about ^?as to secure) food for
her mining population und that she asked for the differencebetween the inland and the export price in order to enablener to get credits for this purpose.     They had accordinglycountermade a^proposal which would give Germany these credits in aa on ewl tat different way,THE PRIME MINISTER, went on to say that the Alliedcounter-proposal was in a final form.      It was not pya^ibleto make any further change in it.     The negotiations had now reached a point when the Allied proposition must eitherbo accepted or rejected.Clause 3, i)raf t protocol.     ;.. Millerand stated thatthe Allies were willing to suppees3 the first paragraphwhich accorded priority to Allied deliveries and onlypropose to retain theNsecond,  third and fourth paragraphs.Clause jt,^ Upper Sileoian Coal.      The Prime   minister stated that on this point the Allies proposed the transferof the coal distribution to a joint body on which theGerman Government should be represented.     This body wouldreconsider the distribution of Upper Gilesian coal.     TheAllies did not know enough about the details of the question to take any final decision as to distribution at Spa.Clause 5, Sised Commission in Sssen.     The Alliesgreed to this provided it was not concerned with housingwhich was a purely internal German matter,Ciaufje 5.     jfrs regards credits for the supply of theneeds of t/ie general population of Germany the Allies feltthat this was a matter which had to be discussed in connectionwith the reparation proposals.      It had nothing to do withthe coal question which was a separate issue.Finally the Prime Minister said that the Alliesproposed to introduce a clause stating that if the agreement was not executed, say, by November, the Allies were at..... liberty
liberty to take any stops they thought necessary toenforce it.M. MILL&apos;.-: RAND explained that this meant that it gavethen? 3N months in which to work up to the 2,000,000 tons per month.     All that Germany had to do was to havecollected 6,000,000 tons by November 1st.jail, SIMONS then said tnat they put forward the secondproposal, that relating to the payment to Germany in cashof the difference b;;twet3i the inland and the export price,not merely because they wanted to import food from abroadbut because if there was to be increased production, thestandard of life of the German miner mu3t be rais*d, andthat meant improving both his clothing and his housing.If Germany was to get production up to the full capacity ofthe mines she needed 60,000 to 100,000 more miners in theHuhr a number which would be further increased when thehours were reduced.      This meant a large increase in thenumber of houses,      House Luilding was very difficult inGermany because of the want of material but with assistancethey thought that they could get a large number of houses built by next summar.      If they were really to carry out this part of their programme it was necessary for themto receive the whole difference between the inland and theexport price to spend on the minors alone.     But therest of the population would be very dissatisfied ifthe whole amount was spent entirely on the miners.THE PRIME MINISTER said tnat the proposals which theAllies had put forward did not stipulate the purposes forwhich the credits were to be spent, but only suggested thatthey should be used to improve the conditions of the miningpopulation.DR. SIMONS said that the finance proposed would see...... to
to require a modification of the Treaty and if oo it wouldbe necessary for the German Government to obtain legislationfrom the Reichstag.M. U1LLSRAND expressed the hope and the belief tiiatthis wou&amp;d not be neoos3ury,  and the Prime Minister saidthat he thought the Treaty provisions were in reality muchmoro olastic than people generally believed, and that he felt 3ure tnat it was difficult,  if not impossible, toproceed by the process of amending the Treaty.il. MILLERAND said that so far as the present proposals were concerned,  they obviated the necessity for an altera-tion of the Treaty because they would be passed through theReparation Commission. .   , -DR. SIMONS then referred to the Allied proposals inregard to the protocol.     He thought them impracticable andthe German Delegation also thought that it v/as unnecessary to create the machinery proposed so long as Germany wasdelivering coal up to her undertakings.      They had suggested the suppression of the protocol because it had greatlyWviunded German susceptibilities.      He was quite willing togive the Allies full information as to the method of distribution and the system of transport to be adopted duringthe six next six months.      The German Government had formed the determination to act loyally and openly by the Allies.The new Govomoment had found thatthe form of distribution and production in operation at present was not good.     Hewas not in agreement with the present German Coal Controllerwhose figures wore doubtful and methods dictatorial.     Hewould not remain long in office.      What Germany reallyneeded was a dictator of production.      The distribution wa.snot at present up to standard.     It was necessary for germany to improve both to its required level......  M. MILLERAND
hit . ILL2RAND replied that he thought the disappearance of paragraph I of tae original drain protocol, i.e. that according priority to the Allied requirements and the modifications introduced in the Clauses 3 and 4 meant that the protocol now   represented little more than anarrangement for the exchange of communications on the subjectof coal distribution between Germany and the Allies sothat the Allies might know what Germany intended to do,as regards the source of the coal supplies and its quality and grades.     The changes on the lines now made,  reducedit to a purely statistical commission which would creategrave difiiculties.H, SIMONS said that even so it would add to red tape.As regards Silesia Dr.  Simons said that it was truethat Silesia gave as much to Germany as she did before thewar, but the par s of   Qermany which had been supplied bySilesia had been in the habit of drawing even greater;supplies from. England.       -&quot;&quot;or instance Berlin and Stettin.A&apos;hoy were now get Ling no coal from England.      It was,  therefore,necessary,  if Germany was to give xaore coal to the Alliesfrom the Ruhr district tha$ they in turn should get more from Silesia.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that theCommission might be able to improve matters.     He wished tostcite that England was also short o  coal.      The miners&apos;working hours had been cut down.     They were not working sowell.     Many had been killed,  and the English output,  there-fore, was down by 20 to 22?*.      This fact was also the answer to the suggestion Dr. Simons had sent in his letterthat England might be able to make good the shortage ofGerman coal supplies to Prance if Germ my could find the credits with which to pay her...... DR. SIMONS
DR. oli.uN3 said that tha Genuan experts would examinethe counter proposals that night,  that a Cabinet would consider thaw on the following jiorning, and that he hoped to let the Allies have a reply by noon.     lie further saidthat it was veiy hard to give a promise which it might notbe possible to fulfil completely when every failure to fulfilinvolved the renev/al of the military menace.      This made an intolerable ooaition,THIS PRIME MI&quot;I  &quot;     said that the c would be no military-menace if German,   signed before November and tlxat if shedelivered 6,000,000 tonB by that date, there was not muchlikelihood of a military menace on the subject of coal later.The proposals made by the Allies, therefore, were an inducement to the miners to work because the more coal theyproduced, the greater the advances available for foodstuffs and clothing would be.MR. SIMONS said tiiat their conversation liad beenvery tranquil, but tiiat he was not sure that the deliberationsto which he was about to return would be the some.     iiepromised a reply by the morning.
