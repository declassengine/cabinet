COPY17th May, 1917SECRETDear Lord Robert,As a matter of fact the War cabinet have as yet reached no decision in regard to Lord Grey.The question was   discussed very &quot;briefly yesterday,and I enclose a copy of the notes I made after themeeting.     These have been criticised as giving too much detail involving expression   of opinion with regardto individuals, and I shall probably alter it (thoughit is not to he reproduced) .     Prom your point of viewhowever this first draft is more useful because it isvery full and explains exactly the attitude of the WarCabinet towards the question.You will observe that the question was postponed for further consideration.      I will try and ensure thatyou are present when it is discussed.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    M.P.A. HANKEY.
