A  JjThe Army Council have considered the note fromthe Prime Minister which the Secretary of State read to them.They agree that the proposals contained in the note would &quot;bewithin the scope of the Council&apos;s constitutional powersprovided that the Military forces of the Empire rerain as atpre*ent for purposes of discipline.     The Council agree thatthe Military Representative at Versailles should he a Memberof the Array Council, but the Military Members of the Councilconsider that the Officer holding the appointment of C.I.C.S.at any time should be the Military Representative atVersailles.

Mi?-45CCPY.SECRET./jof State.Secretary of StateYou have informed me this morning that the WarCabinet have decided to appoint General Sir H.Wilson asC.I.G.S., and to appoint me, with ray present position as ArmyCouncillor, British Military Representative to the Supreme WarCouncil, vice General Wilson.that the reason for removing me from my appointment isbecause the Prime Minister cannot &apos;get en&apos; with me.     For thisI can only express my deep regret, because I have always triedto serve him loyally and to tell the truth fearlessly.     WillWilson.With respect to the second decision you will rememberthat at a meeting on the 6th instant the four MilitaryMembers present advised you that, in order to give effect tothe intention of the Supreme War Council with respect to theformation and control of the Allied General Reserves,  the ArmyCouncillor holding the appointment of C.I.G.S., who is fullyacquainted with the resources and needs of the Britishmilitary forces,  is the proper officer to be delegated asBritish Military Representative on the Executive Committee atVersailles.     After careful consideration I am convinced thatthere would be no difficulty in making such arrangements aswould permit of the British C.I.G.S. carrying out the dutywithout interference with essential duties at home.workable system, for the reasons given in the various Paperssubmitted to yourself and to the Prime Minister during theWith respect to the first decision you informed meyou please say when I am to hand over my duties to GeneralI am still unable to see any other practical andlast
last fortnight, as well as for those put forward by Army Councillors at the meetings recently held. I need not further refer to them except to say that it is impossible in practice to separate action in connexion with General Reserves from action concerning innumerable other matters which go to make up "military operations";    and that the decision of the War Cabinet leaves, as before, the issue of orders affecting military operations in the hands of two different authorities - one the C.I.G.S. and the other the British Military Representative at Versailles. The fact of my remaining an Army Councillor does not in my judgment remove this defect.

It seems to me absolutely necessary that the General Staff officer who is to give orders regarding the reserves in question must be in constant and direct touch with the various departments of the War Office - the Great Headquarters of the Imperial Military Forces - and be directly served by, and in close touch with, the Intelligence Branch of the General Staff. Only the C.I.G.S., residing normally at the War Office, can be in this position, and for an officer who is not in  that position to attempt to interfere with the employment and location of Reserve troops under the British Commander-in-Chief in France, Italy, and the Balkans, upon the right use of which final victory depends, would inevitably lead to confusion and perhaps to disaster. So strongly am I convinced of this  that I am compelled to say that I cannot undertake the very great responsibility involved. I say this with the deepest regret because I am keenly desirous of doing my utmost to assist His Majesty&apos;s Government in their very difficult task of winning the war, but on reconsideration I feel sure that you will see that it is asking too much of me to carry out and perpetuate a system
system which the A.G., M.G.O., D.C.I.G.S., and myselfconsider to be fundamentally defective.I desire to thank you for so kindly telling me thatI would not suffer financially by vacating my present post andgoing to Versailles.(Intd.) W.R.R.C.I.G.S.11th February,  1918.
VERY SECRET./ -7   \  H JJ&apos;% &apos; Jr.J c /vjt is wi th the greatest regret that I received yourletter and I still will not take &quot;No&quot; for an answer andhope that tomorrow morning may find you ready to reconsideryour refusal to accept the post now offered to you.You must allow me however to demur to that sentencein which you say that I informed you that the reason forremoving you from your appointment was because the PrimeMinister could not get on with you.     I never gave that as areason.If that had been the reason for what you call yourremoval from your appointment I certainly should not haveacted as an agent in conveying that decision to you as underthose circumstances I should certainly have felt it my dutyto resign.     The reason for making the change is an entirelydifferent one.     As you know at the last Versailles Conferencecertain resolutions were unanimously accepted by theMinisters representing the various Nations and these have nowgot to be put into effect.     They differed .from the previousresolutions in that they gave executive power to theMilitary representatives,  thus largely increasing theirduties and their responsibilities.     To show how this wasappreciated by the Prench it is only necessa.ry to bring toyour notice the fact that General Poch was at once substitutedfor General Weygand as the Prench Military Representative.It became obvious that our Government must also reconsiderour position.I have always pointed out to you (and publicly)that the Government are perfectly justified in making anychanges that they may think proper with regard to theirMilitary Advisors and the Secretary of State&apos;s duty is eitherto
to carry them out if he thinks them proper decisions or toresign if he considers that they are contrary to the safety -and welfare of the troops for whom under the Constitution heis responsible.     The Government suggested to me that just asthe French had put on their Chief of the Staff and theAmericans had put on their Senior Officer,  so should we putyou on as our representative,  in view of the fact thatdecisions might have to he taken at a moment&apos;s notice,  and itwas very desirable that if they were,  they should he taken bya man in whom the Army had &quot;such complete confidence as yourself.If I had thought this was derogatory to you I shouldnot have assented but I do not so consider it.     On the contraryI think it is placing you in a position where your knowledge canbe put to even greater use than in your present position.     Youhave never failed to impress upon me in conversation,  and onmyself and others at Army Council meetings,   that much power hadbeen taken away from the Army Council and put in the hands of theMilitary Representative at Versailles and now when I ask you totake that place you tell me that you are not prepared to acceptit.     You contend&quot;that it would be possible for the C.I.G.S. tocombine the two posts of C.I.G.S. at home and MilitaryRepresentative in Paris,      The Cabinet have considered this andthey have come to the conclusion that it would not be possible andI agree with them.     When the Committee at Versailles v/as purelyadvisory it might have been done,  though even then I do not thinkit &quot;would have been advisable.     Now that it is executive I thinkit is absolutely    impossible.      C.I.G.S. living in London cannotpossibly give a decision, delay in the giving of which might befatal in France.I admit that your deputy,  the D.C.I.G.S. and the M.G.O.are in agreement with you as to the proposal being fundamentallydefective
defective. You expressly omit the Q.M.C., and I do not think that you should include A.G. in your statement.   From what he said this afternoon and from what I have gathered from him in conversation, although he thinks that your proposal is the ideal one, I do not think you would find he went to the extent of saying the proposed arrangement is fundamentally defective.

Again may I beg you to reconsider your decision. You are being offered no inferior post. On the contrary you are being asked to take one which I think entails even more responsibility than your present one and where your influence and the weight that you can bring to bear on this Committee will be invaluable in upholding the views and contentions with regard to the Reserve which Sir Douglas Haig may put forward.

You and I have been on such friendly terms that I should feel miserable if I thought I was doing anything that would mean that your services would be lost to the Nation. I look upon it as indispensable that they should be retained and I ask therefore that whatever your personal feelings may be, you will as a soldier accept the position and by so doing I feel convinced you will be doing a great national service.
