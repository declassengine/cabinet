PALESTINE. THE CHIEF MILITARY COMMAND.

The War Cabinet had a discussion on the Chief Military Command of the Palestine Expedition. Some doubts were expressed as to the suitability of General Sir Archibald Murray for the Chief Command of the forthcoming operations.

The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, to some extent, he felt that he was suspected by the War Cabinet of backing up the soldiers on all occasions. This, however, was not the case. If he thought any particular General was not equal to his responsibilities he would not hesitate for one moment to inform the Secretary of State for War and the War Cabinet. He wished to preface his remarks by stating that it was no use for General Murray to retain the Command of the Egyptian Expedentionary Force unless he had the confidence of the Cabinet. He then recalled General Murray&apos;s record during the present war. At the outset he had gone to France as Chief of the General Staff to Field Marshal Lord French. The Commander-in-Chief and the Chief of the Staff had lived together, which he thought was a bad plan, as they were apt to get on each others nerves. There was no doubt that General Murray had broken down to a certain extent in the retreat from Mons, but others had done the same. Moreover, he had not been particularly well served by his staff. After this he had come to the War Office as Chief of the Imperial General Staff, where he had done very good work, though he had not got on particularly well with Lord Kitchener. There had perhaps been a tendency for him to insert sentences at the end of his Memoranda and Appreciations which rather detracted from earlier conclusions. General Robertson himself, however, had found that the C.I.G.S. could not, and might not, avoid looking at questions from the Government&apos;s point of view as well as from his own purely military standpoint

 where they will be reinforced, and that they may be expected to put up a strenuous defence for Palestine. Having regard to General Murray&apos;s war record, and particularly to his nervous and sensitive constitution, some apprehensions were felt as to whether he was the right man to cope with a series of possibly difficult situations. The opinion was expressed that the qualities required by the Commander-in-Chief in the forthcoming operations were those of a hard fighting and dashing General, who could be relied on not to hesitate even to run risk in order to bring off a great success. It was also felt that the War Cabinet would incur considerable responsibility if the operations of the Egyptian Expenditionary Force just failed to achieve a great success because the Commander-in-Chief had shown the wrong qualities.

On the other hand, the War Cabinet were much impressed by the opinion of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff that delay in the forthcoming action would inevitably be involved by a change in the Command, owing to the fact that a new Commander-in-Chief would not only have to reach the scene of action, but would require some time to enable him to obtain sufficient knowledge of the quality of his troops, the administrative, tactical and strategical situation, and of the lines of communication, before he could commit his army to an action. It was realised that such a delay would enable the enemy to entrench himself more strongly and to bring up reinforcements, and might jeopardise the success of a most important and critical operation.

On a review of these considerations, the War Cabinet decided that:-

General Sir Archibald Murray should retain the Command, at any rate, until the forthcoming operation had taken place. In the meantime, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff was instructed to consider who would be the most suitable successor in order that the question might be re-examined by the War Cabinet, if necessary, after the battle.
