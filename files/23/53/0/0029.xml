The First Lord of tha Admiralty read to theCabinet  a telegram he had received the same day from the Naval Commander-in-Chief in China,  to thefollowing effect:    Prisoners state that the pirategang was composed of 23 men:    the reports receivedup to now are rather conflicting, but it seems probable that practically all the pirates have beenaccounted for and that the only individual missingis a passenger who is&quot; a half-caste British subjectwho was possibly killed or drowned:    Naval units have been recalled to Hong-Kong.
jg IMPERIAL 2.    The Cabinet had before then a draft ReportgpERBNOE.^ of the Commit tee of the Imperial Conference onrter-ImperialRations. Inter-Imperial Relations (Paper CP.-390 (.26)),which was to come before the Committee of thewviousinference: Conference on the following day [ Appendix) .&apos;sbinet 5626), Con-conclusion -7 .)^   Con- The Lord President of the Council, asin-7.)Chairman of the Committee, explained that all the troubles in this inquiry had been due to thedifficulties of the various Prime Ministers intheir own Dominions, where there appeared to be a widespread, though erroneous    belief that they werein some way subject to the British Government,notwithstanding that the latter could not levy a penny in, raise a recruit in, or conclude a treaty on behalf of, any Dominion.    The task of the Com-mittee had been to try and make the practice of theConstitution conform to the reality of the position.This had led to the drafting, after many meetings,of a formula (underlined on the second page of thedraft Report) .    This formula, however, was a seriesof negations and did not by itself state  the truecharacter of our Imperial system.    ConsequentlyLord Balfour had endeavoured to set it in a frameworkwhich would place the matter In better perspective;and this, he was glad to say, had been accepted bythe Committee,The Cabinet then proceeded to dls cuss thedetails of the Report.Page 9.    The Title of His Majesty the King.On the suggestion of the Lord Chancellor, theCabinet agreed - That the representatives of the BritishGovernment on the Committee should endeavour to secure that the Titleshould read:-
&quot;George V, by the Grace of God, ofGreat Britain, Ireland and the british dominions beyond the Seas, King,Defender of the Faith, Emperor ofIndia&quot;.Considerable discussion took place in regard tothe section of the Report dealing with Operation ofDominion Legislation, more particularly pages 12 and IS.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the factthat, under the present Constitutional arrangements -(i) The Governor-General, under various DominionsActs (e,g.,  the South Africa Act, 1909), ,canwithhold assent or reserve a Bill for the signification of the King&apos;s Pleasure, andthat a Bill so reserved shall not come intoforce for a year from the day on which itwas presented to the Governors-General forthe King*s Assent.(ii) At any rate in the case of the South AfricaAct,  19 09,  &quot;The King may disallow any lawwithin one year after it has been assentedto by the Governor-General, and such dis-allowance, on being made known by theGovernor-General by speech or message to each o^ the Houses of Parliament or by proclamation, shall annul the law from theday when the disallowance is so made known&quot;.(iii)  The Parliament in Great Britain has thetheoretical right to legislate for thewhole Empire.The Cabinet wars asked not to overlook that,under the arrangements now proposed, these rights werevirtually being surrendered.It was pointed out, however, that these rightswere historical survivals which had long fallen intoabeyance and which could not be exercised withoutdisastrous results.    In this connection attention was drawn to the principles of non-interference laid downmany years ago by Mr Joseph Cha-berlain, when colonial secretary, in the case of the Reid contract in new fo und la nd .&apos;  The general view of the Cabinet (from whichT however.some Ministers djssented) was that  (subject to the amendments to the draft Report proposed below) nosubstantive power which was or could be exercised in-3-
practice was being g1?en up,  though, some regrets were expressed for the formal surrender of historic rights which, though they had to some extent fallen intodesuetude, might &quot;^ell, as some Ministers suggested, be reserved for use in a time of crisis.After considerable discussion, the representativesof the British Government on the Committee undertook to seek to obtain the following alterations:-Page 15,  line 11:    For the word &quot;requiring&quot; put the words  &quot;providing, for&quot;.Page 13.    The elimination, if this could besecured by consent,  of the whole ofthe section beginning &quot;(i) It wouldnot be in accordanc e--with&quot; down tothe words &quot;generally that&quot; at thebeginning of (ii), but,  if this isnot obtainable (-as was recognised tobe probable),  to insist on the omission of the following sentence in (i), -&quot;(b)  that any such Bill should be reserved, or assent theretowithheld, by His. Majesty&apos;representative against theadvice of the Ministers ofsuch Dominion&quot;.Page 14,  line 3:  To obtain the substitution of&quot;the word &quot;legislation&quot; for the word&quot;affairs&quot; ,Page 20,  fourth,line from the bottom:The representatives of the British Governmenton the Committee undertook to try and secure the substi-tut ion of the words  &quot;due regard being had--to the specialconstitutional position of India&quot; for the words  &quot;withoutprejudice to the special constitutional position of IndiaPage 22.

gag e 48.    The Policy of Locarno.The Cabinet welcomed the proposed Resolu-tion in regard to Locarno, which, they were informed,had been drafted by one of the Dominions representa-tives,  and which reads as follows:-&quot;The Conference has heard with satisfaction the statement of- the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs with regard to the efforts made to ensure peace in Europe,oulminating in the agreements of locarno:    and congratulates HisMajesty&apos;s Government in GreatBritain on its share in thissuccessful contribution towardsthe promotion of the peace of theworld.&quot;tehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 17,  1926.

ITO3-.IM?:-;3IAL RBLaTIOITS COMMITTED,Draft Hepert,I&quot;   -INTRODUCJIOH,We were appointed at the meetingof the Imperial Conference on the25th of October, 1926, to investigateall the questions on tho Agenda affectingInter-Imperial Relations,      Our discussions on those  questions havo been long andintricate,      V/o found,  on examination.,that they involved consideration of fundamental principles affecting- therelations of tho var1ous parts of theBritish Empire inter se,  as well as therelations of each part to foreigncountries.      For such examination thetime at  our disposal has been all tooshort,      Y--.t \?e hope  that we may havela id a foundation on which subsequent0onferencoo may build.
11.    STATUS 0 g. GREAT. BRITAIN AND- THE; DOMINIONS.The Committee are of opinion that nothing wouldbe gained by attempting to define the Constitution of theBritish Empire.      Its widely scattered parts have very-different characteristics,  very different histories,  andare at very different stages of evolution;    while,considered as a whole, it d.efi-es classification and bearsno real resemblance to any other political organisation which now exists or has ever yet been tried.There is, however, one most important element init which, from a strictly constitutional point of view,has now,  as regards all vital matters,  reached its full development;    - we refer to  the group of self-governingcommunities  composed of Great Britain and the Dominions.Their position and mutual relation may bo readily defined,ihey are autonomous Communities within the British Empire,equal in status-  in no way subordinate one to another in anyaspect of their domestic or external affairs,   though unitedfry, a common allegiance to the Crown, and freely associatedg.3 members of the British Comimonwealth of Nations.A foreigner endeavouring to understand the truecharacter of our Imperial system by the aid of this formula
alone would.be tempted to think that it was devised rather to make mutual interference impossible than to make mutualc0.operation easy,Such a criticism, however,  completely ignores the historic situation.      The rapid  evolution of the OverseasDominions during the last fifty years has involved manycoirplicated adjustments of old political machinery tochancing conditions.      The tendency towards  equality ofstatus was both right and inevitable.     Geographical andother conditions made this impossible of attainment by the pay of federation.      The only alternative was by the way of autonomy;    and along this road it has been steadily sought.Every self-governing member of the Empire is now the master)f its destiny.      In fact, if not always in form, it is subject to no compulsion whatever.But no  account, however accurate, of the negativedelations in which Great Britain and the DominionsBtand to each other,   can do more than express a portion of1[I^e truth.      The British Empire is not founded solely orainly upon negations.      it depends essentially;  if not finally,  on positive ideals.      Free institutions are itsfe-blood.      Free - co-operation is its instrument.      Peace,
security and progress are among its objects.     Aspects ofIII these great themes have been discussed at the present(inference:    excellent results have been thereby obtained,,lad though every Dominion is now,  and must always remain, the sole judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation,no common cause will,  in our opinion,  be thereby imp erf lied, quality of status,   so  far as Britain and the Dominions areconcerned, is thus the root principle governing our inter-Imperial relations.      But the principles of equality andsimilarity, appropriate to  status,   cannot be universallyextended to function.     Here v.-e require  something more thaniiiinutable dogmas.      For example,  to  deal with questions ofdiplomacy and questions of defence,  we require also flexiblemachinery, machinery vhich can, from time to   time, be adaptedI to the changing circumstances of the world,    This subject also[has occupied our attention,      The rest of this report willIshovf how we have endeavoured not only&apos;&apos;to  state political tho orto apply it to our common needs.
III.      SPECIAL POSITION OF INDIA.It will be noted that in the previous paragraphswe have mede no mention of India.      Our reason for limiting their scope to Great Britain and the Dominionsis that the position of India in the Empire is alreadydefined, viz,,  by the Government of India Ac t, 1919.Vie would also recall that by Resolution IX 0f theImperial Bar Conference, 1917, due re&apos;coinition was givento  the important position held by India in the  BritishCommonwealth of Nations .      Where,  in this Report,we have  had occasion to consider the position of  India,we have made particular reference  to it.
iv.    relations between the various parts of the British empire.Existing administratives legislative and judicialforms are admittedly not wholly in accord with theposition as described in Section II of this Report.This is inevitable,  since most of these  forms date backto a time well antecedent to the present stage of constitutional development.      Our first task then wasto examine these forms with special reference to anycases where  the want of adaptation of practice toprinciple caused,  or might be thought to cause,Inconvenience in the  conduct of Inter-Imperial Relations.
(a&apos;)    The T1 tie of Hi s Ma J esbvthe Kln.g.The  title of His Majesty the King is of special importance and concern to all parts of His Majesty&apos;sDominions,    Twice within the last fifty years has the RoyalTitle been altered to suit changed conditions ond con-siitutlonal developments,The present title, which, is that proclaimed raider theRoyal Titles Act of 19C1, is as follows:-&quot;George V, by the Grace of God,  of the United Kingdomof Great Britain and Ireland and of the British dominions beyond the Seas Kin-, Defender of the Faith, emperor of Indi a. &quot;Some time before the Conference met,  it had been recognised that this form of title hardly accorded with the altered state of affairs arising from the establishmentof the Irish Free State as a Dominion.    It had further been ascertained that it would bo in accordance with HisMajesty&apos; 3 wihh.es that any recommendation for change shouldhe submitted to him as the result of discussion at theConference,fe are unanimously of opinion that a slight change is
dc-sir able, and we re commend that, /subject to His Majesty &apos;approval, the necessary legislative action should betai^en to secure that His Majesty1 s title should hence-,forward read:  &quot;George V, by the Grace of God, King  of GreatBritain,   Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas,Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India&quot; .(b) Position of Governors-General.We proceeded to consider whether It was desirableformally to place on record a definition of the position heldby the Governor-General as His .ua jesty &apos; s representative  inthe Dominions.    That position, though now generally wellrecognised, undoubtedly represents a development from an earlier stage when the Governor General was appointed solely on the  advice of His Majesty&apos;s Ministers  in London and actedalso as  their representative.In our opinion it  is  an essential consequence of theequality of status existing among the members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations  that the Governor-General of a dominion is  the representative of the Crown, holding in allessential respects the same position in relation to theadministration of public affairs in the Dominion as  is heldby His Majesty the King in Great Britain, and  that in norespect is he now considered to be the representative or
agent of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain or any department of that Government.It seemed to us to follow that the practice whereby the Governor-General of a Dominion is the formal officialchannel of communication between His Majesty1s Governmentin Great Britain and His Governments in the Dominions mighbe regarded as no longer wholly in accordance with theconstitutional position of the Governor-General.      It was thought that the recognised official channel of cororiiunica&apos;-tion should be.   in future, between Government and Governmedirect.      The representatives of Great Britain readilyrecognised that the existing procedure might be open to criticism;    they accepted the proposed change in principle in relation to any of the Dominions which desired it.Details were left  for settlement as  scon as possible afterthe Conference had completed its work,  but it was recognised by the Committee,  as an essential feature -if an;change or development in the channels of communication,  tha Governor-General should be supplied with copies **f alldocuments of importance and in general should be kept as fully informed as  is His Majesty the King in Great britain of Cabinet business and public affairs.
( 0 )      Operation of Dominion Leg;! si at ion.Our attention wtis also called to various-points in connection with the operation of Dominionlegitlation, which,  it was  suggested, requiredclarif publication.The particular &quot;points  involved were  ; -*(a) the present practice under which Acts of theDominion parliaments are sent each year to London, andit is intimated,  through the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,  that His Majesty will not he advised to exercise his powers of disallowance with regard tothem;(b) the reservation of Dominion legislation,  incertain circumstances,  for the  signification of HisMajesty&apos;s pleasure which is signified on advice tenderedby His Majesty1 r. Ministers in London;(c) the difference between the legislativecompetence of the Parliament at Westminster and of theDominion parliaments in that Acts passed by the latteroperate,  as a general&apos; rule,  only within the territorialare a o f the Do: li ni on c o nc a rhe d:
(d) tha operation of legislation passed by tho  -Parliament at Westminster In relation to the Dominions.In this connection special attention was called to suchStatutes as the Colonial Laws Validity Act.      It wassuggested that in future uniformity of legislation asbetween Great Britain and the Dominions could best besecured by the enactment Of reciprocal Statutes basedupon consultation and agreement.He gave these matters the best considerationpossible in the limited time at our disposal, but came to the conclusion that the issues involved were socomplex that there would be grave danger in attemptingany immediate pronouncement other than a statement ofcertain principles which,  in our opinion, underlay thewhole question of the operation of Dominion legislation.!7e felt that, for the rest, it would be necessary toobtain expert guidance as a preliminary to furtherconsideration by His Majesty&apos;s Governments in GreatBritain and the Dominions.On the questions raised with regard to disallowanceand reservation of Dominion legislation,  it was explained by the Irish Free State Delegation that    they
desired to eludicate the constitutional praoticein relation to Canada, since it is provided by 434Article 2 of the Articles of Agreement for aTreaty of 1921 that &quot;the position of the Irish Free-State in relation to the Imperial Parliar nt and government and otherwise shall be that of the dominion of Canada&quot; 0On this point we propose that it should beplaced on record that, apart from provisions embodied in constitutions or in specific statutes expresslyrequiring reservation,,(i) it would not be in accordance with establishedconstitutional praotice(a) that His Majesty*s Ministers in London should advise His Majesty the King either to disallow an Act,or to issue instructions to His Majesty1s representative to reserve a Bill, passed by the Parliament of Canadaor of any other Dominion,  or(b) that any such Bill should be reserved,  orassent thereto withheld, by His Majestyrs Representativeagainst thd advice of the Ministers of such Dominion;(ii) generally that the constitutional praoticeis that it is the right of the Government of each dominion to advise the Crown in all matters relating
to its own affairs and that advice would not ho tendered to His Majesty by His Majesty&apos;s   Ministers in London inany matter appertaining -co the affairs of a Dominionagainst the views of the Dominion Government concerned.The appropriate procedure with regard to projectedlegislation in one of the self-governing parts of theEmpire which may affect tho interests of other self-governing parts is previous consultation between HisMaj.esty&apos;8 Ministers in the several parts concerned.On the question raised with regard to thelegislative competence of Members of the BritishCommonwealth of Nations other tha&quot;n Great Britain, andin particular to the desirability of those Membersbeing enabled to legislation slate- with extra-territorialeffect, we think that it should similarly be placedon record that the constitutional practice is that,legislation by the Parliament at Westminster applying to a Dominion could only be passed with the consent ofthe Dominion concerned.As already indicated, however, we are of opinionthat there are points arising- out of these oonsider-ations, and other aspects of general principle, which
will require detailed examination and we accordingly recommend that steps should be taken by Great Britainand the Dominions, to  set up a Committee with terms ofreference on the following lines  :-&quot;To enquire into,  report upon and makerecommendatio ns cone erhing(i)    existing statutory provisions requiringreservation of Dominion legislation for tha a&quot;ssent ofHis Majesty or authorising the disallowance of such legislation.(ii)    (a)    the present Dotsitidb as to thecompetence of Dominion Parliaments to give theirlegislation extra-territorial operation;(b)    the desirability of giving effect to theprinciple that each Dominion Parliament should havepower to give extra-territorial operation to itslegislation in all cases where such operation is ancillary,to provision for the peace, order.and good government ofthe Dominion;(iii)    the principles embodied in or underlying theColonial Laws Validity Act , 1655 , and the extent towhich any provisions of that Act ought to be repealed,
amended or modified in the light of the existingrelations between tho various members of the BritishCommonwealth of nations as described in thisReport.&quot;
Somewhat similar considerations tothese set out above governed our attitudetowards a similar,  though a special,question raised in relation to MerchantShipping Legislation.        On this subjectit was pointed out that, whileuniformity&apos; of administrative practice was desirable, and indeed essential, as regard the Merchant Shipping Legislation of thevarious parts of the Empire,  it was difficult to reconcile the application,in their present form, of certain provisions of the principal Statuterelating to Merchant  shipping, viz., theMerchant  Shipping Act of 1894, with theconstitutional status of the several members of the British Commonwealth ofNations.In this case also we felt that
x It hough.,  in the evolution of the Britishflapiro,  certain inequalities had &quot;beena11owed to remain us regards various questions of maritime affairs, it was essential in dealing with theseinequalities to consider the practicalaspects of tho matter.     Hot only was it-imp ps Bible to i nt ro d uce 1 owe d*i at ealterations in the Merchant Shipping Code(which dealt, amongst other matters, withthe registration of British ships all overthe world) , but  it was necessary.,  in anyreview of the position, to take 1 ntoaccount  such matters of general concern asthe qualifications for registry as aBritish ship, the status of British shipnin war, the work done by His Majesty&apos; cConsuls in the interest of british shipping and a earner., and the question ofNaval Courts at foreign ports to deal withcrimes and offences on British ships
abroad.    It was also worth  while to take into consideration the question whether theprinciple of differentiation of function,to which wo have already alluded, had nota special application in relation to merchant shipping questions,&apos;.&apos;/e came f finally ly t o th c c onelusionthat, following a-precedent which had boonfound useful on previous occasions,  thogeneral question of Merchant ShippingLegislation had best be remitted to aspecial Sub-Confer enc e ,. which could meetmost, appropriately at tho same time as the expert Committee, to which reference is made above.    ;,Ve thought that this speciSub-Conference should be invited to adviseen the following general liriee:&quot;To consider and report on theprinciples which shall govern,  in thegeneral interest, the practice and legislation - relating to merchant
shipping in the various parts ofthe&apos; Ptapire, having regard  to the changein constitutional procedure which has*occurred since existing laws were enacted&quot;.-.7o took note that the representativesof India particularly desired that India,in view of the importance of her shippinginterests,  should be represented at theproposed Sub-Oonferen.ce.     Ye felt that thefull  representation of India on an equaltooting with Oreat Britain and  theDominions would not  only be welcomed,  but could., very properly be given, withoutprejudice to the special constitutional position of India as explained in SectionIII of this ^eoort.- &apos;dO -
(e)    Appeals to tha  Judicial Committee of the privy council.Another matter which we discussed in which thegeneral constitutional principle was raised,  concerned the conditions governing Dominion appeals to theJudicial Committee of the Privy Council.    From these discussions it became clear that it was no part oftiie policy of any part of the Empire represented atthe Conference that questions affecting  judicial appealsshould be determined otherwise than in accordance withthe wishes of the  inhabitants of the part primarilyaffected.    It was, however,  recognised,  that wherechanges in the existing system were proposed which,while primarily affecting one part,  raised issues inwhich other parts    were also concerned,  such changesought only to be carried out after discussion and byagreement./So- SSL  -
So far as the work of the Committeev/as concerned, this general understandingexpressed all that was required-    The questionof some immediate change in tho presentconditions governing appeals from, the IrishFree State, was not pressed In relation tothe present Conference,,  though it was made clear that the right was reserved to bring upthe matter again at the next ImperialConference.
V.    EI.IA?IkLT  ;/ITIi POPEIGH COEInRIii3 .From questions specially concerning the relations of the various parts of the British Empire with one another,- wo naturally turned to those affecting the irrelations with foreign countries.      In the lattersphere, a beginning had been made towards making clearthose relations by the Resolutions of tho ImperialConference of 1923 on the subject of the negotiation,signature and ratification of treaties.      But it seemed desirable to examine the working of that resolution during trie  past three years and also toconsider whether tho principles laic down withregard to Treaties  could not be applied with advantage in a wider sphere.
(a),    Procedure in relation to Treatios,We appointed a special sub-committee under tho Chair-tnanship of the Minister of Justice of Canada (The H. on our able, Lapointe,  ICC, ).,  to consider the question of treatyprocedure,thoTho Sub-Committoe,  on whose report/following paragraphare based,  found that the -Resolutions of the Conference of1923 embodied on most points useful rules for the guidanceof the Governments.      As they became more thoroughlyunderstood and. established,  they would prove effective inpractice,Some phases  of treaty procedure wore examined howeverin greater detail in tho light of experience in order toconsider to what extent the Resolutions of 1923 might with advantage &quot;be supplemented,Negotiation,It was agreed in 1923 that any of the Governments ofthe Vhnpire contemplating the negotiation of a treaty should give due  consideration to its possible effect upon otherGovernments and should take stops to inform Governments
likely to be interested of its intention,This rule should be understood as applying toany negotiations which any Government intends to conduct,so as to leave it to tho other Governments to say whetherthey are likely to be interested,When a Government has received information&quot; of theintention of any other Government to conduct negotiations,it is incumbent upon it to indicate Its attitude with reasonable promptitude,      So long as tho initiatingGovernment receives no advorse comments and so long as its policy involves no active obligations on the part ofthe other Governments, it nay proceed on the assumptionthat its policy is generally acceptable,      It must,however, before taking any steps which might involve theother Governments in any active obligations, obtain theirdefinite assent.Where by the nature of the treaty It is desirablethat if should be ratified on bohalf of all the Governments
of the Empire, the initiating Government may assume thata Government which has had full opportunity of indicatingits attitude and has made no adverse comments will concurir. the ratification of the treaty,      In the caso of aGovernment that prefers not to concur in. the ratification of a treaty unless it has heon signed by a plenipotentiaryauthorised to act on its behalf,  it will advise theappointment  of a plenipotentiary so to act.- 2 6  -
gprm of Treaty.Some treaties begin with, a list of tbecontracting countries and rot v/itb a list of Headsof States.   In the case of treaties negotiatedunder the auspices of the league of Nations, adherence to the wording of the Annex to the Covenant for thepurpose of describing the contracting party has ledto the use in the preamble of the term &quot;BritishEmpire&quot; with an enumeration of the Dominions andIndia if parties to tbe Convention but without anymention of Great Britain and Borthere Ireland and theColonies and Protectorates.    These are only includedby virtue of their being covered by the term &quot;BritishEmpire&quot;.    This practice, while suggesting that theDominions and India are not on a footing of equality with Great 3ritain as participants in the treatiesin question,  tends to obscurity and misunderstandingand Is generally unsatisfactory.As a means of overcoming this difficulty it is recommended that all treaties (other than agreements between Governments)  whether negotiated under the auspices of the league or not should be made in the
name of Heads of States, and if the treaty is signed on behalf of any or all of tho Governments of theEmpire,  the treaty should be made in thename of the King as the symbol of the special relationship between the different parts ofthe Empire.    The    British units on behalf of which thotreaty is signed should be grouped together in thefollowing oroer;  Great Britain and.. Northern Ireland andall parts of the British Umpire which are not separatemembers pf the League,  Canada, Australia, Eew Zealand^.South Africa, Irish 3?ree State, India.    A specimen formof treaty as recommended is attached as an appendix to the Committee report.In the case of a treaty applying to only one partof the Umpire it should be stated to be made by the Kingon behalf of that part.The making of the treaty in the name of the King asthe symbol of tho special relationship between thedifferent parts of the Umpire will render superfluousothe inclusion of any provision that its terms mustnot be regarded as regulating interne the rights and obligations of the various territories on behalf of
which it has been signed in the name of the Kin.3.In this connection it must be borne&apos;in mind thatthe question was discussed at the Arms TrafficConferonce in 1925, and that the legal Committee ofthat Conference laid it down that the principle towhich the foregoing sentence gives expressionunderlies all international conventions.In the case of some international agreements theGovernments of different parts of the Empire may be willing to apply between themselves some of theprovisions as an administrative measure^   In this case they should state the extent to which and theterms on which euch provisions are to apply,.,    Whereinternational agreements are to be applied between different parts of the Empire,  the form of a treaty between Heads of States should be avoided,Full &quot;Powers cThe plenipotentiaries for the various British units should have full powers, issued in each case by the Kingon tho advice of the Government concerned, indicatingand corresponding to the part of tho Empire for whichthey are to signa   It will frequently be found convenient,
particularly where there are some parts of the Empireon which it is not contemplated that active obligationswill be imposed, hut where the position of the Britishsubjects belonging to these parts will be affected,for such Governments to advise the issue of full powerson their behalf to the plenipotentiary appointed to act.on behalf of the Government or Governments mainly concerned.,    In other cases provision might be made foraccession by other parts of the Empire at a later date..Signature.In the cases where the names of countries areappended to the signatures in a treaty, the different parts of the Empire should be designated in the same manner as is proposed in regard to the list ofplenipotentiaries in the preamble to the treaty,    Thesignatures of the Plenipotentiaries of the various partsof the Eirrpire should be grouped together in the same order as is proposed above *The signature of a treaty on behalf of a part ofthe Empire should cover territories for which a mandatehas been given to that part of the Empire, unless thecontrary is stated at the time of the signature.
C01HNG  INTO FORCE OF I ;I ULTI LA TE R a L TREATIES.In general treaties contain a ratification clause and a provision that tha treaty will come  into force onthe deposit of a certain number of ratifications.    Thequestion has sometimes arisen in connection with treatiesnegotiated under the auspices of the League whether,for the purpose of making up the number of ratificationsnecessary to bring the treaty into force,  ratificationson behalf of different parts of  the Empire which areseparate Members of the League should be counted asseparate ratifications.     In order to avoid any difficultyin future,  it is recommended that when it is thought necessary that a treaty should contain a clause of this character,  it should take the form of a provision thatthe treaty should come  into force -when it has been ratified on behalf of so many separate Members of theLeague .The Committee think that some  convenient opportunity should be taken of explaining to the otherMembers of the League the  changes which it is desiredto make in the  form of treaties and the reasons for
which, they are desired.    They would also recommend thatthe various governments of the Empire should make itan  instruction to their representatives at international conferences to he held in future that they should use their best endeavours to secure that  effect is givento the recommendations contained in tho foregoing paragraphs.(b)    Representation at International Conferences.vVe also studied,   ir. the light of the resolutions of the  Imperial Conference of 1923 to which reference hasalready been made, the question of the representation ofthe different parts  of the Empire at international conferences..    The conclusions v/nich we reached may heeumraarIsed as foilows :-(1)    ho difficulty arises as regards representation at conferences convened by, or under the auspices of,the League of Nations.    In such conferences all membersof the League are invited, and if they attend are represented separately by separate delegations. &apos;   Co-op or a-tion is ensured by the application of paragraph I (c)  ofthe  Treaty (Resolutions of 1923.
(2)    as regards international conferencessummoned by foreign govemnents, no rule of universalapplication can bs laid down,  since the nature of the representation must,  in part, depend on the form ofinvitation issued by the convening government.(a) In conferences of a technicalcharacter,  it is usual and always desirablethat the different parts of the empire should  (if they wish to participate) berepresented separately by separate delegations,and where necessary efforts should be made tosecure  invitations which will render suchrepresentation possible:(b) Conferences  of a political charactercalled by a foreign government must be con-sidered on the special circumstances of each individual case .It is for each part of the Empireto decide whether its particular interests
are so involved, especially having regardto the active obligations likely to be imposed by any resulting treaty^ that it desires to berepresented at the Conference, or whether it iscontent to leave the negotiation in the handsof the part or parts of the Empire more directly concerned and to accept the result.If a Government desires to participate inthe conclusion of a treaty, the method by whichrepresentation will be secured is a matter to bearranged with the other Governments of the empire in the light of the Invitation which has beenreceived *Where more than one part of the Empiredesires to be represented, three methods of representation are possible:-(i)    By means of a common plenipotentiaryor plenipotentiaries, the issue of full powers to whom should bo on the advice ofall parts of the Empire participating,(ii) By a single British empire delegation composed of separate representative
of such parts  of tho Empire as are participating in the conference.    This was the form of representation employed at the WashingtonDisarmament Conference of 1921.(iii) By separate delegations representing eachpart of the Empire participating in theConference..    If, as a result of consultation,this third method is desired, an effort must bemade to ensure that the form of invitation fromthe convening Government will make this methodof representation possible.Certain non-technical treaties should, fromtheir nature, be concluded in a form which will render them binding upon all parts of the Empire, and for thispurpose should be ratified with the concurrence of all theGovernments.      It is for each Government to decide &quot;to what extent its concurrence in the ratification will be facilitated by its participation in the conclusion oftine treaty, as for instance by the appointment of a commonplenipotentiary.      Any question as to whether the natureof the treaty is such that its ratification should beconcurred  in &quot;by all parts of the Empire  is a matter fordiscussion and agreement between the Governments.
(c)    General Conduct of Foreign Policy.We went on to examine the possibility of applying the principles underlying the Treaty resolution of the 1923 Conference to matters arising in the conduct.offoreign affairs generally.      It was frankly recognisedthat in this sphere, as in the sphere of defence, the major share of responsibility rests now, and must forsome time continue to rest, with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin Great Britain.      The principle of differentiation offunction to which we have already alluded manifests itself,in this case,  in the clearest manner.    Nevertheless,practically all the Dominions are engaged to some extent,and some to a considerable extent,  in the conduct offoreign relations particularly those with foreign countries on their borders.    A particular instance of this is the growing work in connection with the relations between canada ana the United  States of America which has ledto the necessity for the appointment of a minister to represent the Canadian Government in
We felt that the gever.a in/; consideration underlyinall discussions of this problem must be that neither GreatBritain nor the Dominions could be committed to theacceptance of active obligations except with the definiteassent of the ir own Governments.    In the light of thisgoverning consideration, the committee agreed that thegeneral principle expressed in relation to treaty negotiations in Section V (a) of this Report, which is indeed already to a large extent in force, might usefully be adopted as a guide by the Governments concerned infuture in all negotiations affecting foreign relationsfalling, within their respec tive spheres.
(d ) - Issue of Exeauaturs to Foreign Consulsin the ^Dominions.A question was raised with regard to the practiceregarding  the issue of exequaturs to Consuls in theDominions.      The general practice hitherto, in the caseof all appointments of Consuls de Carriere in any partof the British Empire, has been that  the foreign government concerned notifies His Majesty1 s Government in Great Britain,through the diplomatic channel, of-the proposed appointment and that,  provided that it is clear that the person concerned is, in fact,   a Consul de Carriere,   steps have been taken,v/ithout further formality,  for the issue of His Majesty&apos;sexequatur.     In the  case of Consuls other than those deCarriere,  it has been customary for some time past to  consult the Dominion Government concerned before the issue of theexequatur.Tne Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs informed us that His Majesty&apos;s Government in Great Britain acceptedthe suggestion that in future any application by a foreign government for the issue of an exequatur to any person whowas to  act as Consul In a Dominion should be referred to
the Dominion Government concerned for consideration andthat, if the Dominion Government agreed to the issue ofthe exequatur, it would he sent to them for counter-signature by a Dominion Minister.    Instructions to this effect had indeed already been given.
(e )    Channel of Communication &quot;between DominionGovernments and Poreicrn jGove rnments .V,;e took note of a development of soeciaL- interest which had occurred since the Imperial Conference last met,viz.  the appointment of a Minister Plenipotentiary -torepresent the interests of the Irish Free  State in washington, which was now about to be followed by theappointment of a diplomatic representative of Canada.     we felt that most fruitful results could be  anticipated fromthe co-operation of His Majesty&apos; s representatives in theUnited States of America, already initiated,  and now further to be developed v     In cases other than those whereDominion Ministers were accredited to the Heads of foreign states,  it was agreed to be very desirable that the  existingdiplomatic channels should continue to be used, as betweenthe Dominion Governments and foreign Governments,  in&quot;matters of general and political concern.
VI.      SYSTEM Off OOMkUljIOATION AIDCOWSUTiTA TION .,33, This Section is in a tentative form and still xm.der-fLi&amp;c.   Sessions of the Imperial Conference at whichthe Prime Ministers of Groat Britain and of theDominions are all able to be present cannot, from thenature of things, take place very frequently.      The^system of communication and consultation betweenconferences becomes therefore of special, importance.V/o reviewed the position rev/ reached in this respectwith special reference to the  dosirabiLity of arrangingthat closer personal touch should be established betwcGreat Britain and the Dominions, and the Dominionsinter se, for the discussion of current questions ofpolicy.      Such contact alone can corprey an impression* of tho .atmosphere in which- offioial -correspondence isconducted.      Development, in this respect,  seemsparticularly necessary in relation to matters of major importance in foreign affairs where expedition is of to:essential, and urgent decision necessary.    A specialaspect of the question of consultation which we considered was that concerning tho representation ofGreat Britain in the Dominions.    By-reason of hisconstitutional
constitutional position, as oxpLained in sectionof this Report, the Governor General, can no Lsnger boregaraod as in any sense specially concerned with theInterests of Great &quot;Britain.      There is no one therefore in the dominion capitals in a position to representwith authority the views of His Majesty1s Government inLondon,We summed up our conclusions in the followingHe solution, which-is submitted for the considerationof the Conference: -&quot;The Governments represented at the ImperialConference are impressed with the desirability of developing a system of persona].- contact, both in f;cndonand in the Dominion capitals,  to supplement the presentsystem of inter-communication and the reciprocal supplyof information on affairs of common interest.      Themanner in which any new system is to be worked out is amatter for consideration and  settlement between his majesty s Governments&apos; in-Great Britain and the Dominionswith due regard to the circumstance s of each, particularpart of the Empire,  it being understood that any new arrangements
arrangements should bo supple;mentary to   and not in replacement of, the system of direct, communication from Government to Government and the special arrangements which have been in force  since 1918for communications between Prime Ministers.&quot;
VII.    PATv? 10 ULAB. ASPU0T3  0? l^gJIgN RTgLASPICKSDISCUSSED BY CQIIIITlUIhIt v/as found convenient that certain aspects offoreign relations, particularly those on which a common policy was desirable on matters outstanding at thetime of the Oonforonco,  should be referred to us,  since they could be considered, in greater detail,  and mareInformality than at meetings- of the full Conference.
(a)    Compul s cabinet *rbi trc tion^in , In tern a ti onal31 s pu te Sj^One cue at ion which vre studied was that ofarts, tration in international disputes, with soecialreference  to the question of acceptance of Article 56 ofthe Statute of  the  Permanent Court of InternationalJustice, providing for the comoulsory submission ofcertain classes of cases to the Court.      On this matterwe decided to submit no Re solution to  the Conference,hut, whilst the members of the Committee were unanimous in favouring the widest possible  extension of the methodof arbitration for the se ttlenient of international-disputes,  the feeling was that it was at presentpremature to accent the obligations under the article in question.      a general understanding was reached that none of the  Governments represented at the ImperialConference  would take any action in the direction of theacceptance of the corapulsory jurisdiction of the PermanentCourt, without bringing up the matter for furtherdi sou ssi on .
(b)      Adherence.of the United States of America1-J^^Sl^l9. 22i^^^lA^^nS the PermanentCourt of Internstional Justice.Connected with  the question last mentioned,  wasthat of -the adherence of the United States of america to the Protocol establishing  the Permanent   Court ofInternational Justice.The special conditions upon which the UnitedStates desired to become a party to the Protocol hadbeen discussed at a special Conference held at Geneva in September, 1926,  to which all the governments represented at the Imperial Conference had sentrepresentatives.      We  ascertained that each of these governments was in accord with the  conclusions reached by the  special Conference and with&quot; the action which that conference recommended.
(c)    The Policy of Locarno.The Imperial Conference was fortunate in meeting ati time just after the ratifications of the Locarno Treaty,f Mutual Guarantee had been exchanged on the .entry of Germanyinto the League of Nations.      It was therefore possible toaivisage the results which the Locarno Policy had achievedalready, and to forecast to some extent the further results-mich it was hoped to secure.      These, were explained andiiscussed.      It then became clear that,  from the standpointjf all the Dominions and of India,   there was  complete approval:f the manner in which the negotiations had been conductedaid.brought to so suocessfi.il a conclusion..      The provisions::&quot; Article IX of the Treaty of Mutual Guarantee were alsofolly considered, with  special reference, on the one hand,to the narrow margin of difference between obligations already undertaken under the Covenant of the League of Nations andthose incurred under the Treaty,  and,  on  the other hand,to the practical certainty that the circumstances of any  crisitadetf which   the special obligations of the Treaty would comeInto force would be such as to enlist the full co-operation!f all parts of the Empire,
Our final and unanimous conclusion was to recommend to tlie Conference the adoption of the following Resolution:-&quot;The Conference has heard with satisfaction thestatement of the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs with regard to the  efforts made to ensure peace in Europe,culminating in the agreements of Locarno;    andcongratulates His Majesty&apos;s Government In Great britain on Its share in this successful contribution towardsthe promotion of the peace of the world,&quot;tell Gardens, S,W.l0November&quot; 16th, 1926*
