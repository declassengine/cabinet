THE coal situation.previous reference:Cabinet 43(26), Con-elusion 21c ) ..)3. The Cabinet had before them an InterimReport of the Cabinet Committee on(l)  Fuel and Power Council,(2) Municipal Trading in Coal,(3) Qualifications of Mine Managers(Paper CP.-262  (26)).The Minister of Labour reported that therewas not much change in the coal situation and thatit would be necessary to wait a few days to see theeffect of the Coal Mines (Hours) Bill.The attention of the Cabinet was then drawn to the action of the Jfeasgt Yorkshire Mineowners,who, without informing the Government, had notonly offered a comparatively low scale of wagesbut had altered the division of proceeds againstthe miners from a proportion of 87 to 13 to oneof 85 to 15,    In consequence the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster had announced that the later stages of the Coal Mines (Hours) Bill in the Houseof Lords would not be accelerated.    The cabinet were informed that the representatives of the 5&amp;a&amp;tYorkshire Coalowners&apos; Association would be in london in the course of the day and would give their replyto the demand that they should, withdraw their wagenotices.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, it was essential to avoid any delay in passing the Coal Mines(Hours) Bill:(b) That in the event of a withdrawalof their wage notices by the WubtYorkshire Coalowners&apos; association the present difficulty would dls-appear:(c) That if the We*JL Yorkshire Coalowners&apos;Association should decline to with-draw their notices,  legislation should be enacted to prevent a departure from the division ofproceeds In the proportion of 87to 13, and that such legislation
should take the form of an amendment to the Mining Industry Bill so as not to delay the Coal Mines  (Hours)Bill:(d)  That the Lord Privy Seal should beauthorised to announce today thathe would make a statement on thesubject on the Third Reading.of theBill on Thursday, July 8th, andthat he should confer with the PrimeMinister as to the nature of thestatement to be made on the third reading:Fuel and Power (e) That    as recommended in Paper G.P.-Council. 262 (SB) , the Fuel and Power council should be an ad. hoc body set up by .the President of the Board of Trade:Qualifications (f)  That,  as recommended in Paper C.P.-of Mine Managers. 262 126), an attempt should be madeto improve the qualifications of mine managers by the insertion Inthe Mining Industry Bill of a new clause on the lines of the following draft clause circulated by theSecretary for,-Mines:-&quot;(l)  The Board of Trade may, afterconsultation with the board for Mining Examinations, byorder vary the provisions  ofsections nine and ten of theCoal Mines Act, 1911; relatingto the examinations and qualifi-cations of applicants for certi-certificates of competency under thatAct in such manner as may appearto the Board of Trade to be expedient for the purpose ofadapting them to the.needs ofthe industry and the progressof education.(.2)  The provisions of subsections(3) to  (5)  of section eighty-six,and section one hundred and &apos;seventeen of the Coal Mines Act,.1911, and of Part I of the second schedule to that Act,  shall apply with the necessary modificationswith respect to orders made underthis section in like manner asthose provisions apply to orders made under the said section eighty-six&quot;;(g) That in regard to a Parliamentary .Question addressed.to the Secretaryfor. Mines on the subject of the steps taken by the Government for implementing the Report of the Royal Commission onthe Coal Industry (1925), a reply should be given to the effect that torecapitulate all the information onthe subject would go beyond the bounds
of Question and Answer in Parliamenand that full information on thesubject had already been given.
4* Tha Cabinet were informed that the 500,000tons authorised at the Meeting referred to inthe margin had been bought at reasonable prices and shipping had been arranged at reasonablefreights.The Cabinet agreed  To give to the President of theBoard of Trade and the Chancellorof the Exchequer authority topurchase further supplies of coalas required.
5.    The attention of the Cabinet was called to a recent occurrence at the Snowdown Colliery,in Kent, where, after the miners had gone backto work, 800 men had arrived from a neighbouringcolliery in chars-a-lancaster and had nersuaded theminers to leave their work.The Cabinet were informed that,  accordingto reports received both at the Home Officeand at the Mines Department,  the persuasion hadbeen of a peaceful character^ but the s\iggestionwas made that  the mere fact of fche presence of so large a number of men as 800 gave the demon-stration a non-peaceful character.The Home Secretary said that, in accordancewith the desire of the Cabinet, he ard theSecretary for Scotland had taken steps to provid.call necessary protection.
iHE LEGISLATION: (previous reference:cabinet 4-3136), Con-Illusion o *)6.    The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on Legislation, containingrecommendations in regard to Illegal Strikes,Secret Ballots, the Protection of Workers, TradesUnionism in the Civil Service and among LocalAuthority employes, Picketing during Strikes,the Tra.de Disputes Act, Compulsory Arbitration,and covering a draft Bill (Paper C.P.-237 (26)).In the course of the discussion the cabinet were informed that a strong Comrr it tee had beenformed privately by certain Members of Parliament(including Sir Leslie Scott), and it was suggestedthat the result of this inquiry might be useful to the Cabinet.    It was also suggested that further evidence might with advantage be taken on the ques-tion of Secret Ballots from employers, and that,if possible,  further information should be obtainedfrom the inside of the Trade Union movement on thebest means of carrying out Secret Ballots.The Minister of Health suggested that,if theCabinet Committee was to resume its labours, therewere two questions which they might usefully explore,viz,(i)  The situation which had arisen duringthe recent General Strike when powerengineers held the key to the situa-tion and the Government, when com-pelled to supersede the LocalAuthority, had been unable to retain their services:(ii) Another situation which had occurred during the General Strike when theLocal Authority had abdicated its functions and handed them over to a council of Action, which had sat inthe Mayor&apos;s Parlour   an incidentwhich pointed to the desirabilityof taking powers to supersede a LocalAuthority which declined to do itsduty.
The Report of the Cabinet Committee met withgeneral approval in principle,  but the cabinet felt that further inquiry was desirable and that further evidence should be taken on the questionof Secret Ballots and the method by which theyshould be administered;    also that further inquirywas desirable in regard to Picketing during strikes and Torts.The Cabinet Committee was invitedto make further investigations into these questions with a view, ifpossible, to a further discussion by the Cabinet before the Parlia-mentary Recess.

After consideration of a Memorandum bytbe Lord Chancellor on the subject of the practicefollowed at present by many Departments as regardsthe preliminary steps taken before the royal assent is obtained (Paper CP.-261 (26)&apos;), theCabinet agreed  That the Department concerned should, some considerable time before the date on which it is desired that  a Bill should become law, communicate withthe Chief Government Whip inthe House of Lords, who could then,  after consulting the leader of the House, make suitable arrangements in con-cultation with the Chief Whipin the House of Commons. Whenthe communication is made tothe Chief Whip, a simultaneouscommunication should be made tothe Lord Chancellor,  through hisPermanent Secretary, as by thepractice of Parliament the pres-ence of the Lord Chancellor isrequired at the pronouncement ofthe Royal Assent,  and if the time is fixed without reference to himdislocation of public business mayensue.

The Prime Minister read to the Cabinetthe following extracts from  a    letter he hadreceived from Cardinal Bourne, Roman CatholicArchbishop of Westminster.&quot;But what I have heard to-day is far more serious-      That our religious processionsshould continue to be subject to a law ofexception instead of being brought definitelyunder the common law of the land affectingprocessions of all kinds, as we desire themand are fully justified in desiring them tobe,, will justly give rise to feelxngs andexpressions of resentment and indignation mostharmful to His Majesty!s Government and tothe good name of England throughout - the Empire,wherever Catholics are found, and indeed allover the world. r   If I am rightly informed nosuch exceptional&apos; legislation affecting us nowexists in any part of the Empire outside this island.As I said in my letter to you of May 1st:&apos;We do not ask for privileges but we do claimto have the same rights as the rest ofEnglishmen&apos;.&quot;The Cabinet agreed:That the question of Roman Catholic publicprocessions should he left to free vote on the House of Commons and that ministers should be free to speak on the subject ifthey so desire.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.July 7th,  19 26.
APPENDIX.REVISED DRAFT LETTER FROM THE FRENCH MINISTER OFWmjM-ELWz CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.Dear Mr. Chancellor,In assuming the responsibility of signing the agreement for the settlement of the French debt and thereby accepting the payment of the annuities fixed on the sole credit ofFrance, I feel bound to explain that, In the opinion of theFrench Government, the future possibility of making transferacross the exchange of the amounts required to assure the fulfilment of the debt settlements with the United Statesand Great Britain seems inevitably to depend largely onthe continued transfer of receipts from Germany under theDawe-s Plan.     If, therefore,  through the fault of Germany,such receipts should cease completely or to the extent ofmore than one half, a new situation would&apos;be created andthe French Government is bound to reserve the right insuch an event of asking the British Government to reconsider the question in the light of all the circumstances thenprevailing.     It is under this reserve that I consent to sign the agreement that we have dram up. *&quot;        1REVISED DRAFT LETTER FROM THE CHANCELLOR of THEeXchTOSr TO The PreiTch Minister&quot;oF&apos;TiM?7cb:Dear M. Caillaux,I have received your letter of the ..... July.     As I. have explained, His Majesty&apos;s Government must maintain the position that the settlement&apos; which we have arrived at of the French war debt to this country depends, like that debt itself, on the sole credit of France.     You will realise that in the hypothetical circumstances that you mention, Great Britain wouldalready have suffered a diminution of the receipts from the dawes Scheme, which we have taken into account in arriving at the various debt settlements, and this is one of the factors which would have to be borne in mind in the eventof any. reconsideration of the question being desired by theFrench Government.     Subject to this i do not object to thestatement that you make.In the event of any modification being made, I should expect, in order to secure equal treatment among creditors,that other creditors of France would take into consideration a corresponding modification of debts due to them.!l i!LL&quot;     Amendments approved by the Cabinet are underlined.
