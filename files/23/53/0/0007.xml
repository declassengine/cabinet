In these oircumstancesMr Amery proposed, after giving proper notice ofour intention to the Free State Government, tojpubliah the Report of the Committee and announce the Cabinet&apos;a decision.    Attached to  the Notewere drafts of a Question and Answer in Parliament,together with drafts of letters to Mr Cos graveand to the Governor-General.Shortly before the and of the Cabinet Meetingthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs received and read to the Cabinet a letter from Mr Cos gravein which the latter rejected as inadequate- theoffer of legislation for a removal of the obstacleimposed by the ^ot of 1383 in the way of animmediate loan of the Lane Pictures to the DublinGallery, and adhered generally to his previousview .

APPENDIX.HO INN AN UA OTA RAINSrald Mulrbtean UacBaile Ata Cliat(Dublin).8th June, 1926,ig Right Honourable L.S. Amery, M.P. tscretary of State for the Dominions,-ning Street, London.Dear Mr, Amery,I have discussed with my colleagues your letter ofthe 27th ultimo on the subject of the Lane Pictures and I am bound to say that we are disappointed at the decision arrivedat by the Cabinet that it would be improper.to modify SirHuRh Lane &apos;s Will by legislation^     We had hoped that theconsideration of Sir Hugh Lane(s undoubted intention, as expressed in the Codi oil of the 3rd February, 1915,  to bequeaththese pictures to the City of Dublin would be regarded as of sufficient weight to justify the introduction of legislation to give effect to that intention,,Whatever may be the legal position, the Irish art-loving public have always regarded these pictures asbelonging of right to their country, and there can be no doubtof the deep interest which they take in the question of thereturn of the collection to Ireland.      They cannot fell to feel &quot;issatisfaction at the insistence upon a legal techni-cality in order to retain possession to the National Galleryin     idon of a collection, the value of which to Dublinnculch by reason of the limited opportunity which existsere -     the acquisition of works of art, be Incomparablygreater than the relative loss to London, which possesses in&apos;&quot;JO Art Galleries numerous examples of the works of***** Masters.
My colleagues and I would not feel justified ining that the loan for a substantial period to thei Gallery of a portion of the lane Collection could beted as a final settlement of the matter..     We feel thatje and equity alike dictate that the pictures should besed of In accordance with the donor1s last expressed3,     We feel too that in a matter of this kind there &quot;be no appearance of haggling as between two sisteris of the Commonwealth, and we venture therefore to3S an earnest hope that the Cabinet may see their) authorise the Introduction of the necessaryLation to enable the collection to be permanently.&quot;erred to this country.Yours sincerely,SD.      W.T.  COSGRAVE.
