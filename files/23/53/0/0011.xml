The pro-posed National Wages Board had not been included as it was bitterly opposed both by owners and miners,and it was proposed to deal with the question later, -
after further consideration and consultation with both parties .As regards the Government&apos;s coal policy as awhole, there were various proposals of the Commissionoutstanding, including Prof it-Sharing, Pit CommitteesSelling Agencies, and Transfer Prices, on some ofwhich it was Intended, as soon as circumstancespermitted,  to set up Committees with which miners and mine-owners might he associated.    Municipaltrading had been considered by an inter-DepartmentalCommittee, but their Report had not yet come beforethe.Cabinet Committee.After careful consideration of the two Billsthe Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Coal Mines (Hours) .Bill, 1926, for introduction in theHouse of Commons on the following day, in the form attached to C.P.-247 (26), subject to any drafting alterations that might be foundnecessary:(b) To approve the Mining Industry Bill(1926) for introduction in the Houseof Commons on the following day,  inthe form attached to CP.-248 (26),subject to the following:-(l)  The adoption of the typewrittenamendments circulated just beforethe Cabinet Meeting.(2)  Page 7.

In view of the urgency of intro-ducing the Bill, it was decided not to suspend its introduction pending theseinquiries, as the necessary amendmentscould be introduced during the Parlia-mentary discussion of the Bill.(d) That the, &apos;&amp;eere-ta-ry of Dtra&amp;e-for-Wa-r&amp;he-u4rd--be-a-s-ke-d-^to-4*committee-eharrge-o- -%he-s-eBills in the-Hoxise-of Commons .(e) That the Cabinet Committee should atonce consider the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on MunicipalTrading.( f) That the Secretary for Mines, should circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum explaining the precise position inregard to the various recommendationsof the Royal Commission on the CoalIndustry involving Government action,so that members of the Cabinet shouldbe in a position to review theirpolicy as a whole.(g) That, if and when the question of thepurchase of mining royalties was raised in debate, it should be explainedthat the Government have been released from their offer to accept the wholeof the Coal Commission&apos;s Report, whichwas conditional on its  acceptance byother parties, and are absolutely freein this matter;    that some of thepractical advantages claimed for thepurchase of royalties have beenprovided for in the Mining industry bill (Part II);    that our financialposition has been prejudiced by thestrike and is now unfavourable to any
