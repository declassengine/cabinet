-TfJA&apos;Xl ON.I (26),In 5).1.      The Cabinet met as a matter of urgencyto consider the Coal Situation.On the previous morning the negotiating committee of the Trades Union Congress general council had been received by the Prime Ministerand some of his colleagues, and had informedthem that the Executive Committee of theMiners&apos; Federation was now prepared to enter upon negotiations on the basis of animmediate resumption of work following uponthe formal acceptance by the Miners of theprinciple of district agreements subject tocertain safeguards.At 1.30 p.m. and again at 4.15 p.m. the&apos;Prime Minister and his colleagues hadreceived the Executive Committee of the Miners&apos;Federation, and a discussion had taken placein regard to the nature of the safeguardsdesired by the Miners as a condition of their acceptance of district settlements.      Subsequentlythe Secretary for Mines had been asked to .invite,  for consultation in London to-day,   suchrepresentative coal owners as were  available and were willing to attend.At the outset of the meeting, a Memorandumby the Secretary for Mines  (Paper No. CP.  371 (26,Appendix), was handed round,  setting forthethe follow!ng:-I.      The miners  Proposals,   (as interpretedby the officials of the Ministry of mines after hearing the statements madeat the meeting on the previous day.
II.      Proposals that might be pressed uponthe Owners.III.      Action that might he taken in theevent of the Owners not agreeing.The precise questions before the Cabinet were as to whether the Prime Minister and his colleagvi.eson the Coal Committee should have authority (1) toa vproach the Coal Owners on the lines suggestedction II of the above Memorandum (Appendix), and(2) in the event of a refusal on the part of theOwners to treat, to proceed on the assumptionthat legislation will be introduced on the linesof Section III of the same Memorandum, providingfor a review by a Central Appeal Tribunal of district agreements.The Cabinet were reminded that theproposals of the Miners, so far as they referredto a Central Appeal Tribunal/ and the course proposed in Section III of the Memorandum inthe Appendix,, are substantially the same as theoffer transmitted to the Miners with the PrimeMinister^ letter of the 17th September, 1926, (CP. 331 (2f )which contemplated legislation to secure theapplication by a National Appeal Tribunal of principles intended to combine districtarrangements with national supervision     an offer which had been refused by the I/liners andsubsequently withdrawn.It was made clear In the discussion that,in the abBence of special provisions to thecontrary/ the proposed legislation would be restricted In duration within the same limitsas the Coal Mines (Hours) Act, and consequently
the establishment of a Central Appeal Tribunalcould be represented as applicable only to theconditions existing temporarily in the coalindustry, and must not be regarded as a precedent for extension of the principle to other industries the Coal Committee, however,  was  asked tobear in mind the importance of securing, ifpossible, that any agreement should providefor peace in the coal industry for as long aperiod as possible.As a point of minor detail, the coal committee was asked to ensure the same terminologyfor the proposed Central Appeal Tribunal, whichis variously described in CP. 371 (26) as a tribunal and an Industrial Court.The Coal Committee was also asked to makeunmistakably clear that the proposed CentralAppeal Tribunal would not come into operation without a general and immediate resumption ofwork.The Attorney-General raised several points of detail on CP. 371 (26) for the Coal Committee1consideration.Having regard to the general acceptance by the Coal Committee of the policy set forth in cp. 371 (26),  the Cabinet agreed:-That the Coal Committee should beauthorised to proceed with the Ownerson the lines set forth in CP. 371 (26)(Appendix), Section II, and in theevent of their refusal, to   acton the assumption that legislation wouldbe Introduced providing for a review by a Central Appeal Tribunal of districtagreements, as set forth in Section iii of the same Memorandum. NAll questions of detail were left to theCoal Committee.-1 Gardens, S.W.Ctoenber, 1926.
