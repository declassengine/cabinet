1.   The Cabinet heard from Lord Lloyd, theHigh Commissioner,, a detailed- statement on thepresent position in Egypt.   Lord Lloyd emphasizedthe difficult position     arising from the provi-sional settlement of 1922, which had resulted inGreat Britain being paralysed as regards the powerto control the situation in Egypt, while Egypt was left in a state of deception as to its true status.He asked for support for the following policy:-That we should stand firmly to the&apos;present position and not allow anyweakening of o\ir authority in Egypt:That we should stand by all those who have stood by us in Egypt:That we should insist on a renewal of the contracts of British officials(many of which expire in the spring of 1927) until after the settlementof the four reserved point, andshould seek gradually to replaceBritish officials in Some, key posts whichin recent years have been allowed tobe given to persons of other than british or Egyptian nationality:That when we make a definite demand on Egypt we shotild insist on its being carried out:That we should do our- utmost to avoidan application by Egypt for admissionas a member of the League of Nations,and that this object should be secured,if possible, by action at Cairo.(NOTE:    A summary of Lord Lloyd&apos;s observa-tions is on record in the ForeignOffice and in the Cabinet Office.)In the course of the discussion, allusionwas made to telegrams from Cairo,&apos; Nos. 350, 351,352 and 353, dated July 28, 1926, in regard tothe desire of the Egyptian Government to make anapplication for admission to the League ofNations before September.-1-
The  cabinet approved Lord Lloyd&apos;s statement of policy.    they agreed       that we cannot allow the gradual erosionof our position in Egypt by the elimination ofBritish officials;    that the concentration of egyptian troops at or in the vicinity of.Cairo is dangerous to our position and should be prevented;that steps should be taken to dissuade the egyptian government from making an application for admission to the League of Nations;    and that the methods bywhich we should place ourselves in a position to&apos;carry out our obligations for the good governmentof Egypt and for the protection of foreign communi-ties in that country, and the moment at which action should be taken in support of those methods, are matters for the consideration of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, acting on the advice of the High Commis-sioner in the light of other relative circumstances,from time to time as occasion requires.    The view was expressed that the Egyptian Army might well bereduced in size, and that there was no necessityfor it to be trained or equipped on.the lines of a modern Eu.ropean army,  or for other than ceremonialpurposes and the support of the Civil power.    TheCabinet were informed that&apos;the Secretary of Statefor War had arranged to discuss certain matters relating to the equipment of the Egyptian Army with lord Lloyd,
The Cabinet decided  That the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with Lord Lloyd,should send a telegram to Mr.Henderson, at Cairo, instructing him to make it clear to theEgyptian Government that HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not allow them to join the League ofNations until after the settlementof the four reserved points, .with a view, if possible, to pre-venting the question from being raised at Geneva.
/2.  In the course of the preceding discussion the Secretary of State for Foreign.Affairs informed the Cabinet that, as the result of a Meeting of theCommittee pf Imperial Defence, an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee had been set up, composed of membersnominated by the Secretaries of State for Warand Air and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs himself, who had appointed an officialfrom the Sudan Government (.215th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence,.. Conclusion 7),
3.    At the request of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Cabinet agreed  That action on the decision reached at the previous Meeting (referred toin the margin)  should be suspendedpending the&quot; receipt of a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, and that the question shoxxldbe disclassed at the next Meeting ofthe Cabinet.
S.t.viouserenee:inet 46&apos;), Oon-sion4. The Chancellor of .the Exchequer informed theCabinet that the new French Government proposedto ash. the French Chamber to ratify the agreement in regard to the funding of the French Debt nextOctober, but that in the meantime the main provi-aions of the Agreement would hold good, and that accordingly we should receive payments amountingin the aggregate to  4,000,000 in the interval.He proposed to accept this arrangement, but topress for the payment of the  800,000&apos; due to this.country under the Spa Agreement for ship hire  a payment which, under the unratified Debt Fundingagreement,would have been modified. - In the last resort, however, rather than lose the chance of putting the Agreement into effective operation, hewould give way on this latter point, and allow the contemplated concession on ships as if the Debtagreement had been ratified.The Cabinet approved the policy proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
daiion.ousenoe-at 485.)5.    The Minister of Labour informed tbe Cabinetthat the Miners&apos;  Executive had held a meeting onthe previous day and that a Delegate conference was being held today, when the Executive wouldprobably ask the Conference for approval to thepolicy set forth in the manifesto recently drawnup by certain religious leaders under the auspices of the Christian Industrial Fellowship.    this might or might not lead to a reqixest by the miners&apos;representatives to be received by the Government.Should this occur during the next day or two, hethought it would be wise that the miners shouldnot be received by the Prime Minister but by himself, with the Secretary for Mines, accompaniedby any other Minister who might be available and willing to co-operate.    At this interview his attitude would be governed by the decisions alreadyannovmced in regard to subsidy, etc.    It wasimpossible to foresee what might be the resultof such a meeting, but if the miners evinced a disposition to negotiate he might think it desirableto put them in contact with the mine-owners,probably with a neutral Chairman.The Cabinet concurred generally inthe proposals of the&quot;Minister ofLabour -
