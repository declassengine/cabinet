The Cabinet again resumed, consideration ofthe Chancellor of the Excheqxier&apos;s Memorandiira. on theCivil Service Cost-of-Living Bonus (Paper CP.-76(26)).while the strength of public opinion againstthe growth in size and cost of the Civil service was recognised,  the view was rather strongly supportedthat the Government&apos;s attitude towards the questionof compulsory arbitration,. as established by theundertaking given by the present Prime Minister inMay, 1923, could only be modified by reopening thewhole question with a viow to revised arrangementsfor the future .The Chancellor of the Exchequer v/ithdrew the-question ^or the moment, as it was generally recog-nised that the present time was unfavourable for raising a question of this character in Parliament.
