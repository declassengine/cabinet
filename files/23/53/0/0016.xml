COAL TION.Jlousfjgrenoe:)tnet 45I ct1,   The Cabinet were informed that no develop-ment had taken place in the Coal Situation.   Therehad been no real tendency on the part of theminers to return to work, but this had not been anticipated as yet.The President of the Board of Trade gave the Cabinet sorne particulars which showed thatthe effect of the Coal Strike on trade had been less than might have been expected, and less thanat the corresponding stage of the last Coal Strike.A short discussion took place as to thedesirability of announcing the Government&apos;s policy(Cabinet 43 (26), Conclusion 2 and Appendix, Para.l)in regard to the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on the Coal Industry, 1925, on thesubject of research.In this connection the Chancellor of theExchequer pointed out that the long duration ofthe Strike would render it impossible to devotewhole of thethe  3,000,000 which he had hoped to use for theindustry during the transition period, and that part of it was being spent on the purchase offoreign coal^\The Cabinet agreedTo postpone a decision as to anyannouncements on the above ques-tions until the occasion should arise.
gHK BETTINGjreviousReference:cabinet 1426), Oon-lugion b.)2. Tho Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,at his own request, made a statement to theCabinet, in which, by reference to a verbatimreport of a speech he had made the previous week,he was able to show to the entire satisfaction ofhis colleagues that remarks on the subject of theBetting Tax attributed to him in certain newspaperswere wittaout foundation.-2-
3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer had nothing, to add to the statements already pub-lished in regard to the French Debt agreement which he had signed on Monday, July 12th.-3-
pIA.llicybardsteviousfcference:[binet 40p), Con-conclusion 5.)4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet some particulars of the extra-ordinary attitude of suspicion with which theSoviet Government regarded this country.   sir austen Chamberlain added that he had recently received the Soviet Charge d*Affaires, and in thecourse of their conversation had pointed out thatit was useless to take up fresh negotiations solong as the two Governments were separated by agulf of principle.    In reply to a request forinformation as to why negotiations could not be resumed on the basis of the Agreement signed bythe late Government, Sir Austen Chamberlain had said that the Soviet Government must recognisethat a Government inherited tha obligations aswell as the rights of its predecessors.    It wasimpossible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to under-take any obligation in regard to a Loan to SovietRussia.    The only means by which the Soviet Gov-ernrcent could borrow in this country would be byapplication to the City, but the banks would notlend to people who had repudiated the debts oftheir predecessors.    If closer relations with GreatBritain were desired, the first step of the SovietbothGovernment or of those who controlledthem and theThird International must be to desist from attack-ing British interests in all parts of the world.The Cabinet approved the line taken by the Foreign Secretary.
5.    The Prime Minister mentioned to the Cabinetthat on the preceding Sunday afternoon a burglarhad broken into the block of buildings in WhitehallGardens in whioh the Cabinet Office is situated.The burglar had eventually been caught outside2, Whitehall Gardens, and had been committed for trial. Thi3 was the second attempt on WhitehallGardens within the apace of a few weeks.
6.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Gabj.net some further particulars of con-vereatlons he and some of his colleagues had held with the King of Spain.    At the moment it seemed unlikely that Spain would continue to take part inthe work of the Council of the League of Nations.In the course of the conversations the king of Spain had suggested the possibility of a mandate for Spain over Tangier under the League of Nations,and had expressed the view that this might not beso objectionable to Italy as appeared at first sight&apos;.   .Sir Austen Chamberlain had informed TJisMajesty that if Italy acquiesced there was noobjection to the proposal from the point of viewof British policy, nor, he would hope,  on the partof the French.    The possibility of an eventualvisit to London by General Primo de Rivera had beenmooted.Sir Austen Chamberlain added that the essen-tial thing from the British point of view was thatTangier should remain internationalised and shouldnot be made a place dT armes .    The terms of theMandate, if any were proposed, would need to becar-)fully cons ider ed .The Cabinet approved.
