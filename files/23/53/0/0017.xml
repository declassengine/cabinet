1.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsbrought to the attention of the Cabinet two mattersbearing on our relations with Italy.The first had reference to the refusal ofthe Italian representative on a League of nations commission on the proposed Bulgarian Refugee loan to agree with the British and other representatives.At the request of tha British representative. sir austen had made a personal appeal on this question to Signor Mussolini.    The latter, though stilladhering to his original point of view, had acceded to Sir Austen Chambe rlain&apos;s personal appeal and had instructed the Italian representative, if theLeague of Nations Commission was unable to find a formula reconciling the two points of view, toadopt the British formula.The second question arose in connection withtheFarsan Islands, in the Red Sea, in which therewas a fine harbour and in which oil was suspectedto exist, and which the British 0-government had promised to  the Idrisi should not be allowed topass into anyone else&apos;s possession, though this had apparently teen intended to relate to theclaim of any European Power to the Islands.    TheItalians were supporting a claim by the Imam tothese Islands and were furnishing him with amis.If we in the same way were to arm the Idrisi,the two tribes would in affect be at war, with thesupport of Great Britain and Italy respectively.Sir Austen Chair.berlain therefore proposed toascertain the exact position and then to have itdiscussed direct with Signor Mussolini.The Cabinet expressed satisfaction at tte
success which had attended Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;sai-peal in regard to the Bulgarian Refugee loan,and fully supported his policy in regard to theParsan Islands.
3.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that, according to Press reports,Mr Mellon,  the Secretary of the United Statesmraasury, had, on leaving Hew York for Europe,made some extraordinary statements in regard tothe conditions in which the British debt to theUnited States had been contracted.    Mr churchill had felt it his duty to correct these statements,and had taken advantage of Monday&apos;s Debate on theInter-Allied Debts to do so in courteous terms.Mr Winston, the Acting Secretary of the AmericanTreasury, had now issue.ed a reply, but, so far ashe oould judge, nothing therein tended in any wayto upset his own statement.The matter vas sufficiently complicated toenable tbe United States of America to make adebating case,  but the statement he had made .in the House of Commons was confirmed. both by the broad results of the figures (which he communicatedto the Cabinet) and by the fact that, in accordancewith a condition made by Congress to loans totheir allies made after their entry into the War,every item had been closely scrutinised and passedby a Committee on which the United States ofAmerica was strongly represented.
3.  The Cabinet had before there a further InterimReport by the Committee on the Report of the RoyalCommission on the Coal Industry (1925), oontainingrecommendations in regard to the establishment of joint Committees for Coal Mines, the Wagon Commit-tee. and Municipal Trading in Coal  (Paper C.P.-277 (26)).The new Clause in the Mining Industry Billin regard to the establishment of Joint committees for Coal Mines had already been adopted by theParliamentary Committee on the previous day.A short discussion took place in regard tothe general coal situation, and the Cabinet were informed that no general change had yet takenplace,Mention was made of three sets of self-constituted intermediaries who were trying tofind a basis for a settlement.The Cabinet took note of and approved the Interim. Report by the Committee on.the Report of the Royal  Commission onthe Coal Industry (.1925) (Paper C.P.-277 (26)).
-5-4. The Cabinet had before then; a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Education on thesubject of the present position in the country as a whole, and in Durham in particular,  in regardto the feeding of school children,  showiner, the -present position compared with that of the coal strike in 1921  iPaper CP.-271 ( 26)).Some discussion took place on the questionof whether meals ought to be provided by theEducation Authorities during the long vacation,and a suggestion was made that the Law officers should be consulted on the legal aspects of thequestion.The Cabinet were informed that the question had already arisen in Scotland and that the lord advocate had given advice to the effect that, asthe law stands,  this duty did not appear to beaffected by the holidays.
HEAP BATHSiousre nee:net 43Oon-&apos;0n 2 andndix)..MININGTRY BILL.ousence:lat 45Con-on 3 (c) .)5.   The Secretary for Mines reported that theParliamentary Committee had amended the provisionsof the Mining Industry Bill in respect of pit-headbaths.    He recalled that the levy on royalties was estimated, to produce  250,000 per annum.    The RoyalCommission had proposed that  150,000 should beadded from, the existing Welfare Fund, and provision to this effect had been made in the Bill.The Parliamentary Committee, however, had takenobjection to raiding district Welfare Funds andhad deleted this provision&apos; from the Bill.    the welfare Committee were still prepared to spend 75,000 from their central funds, which could beadded to the  250,000-.    If more was required, ademand would come from the districts, which wouldbe at liberty to devote their funds to this purpose,A curtailment of the total available would delay the provision       baths, but, as opinion in. favourof the baths  required developing and is not in some districts as strong as it may become, the delaymight be useful and the possible district resent-ment would be avoided if the Committee&apos;s decision was allowed to stand.The Cabinet agreed  That the Parliamentary Committee&apos;decision should be allowed to stand.
6. The Secretary ^or Mines reported that no provision was made in the Bill in regard to theburden of&quot; maintenance of pit-head baths .After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed(a) That the rr aintenanee ought to fall upon the mine-owners :(b) That the Secretary for mines should make a communication tothe owners to this effect .
7.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tocertain amendments to tha Mining Industry Billproposed by Sir Leslie Scott, relating to wholeaaamalgamation and compulsory selling syndicates.Neither of these amendments commendedthemselves to the Cabinet.

This Bill had previous-ously been thoroughly examined by the Committeeof Home Affairs and was brought before the Cabinetin regard to one question which remained unsettled,namely, as to the provisions to be inserted in theBill for the regulation of the hours of employmentof women and young persons.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary should beauthorised to introduce in Parlia-ment during the present session the Factories Bill attached to cp.-272 (26), not with a view topursuing it this Session, but toallow of its examination by theparties interested and to give anopportunity for cons-ultation inregard to it in the Autumn.-10-
