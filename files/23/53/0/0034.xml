^&quot;HINA. 1. The Cabinet invited the First Lord of the(previous Admiralty to confer with the Foreign Secretary in reference:Cabinet 63 regard to the naval reinforcements to be sent to(26), Con-conclusion 3.) China, and to report on the subject to the Cabineton the following day.
($USE OP LORDS 2,    The Cabinet &quot;had before there a Report of the$FORM.Cabinet Committee (Paper CP.-2? (26)), togetherifraviousoeferenoe: with a Note by the Lord Privy Seal (Paper CP.-105Cabinet 61(26),  Con- (26)) on the subject of -House of Lords Reform,jjusion 8.)The Prime Minister suggested that as a large measure in regard to the reform of the House ofLords could hardly be carried before 1928, it mightbe useful at this stage to have the proposals ofthe Cabinet Committee translated into the form ofa Bill.   No decision, however, was taken on thissubject.The discussion which followed was directed to the general principles rather than to the detailsof the Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report.The principle of a referendum or poll ofthe Parliamentary electors (Recommendation A (3)in Paper CP.-27 (26)). in regard to Bills twicepassed by the House of Commons and rejected by theHouse of LordeIn view of the lack of evidence of any strong and general desire in the country for a large measure of reform of the House of Lords, it wassuggested that the policy of the Government shouldtake some less ambitious form than that proposedin the Report of the Cabinet Committee and might beeonfined to some such points as the following:-(l) The setting up of a Joint StandingCommittee of both Houses to consider what is a &quot;Money Bill&quot; within themeaning of the Parliament Act, 1911(Recommendation A (l) of Paper O.P.-27 (26)), - a, proposal which was strongly supported:(2) Provision that the procedure of the parliament Act should not be appli-cable to the alteration of theprocedure under that Act, - which met with a good deal of support;
(3) Reduction by the House of Lordsitself in the number of its members   but the membersof the House of Lords in theCabinet stated that that house would probably not be willing toreduce its numbers except in&quot;return for increased powers.It was suggested that if some lass ambitiousmeasure of this kind were adopted it would be advisable to pass it in 1927 rather than in 1928.criticism was directed, even by some membersof the Cabinet who in other respects supported theadoption of the whole Report of the CabinetCommittee, against the proportion (50 per cent.)of hereditary Peers proposed for a reformed house of Lords (Recommendation B (1) of paper cp.-27 (26)) .A suggestion was made that both the policy proposed in the Report, as well as the reducedpolicy referred to above, should be set forth inthe form of Resolutions.    The two alternativepolicies, presented in this form, could then befurther discussed by the Cabinet.After each member of the Cabinet presenthad given his views, this preliminary discussion was brought to an end and the subject was adjourned for later consideration.
EVASION.The chancellor ellor . of the Exchequer brought before the Cabinet the question of tax evasion,to which a good deal of attention had been directedin the House of Commons and elsewhere.   Variousingenious methods of tax evasion had become acomparatively common practice.    The subject hadbeen studied by the Inland Revenue Department,which had prepared various Memoranda on the matter.The Cabinet accepted the proposal of the that a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for War,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Attorney General,should be appointed to study the documents to be circulated by theChancellor of the Exchequer andto meet at the beginning of Februaryin order to prepare a Report forconsideration by the Cabinet.Chancellor of the Exchequer -Mr R.B.HoworthMr J.D.E.Fergussonecretaries -Whit ehal 1 Gar dens, S .W. 1,December 14 v. 1926.
