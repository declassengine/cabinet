The &quot;Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee in regard to the businessof Parliament up to. Christmas, containing alsorecommendations as to the business of the Houseof Commons for Tuesday, August 3rd (Paper C.P.-301 (26)).The Cabinet was strongly urged to promote the Palestine and Past Africa Loans (Guarantee)Bill from List &quot;B&quot; (important Bills which should.if possible, be passed into law before the close of 1926), where it occupies the first place, toList &quot;A&quot; (Essential Bills which must be passed into law before the close of 1926);   but, in viewof the pressure on Parliamentary time after the adjournment,  the Prime Minister did not feel able.,at present, at any rate,-to accede to this .While recognising that Parliamentary businessafter the Recess would depend to a considerable extent on whether or no it was eventually decidedto authorise the introduction of the Trade UnionBill, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee on Parlia-mentary Business (Paper CP.- 30l (26)):(b) On the recommendation of the LordChancellor, as Chairman of the CabinetCommittee, that the Indian and colonial Divorce Jurisdiction Bill,should be included in List &quot;B&quot;(Important Eills which should,  ifpossible, be passed into law beforethe close of 1926), instead of in-List &quot;C&quot; (Bills to be postponed until1927). . The reason for this decision was that the Cabinet were informed      .that corresponding legislation yms^s&amp;Actd o/n^/pp77BS3Ktesfe^sb^!9 enacted in India in theAutumn.(c) That, as regards other Bills whichit was urged should be included in list &quot;BV viz.; The Sale of PoodRegulationteneref-fusion 17) .(Weights and Measures) Bill, the ParksRegulations Bill, Ministers who thought there was a chance of obtaining the
Second Reading after 11 p.m. should in due course approach the PrimeMinister, with whom the decision should lie,according to the exigencies of the Parliamentarys i tuati on .
5.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterinformed the Cabinet that an amendment to theMining Industry Bill, which had already been oncerejected, was again to be brought forward, this time by Lord Darling, proposing that informationof various kinds should be made available to theminers.The Cabinet were informed that there was agood deal to be said for the substance of this amendment, but that It was not well-suited to theparticular Clause in the Bill in connection withwhich it was to be moved, and that it was a matter that could better be dealt with after the miners and mineowners had corce to terms.It&quot; was suggested that Lord Darling wouldprobably be willing not to press the amendment.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthen referred to a second amendment, proposing that the welfare levy on royalties should be calculated after deducting payments for miningroyalties.    The Cabinet were informed that theonly result of calculating the welfare levy inthis way would be to increase the scale, since acertain sum had to be obtained from this source.The Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster was authorised to resist both amendments in theHouse of Lords.
Navalin6. Cabinet further considered the Memo-randum by tho First Commissioner of Works (paper cp .-293 (26)) dealing with the proposal of theAmerican Battle Monuments Commission to set up a naval Memorial in London.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs15,;) gave the Cabinet an account of the correspondencewhich had passed on the subject, and stated that nothing could have been more proper or friendlythan the terras in which the proposal had beensuggested.In the course of the discussion which followed, the Cabinet were reminded that no publicmemorial to the British Naval Forces had been setup, and that an application for a site on the embankment to commemorate the services of theBritish Mercantile Marine had teen refused.    Itwas important,  therefore,. to avoid offending Britispublic opinion by a premature announcement of theGovernment&apos;s acceptance of the American proposal,while at the same time it would be a profoundmistake to do anything which would appear ungraciouto the Americans.The suggestion that the site of the Americanmonument should be in Grosvenor Gardens,  close tothe chancellery of the American Embassy and to what,were the h^ad offices of the American Naval Missionduring tbe War, found considerable favour.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of stats for Foreign Affairs to write to theAmericanE mbassy cordially welcomingthe proposal to set up a Naval Memorialin London to commemorate the servicesof the American Navy during the War,and tha close co-operation which existedbetween the British and American Navies;
in the course of the letter theSasretary of State should indie ttethat come delay in carrying out theyrspotai waa deoirahla, ac a Memorialto the British Naval Forces was in contemplation,

He was prepared to allow the arrangements in Scotland toremain unaltered.The Cabinet agreed (a) To approve generally the proposalso1-&quot; the Minister of Health,  subjectto discussion of details betweenthe Treasury and the Ministry ofHealth, and to the settlement ofany outstanding disagreement bythe Prime Minister:(b) That the subsidy arrangements forScotland should remain as at present:
(c) That before the rising of parliament the Minister of Health should announce that tho Order which he ha3 to makecannot be made before October 1st,when it may or may not be necessaryto make a variation in the futurerate of subsidy;    but the present rate of subsidy will be applicableto houses completed before October1st, 1927.-1.1-

Annex.Mr from Secretary, Admiralty, to Secretary, Committee of Imperial Defence.l11755&apos; July 16, 1926.&apos;l AM commanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer toiralty letter* of the 30th March, 1926, on the subject of the development of-oapore, and to point out that since that letter was written the Chiefs of Staff^Committee iu its 4th Recommendation contained  in  C.I.D.  MemorandumJ01-B, has placed the adequate defence of Singapore first in order of urgencyjiir defence requirements, and in the same Memorandum has reaffirmed thetssity for the development of the Naval Base Singapore, and has assigned to thisapriority only second to that of the defences.2. As the Committee of Imperial Defence are aware, the Federated Malaytes have also recently by a spontaneous action undertaken to finance the Singaporeme to the extent of  2JOOO,000, to be paid in five annual instalments of  400,000,jider to facilitate more rapid progress with it.3. In view of these developments, My Lords are still further strengthened inr opinion that no time should be lost in deciding on a definite policy both inird to the Singapore defences and the development of the Naval Base, so that; policy may be placed before the Dominion representatives at the forthcomingnerial Conference. My Lords are further of opinion that on this action depends.&apos;best hope of obtaining further financial assistance from other parts of the Empireards the cost of these vital services.\. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee have recently reached agreement, after;tcareful consideration, on the details of the Singapore Defence Scheme, and theirwsals are shortly to be considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence so it(proposed to discuss the Defence Scheme further in this letter. My Lords desire;ate, however, that they have again reviewed the scale on which the developmentk Singapore Scheme (apart from Defence) should proceed having special regard(a.) The decision contained in Cabinet 24 (25), Conclusion IILt(b.) The urgent need for economy.is review My Lords have had especially in mind that, while the Cabinetsion referred to above does not in any way affect the scale of development requiredable the Naval Base to carry out its functions in peace and war, it does enableUnction to be drawn between that part of the work which will require eight yearsoraplete and those items which could be provided in a shorter period of time if anda change in the political situation shall render it necessary to do so.5. It is not, however, practicable to apply this method of computing theediate requirements to its full logical conclusion, as it is essential that certain(e.(/., the Power Station and some part of the machinery shops) should bed contemporaneously with the completion of the graving clocks and repairlirves, since otherwise it would not be possible for the base to be used effectively foriking and repair of His Majesty&apos;s snips.Their Lordships therefore have made a careful review of the existing schemeNaval Base, in the course of which every item has been considered from theJill of view of (a) the length of time required for its completion, and (b) whetherdeeded, either in whole or in part, in order to admit of the docks and repairl&apos;tves being brought into actual use.   On these lines they have prepared a reduced,   the total cost of which is estimated at  7,750,000.   This scheme, althoughpiuces both the repair and storage facilities seriously below what is consideredpry for conducting a war in the Far East, they are prepared to accept, providedSit is clearly understood that it would be necessary for the deferred portions of*tame to be proceeded with (in some cases at a somewhat increased cost) shouldWlook in the Far East become threatening.!
