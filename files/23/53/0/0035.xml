FOREIGN AFFAIRSAllied Occupa-fcion ofGermany.Disarmament ofGermany.Pre vi previous reference:Cabinet 61(26), Con-conclusion 3.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet full particulars of the recent discussions at Geneva which had led up to thedecision to withdraw from Berlin the Inter-Allied1STCommission of Control on January 31st next, and 4sthe adoption of an agreed scheme of investigation by the League of Nations which wouldbe kept readyto be put in operation when any of the partiesdesired.    Up to now there had been wide differences of opinion on this  subject, but, as a result of the conferences at Geneva, and more especially of thehelpful attitude of M. Briand, a scheme had now beenadopted which was acceptable to the Germans no less,than to the French and the other ex-Allies.M. Briand had waived the previous French insistencethat the League should keep an organisation ofobservation permanently in the Rhineland, and had escaped from hie country&apos;s previous attitude by saying that France had always recognised that this could be accomplished by agreement only.   He had intimated, however, that if there could be somepermanent element of observation in the Rhinelandit might perhaps accelerate the withdrawal of theAllied Armies of Occupation, and had hinted that even Consuls might be sufficient.    Sir austen chamberlain had then suggested to I)r Stresemannthat the organisation might be a mutual one forsecuring the demilitarisation of the Rhinelandagainst intrusion fro v. either side, and M. Briandhad not opposed this.   The conception then was thatsome such arrangement might form a complement tothe Locarno Treaties, and that a German repsssentati^might be associated in an organisation for watching-1-
both frontiers of the Rhineland.   Sir austen chamberlain had then taken the initiative indeprecating any -further step at this juncture.He had wished to avoid promoting excessive hopes,such as had resulted in disappointment after theThoiry conversations.   At present, therefore, thiswas only an idea which might fructify in the mindsboth of the general public and of the Governmentsof the countries concerned.The more immediate question of terminating theInter-Allied Commission of Control had raisedgreater difficulties, but eventually it had beenagreed that the Inter-Allied Commission should be withdrawn   not, as first proposed, on February 1stbut on January 31st, which Dr Stresemann hadpreferred for the reason that (as at once noted byM. Briand)  it was the anniversary of the evacuation of Cologne.       ^Sir Austen Chamberlain then described how,after 99 out of the 101 outstanding points existing in March, 1925, had,  one after the other, been settled, two difficulties still remained when theCouncil roet at Geneva, namely^ in regard to thedisarmament of the fortress of Eoenigsberg and the*manufacture of material which might be used either for civil or military purposes.    These questionshad been in the hands of the Ambassadors Conferencein Paris.    The Foreign Ministers of the powers concerned present at Geneva had sent instructionsto their respective representatives both on the ambassadors Conference and on the Control Commissionin Berlin, to settle these points before the endof the week, and at first all had gone well.
At the end of the week, however, General Paweltz,the Geaman liaison officer with the military commission of.Control^ who had at first adopted a conciliatory attitude with the Conference of Ambassadors-dors, had suddenly become rather obdurate, with theresult that an impasse had been reached. In orderto arrive at a settlement the foreign ^gh ministers concerned had postponed their departure from Genevauntil Sunday night, and great numbers of ines sageshad passed between       Briand and Paris and betweenDr Stresemann and Berlin, and in both of theseCapitals many Cabinet Meetings had been held.Sir Austen Chamberlain had himself been placed in an embarrassing position by the receipt of information at the vary end of the Conference to the effect thatthe Alli9d case on the question of war material was not entirely water-tight in the event ofarbitration, but in the end he had been given a freethehand to do his best.   BathfBritish, and French WarOffices had apprehended the &amp;&amp;ig&amp;s of accumulation of stocks of munitions of war (which, as theSecretary of War afterwards explained to the Cabinet,included large numbers of jigs and gauges whichcould be alleged as required for commercial purposesbut were equally available for the production ofmilitary material) .   Dr Stressmann had, however,given an emphatic undertaking that there should beno accumulations.As regards the question of Koenigsberg, theTreaty of Versailles had laid down (Article 180)&quot;The system of fortified works of the Southern and eastern frontiers of Germany shall be maintained inits existing stats&quot;.

At the snd of the week, however, General Pawelta^the German liaison officer with the military commission of.Control^ who had at first adopted a conciliatory attitude with the Conference of Ambassadors-dors, had suddenly become rather obdurate, with theresult that an impasse had been reached. In orderto arrive at a settlement the Foreign ministers concerned had postponed their departure from Genevauntil Sunday night, and great numbers of messageshad passed between M* Briand and Paris and betweenDr Stresemann and Berlin, and in both of theseCapitals many Cabinet Meetings had been held,.Sir Austen Chamberlain had himself been placed in an embarrassing position by the receipt of information at the very end of the Conference to the effect thatthe Allied case on the question of war material was not entirely water-tight In the event ofarbitration, but In the end he had been given a freethehand to do his best,   BorthfBritish, and French WarOffices had apprehended the daig^r of accumulation of stocks of munitions of war (which, as theSecretary of War afterwards explained to the Cabinet,included large numbers of jigs and gauges whichcould be alleged as required for commercial purposesbut were equally available for the production ofmilitary material) .   Dr Stressmann had, however,given an emphatic undertaking that there should beno accumulations.As regards the question of Koenigsberg, theTreaty of Versailles had laid down (Article 180)&quot;The system of fortified works of the Southern and eastern frontiers of Germany shall be maintained inits existing state&quot;.   The Germans had assumed that
this entitled them to keep those fortresses in acorresponding state of preparedness to what had then existed, and had accordingly for six years been constructing various new works to keep Koenigs-berg up to date.that they could only be maintained in precisely the same state as before, without being kept up todate.    The French.but Dr Stresemannhad insisted that the Germans had no offensive ideas and only contemplated the fortresses in theirdefensive capacity.   Dr Stresemann&apos;s statement   /fcc-jprovided a basis for renewed negotiations.Eventually it had been arranged that if thesetwo questions could not be settled by agreementthey should be brought before the Council of theLeague.    Sir Austen Chamberlain warned the Cabinetthat,  in this event, it might be necessary to obtain a legal interpretation of the Treaty, which might involve  reference to the Itaigwo Court of InternationalJustice/. the Secretary of State for War explained to theCabinet the dislike that the War Office had felt togoing into arbitration on a question on which theAllied position was open to doubt, and,in congratulate-lating the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on his successful use of the discretion wMch hadbeen given him, expressed the hope that, if possible,arbitration should be avoided.The Cabinet generally approved theattitude of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.-4r-
(previous cms reference:Cabinet 43(26),  Con-clusion 6.)2. The question was raised of the present difficulties between Italy and Yugoslavia in regardto Albania, and attention was called in particular to the statement in telegram No. 420,  from Mr Phipps,Paris, to the effect that, in view of the reasons give by M. Nincic for resigning,  M. Mussolini couldinot admit either the accession of Yugoslavia to the pact of Tirana or the conclusion by her of asimilar pact with Albania.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssummarised the information he had received on thesubject.    He felt that -what might have been settledeasily at the beginning had no1.? become more difficult,owing largely to  the mutual suspicions which Italyand Yugoslavia entertained of one another&apos;s policy,however ill-founded these suspicions might be.Whatever the state of Italy might be, the internalcrisis In Yugoslavia was even more serious, and this did not make matters easier.^   Sir Austen Chamberlainhimself felt convinced that M. Mussolini had noagaressive intentions, and it would not be worth hiswhile to break his word to Great Britain in thisrespect.   What M. Mussolini desired was the integrity of Albania, but he also felt that Italy had special interests in the Balkans, which wore near neighbours.Sir Austen described the many influences that hadbeen at work at Geneva to ease the situation.    Onthe whole, he was not inclined to anticipate seriousconseauences./j
3. The question was raised as to whetheradvantage might not be taken of the appointment ofa successor to the late M. Krassin as the diplomaticrepresentative of Soviet Russia in London to obtainat least an assurance that the overt hostilitiesof the Soviet towards this country should dease.said that the Soviet Government did not(i intend atpresent to  appoint a fresh representative, but would for the present entrust their representationpolicy towards Russia must be one to be kept underdaily observation.Reference was made to the remarks by the PrimeMinister on the subject to a Parliamentary Deputationwhich had waited on him on the previous day .In the discussion which followed, reference was made to the difficulty of securing evidence which could be used in regard to the hostile activi-ties of the  Soviet representatives in this country,and stress was laid on the inter-relation between this question and the political situation in thiscountry.The Cabinet agreed  That the development of the situationin all its aspects should be carefully watched by the Ministers concerned,and considered afresh after the recess .The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairstoThe whole question of
CHINA * 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Atrairspointed out that although the Nationalist Government(previous previous reference: of fowigrjCqpii had in appearance a Bolshevist complex-Cabinet 64(26), Con-     ion, there was no evidence that it was fundamentallyelusion 1.)Bolshevist in character.    It was not unlikely thatits Bolshevist proclivities were due to the factthat the Soviet Government was the only quarter-Prom which they had been able to obtain any help.He appealed to his colleagues,  therefore., in public statements to avoid saying anything which would suggest that the Nationalist Government of Cantonwas  inevitably Bolshevist in character.
CHINA,Naval andMilitary Re-inf or cements ,(previous o-usReference:Cabinet 64(26), Con-elusion 1.)5. The Cabinet further considered the questionof naval and military reinforcements to China.They were informed that the Admiralty had already sent in the aggregate to that Station three addi-tional Cruisers, a flotilla of Destroyers, and an aircraft Carrier.Reference was made to the earlier reoommenda-tion of the Chiefs of Staff Committee in favour ofan increase in our military forces in the Par East(C.I.D. Paper No.617-B, confirmed by C.I.D. PaperN0.677-B, both attached to Paper CP.-164 (.26)).Attention was drawn to a telegram from Peking,No.516, forwarding the views of the Commandant ofthe Shanghai Volunteer Corps %n regard to the needfor large reinforcements incase of troxible at shangai, and other evidence of great nervousnessamong the foreign communities on the Yangtse.    TheCabinet !?er8 informed, however, that the int-er-national forces at Shanghai already numbered approx-imately 4,000.    The general view of the Cabinet wasthat, having regard to the rapid changes in thesituation in China and the time taken for reinforce-rcents to arrive, there should be no delay in taking a decision in the matter.    It was also felt thatlanding-parties were more important than ships, andthat from this point of view Cruisers would be more valuable than Destroyers, both as a means of pro-tecting any foreign settlements that might be threatened and to reassure the British population.After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed  
NAVAL REINFORCEMENTS -    That theAdmiralty should&apos; make the followingdispositions(i) In addition to H.M.S. ENTERPRISE,which was on her way, H,M,S. EMERALDshould be sent from the East Indiesto tha China Station, and a thirdCruiser should also be sent fromthe nearest Station from which one could be spared:(ii) The two Gunboats at Malta shouldbe got ready and sent to the china Station as soon as possible:(ill) A flotilla of Destroyers (v&amp;ek&amp;h.&amp;^u4yd-^0t-bo ready to leisvo MaltaT^Soa^e^petesaaa^y) should be ordered to get ready but should not be despatched without further orders.(b) MILITARY REINFORCEMENTS.    That, on theunderstanding that an Indian Battalioncould be sent in case of emergency at short notice from Hong-Kong to Shanghaior elsewhere as needed without waiting for relief, the War Office should make arrangements for a British Battalion tobe sent from Gibraltar to Hong-Kong.Notwithstanding that a Battalion from gibraltar would take two months ascompared with one month for a battalion from India, this plan was preferredas being a much more economical arrange-ment and one with which the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff wafe under-stood to be in agreement.The general view was that it would be inadvisable to make an announcement ofthese reinforcements, but that theinformation should be allowed to leakout as the moves become known in theordinary way.
6.  The Cabinet resumed thv-Ir discussion onthe Third Report of the Legislation Committee,which covers a draft Bill (Paper C.P.-406 (36)),and an accompanying Memorandum by the LordChancellor (Paper C.P.-407 (.26)).Without taking any decision on the questionsof principle contained in tbe Report of theLegislation Committee, the Cabinet agreed&apos;- (a) That the Trade Disputes Act andTrade Unions Bill should be revisedon the basis of the majority report on the following heads:-(i) Amendment of the Trade disputes act (paragraph 5 of Report);(ii)  The Optional Ballot (para-graph 6 of Report);(iii) Th/&apos; political levy fparagraph12 of Report);(iv) The separation of the assets of the provident funds (para-graph 13 of Report);(v)  The extent to which members&quot;&quot;expelled from their Unionsshould be entitled to a refundof the surrender value of theirprov id ---nt c ontribut ions^paragraph 14 of Report).(b) That Parliamentary Counsel should beauthorised to confer with the Depart-ments concerned regarding various questions of detail a3?ising on theBill, with a view to the preparationof a revised dra^t for the cons id era-tion of the Cabinet early in 1927.(c) That the Ministervof Labour should circulate to the  Cabln-t figuresfor the various Trades Unions shoeinghow far members have contracted-out ofthe politic 1 levy under existinglegis la tion/.
OO-PARTNERSFIPIN INDUSTRY.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(26)    Con-cTusion 2(e) .)7.. The Cabinet had before&apos; them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in regardto Co-partnership in Industry (Paper CP.-404(26)).The subject was discussed at some length.,but no-decision of principle was taken.    TheCabinet were informed that Sir Arthur Balfour*sCommittee   on   Industry and trade would be rendering its Final Report within thenext few w-o-eko, and this should provide some further material on profit-sharing and kindredsubjects.The President of the Board of Trade under-took to circulate a Memorandum in regard to theposition of Company Law in relation to profit-sharing, and more particularly as to whether theexisting law offered any obstacle to the transferof property from the present holders in companies for the development of profit-sharing schemes.2 , Whit ehal 1 Gardens , S .W. 1,December 15, 1926.
