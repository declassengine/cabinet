1. The Cabinet had before them a draft Note,prepared in the Foreign Offioe, to be sent by-Lord Lloyd to Zaghloul Pasha notifying the latterthat his assumption of office would render impos-sible friendly co-operation between the Britishand Egyptian Governments, as well as the fulfil-ment of the responsibilities of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment under the Declaration of 1922 for thesecurity of the lives and interests of foreignresidents in Egypt.They also had before them telegram No. 256from Lord a Lloyd on the subject of the abovec oramunic ation.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsnotified the Cabinet of the receipt of a telegramfrom Lord Lloyd (No.260, of June 1st)  suggesting the omission from his communication to Zaghloul,in regard to the recent murder trial, of thefollowing words:-&quot;until relevant documents areavailable for their consideration&quot;,on the ground of the voluminous character ofthese documents, and his own telegram No.191,also of June 1st, concurring in the omission ofthese words;    as well as telegrams just receivedfrom Lord Lloyd notifying the objections of theFrench and Italian Ministers at Cairo to theassumption of power by Zaghloul Pasha and their intention to advise their respective Governmentsaccordingly.Burin? the Me-ting further telegrams were received from Lord Lloyd in regard to the natureof the assurance to be given by him to JudgeKershaw, and asking for the despatch of a Battle-ship to Alexandria.
5 bAfter a discussion of the draft Note toZaghloul and of the various telegrams referredto above,  in the course of which certain amend-ments were accepted by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign A^airs, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the draft Note attached in the Appendix:(b) That the telegram forwarding thedraft Note to Lord Lloyd shouldbe preceded by a covering tele-gram stating that the Note hadbeen drawn up with the object of presenting the whole case shortlyand clearly in a single document:that all references therein toLord Lloyd&apos;s conversations withZaghloul Pasha were subject tohis concurrence, and asking lord lloyd to notify the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs of any alterations he wished to make:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be author-ised to give an undertaking toLord Lloyd to the effect that,since Judge Kershaw intended to resign, Mis Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould undertake that he shouldnot be worse off than at present,&apos;.vhen the emoluments of any newpost he might receive werebalanced against those of his present post:(d) That the First Lord of theAdmiralty should arrange for theimmediate despatch of a Battleshipto Alexandria.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconsulted his colleagues as to whether,  in presetcircumstances, it was advisable for him to attencthe forthcoming meeting o^ the Co\mcil, whichwould involve his leaving London on Saturdaynaxt, June 5th, for several days.   His neglectto attend might qive the impression in Egyptthat TTis Majesty&apos;s Government were alarmed atthe situation there.    On the other hand, he was particularly desirous of meeting M. Briand, ifnot at Geneva at any rate in Faris on his return journey,  in order to discuss the question of limitation of armaments and other subjects,and the questions for consideration at theCouncil werA such as to justify his attendance.vVhile recognising that events in Egyptnight conceivably take an untoward turn duringthe next week or two, the Cabinet agreed  That it was in the public interest that tha Secretary of State for &quot;Foreign Affairs should attend theforthcoming meeting of the Council&apos;at  Geneva.
S. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he thought it right to inform the Cabinetthat he had received some information which indicated the possibility that before very longthe political situation in France might necessi-tate a Coalition Government,  in which case itwas not improbable that M. Poincare and M. Briandmight come together.    This might tend to strengthenFrench military opposition to M. Briand&apos;s con-ciliatory policy towards Germany and especially to a reduction of the garrison in the- Rhineland,which at the present time was indefensibly large and the reduction of which Sir Austen Chamberlainwas anxious to bring about.    Sir Austen did not,however, anticipate that it would affect the broad lines of recent French foreign policy.
GOAL STRIKE(previous reference:Cabinet 31(36), Con-clusion 4.)4. The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had very little to say in regard to theCoal situation.   All negotiations were broken off and there was a complete deadlock.    The Debate inthe wouse of Commons on the previous day had not done much to help the situation.A short discussion on the subject then tookplace, in the course of which the Cabinet were informed by the Secretary for Mines that most ofthe Bills required to implement the Government&apos;s share of the recommendations of the Report of theCoal Commission were either actually in draft andunder consideration by the appropriate GovernmentDepartments or also in the hands of ParliamentaryDraftsmen.    If a Bill suspending, the 7-hours day -should eventually be required, its preparationwould present no difficulties.The possibility.;/ of some measure of subsidyor Government assistance being required in the .eventual settlement was not contested, notwith-standing that this was contrary to the recommenda-tion of the Report of the Coal Commission, but itwas suggested that, in the event of a demand forsuch assistance,  the Government should avail themselves of the opportunity to got rid of theproposal in the Coal Commission&apos;s Report in regardto  the purchase of royalties .The Prime Minister undertook to consult the Cabinet on the subject at. the appropriate moment.The Cabinet agreed.  That, the Board of Inland Revenue andthe Mines Department should considerthe possibility of assisting amalgama-tions of coal mines by means of relief in Stamp Duty on the capital of new
combines, a proposal which, tbeCabinet were informed, was supported by tbe findings of tbe. Committee on Company Law

(86))., on the subject of the Importation ofForeign Coal.After careful consideration of the reasonsfor the importation of American and Continentalcoal respectively, the Cabinet approved thefollowing recommendations of the Supply andTransport Committee:-(a) That the Mines Department shouldbe authorised to buy and Import t .forthwith 800,000 tons of coal from the United States of Americaand Canada:(b) That no public announcement ofthis decision should be made until the Mines Department had concluded their contracts for purchase,  i,e,, for a periodof about one week:(c) That.in the announcement then made,it should, be emphasized that theo-e-al so. imported would be dispoocdoT ooiolj- tc^ small consumersengaged on essential services:(d)  That no general public declaration should be made in regard to pro-tection for the handling of coalimported by private importers,but that the Mines department should be authorised to give assurances to enquirers that pro-t-&quot;-ction would be forthcoming a,ndthat,  if any question wers raised in Parliament, a statement to  thesame effect should bs made:(e)  ^hat it should be left to theSupply and Transport Committeeto authorise the purchase andImportation of a further 800,000tons, if necessary,  at a later date .

11. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that on the previous day the Committee of Imperial Defence had received and discussed, at considerable length an interest-being verbal report from the Chancellor of the duchy of* Lancaster in regard to the recent meetingat Geneva of the Preparatory Commission for.Disarm-ament, and had.made a recommendation to the effectthat he (Sir Austen Chamberlain) should have a free hand, at the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil, to deal, on the lines of the discussion at the Committee of Imperial Defence, with certain questions which had been forwarded by the Prepara-tory Commission to that body.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterimpressed on the Cabinet the seriousness withwhich the question of the reduction and limitationof armaments was approached by the Delegationsof the nations represented on the PreparatoryCommission,  some of which, particularly that ofthe United Statss of America, were accompaniedby officers of high rank.   While expressing theutmost satisfaction with the technical competence of the Departmental Officers  attached to his ownDelegation, Lord Cecil asked his colleagues tocons id--r whether, at the future deliberations onthis subject, it would not be wise to attach moresenior Officers, who, on technical matters, wouldbe in a position to take decisions without refer-once to the home authorities.    In this he waswarmly supported by the Secretary of State, forForeign Affairs.
The S-ryice Ministers explained the greatdifficulty of sparing senior General staff officers for the comparatively long periodsinvolved in the work of international Comrois-sions on Disarmament, and the difficulty anddanger of authorising even senior Staff officers to take dec3s ions on technical matters ofimportance without reference to headquarters.The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to circulate the Minutesof the Committee of ImperialDefence to the Cabinet before their next Meeting.In the meanwhile,  the cabinet approved the free hand recommendedby the Committee of ImperialDefence to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to do his bestat the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil of the League of nations in accordance with the general lines of the discussion at theCommittee of Imperial defence on the previous day.2, Whitehall gardens .7/.1,June 2,  1926.
APPENDIX*EGYPT.Code telegram to Lord Lloyd,  (Cairo),Foreign Office, June 2nd 1926*     3.0 p*m.No.  195c     (R).Very UrgentoFollowing is text referred to In my immediately preceding telegram...Your Excellency,It is with, great regret that I find myselfconstrained to refer to the terms of the note which my predecessor addressed to Your Excellency onNovember 22nd, 1924,      In that note he referred to a campaign of hostility to&quot; British rights and Britishsubjects, not discouraged by Your Excellency&apos;sgovernment, and fomented by organisations In close contact with that government, and he showed that the then Egyptian government had proved Itself unable or unwilling to protect foreign lives.His Majesty&apos;s Government are most anxious to.see,  and have,  so far as the matter rested with them,taken every step in their power to ensure the restorationof parliamentary government in Egypt.      But whenthe recent elections resulted in a great majority for your Excellency and your supporters it became myimmediate duty to satisfy His Majesty&apos;s Government that your Excellency&apos;s intentions were such that your assump-tion of office-would not involve a return to thepolicy which had such disastrous consequences for egypt in 1924, and would consequently not prejudice the
discharge of those responsibilities which his majesty&apos;s Government have assumed under the declara-tion to Egypt of 1922, nor imperil public tranquillity,the security of life and the good relations of HisMajestyls Government and Egypt, all of which had sogrievously suffered during your previous tenure of office.In the conversation which recently took place between Your Excellency and myself I was unable tofind in Your Excellency^ statements any grounds onwhich I could reassure my government in this respect.I offered the friendly co-operation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment with such a government as you had a fewdays before authorised Adly Pasha to Inform me itwas your desire to see formed under his presidency.You declined this offer.I then enquired of Your Excellency whether you could offer any assurances in regard to suchmatters as respect for the status quo and the four points which His Majestyls Government reserved in1922 to their own discretion, pending their settle-ment by friendly agreement.     Your Excellency againdeclined and stated that you could give no assurances of any kind before assuming office.     His Majesty!sGovernment, you said, must place Implicit trust inyour intentions.It is impossible for His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto feel this confidence as to the future In the lightof the events of your last administration.I feel bound to add that the view taken by .the President of the Court of the judgment given Inthe recent murder trial increases the anxiety caused
by Your Excellency&apos;s past actions and present attitudelest the ordinary securities for the lives andliberties of foreigners in Egypt should be at themercy of party interests and the administration ofjustice Itself be tainted by political influences.His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot ignore thesedangers,  in view of the obligations which they have undertaken in regard to their own subjects and thoseof other countries in Egypt, and in regard to thesecurity of Egypt itself.      But Your Excellency has left no doubt that so far from co-operating with Hismajesty&apos;s Government in fulfilling these duties youreserve your freedom to pursue the same course which led Egypt under Your Excellency&apos;s guidance to thebrink of disaster in 1924.It Is impossible for His Majestyrs Governmentto run so grave a risk.      They are fully conscious that were they to do so they would be accused, andrightly so, of a dereliction of the duty they owe to egypt no less than to British and foreign interests inEgypt.I have therefore to inform you that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have regretfully come to the conclusion that your Excellency&apos;s assumption of office would renderimpossible friendly co-operation between the Britishand Egyptian governments as well as the fulfilment oftheir responsibility llties . under the declaration of 1922for the security of the lives and interests of foreignresidents in Egypt.
