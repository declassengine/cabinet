1. The Prime Minister informed the-Cabinet thatthe Coal Negotiations were still dragging on.    the conversations up to now had been &quot;unproductive, forthe reason that on Monday afternoon it had transpired that the Executive of the MinersFederation werenot entitled to instruct their.men to negotiatedistrict agreements on a basis involving more thana 7-hours day.    The Negotiating Committee of theTrades Union Congress General Council were .indignantwith the miners for taking this attitude.The present position was that the executive of the Miners&apos;   Federation had called a DelegateMeeting, and after that the negotiations wouldprobably be taken up afresh.In view of the reluctance felt at the pre-vious Meeting in authorising&apos; the Cabinet coal committee to proceed, if necessary, on the  assurap-tion that legislation will be introduced providingfor a review by a Central Appeal Tribunal of district agreements, the Cabinet were glad to learn that in the negotiations with the miners theGovernment representatives had been careful not to commit the Government finally in the matter, andthat,  in view o^ the attitude of the miners andminsowners, the Government were at present absolutelyuncommitted.On the  assumption that any kind of CentralAppeal Tribunal would be an independent arbitral tribunal and in no sense a negotiating tribunalincluding miners and mineowners as members,  theCabinet agreed  That if the Cabinet Coal Committeewas unanimously in favour of a&apos;   Central Appeal Tribunal, they should
have authority,  in their negotia-tions with the two parties, toproceed on the assumption that legislation would be introducedproviding for a review by such a tribunal of district agreements,but that if the Cabinet coal committee was not itself unanimouson the subject the matter Bhould he brought baok to the Cabinet.
IlSP during STRIKE.Iviousferer.ce:Oon-lsion 2.)2. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (Paper O.P.-374 (26))  pointing out that the legality of therelief which Pariah Councils in Scotland have givento the dependants of miners, in accordance withadvice issued in a Government Circular, is beingchallenged in the Court of Session, and raising thequestion of what action the Government should take in the event of a decision by the Court that relief is illegal.    In this Memorandum it was proposed to legalise not only the relief that has been or may begiven in the present dispute,  but also to make somesimilar provision.for the Immediate future, namely,until May 15, 1927,(which is the date of expiry ofthe Poor Law Emergency Provisions (Scotland) Act,1921, under which relief is granted to the able-bodied unemployed) the position after that datebeing left for further consideration in the lightof the experience of the present strike.    It wasalso proposed in the Memorandum,  in order to meetthe criticism of those who object to the principleof the rate-payers being made to bear the burden of supporting the dependants of men who voluntarilyabstain from work,  that all relief given underthe Pill should be recoverable from the men them-selves as an alimentary debt.In the course of a short discussion theCabinet v/ere given to understand that there was apossibility of an appeal from the Court of session to the House of Lords, and it was felt advisable to postpone a decision until the position in thisrespect was clearer.Tbe subject wa3 left for inclusion in theAgenda for the next regular meeting of the Cabinet.
PBRIALStatus ofrnors-r-al fioucbat 55( Con-ion 4.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents:-A Memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council, giving, particulars of proposals made at a meeting ofthe Committee of th? ImperialConference on Inter-imperial relations in regard to the positionof Governors-General and the oon-naoted question of the representa-tion of tha British Government inthe Dominions  (Paper CP,-373 (36))&apos;,Correspondence between the Secretaryof State for &quot;Dominion Affairs and the governors-General of the dominions on the same subject (Paper CP.-379  (26)).No great objection in principle was raisedagainst the proposal that the channel of communica-tion between the British and Dominion governments should be direct Instead of through the Governor-General&apos;?; office, on the understanding that theGovernor-General is given copies of all inward andoutward telegrams of importance and kept fully informed of his Government&apos;s business.Mr Mackenzie King&apos;a proposal in favour of aBritish High Commissioner in Canada, as set forth inthe Lord President&apos;s Memorandum, was also felt to -deserve most-careful consideration, particularly sofar as the conditions of Canada are concerned, butthe Cabinet was also impressed by the strong argu-ments againsH&apos; this proposal presented in the tele-grams of the Governors-General of Australia andNew Zealand .As a preliminary.to a further discussion ofthese questions, the Cabinet asked the Prime Ministerand the Lord Chancellor to see the Prime Minister ofCanada, and, if they thought fit, the Prime Ministerof Australia, either together or separately as theymight  deem best,  in order to explain some of the
objections to trie proposal, and with a view to finding a solution acceptable to all.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 10,  1926.
