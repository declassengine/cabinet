IRAQ, POLICY.Negotiationswith Turkey.(PreviousReferents e:Cabinet 19(26), Con-clusion 5.)1.    The Cabinet bad before then draft ins true -tions to the British Ambassador at Constantinoplere gar di n g ne go that i ons with Turk ey , circ ula ted by direction of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (Paper CP.-201 (26)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecounted the various proposals which had beendiscussed in response to the new attitude of conciliation shown by the Turkish Government.The latest suggestion made by Sir Ronald Lindsaywas a 20 per cent, participation for 25 years inoil royalties,  or,  alternatively,  a capital paymentof from  300,000 to  500,000 as final extinctionof Turkey&apos;s interest in Iraq oil (ffloyoi^n Ofif-i^e&apos;Telegram No.77, of May 11th) .   This arrangement-appeared to the  Secretary of State much nore inour interest than any territorial cession;    itwould relieve us of certain burdens and anxieties inconnection with Iraq.    Further, the conclusiono^ a Treaty with Turkey would have a good effectamong Mohammedan peoples .Strong objection was taken to any arrarsge-ment which would  require thb capital sum to befound by the British Exchequer.    The Cabinet were,however,  informed by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies that  the Crown Agents could arrange to finance the transaction w it hoi) t recourse to theEstimates.    The advance would be secured on thegeneral revenue of Iraq and not merely on therevenue fro*r oil.
ISThe Cabinet agreed  (a) To. approve the draft telegram to theBritish Ambassador at Constantinople( Paper C .P.-201 (26)) , subject tothe following amendments:-(i) in para.2, so as to read&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare therefor? prepared toagree to  payment by Iraqof a sum from  300,000up to,  if necessary,  amaximum of  500,000&quot;, etc.:(ii) to omit para.3:-    &quot;For yourinformation, I would explain that incidence of cost between his Majesty&apos;s Government and iraq Government is still underdiscuss ion&quot; :(ill)  to &quot;make clear that the paymentof the lump sum was in lieu of,and not  in addition to, terri-torial cessions, and couldonly be admitted if it led tocomplete settlement o&quot;f out-standing questions between turkey and Iraq:(b)  That if this proposal is accepted,the Secretary of State for the colonies should arrange that the transactionshould be financed by the Crown agents and secured on the basis of the generalrevenues of Iraq.-2-
government servants ANDTHE REGENTSTRIKE.(previous previous reference.:Cabinet 89(36),  Con-conclusion 4.)2.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the treatment of establishedmen&apos; in the  service of the  Government who had taken part in the recent strike:-A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (Paper CP.-198 (26)):A further Note about EstablishedStrikers at Deptford, by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (Paper C.P.-200 (26)) .The Cabinet were generally agreed, that it was desirable to mark by some disciplinary action the gravity with which it regarded the conduct of thosefew established servants in the Admiralty who took. part in the strike,  and especially those who couldbe shown to have incited or intimidated others.It was pointed out that to make all offendersforfeit all their pension rights on readmissidnwould be unfair, and that some attempt should bemade to fit the penalty to each case.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To allow the hired men to cose backas and when employment can be found for them, with the exception of those,who instigated the  strike or usedintimidation:(b) ^o discharge finally the threeleaders who incited establishedservants to strike, if the FirstLord is fully satisfied with theevi.d-n.ee against them:(c) To discharge other established menac cor dim to rule,  readmit them under a r.e&quot;7 certificate, and make them forfeit some of their yearsof service for pension:
(d) To insist on readmitted men sighinga declaration that they have brokentheir contracts and that they under-take not to do 30 again:(e) To add a further section in their conditions of employment that theymust not take part in a strikeT( f)  That the four established men whoreturned to work after going out on strike should remain unaffected:(g) That the First Lord of the admiralty should keep in touch with theChancellor of the Exchequer in giving effect to the foregoing.CASE OF STRIKERAT WOOLWICH.The Secretary of State for War called attentionto the case of an established rate-fixer at Woolwichwho, at the time of his appointment, had signed anagreement to sever his connection with his TradeUnion and had not done so and had struck work inthe recent crisis.^he Cabinet agreed  That the rate-fixer should be discharged for breach of agreement.GOVERNMENTPRINTERS .The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the exchequer should review the position ofprinters employed in GovernmentDepartments,  in the light of therecent strike, with the object ofincreasing the number of establishedprinters.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 17,  1926.
