The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave theCabinet an account of negotiations he had conductedduring the two previous days with       Raoul Peret,the French Minister of Finance, who was leaving for France the same morning.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that Sir William Tyrrell, the permanent under-Secreta ry of State for Foreign Affairs,had recently spent a holiday in Italy, where he had had a conversation with M. Mussolini.The latter had spoken in terms of the highestregard for this country, which confirmed informa-tion reaching the Foreign Secretary from other sources.    In particular, M,Mussolini had expressed his appreciation of the manner in which theItalian delegates had teen treated by theChancellor of the Exchequer in the negotiationsfor the  settlement of the Italian Debt, whichhad proved a real contribution to  the good relations between the two countries.
3.. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled, to the Cabinet the perturbation whichhad been felt at first in France, Poland,Czechoslovakia and other Continental countriesin regard to the This so-German Treaty, which those countries had felt to be inconsistent with the Covenant and the Treaty of Locarno.He recalled that lie himself had taken a differ-ent view and had addressed a reasoned despatch to the British representatives with various governments, expressing  the view that the Russo-German Treaty contained nothing inconsistent with the Treaties mentioned.    The effect of this had been that. M. briand, disregarding the firstimpressions of the Q,uai d&apos; Orsay, had expressed general concurrence in his view, with, which m, Mussolini had also  concurred, while theForeign Ministers of Czechoslovakia and Polandhad also rallied somewhat towards his point ofview.   Recently  the question had been discussedinformally at Geneva between the jurists ofGreat Britain, France and Germany,    At thesediscussicns Herr Gauss, the German jurist, had given an explanation of a satisfactory characterof the events leading up to the Russo-GexraanTreaty,  full particulars of which had not yet reached the Foreign Secretary,    Sir austen chamberlain was satisfied., however, thatGermany intended to remain loyal to the neworientation of policy implied in her acceptanceof the Locarno Treaty, and this had been confirmed by the rejection of Herr Adenauerfor the post of Chancellor, on the ground thathe was not sound on the Locarno policy,
to which, he had previously declared himselfopposed (Lord D&apos; Aternon&apos;s telegram No .163) .
4.    The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that he hadalready circulated to them all the informationhe possessed on the subject of recent events in Poland.   For the moment he was oarrying on with Poland on the basis o^ &quot;relations de fait

n&apos;kf. GOVERNMENTHOSPITALITYFUND.previous reference:Cabinet 91(24), Con-elusion 3.)14. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised, as a matter of urgency, a question inregard to the issue of invitations at the costof the Government Hospitality Fund.   He recalled that when this Fund had been established it hadbeen hedged round with certain conditions, one ofwhich he understood was that the First&apos; commissioner of Works was to issue- each invitation.    Under thelate Government the Foreign Office King&apos;s BirthdayDinner had been revived and had been charged tothe Government Hospitality Fund.   The late foreign secretary, on the advice of his Office, had insisted that the invitations should be issued in the nameof the Foreign Secretary and not of the first commissioner of &quot;orks, who administered theGovernment Hospitality Fund, and this procedurehad been followed under the present Government.He raised as a matter of principle the questionof whether invitations should be issued in thename of the First Commissioner of Works or of theMinister at the head of the Department particularly concerned.The Cabinet agreed  That the  question should, in the a first instance, be examined in theTreasury, and that the Chancellorof the Exchequer should make aReport to  the Cabinet.
15.     The question was raised as to the-attitude to be adopted by the Government towardsthe o^ers,  reported in the Press,  of oonsider-able surrs of money from Soviet Russia as aoontribution towards the miners&apos;  strike.The Cabinet were informed that theEmergency Regulations  already Issued on thissubject had now lapsed.The Hone Secretary was considering whether he would be justified in refusing the contribution of foreign funds to a legitimatestrike.-.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,May 19,  1936.
18th May, 1926.My dear Monsieur Peret,As yon find it necessary to return to Paris tomorrow morning I take the opportunity of putting before you in a precise form the position which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentoccupy in the present phase of the debt negotiations.We take our stand upon the general basis of agreement reached in the negotiations which I had with Monsieur Caillauxin August last, namely, 62 annuities of  12% millions on the sole credit of France.    This was the basie accepted inprinciple by the French Government subject to a settlementof three outstanding questions.    In my view ovtr discussions at the present time should be directed sol3ly to the solutionof these questions.    I had agreed with Monsi^ir Caillaux thatin the event of France making an arrangement more favourable to the United States than that which we had agreed together,the British Government should be entitled to press for a pro-portionate augmentation of the  12^ millions standard annuities-ties.    As we do not consider that the Franco-American debtproposals now awaiting ratification are substantially morefavourable to the United States than those which I had agreed with Monsieur Caillaux,  this point does not arise.We have therefore in my view only to consider the threeoutstanding difficulties, viz. first:-   the scales of reducedpayments during the years preceding 1930;    this has been described in our talks  as either the &quot;echelle&quot; or the &quot;moratoriurn&quot;.   We suggested to Monsieur Caillaux certain figures in two alternatives, the second of which was related to certainadjustments in the payments to be made by the Bank of france to the Bank of England.    To these figures we still adhere.But I must make it clear that throughout my discussions withMonsieur Caillaux it was always understood that any diminutionin the payments to be made by France during these early years should be replaced by additional payments in later years, sothat the present value of the debt payments to be made by france 3hould not be less than the present value of 62 annuities-ties of  12% millions running evenly throughout.We do not anticipate that any difficulty will arise in anagreement about  the second point, i.e., transfers or postpone-ments in certain circumstances.    There remains what youdescribe as the &quot;safeguarding clause1&apos;.    I must draw attentionto the strong view which His Majesty1s Government have alreadyformally and&quot;publicly expressed upon this subject, and our willingness to reduce the payments for the settlement of the debt to standard annuities of  12^ millions was explicitlyconditional upon those annuities resting upon the sole credit of France and not beinp; in any way dependent on the receiptsderived by France from Germany unde-.- the Dawes Plan,    Theoriginal debt wa&apos;s contracted on the sole credit of Franceand we see no reason why the great reduction we have shownourselves willing to make should not have the same security.Our view has of course received confirmation from the factAPPE.ndty       tLETTER PROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXOHEQITTjitrTO THE FRENCH MINISTER Q? FINANCE.
A 9that the United States have refused to entertain any safeguard-ins clause and that the French Government has accepted this position.You then suggested that although our proposed agreement should contain no safeguarding clause yet some provision mightbe made by an exchange of letters or other form of record forthe contingency which we both regard as improbable of a seriousor total failure of the Dawes Plan.    In reply I have pointedout that I had no authority to modify the position adopted bythe Cabinet and communicated in writing to Monsieur Caillaux,but that if you cared to draft the kind of letter you had inmind, if the terms were acceptable and if our taking note ofsuch letter were the sole outstanding point of difference,  Iwould not refuse to submit this proposal to my colleagues inthe Cabinet.    We had some informal conversation upon the termsof such a letter and of the suitable reply which should be madeto it, and I undertook to let you have some suggestions inwriting.    I learned, however, that our experts were not yet inagreement on the outstanding points o^ the settlement and thatthere was even some disposition to call in question the mainprinciple of the 62 annuities o^  12^ millions on the solecredit of France. In these circumstances I feel that it willbe better in all our interests that the discussions betweenthe experts should make further progress before the subjectof any exchange of letters can be proceeded with even in themost tentative and non-committal form on either side,    I shall therefore leave the further discussion of this aspect until Ihave the pleasure of receiving you here again on your return,and with my best wishes and keen sympathy in your dischargeof so many difficult duties,Believe me,Yours most sincerely,(Signed) W.S. CHURCHILL.is ExcellencyMons i sur Raoul Pe re t.
