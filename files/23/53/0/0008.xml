owe GOAL The Prime Minister said that he had summonedqttUATION.this meeting of the Cabinet as a matter of urgencyPrevious in order to ask approval to the course of actionReference&apos;Cabinet 37 concerted on the previous day at meetings of the(26), Oon-lusicn 5.) Cabinet Committee on the Coal Industry.The Cabinet Committee had reached the conclu-sion that it was impossible to refrain at thepresent juncture from Government action of some kind.    They had therefore agreed that the PrimeMinister himself should announce,  in the course ofthe Debate that afternoon,  that the government intended to introduce a Bill to suspend the SevenofHours Act for a terny( probably five) years, whichwould enable eight hours to be worked.    They also,proposed the introduction of an &quot;omnibus&quot; Billembracing a number of the recommendations of theCoal Commission on the re-organisation of theindustry.    In announcing this, the Government wouldtake their stand on the proposals of a month ago(Paper CP.-202 (26)) .As regards mining royalties the Prime minister proposed to point out that a new situation had arisen since the Government accepted the Reportof the Coal Commission.    Neither of the parties tothe dispute had accepted the Report or the Govern-menfs proposals, and the strike had taken place.In consequence,  the Government considered themselvesentirely free in this matter.As regards the suspension of the Seven HoursAct, he proposed to point out that it was made clear in the Report that some sacrifice from theminers was necessary, &quot;and the Government hadconvinced themselves that the least onerous
sacrifice was in the direction of an increase inhours.   The reason why the Government had made no suggestion in this direction hitherto was thatthey had felt that they could not introduce legis-lation in regard to a lengthening of hours until they had assurances from, the owners that the con-cessions by the miners would be small.(At this point the Prime Ministerhanded round copies of CP.-239(26)  (Appendix) , which contains a statement of the assurancesaccepted by representatives ofthe Mining Association at a meetingthe previous afternoon with theSecretary of State for War, theMinister of Labour and theSecretary for Mines.)In the course of the discussion a number of amendments were suggested to the &quot;above statement,mainly with the object of making it unmistakeablyclear to the miners that there would be no reduction-tion in their wages below the minimum of 1921.It was pointed out that if substantial, alterationswere made in the draft statement the mine-owners would have to be asked to agree to them.The Cabinet approved the general lines of the policy proposed bythe Prime Minister and summarised above, and left the Prime minister himself to make such commentary ashe thought fit in order to make clear the precise significance ofthe mine-owners&apos;  assurances.tehall Gardens, S.W.1,June 15,  1926 . &apos;
[c RjUi&apos; APPENDIX. I239J262.G A B I N E T.THE    COAL    DISPUTE.Draft Statement to be made by the Prime minister when announcing the decision of the Government to legislate on Miners&apos; Hours.I have received positive assurances from the coalownershat, on the basis of ai   eight-hour day,  there are certain^districts, producing approximately 50 per cent,  of the outputf the country,  in which the men will be offered a continuanceof their existing wages for July, August and September.      Overore than half of the rest of the country the reduction asked,f one is asked at all,  will be something materially less thanthe 10$ drop that the offer already made by the owners on theight-hour basis contemplated as a maximum, and the men will,luring July, August and September,  be guaranteed that  wage.During this period the Government will press on with theirreorganisation legislation, and the owners,  for their part, willtake all possible steps to make effective such of the proposals)f the Commission as may be necessary to leave no ground forioubt that the men will get all that is due to them under the ages ascertainments.      After these three months the wages willce based on the ascertained proceeds of the industry in theordinary way,  October being based on July and August,  and it may reasonably be hoped that over a substantial portion of theindustry the wages rates may still be maintained if not actuallyincreased.      In any case, under the proposal already made by theowner::, they could not in any district fall below the 1921piniraum, which,  the owners point out, having regard to the changeln the G0st of living,  would now give a real wage 30^ highern at the time when it was agreed&apos;five years ago, and wouldJ861 the miners&apos; desire for a national settlement.
