jlOliWAY 1. The Minister of Transport informed the CabinetrRUSTEEthat the Railway   Association had approached him,through its Chairman, asking the Government for help in a difficulty in which they had become involved.   The Company mainly concerned was theLondon and North Eastern Railway, which, owing tothe loss of mineral traffic during the Strike,had sustained financial losses, with the resultthat if nothing was done this Railway company would not be able to pay the rats of 3 per cent.onits Ordinary Stock which is necessary to qualifythe Company&apos;s other securities to be rated asTrustee Stock.   This would be serious, not only for the Company immediately affected, but for theother Railway Companies as well. - The proposal ofthe Railway Association was that the Governmentshould, at the earliest possible moment, pass ashort Bill stating that, whether 3 per cent, hadbeen paid on the Ordinary Stock in 1926 or not,such dividend should be deemed to have been paid.Colonel Wilfrid Ashley, after suggesting otheralternatives, asked that a Cabinet Committee mightbe appointed to consider the question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that the Treasury view was strongly opposed to any action calculated to weaken the basis of trusteesecurity,  such as would be involved by special legislation to maintain the position of a singleRailway Company which had got into temporary -difficulties .The Cabinet agreed -That the questions raised by theMinister of Transport should beconsidered by the followingCabinet Committee:-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of Trade,The Attorney-General,The Minister of Transport,which should report to the cabinet at their next Meeting, with a viewto a public announcement being madeat an early date.
THE coal situation.fbe suggested&quot;Amnesty&quot; .(previous reference:Cabinet 61(86), Oon-clusion 1.)2.   The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that he had received a Private Notice question from the Leader of the Opposition in regard to theproposed &quot;amnesty&quot; to persons convicted for breaches of public order during the Strike.The Secretary of State for India, acting onbehalf of the Home Secretary, who was indisposed,gave the Cabinet particulars of the sentences whichhad been passed in regard to breaches of the peace,etc., during the Strike, which may be summarisedas follows:-(a) Oases dealt with by summary jurisdiction(i) under the Emergency Act(ii) under the ordinary lawTOTALOf these, 39 were due for release before Christmas.(b) At Assizes or Quarter Sessions,under the ordinary law of these, 10 were entitledto release before Christmas871810526.The Secretary of State for Scotland reportedthat in Scotland the number of sentences was 55,of which only 2 were made under the Emergency Act.The alternatives before the Cabinet were asfollows:-(l) To recommend a small remission ofthe term (say, a month) in the caseof each sentence:(2) To do nothing at alii(3) To draw a distinction between casessentenced by Courts of summary jurisdiction and those sentencedat the Assizes or Quarter Sessions,based on the ground that the majorityof the sentences in the formercategory were passed under emergency legislation and not under statute law.
The Cabinet agreed  That, in view of the dangerousprededent which would be estab-lished for the future if sentencespassed under the Emergency Actwere remitted in whole or in part,they could not agree to recommendany such remissions.    This decision,however, would not impair the discre-tion of the Home Secretary to re-consider oases where the circum-stances were exceptional.The Prime Minister was asked, in answering the leader of the Opposition, to avoid the use of theinapproprlate term &quot;amnesty&quot;.
bBGH ey theS5HT hon.irichards .Previousfarenoe:(atinet 1026), Con-conclusion   11.)3.   Arising out of the discussion summarised inthe previous Conclusion, the Attorney-Generalinformed the Cabinet that his attention had been drawn to Press reports of a speech made by theminers&apos; leader the Right Hon. Tom Richards, in whichhe discussed tbe recent trials and convictions atMonmouth.   Mr Richards was alleged to have described the proceedings as &quot;a travesty of British justice&quot;and to have stigmatised passages in the Judge&apos;eSumming-up as &quot;malicious lies&quot;.    Sir Douglas Hogghad been advised by the Director of Public Prosecu-tions that these statements amounted to contemptof Court and that a conviction could probably beobtained.    In view of the importance of protecting the Judicial Bench he himself was disposed to takeproceedings against Mr Tom Richards if the correctnessof the Press reports was confirmed by the ShorthandNotes.   Before taking his decision, however, he wished to know whether there were any political considerations which,  from the point of view of theCabinet, he ought to take into account.The Cabinet agreed - That there were no political consid-considerations which they would desire the attorney-General to take into account in forming his decision as to the expediency of prosecuting Mr Tom.Richards, but the hope was expressed that if Mr Richards (who is a PrivyCouncillor and hitherto highlyrespected) should show a properrecognition of the gravity of hisoffence,  the prosecution might not feelconstrained to press -for the severestpenalties.
,IBF DURING A. The Cabinet again had before them a -Memoran-dum by the Secretary of State for Scotland inregard to Poor Relief to Miners&apos; Dependants,covering a draft Poor Law Emergency Provisions(Scotland) Bill (Paper C.P.-374 (26)).The Secretary of State for Scotland informed the Cabinet that the Judgment of the Court of session would not be given until the following week.This would be too late for the legislation proposedin his Memorandum to be enacted in the present session.On his advice, the Cabinet agreed -That, in order to protect the treasury as far as possible against the demands which might be made upon them byParish Councils in Scotland in theevent of a decision by the Court of session that the relief given todependants of miners was illegal,the Secretary of State for Scotland,in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should draw up anannouncement that the government propose to legislate on the subject at the first opportunity.    Sir JohnGilmour was asked to keep in touchwith the Prime Minister with a viewto an opportunity being given forthis announcement to be made, ifpossible, in the House of commons during the present Session, but otherwise in some other manner.STRIKE.fsviousiferenc e:iinet 606), Con-lsion 3.)

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat the Government were doing their best toobtain the passage through the House of commons of all the legislation proposed for the present session.   Unexpected opposition, however, had been encountered in regard to some of the measures proposed, more particularly the Judicial CommitteeBill and the Indian and Colonial Divorce Bill.Mr Baldwin recalled that he had warned the Cabinetthat,if unexpected opposition arose, minor measuresmight have to be dropped (Cabinet 46 (26), Con-elusion 10) .The Cabinet were informed that, while itwas still desirable to press forward with theJudicial Committee Bill, its loss would not be so serious as might have been the case.   Lord Sinhaand Sir Lancelot Sanderson had joined the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council, which had slightlyeased the situation, and, in addition, there was some reason to hope that the Indian Legislaturemight adopt the original proposal for the appoint-ment of paid Judges.As regards the prorogation of parliament the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in the King&apos;s Proclamationfor Prorogation, provision shouldbe mads for the re-assembly ofParliament on February 8th:(b) That the Lord President of theCouncil should supervise theediting of a draft of the King&apos;sSpeech with a view to its con-sideration by the Cabinet early next week.
k LEGISLATIONfalTTEE.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(26), Con-clusion 11.)6. The Cabinet had before them, the following documents relating to Trade Union legislatlon:-The Third Report of the legislation committee, covering a draft of theTrade Disputes and Trade Unions Bill(Paper CP.-406 (26)):A Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Ex-( Paper CP.-365 (26)) : chequerA Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour-(Paper C.P.-394 (26)):A Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor(Paper CP.-407 (26)), suggestinga Clause for incorporation in theBill to amend the Trade disputes act, 1906.The Lord Chancellor gave an explanation ofthe draft Trade Disputes and Trade Unions BillClause by Clause, and drew attention to the decisiorsasked for in paragraph 17 of the Cabinet Committee^Report.A discussion of a preliminary character thentook place.There was general agreement in principle thatthe Cabinet desired that a General Strike should be declared illegal,  and that the abuse of the so-called&quot;peaceful picketing&quot; should be stopped, but no decisions were taken as to the legal method andlanguage by which these objects should be attained.A discussion followed in regard to thepolitical levy.After some further discussion the subject was adjourned with a view to consideration at a laterand, if possible, Special Meeting of the Cabinetdevoted only to this subject.
CHINA. 7.    The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinet that,  from a military point of view,(previous reference: he thought it desirable to send another white BattalionCabinet 61(26), Con-     from. India to Hong-Kong, where accommodation could; elusion 4.)be found.    Before taking action, however, he wishedIto know if there were any objections from the pointof view of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister said he would like to consult the Foreign Office before a decision wastaken..  .  .2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 8,  1926.
