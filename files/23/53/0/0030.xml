This proposal was,madein the hope of ending the stoppageby providing the Miners&apos; Federationwith some substitute for a national aggreement.   The Miners&apos;  Federationhave informed the Government thatthe proposal is not acceptable tothose whom they represent, and thedistrict negotiations now takingplace will, I hope, lead to an earlyend of the stoppage.

3.   With reference to the Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland on the subjectof Relief during the Strike (Paper 0.P.-374 (26)),the Secretary of State for Scotland informed theCabinet that no Judgment had yet been given bythe Court of Session.The subject was consequently postponed until the next Meeting of the Cabinet.
NEW HEBRIDES. 4. The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and for the Colonies reported to the Cabinet thatpreviousReference: the French Government had declined to considerCabinet 68(21), Appen-     the px-proposals made to them as the result of andlx I (13)) .inquiry by a Committee of the Imperial conference for a partition of the New Hebrides.   The reasonfor this was that the French had succeeded in placing themselves In a favourable economic posi-tion by the importation of Indo-Chinese labour,which the British settlers were not permitted todo, as well as by allowing recruitment within the islands under a less rigid system than was permitted to the British settlers.   He had accordingly arranged with the Prime Ministers ofAustralia and New Zealand that the latter should send immediately representatives to form aCommission with the British High Commissioner ofthe New Hebrides, with the following terms ofreference:-To report \upon the position ofBritish settlers in the New Hebrides,with special reference to any disad-vantages under which they may be work-ing in comparison with French settlers:In particular to consider(i) the provision of an adequate supply of labour for Britishsettlers from any sourceswithin or outside the Groupfrom which such labour may beobtainable:(ii) any further measures to assistBritish settlers in the produc-tion and marketing of their crops:and to indicate what financialassistance, if any, would berequired from Government, whetherby loan or otherwise, for carryinginto effect any recommendations which the Commission may make.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs andfor the Colonies had made it clear to the Prime
Ministers of Australia and New Zealand that hecould not possibly assent to the importation intothe New Hebrides of labour from outside withoutobtaining the assent of the Cabinet.The Cabinet -approved the action ofthe Secretary of State for :&apos;   DominionAffairs and for the Colonies., and moreparticularly his association of repre-sentatives of Australia and New zealand in the new Commission, since it was felt that any possible proposal forthe importation of outside labour would be easier to defend if it was supported by the Government and by public opinion in Australia and NewZealand.
AST ARCTIC. 5.   Inquiry was made at the Cabinet as tothe meaning of the passages in the Report of theImperial Conference dealing with the Antarctic.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs stated that the action contemplated wasnecessary in order to avoid the ruin of the whalingindustry, since it was only by taking steps toensure control by means of licences that thismisfortune could be averted.-7

0 LAW 7.    The Cabinet had before them the followinjjOBM. -,documents relating to Poor Law Reform: -&amp;rants.A Memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (Paper CP,-389 (26))pointing out that the provisionalproposals for the reform of the poor Law, the issue of which wassanctioned by the Cabinet last december, had been the subjectof discussion, by correspondenceand interview, with the Associa-tions representing the various classes of Authorities, and have,as a result, undergone modificationand elaboration;    setting forth his proposals in their present form; and asking the sanction of the cabinet for the drafting of a Bill to be passed into law during the next session of Parliament:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper CP.-395 (26))urging that the proposals in theMinister of Health&apos;s memorandum should, if proceeded with, beaocompanied by&apos;the.adoption ofa complete scheme of block grants for local services, a subject whichis now under consideration by an inter-Departmental Committee:A further Memorandum by the Ministerof Health (Paper CP.-396 (26)) urging that, if the Cabinet decides to proceed on the lines suggested by the Chan-cellor of the Excheqxier,  (i) it mustbe an instruction to the Bars towCommittee that a block grant formulais to be found, and (ii) that it isto report to the Cabinet in a fort-night from the date of the cabinet discussion:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Education (Paper CP.-398(26))  expressing the view that itis now too late to introduce legis-lation for putting in force blockgrants for Education and other ser-vices concurrently with block grants in respect of Health and assignedrevenues;    and advocating an interimexperimental period of three years during which legislation would beintroduced separately for the estab-lishment of block grants for health services and assigned revenues, and,as far as possible, for Education,with a view to the establishment,at the end of the period, of a unifiedblock grant system, if found practi-cable, for a period of 5 or 7 years.8&apos;,rj.0U3jjference:fjbinet 50(25), Oon-conclusion   a.)
The Minister of Health did not ask for any decision by the Cabinet at this Meeting.    he explained his proposals in considerable detail,and a short discussion took place.The Prime Minister mentioned that he hadreceived an important letter from the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries on tha subject, butas the discussion was not completed he did notread it to tha Cabinet.The subject was recognised to require carefulconsideration from the political standpointno less than from that of the advantages of theproposed simplification in the Poor Law.The Minister &quot;of Health undertook to considerthe possibility of including among his proposals the establishment of some national tribunal tosettle disputed paIsii-feT^ with a view to avoidingunnecessary litigation.Caveats were entered by the Home Secretary inregard to the need of providing,in any scheme ofgeneral block grants, that Local Authorities shouldnot unduly cut down the Police in order to providefor other services;    and by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland in regard to the peculiar difficultiesof the subject in Scotland.With a view to the assembly of all the informs-tion required to enable them to deal with thesubject, and without prejudice to any question ofprinciple, the Cabinet agreed  That Sir George Barstow&apos;s Committeeon Slock Grants should be asked towork out a scheme for a generalblock grant to cover all servicesfexcept roads) and to present aReport within, a fortnight of thepresent date.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland (paper cp .-388 (26)) giving particulars of progressof the Steel Houses Scheme and stating that,after careful consideration, he had come to theconclusion that a fresh order by the State for steel houses would not be justified exeept onthe ground of relief of unemployment.The Secretary of State for Scotlandexplained that, since circulating this Memorandum,he had had further conversations both withcolleagues and with those engaged in producingthe houses,, and he had now modified his view and would ask the Cabinet to authorise him tocontinue his conversations and to prepare a schemeof contracts with a view to continuing the produc-tion of houses in 1927 on the same scale as inthe present year.Impressed by the value of steel houses,more especially as a means of preventing a risein the cost of ordinary houses, the cabinet approved this proposal in principle and agreed  That the Secretary of State forScotland should proceed accordingly,unless difficulties arose with theChancellor of the Exchequer, inwhich case the subject should be-brought back to the Cabinet.
