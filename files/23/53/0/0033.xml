2,. The Cabinet bad before them the Report of aCabinet Committee (Paper CP.-405 (26)) appointedto consider a Memorandum (whioh is appended to theReport) by the Home Secretary., containing proposals,arising out of receht discussions with the NorthernIreland Ministers   on the King&apos;s Title, relative to the title of Parliament .The Cabinet approved the following recommend-ations contained in the Report of the Cabinet Com-mittee:-(a) To approve the following proposals contained in the Home Secretary&apos;sMemorandum -   -(1) That the Title &quot;Parliament ofthe United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland&quot;should be substituted for thepresent Title of Parliament.(2) That the change of Title shouldbe effected by Act of Parliament.(3) That the change of Title shouldbe made in the same Act whichwill authorise the issue of a proclamation altering the King&apos;title .(4) That the same Act should provide -(i) That notwithstanding anythingcontained therein, the Parlia-ment shall be deemed to be forall purposes the same Parlia-ment;    and(ii) That in all future enactmentsreferences to the &quot;UnitedKingdomv shall, except whenthe context indicates thecontrary, be interpreted as meaning Great Britain andNorthern Ireland.(b) To authorise the Home Secretary toarrange for the preparation of a Billfor the consideration of the Home AffairsCommittee.(c) That at least two months&apos; notice shouldbe given to the Treasury of the date on which the change of the term &quot;UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland&quot;is to take effect.
3.    The attention of the Cabinet was Galled,as a matter of urgency, to a telegram despatchedfrom Shanghai by Mr Lampson, the British Ministerat Peking, No.41, dated, December 8th, in which heemphasized the moral effect of the display of naval force as the best preventive of trouble and statedthat the mere announcement that reinforcements -were coming would have a salutary and restrainingeffect.The First Lord of the Admiralty reported thatgunboats were the only naval force that was of any value for the present conditions on the Yangtse Kyang,as, owing to the lowness of the water, even destroyerswould not be able to go up the river to Hankow for two or three months.    Two gunboats at Malta werebeing prepared but would not be ready until February.In addition, H.M.S. ENTERPRISE had been ordered toproceed from the East Indies to the China Station.The First Lord had left to Sir William Tyrrell theform of any announcement to be made in regard to naval reinforcements .The view was expressed that, having regardto the smallness of the naval reinforcements, itwould be advisable merely to state that furthernaval reinforcements would be sent, without givingdetails .The general opinion of the Cabinet was thatit would be advisable to send further reinforcements to the China Station, including some Destroyerswhich would be available to proceed, up the riveras soon as there was sufficient water, the mereannouncement of which, according to Mr Lampson&apos;aview as quoted above, would in the meanwhile have a useful effect.
A short discussion then took place inregard to the proposal of the Secretary of Statefor War tors end a British Batta.lion from India to hong-Kong,    The Cabinet were informed that thecost of this move might amount to an increase of 200,000 in next year&apos;3 Estimates, since, on itsleaving India, the full charge ol the Battalionwould fall upon War Office Estimates.    It wassuggested that, even after allowing for transport charges, the total cost might be reduced byreplacing the Battalion sent to Hong-Cong by a battalion from home,  the cost&quot; of which would beborne by the Government of India.The Secretary of State for   War   was askedto look into this aspect of the question, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for India.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That additional naval forces, including some Destroyers, should be sent to the china Station:(b) That the question of sending an addi-tional English Battalion from Indiato Hong-Kong should be reserved untilthe Foreign Secretary could be present:(c) That in the meanwhile the Secretaryof State for ?ar, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for India,should examine into the most economicalmeasures possible for an increase inthe garrison of Hong-Kong if approvedby the Cabinet.
fjfiG-Fr POLICE 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySCOTLAND)mi, the Secretary of State for Scotland covering adraft Burgh Police (Scotland) Bill and asking for authority for the introduction of the Bill (paper c.P..-411 (26)) .The Secretary of State for Scotland informed his colleagues that, he aid not ask the Cabinet to commit themselves to passing this Bill in the coming session, tut merely for authority to have the &quot;Billprinted and circulated.On this vindarstanding  the  cabinet approved the introduction of theBill attached to Paper CP.-411 (25) .
PAY OP THEFIGHTINGSERVICES .Cadet Fees .(previous reference:Cabinet 16(25), Con-conclusion 4,)5. The Cabinet had before them a Report by theCabinet Committee on the Pay of the Fighting services on the subject of Cadet Pees (Paper CP.-413 (26)).After some-: discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee on the Pay of the FightingServices on the subject of Cadet Pees(Paper C.P.-413 (26)),. the Conclusionsof which are summarised in the report as follows:-*(l)  That the War Office and the AirMinistry should both adopt theprinciple according to whichreductions in fees should onlybe granted where they are justified by the pecuniary circumstances ofthe parents of the entrant, subjectto the reservation that a limitedpreference may be given, whether as regards standard or reduced fees,in the case of the sons of officersand other ranks of the three Services.(2) The War Office should be directed to prepare a scheme on the abovebasis for consideration by theCommittee.(3) The number of Prize Cadetshipsawarded by the Air Ministry may beincreased from 3 per annum to 12per annum forthwith, on the existingbasis, provided that this increase will not prejudice the- possiblerevision of the system of fees onthe basis of Recommendation (l)&quot;.(b) That the Cabinet Committee should meet again before Christmas, with a repre-sentative of the Treasury, and shouldhave power to decide, unless the Treasuryobject, on the following proposals putforward by the Secretary of State for w?ar: -(i) That the scale for Cadet Feesexisting today should not be altered until another scheme has been substituted:(ii) That the 40 additional scholarshipsasked for by the Secretary of Statefor -Var should be approved.
