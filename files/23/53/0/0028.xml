1. The Cabinet authorised the immediate intro-duotion in the House of Lords of a Poor Law Con-solidation Bill, prepared by the Minister of Health,on the understanding that if the Bill was likely to involve serious discussion Parliamentary time couldnot be found for its passage before Christmas.
2.    The draft of a Bill to give effect to  theMemorandum of Settlement of the mining dispute   adraft which had teen approved at a meeting of theCabinet Coal Committee held at 6 p.m. on the previous evening   was handled round at the outset of theMeeting (Paper CP.-38? (26)) .    There was also handed round an additional Clause, which was not included inthe original Bill but which it was explained had beenprepared with a view to insertion in the Bill if theOwners were unwilling to work the mines in accordancewith the terms of settlement.    The Cabinet were informed, however, that the Secretary for Mines had arranged to see the mineowners the same afternoonwith a view to impressing on there the desirabilityof securing such agreements in all districts as would render unnecessary recourse to compulsorymeasures by the Government, but with authority to notify the mine-owners that, &quot;failing a satisfactoryassurance from them,  the Government would introduceClause 2 into the Bill in the House of Lords.On the understanding that the Bill had been examined in detail by the Coal Committee, the cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the Coalmines  (SettlementOf Dispute)  bill- 1926, in the formattached to CP.-387 (26):(b) That &quot;the additional Clause attachedto the Bill should not be introducedwithout a further decision by theCabinet .

4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the  Cabinet a short summary of the presentdifficult situation in China resulting from thepowerlessness of the so-called Central Governmentand the difficulty in securing agreement between theGreat Powers.    Sir Austen Chamberlain said that hewas studying the question with a view to formulatinga policy, and in due course he would ash the PrimeMinister to have the question considered at theCabinet.
5.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, bythe Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, together with a Note by theSecretary explaining that the Memorandum had been circulated for consideration by the Cabinet, since,owing to pressure of work in connection with theImperial Conference, it had not been found possibleto convene a prior meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence (Paper CP,-372 (26)),The Cabinet were informed that the following telegram had been reoeived by the War Office on theprevious day:-&quot;Fiflom the G.0.0, Hong-Kong,    I am sendingat the request of Governor and Admiraltwo platoons of Indian Infantry to reinforce Naval contingent leavingimmediately for Bias Bay to rescuetwo European women reported to becaptured by pirates, with orders that&quot;without your cabled authorisation theyare not to land&quot;.In view of the great urgency of the matterthis telegram had been considered at a hastily assem-bled meeting attended by the Prime Minister, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs^/the Secretaryof State for War and t-ho First Lo^d-of tho- Admiralty-,as the result of which a telegram had been sent tothe Naval Commandor-in-Chief (this being the shortestroute) with Instructions to repeat it to Hong-kong and Pekin, to the effect that the information avail-able was insufficient;    that unless the women were british it was not for us to act;    pointing out therisk that on the arrival of a landing party the women would either be moved inland or.killed:    and contain-ing instructions that the landing was not to takeplace unless the women were British, all means forrescue by negotiations (including an offer of ransom )
had been exhausted, and the Admiral satisfied thattbe operation would be successful and not lead toextended operations (Appendix I) .    This conference had not had before them a telegram which had beenreceived the same morning,/from the Governor of Hong-Kong (Appendix II) .A further telegram, which had been receivedthe^&amp;a^^mtfrn&amp;-ng*,/was read to the Cabinet by theTwo questions, therefore, were before theCabinet:-(i) The immediate action to be taken inview of the latest outrage by piratesin Bias Bay; -(ii) The general policy dealt with in paper cp.-372 (26) .The former question was felt to depend upon whetherthe incident could be treated solely as an act ofpiracy, or whether the possible landing of troops onChinese territory (even though that territory was not under the effeotive control of the nominal Government)might involve considerations bearing on the wholeinternational situation in China..On a review of the relevant facts the Cabinet(a) That the First Lord of the admiralty should be authorised to send a telegram to the Naval Commander-in-Chief inChina to the effect that the action taken by him and this  course proposedin his latest telegram (Appendix III)was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, and requesting him to inform theBritish Minister atPekin and theGovernor of Hong-Kong:(b) That/the question of policy dealt within CP.-372 (26)  should be reservedfor consideration by the Committee ofImperial Defence (if it is possible toarrange a meeting in the present pressure of businesshin connection with the ImperialConference)^ or otherwise by the cabinet when the question of our general policyin China is discussed.(See Conclusion 4.)First Lord (Appendix III).agreed -

The Cabinet had before them a Note by theLord President of the Council covering draft para-graphs provisionally approved by the Committee ofthe Imperial Conference on Inter-Imperial Relationsregarding the position and mutual relations of GreatBritain and the Dominions (Paper CP,-384 (26)).The Lord President of the Council made a verbal report to the Cabinet in regard to the progressof the Committee of the Imperial Conference on Inter-Imperial Relations, over which he presides.   As theresult of a meeting on the previous day, Lord Balfourstated, a draft Report had been circulated to themembers of the Committee late inthe evening.    Copieshad been sent to two or three of his colleagues inthe Cabinet who were specially interested, but therehad not yet been time to prepare copies for the   ,Cabinet as a whole, though he thought it would be advantageous if his colleagues could consider it before the final discussions at the Committee,The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to circulate copies of thedraft Report of the Committee of theImperial Conference on Inter-imperial relations to the Cabinet at once, witha view to its discussion at a meetingthe same evening at 6 p.m.

9.  The Cabinet had before them a Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence,  in regard to the position in South-West Arabia, together with a Note by the Secretaryexplaining that the Report had been circulated for.consideration by the Cabinet since,  owing to the pressure of work in connection with the ImperialConference, it had not been possible to convene prior meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence(Paper CP.-377 (26) ) .In the absence of the Secretary ofState for Air,  the question&apos;waspos tponed.

118APPENDIX I.TELEGRAM from ADMIRALTY to COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,  CHINA, dated 16.11.S6.Following instructions have been received by Admiraltyfrom H.M. Government,(Begins) Reference telegram from Governor of Hong-Kongof 16th November, and 1252/16 from G.O.C. Hong-Konginformation given is insufficient.    Unless women are british it is not for us to act.    It. is  assumed the women are on shore and in this  case it appears almost certainthat, at first sign of landing party,  they will be takeninland or murdered and that landing party may becomeseriously engaged with little if any chance of effectingrescue.    On general grounds it is most undesirable weshould become engaged in fresh operations which, althoughdirected against pirates, would cause us to be deeperinvolved with Chinese.    Landing should not take placeunless firstly women are British, secondly you haveexhausted all means for rescue by negotiation incltidingoffer of ransom,  thirdly you are satisfied that rescuecan be successfully carried out without involving forcesin dangerously prolonged or e-tended operations  (ends).Inform Minister Peking and Governor Hong-Kong.
