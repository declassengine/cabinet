ADEN. 4.  The Cabinet bad before them a Joint Memoran-jdffiinistra- durc by tbe Secretaries of Stats for the Colonies,tion of. l^dt^War and A4rr, containing recommendations in regardprevious to the control and administration of Aden (Papereference:Cabinet 61 CP.-4.14 (26)).26), Con-conclusion 6(b).) After considerable discussion, the cabinet.R, agreed  10(33)4(a)  To approve tbe proposals of tbeSecretaries of State for theColonies, War and India, in regardto the responsibility of theadministration of Aden, the prin-cipal features of which are setforth in Paragraphs 11, 12 and 16 of cp.-414 (26) in tbe following terms:-&quot;11.  ... that a single chiefauthority should be appointed in control at Aden by the ImperialG-overnment, with the concurrence of the Government of India, in the shape of a Political Resident, orGovernor, preferably a civilian.The Governor, who would have withhim a military officer to command and administer tbe troops, shouldbe responsible to the ImperialGovernment in all political andmilitary matters, and to the Gov-ernment of India only for theinternal municipal administrationof the Settlement of Aden, whichwould continue on the same basis as if the Settlement had remainedpart of British India.    The governor should have the titular rank of commander-in-Chief as is customaryelsewhere, it being understood thatthe possession of this title willnot confer on him any right to giveexecutive orders to tbe troops.    TheOfficer Commanding the Troops shouldbe appointed by the. War Office afterconsultation with the Colonial Office.He should communicate direct with theWar Office on questions of intelligence,training and preparation for war, aswell as on matters affecting the routine administration of the troops.We recommend that this arrangement should take effect from 1st April,1927, as regards finance, and asregards administration as soon after that date a,s practicable.12. This arrangement would sec\ireImperial control in all essentialmatters, but leave India the satisfaction of retaining Aden as
part of India and still control-ling the civil affairs of theSettlement, including its residentIndian population.    In view of this we consider that India should beprepared to contribute towards themilitary and political charges asum of  250,000 a year for 3 years,and after that  150,000 a year, or one-third of the total cost (includingthe cost of any Air Force units at aden) , whichever is the lesserfigure&quot;.&quot;16. We consider that the responsi-bility for tha political and mili-tary administration of Aden shouldbe vested primarily in the Secretaryof Stats for the Colonies, and that&quot;Imperial expenditure in connectionwith Aden should be borne on theMiddle Eastern Vote.    The military expenditure will in the firstinstance be borne by the War Office,subject to reimbursement from theMiddle Eastern Vote.&apos;&quot;(The Chancellor of the Exchequerdemurred from this decision ofprinciple being taken before itwas known whether the two inquiriesreferred to below will achieve com-compensating economies in expenditure from British funds.)That the Lord Chancellor should arbitrateon th? claim of the %a.r Office set forth in CP,-414 (26), Para. 15, that from thedate on which the new increases to Imperialcharges come into force (let April, 1927)the payment to India of a subsidy of 130,000 for sea transport out of Armyfunds should be discontinued.That tho Committee of Chiefs of staff should be instructed that the Cabinetdesire that th^ defence of Aden shouldbe r-introduced to a less costly basis, andshould be  asked to advise the committee^ Imperial Defence as to whether this can be effected without undue risks byan addition at Aden of a Squadron ofthe Royal Air Force, combined with thewithdrawal and disbandment of the british infantry Battalion at present stationedther-;, or by any other means.

POOR law reform.BlockGrants.(previous reference far enc e:Cabinet 60(26), Con-clusion 7 ,)5o The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to Poor Law Reform and theconnected question of Block Grants:-Memoranda by the Minister of Health(Papers CP.-389 (26) and CP.-396(26)):A Memorandum by tha Chancellor oftho Exchequer (Paper CP.-395 (26)):A Memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Education (paper cp.-398 (26)):An Interim Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Grants(Paper CP.-282 (26)):The Second Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Grants(Paper CP.-410 (26)).The Cabinet were informed that the questionof Block Grants had been discussed at a meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Ministerof the Board ofof Health and the President / Education, as theresult of which the Cabinet (on the assumption thatthey wished the Minister of Health to proceed in thenext Session of Parliament with a scheme of Poor law reform) were askad to take the following decisions:-(i)  That the Minister of Health should begiven authority to print a Bill setting forth his proposals in regard to PoorLaw Reform, but omitting the financial provisions, and to communicate it tothe Local Authorities with a view toeliciting their attitude about February 1st:(ii) That with tha Bill a letter should besent to the Local Authorities explainingt ha t. the fi na no ial pro pos a Is we re no tIncluded, as the Government had resolved to investigate a larger scheme which wouldembrace Education and Police as well asHealth, but stating explicitly that ifthese proposals were proceeded with no Local Authority would be worse offfinancially than at present:(iii) Immediately after the issue of theletter, negotiations should be begunwith the Local Authorities under thedirection of a Cabinet Committee
composed as follows:-The Minister of Health(In thK Chair),The Horne Secretary,The President of the Board of Education,with a Representative of theTreasury:(iv) That Sir George Bars tow&apos;s Inter-DepartirentaT Committee shouldcontinue its investigation ofthe question of Block Grants in greater detail, under instructionsto be drawn up by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned.The subject was discussed at considerable length.The cabinet.net were informed that, notwithstanding theheavy expenditure involved (but not until the yearigSO-^l) , the Treasury were, on a long view, infavour of the scheme, since it would release theExchequer from the frequent increases in expenditureresulting&apos; from the decisions of Local Authoritiesto spend money under the present feystem   a system which leaves the Government but little control and sometimes tends to encourage extravagance by LocalAuthorities .The scheme was criticised  -&quot;rom the point of viewof its possible effect in the agricultural districts(particularly from the points of view of the abolition -tion of Boards of Guardians and of the futureadjustments of the block grants contemplated in thescheme) and in non-County Boroughs.The subject was adjourned until11 a.m. on Friday, December 17th.
EQUAL FRANCHISEFOR MBIT ANDWOMEN.(PreviousRefsrence:Cabinet 58(26) , Con-conclusion 13.)6. The  Cabinet took note of the attachedstatement vhich was handed in by the Lord Chancellor(Appendix,) giving the results of the first meetingof the Cabinet Committee held earlier in the dayon the subject of Equal Franchise for Men andWomen,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 16,  1Q26.
APPENDIX.EQUAL FRANCHISE COMMITTEE.NOTE BY THE LORD CHANCELLOR.The Committee yesterday held their firstmeeting, over which, in the absence through illness ofthe Home Secretary, I was called upon to preside, andalthough they could not in the time which was availableagree upon a final report, they made a certain amount ofprogres s.Before, the late General Election a pledge wasgiven by the Prime Minister in the  following terms&quot;The Unionist Party are in favour of equalpolitical rights  for men and women,  and desire that the question of the extension of the franchise should, if possible,  he settled byagreement.      With this in view they would, Ifreturned to power, propose that the matter be referred to a conference of all political parties on the lines of the Ullswater Committee.&quot;The Home Secretary,  in a debate on a private member&apos;s Bill which took place on the 20th February,  1925,went further, and said that the pledge was for equalrights  &quot;at the next Election&quot;;    but it will be sufficient for the present to deal with the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge.In the opinion of the Committee that pledge binds theparty to two things:-(1) An attempt must be made to refer the matter to a conference of all parties on the lines of the speaker&apos;s Conference of 1916, with a view to its being settled by agreement.      The committeerecognise the dangers attending such a conference,which may result in a declaration in favour ofthe widest possible extension of the franchise;but they think that In view of the pledge these
dangers must be faced.      But the reference to theconference should require  them to examine the question and to submit (as in 1916)  &quot;agreed&quot; resolutions;    andit should be made clear that the Government will not feel bound by the conclusions of a majority only of themembe rs.If as appears to be not unlikely,  the Speakerdeclines to preside over such a Conference,  thequestion will arise whether another independent chairman.for the Conference should be found or whether(failing agreement with the leaders of theyother parties)the Government should submit its own proposals toParliament.(2) If there is a Conference called, theGovernment will be asked to submit their proposalsfor giving equal political rights to men and women.Under this wide phrase a good many questions will arisefor solution,  e.g.,At what age should men and women become entitledto a vote?    Is it necessary to keep to the long-established rule which gives a vote to men at 21;    or,as the age for women is to be lowered&quot;from 30, is it possible to propose a vote for both sexes at 25, or some other age,  subject to the preservation of existing rights?Should the basis of the Franchise be residence(as is&apos; now the  case for men) or occupation of premises(which is now the basis of the franchise for women)?      Theformer is the wider basis, and it appears to the committee thatit should be adopted.Should the second Parliamentary vote now givento a man in respect of the occupation of business premisesbe extended to women who occupy such premises on their own account?    And if so,   should the right of a married woman
to vote in respect of her husband&apos;s occupation ofbusiness premises be retained, and a like votegiven to a married man in respect of his wife&apos;business premises?Should the vote be given to representativesof public companies?Should persons in receipt of poor reliefbe disqualified from voting?What changes should be made in the LocalGovernment Franchise?The questions of redistribution and of election expenses would also .have to be considered.The committee think that these and other questions will require to be carefully examined by the committee,and&quot;ultimately by the Cabinet,  before any scheme is submitted to the proposed conference;    and they suggestthat in any speech which may be made by a member of theGovernment in the meantime, it would be better to reserve the answer to these questions,  and while adhering to the pledge to  lay stress on the importance of securing (ifpossible) agreement between the parties on the subject.In any case it is clear that the effect of theproposed change will be to establish a substantialpreponderance in the number of women voters over male votersThe present excess of men over women of about 2\ millionswill be converted into an excess of women over men offrom 2 to 2-g million voters.15.12.26.
