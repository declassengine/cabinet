THE PRIMEMINISTER.Cabinet&apos;sCongratula-tions to .1.    On the motion of the Secretary of State forFordism Affairs, the- Cabinet placed on record their appreciation, of the part which the reputation and position h-ld by th&quot; Prirro Minister in the country had played in the unconditional withdrawal on theprevious day       the Strike Notices, and which they felt would be of inestimable value in the final stages of these events and in the reconstructionfollowing the strike.    There was general agreement that no-one could read the  stenographic notes ofthe meeting held on the previous  day between thePrime Minister and the General Council of th^ TradesUnion Congress without realising the great part which his personality had played.The.Prime Minister, in thanking the cabinet for this expression of their sentiments, emphasised the difficulties of the next week or two, and thegreat importance of maintaining a right spirit inthe nation, without which his own task and that ofthe fi-ovem/rent, would be rendered very difficult.He was apprehensive of the effects of a wrong spiritnot only  on this Government but on all Governments .

The Prime Minister, on behalf of his colleagues,CABINET to ministers AND expressed his thanks to the Hone Secretary, as Chair-CIVIL SERVANTS.man of the Supply and Transport Committee;    thePresident of the Board of Trade as responsible forthe food arrangements;    and other Cabinet colleaguesresponsible for drawing up the emergency arrangementsfor meeting the general strike, and congratulatedthe-;- on the success &quot;/hich had attended their efforts.The Cabinet agreed  To place on record their appreciation of the remarkable success which had attended the efforts of the ChiefCivil Commissioner and other Ministersnot in the Cabinet (including theCivil Commissioners in charge of-        ^ -wSil as the Civilconcerned in organising the emergency arrangements for safe-guarding the essential services ofthe country during the general strike.The Secretary was instructed to seethat the thanks of the Cabinet wereconveyed to those concerned in an appropriate form.
THE INDUSTRIAL 8. The Postmaster-General,  as Chief CivilSITUATION,Commissioner, made a report to the  Cabinet in(Previous regard to the position in the various districts..Reference:Cabinet 30 . Broadly(26),  Con-clusion 1,)       speaking, the general strike still continued inall parts of the country,  largely owing to the unwillingness of workers to return unless employers would tak8 back the whole of the men who had gone on strike.   All the Civil Commissioners were unanimous in the hope that the Government would not departfrom the terms of the official statement drawn upon the previous  day and published this day in the&quot;British Gazette&quot; (Appendix I) .The Cabinet were informed that recruitinghad bean stopped both for Special Constables andvolunteers, but that the emergency organisation had been retained in being, and that, although some of the Civil Constabulary Reserve were leaving, the Special Constabulary organisation was still in being.There was general agreement that theemergency organisation must be kept in beinguntil the, general strike had come effectively toan end.
4. The Prime Minister reported to his colleagues the present position in regard to  the coal dispute,in the cotirs^ of which he mentioned a Memorandum(Appendix IT) drawn up by Sir Herbert Samuel,entirely on his own responsibility and without any communication with the Government, which had beenconcurred in by the Trades Union Congress general council as offering a basis on which the negotiationsupon the conditions in the coal industry could be renewed, but had since been rejected by the Miners&apos;Federation Executive.    He then read to the Cabinet aprovi si onal/ Memorandum prepared by the Cabinet Committee as  .the basis of proposals to be made, at such momentas might be deemed appropriate, to the Mining As so-elation and the Miners1  Federation.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  (a) To give general approval (leavingdetails to be worked out by the- Cabinet Committee) to thepjprovisional Mem-memorandum  in Appendix III, which had been drawn up by the Prime Minister&apos;cabinet Committee on the CoalDispute, as the basis of proposals to be made,at such moment as thePrime Minister might deem, appro-priate, to the Miners&apos;  federation and the Mining Association;(b) To take note that the questions of mining Royalties and MunicipalTrading were not dealt with in theabove Memorandum, but that it wasin contemplation to propose tohave both questions examined by Committees, and that in the caseof mining royalties the question. .   would be considered in connectionwith the setback caused by theStrike to the financial position ofthe country:(c) That the question of the amount offurther financial assistance to thecoal  industry (Appendix III,  3,  (g)),would be discussed by the PrimeMinister with the Chancellor o^ the exchequer quer.-4-

Towards the end of the Cabinet meeting theChief Whip brought -information that Mr Arthur Henderson,of the Labour Party, had made a formal request for a debate on the situation arising- from the refusal by employers to respond to the Prime Minister&apos;s appeal for peace ,The Prime Minister instructed the Chief whip to do his best to avoid losing a &quot;Supply&quot; day,  andto postpone the Debate asked for by Mr Arthur Hendersonas late in the day as possible.f/hitehal.I G-ardsns,  SMay 13,  1926 *
APPENDIX      I.&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;have no power to compel employers to take back every man who hasbeen on strike, nor have they entered into anyobligations of any kind in this matter.Some displacements are inevitable in view ofthe reduction of business consequent upon thestrike, as well as any obligations which may havebeen entered into by employers towards volunteerswho have helped them to carry on during the lastweek,Attention is, however, drawn to the hopeexpressed by th** Prime Minister in his statement in thv- Ecuse of Commons T that we should resume our work in a spirit of co-op&quot; ration,.. put ting behindus all malice and all vindictiveness&apos;.The best course is for the various trades union to get into immediate touch with the associations of Employers concerned in order that,if possible, a satisfactory agreement may bereached.&quot;
to appendix II.MEMORANDUM by SIR HFPBERT SAMUEL.13      The negotiations upon the conditions of the coalindustry should be resumed,  the subsidy being renewed forsuch reasonable period as may be required for that purpose.2.     Any negotiations are unlikely to be successfulunless they provide for means of- settling disputes in theindustry other than conferences between the mineowners andthe miners alone.      A National Wages Board should, therefore,be established which would include representatives of those two parties with a neutral element and an independent chairman,    The proposals in this direction tentatively madein the Report of the Royal Commission should be pressedand the powers of the proposed Board enlarged.3.      The parties to the Board should be entitled to raisebefore it any points they consider relevant to the issue-under discussion,  and the Board should be required totake such points into consideration,4,      There should be no revision of the previous wage rates unless there are sufficient assurances that the-measures of reorganisation proposed by the commission will be effectively adopted.     A Committee should beestablished, as proposed by the Prime Minister,  onwhich representatives of the men should be included, whose duty It should be to co-operate with the Government inthe preparation of the legislative and administrative measures that arc required.     The same Committee, or alternatively, the National Wages Board,  should assure-itself that the necessary steps,  so far as they relate to matters within the industry, are not being neglected orunduly postponed.5*     After these points have been agreed and the MinesNational Wages Board has considered every practicablemeans of meeting such immediate financial difficulties as
exist,  it may,  if that course is found, to he absolutely necessary, proceed to the preparation of a wage agreement.6B      Any such agreement should -(i)    If practicable, be on simpler lines thanthose hitherto followed.(ii)   ITot adversely affect in any way the wages of the lowest paid men.(iii)    Fix reasonable figures below which the wageof no class of labour, for a normal customaryweek&apos;s work,  should be reduced in any circumstances.(iv)    In the event of any new adjustments beingmade,  should provide for the revision of such adjustments by the Wages Board from time to time if the facts warrant that course.7*     Measures should be adopted to prevent the recruit-ment of new workers,  over the age of 18 years,  into theindustry if unemployed miners are available.8.     Workers who are displaced as a consequence of the closing of uneconomic collieries should be provided for by -(a) The transfer of such men as may be mobile, withthe Government assistance that may be required,as recommended in the Report of the RoyalCommission.(b) The maintenance for such period as may be fixed,of those who cannot be so transferred and for whom alternative employment cannot be found;this maintenance to comprise an addition tothe existing rate of unemployment pay under th e.. Unemployment Insurance Act, of such amount asmay be agreed.    A contribution should be madeby the Treasury to cover the additional sumsso disbursed.(c) The rapid construction of new houses tftaccommodate transferred workers.    The TradesUnion Congress will facilitate this by consultation and co-operation with all thoseYfho are concerned.
