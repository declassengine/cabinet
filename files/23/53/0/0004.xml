EGYPT, The Cabinet met ae a matter of -urgencyat the first possible moment after the re-assemblyPreviousReference: of Ministers on the conclusion of the WhitsuntideCabinet 11(25), Con- recess, as the Secretary of State for Foreignelusion 2.)Affairs felt &quot;that he ought not to proceed furtherwithout constilting his colleagues on the policy ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government towards the situation inEgypt.    The position in that country was thatZaghloul Pasha had returned from recent electionswith an overwhelming majority.   He had at firstannounced his intention,, for reasons of health,not himself to form, a Government.   Recently, however,Zaghloul, unduly elated by his electoral success and by the acquittal of three of his former ministers on a murder charge, had changed his mind and nowdesired to form a Ministry.    In the case of oneMinister the acquittal had been unanimous, but inthe case of the others, while the two Egyptian Judgeshad been agreed on the acquittal, the British Judgeheld that there should have been a conviction.Although, in accordance with the procedureprescribed by Egyptian law, the British Judge(jL-erahaw) felt bound to sign the grounds of judgment, he proposed on doing so to tender his resignation from the Egyptian Service as a protest against the verdict.    This, however, raised thequestion of Judge Kershaw&apos;s future, as he was dependent upon his career for his livelihood andthe education of his family, and Lord Lloyd had   ,urged that on Judge Kershaw&apos;s resignation hisfuture ought to be provided for.Two main questions, therefore,, were beforethe Cabinet, namely,  the policy to be adopted
towards Zaghloul1* desire to form a Ministry,and the future of Judge Kara haw.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made to the Cabinet a very full statement on thedevelopment of the situation as revealed by the telegrams which had passed and which had alreadybeen circulated to the Cabinet, beginning at lord lloyd&apos;s telegram: No. 216, dated May 19, 1926, from cairo, in which, after a very full and balancedstatement of the arguments on either side, he had expressed a view in favour of supporting King Fuadin refusing to accept Zaghloul as Prime Minister,down to the Secretary of state  s telegram No. 182of May 30th, approving the course proposed by lord lloyd.    Sir Austen Chamberlain also read to theCabinet a number of telegrams which had beenreceived the same day, namely,  Noa. 249, 250, 251and 252, of May 51st, together with telegrams ofhis own asking for further information on certainlegal points in Lord Lloyd&apos;s telegram No. 252,and warning Lord Lloyd that his note to Zaghloulmust be approved by the Cabinet.In the course of the discussion which followed the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet&apos;to the following extract from the King&apos;s Speech of December 9, 1924:&quot;      The campaign of hostility to Britishrights and interests in Egypt and theSudan, inspired rather than discouraged by the Gov^rnrent of Zaghloul Pasha,etilminaled in the murder of Sir LeeStack i:h the streets of Cairo andobliged My Government to demand redress.Their demands, which the presentEgyptian Government have accepted, are designed to secure respect for those interests which are of vital ooncernto My Empire and which My Governmentspecifically reserved to their absolutediscretion when My Protectorate overEgypt was wi thdrawn&quot;.
He also read the following extract from the ultimatum delivered hy Lord Allenby to Zaghloulafter Sir Lee Stack&apos;s murder:-&quot;Hie Majesty&apos;s Government considerthat this murder, which holds upEgypt as at present governed to thecontempt of civilised peoples, isthe natural outcome of a campaign of hostility to British rights andBritish subjects in Egypt and Sudan,founded upon a headless ingratitudefor benefits conferred by GreatBritain, not disoouraged by yourExcellencyTa Government, and fomentedby organisations in close contact with that Government.Your Excellency was warned by HisMajesty&apos;s Government little more thana month ago of consequences of failing to stop this campaign more particularly as concerned the Sudan.    It has notbeen stopped.   Egyptian Governmenthave now allowed Governor-General ofSudan to be murdered, and have proved that they are incapable or unwilling to protect foreign lives.His Majestyrs Government thereforerequiren, etc.In addition to certain amendments proposedby the Secretary of State in the note which lord lloyd proposed to address to the Egyptian Governmentin the event of Judge Kershaw&apos;s resignation (Cairotelegram No. 853),. some suggestions on legal points were made which the Secretary of State undertook to embody in his reply to Lord Lloyd./After a very full discussion, in which thesubject was considered both from the point of viewof the possible serious consequences on our future policy in Egypt of the acceptance or of the reject-tion of Zaghloul as Prime Minister, as well as fromthat of the presentation of the policy in Parliament,the Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o approve the policy of refusing to accept Zaghloul as Prime Ministerof Egypt:
