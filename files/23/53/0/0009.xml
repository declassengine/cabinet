1.  The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a verbal statement to the Cabinet in regardto the present state of affairs in Egypt. Lord Lloydhad handled the difficult situation arising out ofZaghloul&apos;s success at the election with a goodjudgment, and up to the present our policy hadbeen successful.    Sir Austen Chamberlain warned theCabinet, however, that at any moment difficult questions were liable to arise in Egypt calling for cabinet decision.
f?IINA.juation inIviotisferencs:finet 19t Con-Ision 12.)Ift .S. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made a verbal statement to the Cabinet in regardto the present state of affairs in China.    A criticalposition had arisen owing to the seizurein various Provinces in China of the Salt Revenueswhich provide the security for a number of foreignLoans.   At Tientsin one of the Generals wasappropriating the local revenues from the saltand was compelling salt merchants to pay duties to him instead of to the Salt Administration.    Inconsequence,  the French,  Japanese and british ministers had reluctantly come to the conclusionthat if certain offers they had made were rejectedit would  /be necessary to prevent by force the removalof salt which had paid illegal taxes but no legalduty,to the Administration from certain depots, ameasure which would probably entail the use offoreign troops and a demonstration by foreign gun-boats in the River.    Sir Austen Chamberlain had told the British Minister in Pekin that the government must have further information before authorisingany action, including reports from the Naval andMilitary authorities in the Far East, as to thedifficulties and risks involved.    The Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs said he would not.authorise action of the kind contemplated withouta Cabinet decision.
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that on the previous evening,in consequence of the resignation of the FrenchMinistry, he had received a message indicating thatthe French President of the Reptiblic and thePresident of the Council would be grateful if theformer&apos;s visit to the King next week could be post-poned.    The French Government had proposed thefollowing text of a communique:-&quot;In presence of economic and political difficulties In Great Britain and inFrance, both Governments considerthat it is advisable to postpone the visit of the President of the- ;Republic to His Majesty the King ofEngland fixed for the beginning of next week, and  the festivitiesarranged on that occasion&quot;.The Cabinet felt strongly that no allusionshould be made in any communique to economic or political difficulties in Great Britain as consti-tuting the smallest bar to the visit, and approvedto Lord Crewethe following draft reply/which the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs proposed...to send, subjectto the King&apos;s approval:-&quot;Your telegram No. 214 (of June 15).His Majesty quite understands thedifficulty created by the govern-msntal crisis in France.    The lastthing that he would wish is thathis invitation intended as a mark of his regard for the President ofthe Republic and as a signal expres-sion of the close friendship whichunites our two nations should throughuntoward circumstances become an embarrassment.    He accepts therefore the proposal for postponement.But His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot agree that political or economic difficulties in this country shouldbe alleged as a reason.    The coal strike would not in any way haveinterfered with .the warmth of thePresident&apos;3 reception or the cere-monies connected with it.    Court and
other functions are being held as usual and the excuse would be sopalpably inaccurate as to provokei nv id I. o u s c ommen t.It is surely n;uch better to state the real and obvious reason, viz.,that the President&apos;s public dutiesmake it impossible for him to leavePrance at this moment,  that-the twogovernments are agreed that it isnecessary to postpone the visit andthat His Majesty hopes to renew hisinvitation at a more opportune moment.If the French Government agree, pleasetelephone the exact words in which you and they embody this communique.It is out of the question that weshould allow it to be suggestedthat political or economic difficul-ties here are the cause or even acontributing cause of the post-ponement.&quot;
