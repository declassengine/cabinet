SITUATION.Kef:1 (26).n 1*1.     The Cabinet had before them the following documents :-Proposals of the Cabinet Coal Committee(CP. 336 (26));Draft wf a Bill entitled Industrial Courts(Temporary Powers) (CP. 337 (26));Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines onthe Industrial Court (Temporary Powers) Bill(CP. 236 (26));Proposals of Miners&apos; Executive as issued tothe Press on September 23rd, 1926. ( CP. 339 ( 6^5A letter from the National Confederation ofEmployers1 Organisations (CP. 340 ( 26)).&quot;The Cabinet were Informed of the cov&amp;er^bUsinawhich bad taken place, since their last meeting,   &quot;**&quot;with the officials of the Miners&apos; federation and with the Chairman of the Mining Association.Late on Tuesday, September 21st. the Miners1officials had put forward proposals, as atemporary arrangement, for the immediateresumption of work at wages not less than thosepayable under the terms of the 1921 agreement(for a seven hours day) and for the appointmentof aflfagreed tribunal to fix the terms of anational agreement (CP. 339(26).  These proposals,which had been issued to the Press on September 23rd,had been considered by the Coal Committee and found unsatisfactory, chiefly because theyexcluded arbitration on hours, otherwise than as embraced in the recommendations of the RoyalCommission.The Coal Committee had now submitted forthe consideration of the Cabinet fresh proposalsfor the immediate appointment of an independent tribunal which should have power to decidenationally hours and minimum wage percentagesdistrict by dlstriot (Appendix I).
These proposals had been embodied in a draftbill (Appendix II) subject to the omission of provisions dealing with the principle of the ratioand of recoupmeni.The Cabinet were impressed with the difficultyof reaching a decision where the advantages and disadvantages of Government action were very nearly balanced.      The owners were firm in resisting a national agreement, the miners in resisting an extension of- hours.     There was no prospect of a joint Conference or of any agreementbetween the two parties.     The miners were increasingly conscious of defeat.      Over 100,000miners had returned to work and, in the opinionof the mineowners, this number would be swiftlyand largely Increased if the Government withdrewfrom all Intervention in the dispute.     this opinion was not endorsed by observers in districtssuch as Lancashire,     -Northumberland and Yorkshire,and estimates varied as to the extent to which men were still prepared to continue the conflict.In regard to the proposals of the GoalCommittee, it was urged that they had to be judged partly by their effect on an early andgeneral resumption of work, partly by their power to achieve a permanent settlement, andpartly from the more purely Party standpoint.Doubt was expressed on all three grounds as to how far satisfactory results would follow fromattempting to pass hurriedly a Bill involving the far-reaching principle of compulsory

Further, in viewof the offer made to the miners as recently as the 17th Instant by the Prime Minis ter, afresh series of proposals by the Governmentwould wear the appearance of vaccilation,whereas it was desirable to convey an impression of finality.After prolonged consideration, the cabinet agreed:-(a) That the proposals of the miners federation (CP. 339 (26)) whileindicating an advance in their position,did not afford the means of reaching &apos;an early and lasting settlement of thepresent dispute*(b) That, without prejudice to any action that might be necessary as the miningdispute developed, the Govex-nment shouldnot proceed to give effect to theroposals of the Goal committee. 336 (26)).(c) That the proposals approved at thelast meeting of the Cabinet (Cabinet 51(26) Conclusion 1) and conveyed tothe Miners&apos; Federation in the PrimeMinisterls letter of September 17th(CP. 331 (26)) should he adhered toand remain open for a reasonable period.(d) That the Coal Committee should meetimmediately and&apos;&quot; take steps to announceto the Miners,!&apos; Federation and to thePress Conclusions (a) and (c).(e) That the Coal Committee should meet at 11 a.m. on Tuesday next in theHouse of Commons to consider, inter alia, proposals by the Board of trade for rationing supplies of coal.NOTfS*       At a meeting of the Coal Committee later in the day, it was agreed to address to the miners Federation and to is sue to the press the letter attached as Appendix III.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.24th September, 1926.
