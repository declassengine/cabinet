1.   The Cabinet agreed  (aV On the recommendation of the HomeSecretary, that tha whole of theEmergency Regulations relating tothe preservation of public order should be withdrawn:(b) On the advice of the Secretary for mines, that the Regulations relat-ing to the prohibition of the exportation of coal should bemaintained for the present.The Home Secretary reported to the Cabinetthat the Labour Party had approached him with asuggestion that an amnesty&quot;should be given in respectof all sentences still current which had been imposedfor breaches of public order as the result of theStrike,    He had telegraphed for particulars inregard to all these cases, but was already clearthat  some flagrant crimes had been committed inrespect of which an amnesty could in no circumstances be granted,The general trend of the Cabinet&apos;s view was opposed to any general grant of an amnesty, but theHome Secretary was asked to advise the Cabinet onthe subject at their next regular weekly meeting.[OAliflON.sergencyation3 .nous^re neatinet 60), Con-jsion If a) .)53 tadty.
0 AFFAIRS.     2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsjjsed Con-   reported to the Cabinet that he was leaving for-jtions,Bn France,Paris on the following day and proposed to stop there-,ny, Great.sin, for *wo days- on his way to Geneva, with a view toiv,Hum - conversations with m. Briand and President Poincare.He recalled that, immediately after the last meetingiousrenCet        of the Council of the League of Nations at Geneva,net 35]( con-        a private conversation had taken place at lunchion 3.)between M. Briand and Dr. Stresemann at Thoiry,   Theyhad got on well together, and had discussed the possi-bility of schemes of conciliation on the broadestlines:    for example, the total evacuation by theAllies of occupied territory in Germany, in returnfor some financial payment by Germany, secured, perhaps,on the mobilisation of railway bonds.   These broadand general proposals had not commended themselvesin their finaneial aspects to experts.   The resulthad been that the Thoiry conversations had provedrather a disappointment.   Dr Stresemann had latelyrealised that conversations with m. Briand alone werenot likely to lead to results, and was anxious to get back to conversations comparable to those at Locarno,at which Great Britain,and perhaps Italy and Belgiumalso, would bs represented.   Some time ago m. Briandhad intimated that he would like to see Sir austen chamberlain, and had envisaged the possibility ofa visit to London.    Sir Austen had rather discourageda visit necessarily involving so much publicity,and had preferred himself to stay a day or two (onhis way to Geneva) in Paris, where he hoped to seeboth m. Briand and President Poincare.
A&apos; suggest ion had been made that, after the meet-ing of the Council at Geneva, a special meeting should take place on the lines of the Locarno eonversa-tions .   The- first idea had been that Signor Mussolinishould be asked to come to Geneva, but for various reasons this was not deemed a convenient course.Dr Stresemann, who was contemplating the signature of a Treaty of Friendship with Italy, had proposedthat the opportunity which the signature of this document would afford might be taken for a widermeeting.    There the matter stood at the moment, but sir Austen Chamberlain himself had suggested that heand M, Briand and Dr Stresemann might talk the matter over during the Council at Geneva, though he haduttered a warning that, in view of the presentsensitive state of public opinion in Europe, he feltdoubtful whether any meeting on the lines of Locarnowould be useftil unless the ground had been sufficientlyprepared in advance to ensure a good result .The Cabinet agreed - That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, on the occasion of his conversations with W. Briandand President Poincare at Paris,and with M. Briand and Dr Stresemannat Geneva, should have full discretion to take such decisions as in the cir-cumstances he might deem advisable,subject to Sir Austen&apos;s general impression that a meeting on thelines of Locarno would be inadvisableunless the ground was sufficientlyprepared in advance to render a goodresult probable.
jD OGOUPA- 3. In the course of the statement referred toOF0. in the previous Conclusion, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs expressed the hope that somelousfence: progress might he made at Geneva towards endingnot 35Con-        military control in Germany and establishing theion 3.)innaipent311&apos; CM l J  .;ious;renc e:it 24-conditions under which the League of Nations wouldin future exercise control.Sir Austen Chamberlain did not anticipate that the question of the termination of the allied or.0^&quot;)        occupation of portions of Germany was likely, inthe conversations at Geneva, to reach a pointcalculated to involve an early reduction of theBritish military garrison.   Be gave warning, however,that at any moment now we might be faced with aproposal for evacuation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to circulate a Memorandum, which had been prepared inthe Treasury, in regard to the financial effects of evacuation of occupied territory in Germany.The Prime Minister assured the foreign secretary of the full support of the Cabinet in his forthcoming conversations.-4-
4.  The Cabinet had, before then a draft StatementIrs *of Policy, prepared by the Foreign Office for the-use of Mr Lamps on, the British Minister-designate,who will shortly arrive at Peking, which had beennet 5B        approved by the .Cabinet Committee on China theCon- ,jjlon 4.)- previous evening (Paper C.P.-403 (26)), togetherwith a Memorandum on various aspects of the Chineseproblem, circulated by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (Paper CP.-399 (26)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a very full appreciation of thepresent situation in China and of the events leading up thereto.   He made it clear that in the presentsituation there was no representative ChineseGovernment with which an agreement could be made,but he thought it was possible to lay the foundationson which a future agreement could be reached whenevera stable Government came into existence.    The founda-tions of such a policy were presented in CP.-403 ( 26)The object-was to show a benevolent dispositiontowards China;    to recognise that the status quowould have to come to an end; to provide a liberalpolicy; and to indicate certain steps that could betaken immediately, as,  for example, the grant of theWashington surtaxes.    Sir Austen Chamberlain proposedthat this document should be telegraphed textuallyto Mr Lampson, who should be asked in the firstinstance for his observations.    When it had reached its final form, Mr Lampson should be instructed to read the document to the diplomatic body at Peking,after which he should give copies to the representa-tives of the Powers and should invite their concur-rence therein as the policy of the united Powers.
Mr Lampson would be told that we anticipated that inthe first instance the proposed policy would provesomething of a shock, especially to the representa-tives of the United States of America and Japan, whowould be reluotant to make the concessions contemplatedtherein.   If thsir attitude was not favourable to theMemorandum after it had been considered, Mr Lampsonwould be asked to press the representatives of theother Powers as to what course they proposed, and to enquire whether they intended merely to continue apolicy of feeble and ineffective protests while thewhole situation was crumbling before their eyes, orwhether, at some point, they intended to stand firm and enforce their protests .    The Foreign Secretaryfurther intimated that later on he might have to ask the Cabinet to consider whether some form of recognl-tion of the Canton Government fuller than that involvedin the negotiations at present conducted from time totime on urgent matters by Consular authorities shouldnot be given, but, pending fur the :* enquiries, he didnot ask for any decision on that question.In the course of the discussion, the importance was urged of doing everything possible to providefor the safety of the British community, not only at hankow and any threatened settlements on the YangtseKiang, but also at any settlements further away fromthe River, one of which was reported to exist some 20miles from Hankow.    The Cabinet were informed, however,that the protection of the settlements at Hankow and beyond involved special difficulties in winter owingto the fact that the water falls and none but theshallowest craft can navigate the river during thecoming months.
The suggestion was made that arms should be sent up to Hankow, and any other threatened settlements,for the use of the local community, if these we not already available in sufficient quantities.   TheCabinet were informed, however, that the ForeignOffice were not disposed to think that the settle-ments on the Yangtse Kiang were in great dangerapart from the possibility of a boycott, which mightitself lead to trouble.The Prime Minister explained to the Cabinet thatthe general feeling of the Cabinet Committee had beenthat, in a situation where every possible course was open to objections and difficulties, the one nowproposed offered the best hopes of a useful result.It would at least force the diplomatic body at peking, who had hitherto allowed matters to driftwithout any policy other than that of futile protests,to face the facts.   If the Powers refused our policyand had nothing better to propose, the Cabinet wouldhave to consider carefully whether we should have toadopt our own line, but that did not at present arise.In reply to an enquiry as to whether Mr Lampsonwould be instructed to warn the Powers that in theevent of their rejecting this policy we should proceed alone, Sir Austen Chamberlain drew attentionto telegram No.361, which had been sent to HisMajesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires&apos; at Peking, stating thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were strongly in favour ofthe course recommended by the Consul-General at hankow, namely, to acquiesce in the collection bythe Customs authorities at Hankow of levies on goods,if demanded by Canton officials, as was anticipated.In this telegram the Charge d&apos;Affaires had been
-8-instructed to inform his foreign colleagues of these views and to invite their support to the representa-tions which he had been instructed to make to the inspector-General of Customs.   The telegram furtherhad stated that His Majesty&apos;s Government could notassociate themselves with a repetition of the mistakemade at Canton   which led to the establishment of arival Customs Administration there.Subject to some minor verbal amendments, whichwere accepted by the Foreign Secretary, the cabinet agreed -To approve the draft Statement ofPolicy (Paper C.P.-40S (26)) andthe course proposed by the foreign secretary, with the approval of theCabinet Committee, as set forth above.
I CHINA. 5. The Cabinet bad before them the draft Cone lu-1 ityBdMENT) sions of a Meeting of the Committee of Home- affairs in regard to the China Indemnity (Amendment) Bill.Lous (H.A.C. 15th Conclusions (26)) containing theIterance:fcin9t 60        following recommendation:-&apos;ision09.) &quot;That in view of the fact that thewhole question of the Chinesesituation is at present under theconsideration of the Prime Minister&apos;sCommittee on China, it is not, in theopinion of the Home Affairs Committee,desirable that the China Indemnity(Amendment) Bill should be proceeded with at the present time.&quot;The Cabinet accepted the above recommendation.
I.on in.p.istrationof.iousJon-ion6. The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the position in South-WestAratia:-A Report by the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence (Paper CP.-377(26)):An Extract from the Proceedings ofthe 218th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence thereon,including the draft Minutes and conclusions of the committee as well as a copy of a despatch from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to His Majesty&apos;sre&quot;c^ * Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires at Rome covering&apos; a Memorandum on the Imam-Idrisi?&quot; x conflict in Arabia (C.T.D, PaperNo.720-B) and a letter from theColonial Office.-covering a tele-gram from the Resident in Aden(C.I.D. Paper No .739-B) . j C .P.-401 (26)..)The Secretary or State for the Colonies made astatement to the Cabinet       resa^d to the Conclusionsof the committee of Imperial r^e^ence.The Cabinet agreed  (i) To approve the following recommenda-tions by the Committee of ImperialDefence:-(a) That the Cabinet should approve inprinciple the Report of the Chiefsof Staff Committee &quot;-(Paper N0.738-B),and take note that, in that event,the Secretary of State for ForeignAf fairs will take the Report as thebasis for instructions to the Pritishrepresentative in the forthcoming negotiations with the ItalianGovernment.(b) That the strength of the Royal AirForce at Aden should be raised toone Squadron as soon as this can beconveniently done.    This disposition,the Committee note, will not involve an increase in the total strength ofthe Royal Air Force.(c) That the Imam should be warned thathis occupation of a portion of the aden Protectorate renders hire liableat any time to such measures of retaliation by land, sea or air,at such time and in such manner as we may deem, suitable, and thatany action on his part against anyislands in the Red Sea is calculated to precipitate action on our part.This declaration should not be made
until after the increase in theRoyal Air Force at A.den has been effected.(ii) That the question of the responsi-bility for the administration at aden should be brought before tbeCabinet by the Departments con-cernsd at an early date.-11-
7 . The Cabinet had before them an extract fromthe Minutes of the 818th Meeting of the Committeeiousforence: of Imperial Defence on the subject of Egypt (Papernet 49, Con- C.P.-40B ( 26) ) .ion 1.)The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe following extract from the previous decisionsof the Cabinet on the subject&quot;That we should insist on a renewal of the contracts of British officials(many of which expire in the Spring of1927) until after the settlement ofthe four reserved points, and should seek gradually to replace british officials in some key posts which inrecent years have been allowed to begiven to persons of oth^r than british or Egyptian nationality&quot;,and took note of the following remarks made by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to theCommittee of Imperial Defence:-&quot;Sir Austen Chamberlain remarked thatthe third &quot;conclusion above had been drawn up after the Cabinet had hearda statement by Lord Lloyd.    He was ofopinion that this conclusion wascouched in rather more general termsthan tha Cabinet had intended.   lord lloyd on his return to Egypt had setup a Committee on this particularsubject whose report had been con-side red by the Egyptian Departmentof the Foreign Office, and certaincomments had been referred back toLord Lloyd,   He suggested that it was unnecessary to insist on the renewal of the contracts of British officials in every case, but only to concentrate on those cases which were of real importance. The conclusion as atpresent drafted might be interpreted as referring to every British officialin Egypt.   He suggested that theSecretary shouldering this matter up at a convenient meeting of the Cabinet&quot;.
