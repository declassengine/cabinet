p.st  HAM.jjrevtousEbinet 4-315), Con-&quot;frusion 7,)X, The Minister of Health, raised, as a matter of urgency, certain matters relating to the positionin West Ham.Mr Neville Chamberlain warned the Cabinet that,in consequence of the general strike, West Ham had applied to him. for another loan,  but he was unwilling to sanction it unless the Local Authorities would reduce their scale of relief.    It might be necessaryfor him in the near future to ask for assistance bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer from the Civil Con-contingencies Fund, as well as for a Bill to enable himto take over the administration of relief in WestHam and to charge the cost to the rates.There was general agreement that persons entitledto relief ought not to  suffer owing to mismanagementby the local government, and that if the latterrefused to administer properly funds which were supplied by the State,  arrangements ought to be madefor the control of the expenditure on relief by theMinistry of Health.The Minister of Health was authorisedto act in the matter in consultationwith the Treasury.-1-
2.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health proposing a revised programmeof legislation for his Ministry for the present session of Parliament (Paper CP.-182 (26)).The Cabinet agreed -(a) To authorise the Minister of health to prepare draft Clauses in connec-tion with Rural Housing, for consid-eration.by the Committee of HomeAffairs, but the Prime Ministerparticularly requested that theChief Whip should be present whenthe matter was discussed by that committee:(b) That the Prime Minister and theMinister of Health should discuss with the Chief Whip the proposal that facilities should be given tothe Births and Death3 RegistrationBill introduced by a Private Member.

The Cabinet had&quot; before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Laboirr proposing that a Mission,composed of two representative employers,  two representatives of Trade Unions, together with anIndependent Chairman and a small Secretariat, shouldbe sent to the United States in the early autumnto enquire into conditions in that country, withspecial regard to working cor itions and industrialrelationships.   The cost of the Mission was estimatedat  5,000 (Paper CP.-235 (26)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thatthe Cabinet Office had circulated this Memorandumwithout, fully observing the requirements laid downin Treasury Circular P.6064 of April 28, 1924,which had been approved by the Cabinet (Cabinet 27(24), Conclusion 4).    He asked that in future therules should be&apos; strictly observed.    In the circum-stances, however, as the amount was a small one,he did not oppose the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal.The Cabinet had no objection to the proposal,which they considered to lie within the competence of the Minister of Labour and the Chancellor of theExchequer, hut invited the Minister of Labour&apos;attention to a suggestion that in any public announcement Canada as well as the United States ofAmerica should be mentioned.
Later in the Meeting the Secretary of State -for Foreign Affairs received a further message from paris to the effect that by an indiscretion the communique which, had been rejected by the cabinet at the earlier Meeting the same day had been allowedto appear in the &quot;Temps&quot;.   Arrangements had alreadybeen made in Paris for the issue of a dementi bythe French Government, and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs at once made arrangements forproper explanations to the British Press.4.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet a message he had received from paris shortly before the Cabinet Meeting (No .216from Mr Phipps), stating that the French Government,in view of tbe French financial situation, were anxious to avoid in the communique, any actual refer-ence to the French internal crisis, and proposing the following formula:-&quot;The British and Frenoh governments have agreed in the present circumstance-stances to postpone the visit whichthe President of the Republic pro-posed to pay next week to His majesty the King &quot;of England, who hopes to renew his invitation at a more favour-able moment&quot; .The Cabinet endorsed the acceptance of this formula by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.

The Cabinet resumed&apos; the discussion begunthe same morning on the question of policy towardsRussia in view of the continued attitude of hostil-ity towards this country evinced by the SovietGovernment in recent years, which had culminatedin the assistance offered to the Trades union council for the purposes of the General Strike andthe contributions forwarded to the Miners&apos;  Federa-tion in sxipport of the Miners Strike.A few copies were handed round of a Memorandumon Anglo-Soviet relations, prepared in the ForeignOffice.. This Memorandum showed, inter alia, that the grant of permission for the remit-tance of funds to this  country to support the illegal and unconstitutional General Strike was a breach of&apos;the Trade Agreement, which is based on anundertaking to refrain from hostile actions orundertakings against Great Britain;    and demonstratedin some detail the intimate interlocking of theSoviet Polit-Bureau, the Communist Party,  the SovietGovernment,  the Third International, and the trades union in Russia.During the discussion reference was made tothe protest by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs against the Soviet&apos;s permit to transferfunds to support the General Strike (F-O. N2367/1687/38of June 7,  1926) .A discussion took place in which every memberof the Cabinet present was asked to express hisopinionThere was complete unanimity that, in view of    ,the malignant hostility to the British Empire of theSoviet Government, repeatedly announced by its
leaders, and acted upon in all parts of the world andon every opportunity, the British Government wouldbe fully justified in breaking off diplomatic rela-tions with that Government,  if this was consideredworth while,&apos; and that the Soviet Government had nosort of claim on our consideration.   But, taking into consideration the many disturbing factors InEurope at the present time?    the credit commitments of British firms to Russia on the strength of recentGovernment assurances that no early change in policy was likely;    the increase in trade with&quot;Russia;    the bearing of a rupture on unemployment and on theminers&apos;  strike;.-  and the difficulty of re-establishingrelations when once &quot;broken off;    a large majority ofthe Cabinet felt that the moment was not opportune for a rupture of diplomatic relations, and that, ona long view of the situation, any immediate political advantages to be obtained thereby would soon beoutweighed by practical disadvantages.    There was general agreement,  however, that steps ought to betaken to enlighten the public as to the menacingcharacter of the Soviet Government&apos;s policy towards-this country.The general view was that,  if diplomatic relations were not to be broken off,  it would notbe worth while to stop the transmission to the minersof funds from Russia, since such action could easily be misrepresented.The Lord President of the Council was author-ised, in replying, to a question in the House of lords the following afternoon, to indicate that commonsense showed that&apos; the Soviet Government had supported the strike as a step toward.s destroying Great Britain;-6-
that their hopes were doomed to disappointment;that it was surprising how people in Great britain could accept the contributions of Russian workers who were far less well paid than themselves;    thatample grounds existed for a rupture of diplomaticnegotiations if this were desired;    but that, onthe whole, the Government thought it better tocontinue to treat the attitude of the Soviet withcontempt, and felt that little or nothing was tobe gained by taking a dramatic step. -In case the Cabinet should wish to re-consider their policy at any time, the Chancellor of the.Exchequer was asked to investigate the position ofthe funds of the  former Russian Imperial government at present-locked up hers,  and the effect thereonof a rupture of the Russian Trade Agreement.

11) t*9.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries covering the Report of an   Expert Committee appointed toexamine the question of the production of poweralcohol from sugar beet (Paper CP.-232 (.26)),and took note that the Report lends no support tothe belief that the production of power alcoholwould be a profitable undertaking at the presenttime even with the assistance o^ a generous subsidy,and that the proposal is not one which the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries can recommend.The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries was authorised to make an announcement to this effect.
I 0 ^9 .   The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (Paper H.A.-13 (26)), covering a draft Supreme Co\irt of Northern Ireland Bill, themain object, of which is to implement an agreement that the salaries of future Judges of the SupremeCourt of Jxidicature of Northern Ireland should bereduced by  500 per annum, but which also.enables.certain other economies in the legal administrationof Northern Ireland to be realised:    together withthe recommendation of the Committee of Home affairs thereon (H.A.C. 10th Conclusions (26)., Para.l).The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the SupremeCourt of Northern Ireland Bill, in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-13(26), subject to any minor drafting alterations, with a view to thepassage of the Bill into law, ifpossible, before the Summer Recess.

. APPENDIX.ANGLO-SOVIET RELATIONS.Memorandum by the Foreign Office.The situation which confronts us has been created bythe action of the Soviet Government in giving the specialpermission which is necessary under its regulations for thetransfer to this country of funds in aid of the general strike.The general strike was of course an Illegal and uncon-stitutional act representing a serious threat to establishedorder and our system of government and whether the moneycame from the Soviet Treasury or from other sources, the granting of permission for its remittance amounts to a breach of the undertaking.on which the Trade Agreement is based to refrain from any hostile actions or undertakings against GreatBritain,     We have protested against it briefly but firmly, andthe question is whether any further action would be useful orbeneficial to this country.It is necessary first to say something about the positionof the so-called Soviet Government and its connection withother bodies in Russia.      It differs from all other governments in not being in reality the supreme authority;    It Is more inthe position of a special committee of administratorsappointed to perform certain specified tasks and to representRussia officially abroad.     There is an elaborate hierachy ofSoviets from which the Soviet Government constitutionallyissues, but in reality the effective rulers of Russia are the controlling authorities in the Communist Party, the onlyPolitical part^r which is allowed to exist.     The leaders of thepart;; rule it with a rod of iron and the policy pursued by theparty is the policy decided upon by its leaders.      The mostimportant organ of the party is the Folitbureau,  which is thereal Cabinet of Russia.
The Communist Party is of course the life blood of theCommunist International;    it is unnecessary to say much onthat point, vfhi h everybody will admit,     What is its actualconnection with the Soviet Government so-called, that council of Administrators or Commissars already mentioned?The president of the Council, the most important person inthe government, is Rikov, who is a member of the all important nolitbureau.     Here is the connection established at the most central point of all.      Kamenev, and Trotsky, othermembers of the government, are also members of the Politbureau.The most important questions of policy are referred to thePolitbureau, which controls in fact the actions of theSoviet Government.-   Even such a matter as the granting ofan important concession to foreign industrial enterprise is submitted to the politbureau.     On the other side it controls the Third International.     Zinoviev,  the notorious Presidentof the Third International,  is a member of the ?olitbureau,and the &quot;oiltbureau controls the International bymeans of a delegation of five of its own members,  includingStalin, who is general secretary of the Communist Party and perhaps the most important of the rulers of Russia.      Clearestof all signs of the intimate connection between the    SovietGovernment,  the Communist -arty and the Third Internationalis the fact that Rikov, the &quot;rime Minister, as It were,  inthe Government, is a member of this delegation from the.Party to the Third International.      He,  in fact, and Kamenevalso, has actually an official position in the government, the?olitbureau and the Third International.It is unnecessary to labour the point further.As Mr. Ramsay MacDonald said In his note  to the SovietGovernment on the famous Zinoviev letter,  &quot;No one who-2-
10 0.L 0 0understands the constitution and relationships ofthe Co.-nm.unist International will doubt its intimateconnection and contact with the Soviet Government&quot;.But it may be well to add that the Trades Unions inRussia, from whom the money is supposed to have coxae,are In effect government institutions or partyinstitutions - the two being in essence the same thing- -and not the product of independent enterprise.     Theyactuair.&apos; have important government functions.     Directconnection between them and the roiitbureau Is establishedby the fact that Tomsk!, Chairman of the Trades UnionsCentral Council, is a member of the Polltbureau.     TheRed International of Labour Unions is simply a differentform of the Third International working throughdifferent machinery.The subordinate local Soviets are responsible, notmerely for local interests, but for the execution within their districts of the orders of the Central Government;they form the highest authority In those districts and though the Soviet Government may argue that they have no responsibility for what they do,  their actions can hardly be regarded as anything but government actions.      the moscow Soviet In issuing a fervent appeal in favour ofthe.general strike was  therefore  guilty of&apos;an act towhich His Majesty&apos;s Government have every right to takestrong exception.Now we come to the source of the money and theresponsibility of the Soviet authorities in
connection with, its remittance hare. We have seen categorical&apos; donials that any of the money sent to this country was provided from Soviet State funds: It is alleged, so far as support for the general strike is concorned,  to have come from the Red Trades Unions funds and collections from workers, and as regards support for the miners from the same source and especially from the wages of the Russian miners. There are one or two elementary calculations which throw some light on the matter. There are some two million industrial workers in Russia and their average monthly wage is just over 40 roubles, or £4 - in other words, the monthly industrial wage bill is nominally £8,000,000; but according to the same authority (the "Trud", the organ of the Central Council of the Red Trade Unions) the purchasing power of that wage bill is only £4,600,000 or 47/- a head per month. Further, the latest official wholesale index for all goods is 200, taking the 1913 level as 100 - in other words the industrial worker in the Soviet Union gets 23/6 pre-war value per month - the equivalent of say 37/- a month or 9/3 a weak in Great Britain at the present moment. It says much for the spirit of self-sacrifice among the Russian workers if they are surrendering, as we are told they are voluntarily doing, a part of this trifling wage for the benefit of their British fellow trade unionists. It is as a matter of fact known that tho contributions are levied under compulsion, often without the consent of the men and at times directly against their wishes. This is not surprising, if only because tho non-payment of wages in Russia is becoming acute. The poverty of the State trusts for which they mostly work is such that wages are falling into arrears.

When we turn to tho funds for the miners the Soviet assertions are even more surprising. Miners in the Soviet Union are the worst paid of  all industrial workers
(except possibly the textile workers) and their wagesxare officially reckoned at 36 roubles a month.     Now noloss than 4,000,000 roubles have been transferred tothis country, allegod to havo boon subscribed by theRussian miners for their follow workers in this country,that is to say the entire wages . for one month of111,000 miners - and it is believed that there are lesssthan 100,000 miners in the whole Union. *It is therefore scarcely credible that the amount ofmoney raised, now amounting to some  380,070 can have boonraised by contributions from the workers wages, certainlyso far as concerns the supposed contributions by theminers.     The funds at the disposal of the Trades Unionsthemselves havo, it is acknowledged, boon drawn upon in anticipation of subscriptions by individuals.     iVe cannotsay whether their available funds are or are not sufficient for the purpose.      If not, the responsibility of the soviet authorities is engaged in yet another form, for the banksare State institutions and advances by them therefore ro-prosont offioial loans.If any part of tha money remitted hero came from government funds, it might be thought that a correspondingitem would have to appear in the Budget - but tho Sovietbudget though   oopious in statistics is not luoid.     -Thelast budget includes tha following items :-Reserve Funds............-..     125.3 million roublesSubsidies    &quot;        ..............        75.6     &quot; &quot;State TreasuryOperations    &apos;..............     S12.8     &quot; TTDeductions for localbudgets..............      245.6      &apos;r TT2   Information just received shows that these figures are not correct.      There were 388,000 workers in thomining industry on January 1st 1926,  and wages have risen to 48 roubles a month.
(This last by tho way is a now item this year).Mow all theso items may ba genuine or they maynot:      it is impossible to toll since only the vaguestexplanations are given and no details of actual expenditure - but there aro 658.3 million roubles(nearly 66 million sterling) which oan bo practicallyallooated at will for any purpose the Soviet Governmentnay choose.One thing only can be definitely brought homoto tha Soviet Government.     By a law dated April14th of this year No. 170 of 1926) - for sums over100 roubles a month &quot;the remittance or transfer of currency values abroad shall only be allowed onpermission being given by the Special CurrencyCommission of tha People&apos;s Commissariat ox Finance&quot;and then only on proof of the necessity of payment for imports, covering current commercial expenses and 11 for fulfilment of official orders etc,&quot;.    Itis on the ground of this lav/ that our protest hasboon basod.V/hat this all amounts to is that technicallytha so-called Soviet Government as such can produce acase, apart from tho permission given.f or the transferof the money, &quot;which, while it cannot bo accepted at its face valuo,  is difficult to refute -No other government in tho world would havereceived or expected tho patience we have shown totha Soviet Government, but we hsiVo found it best not
to take them or their offences against internationalcomity too seriously.      Unquestionably they haveno sort of claim on our consideration and our attitude towards them mast be determined purelyon motives of expediency.    They are, as will berealised from -hat has already been said, amisnamed body;    they are not themselves as a bodyresponsible for the policy of Russia, but they erethe representative body with which the outer worldhas to deal, and, as responsible to a large degreefor the administration of Russia and the satisfaction of her practical needs,.their interest is sometimesdivergent from the interest of the pure revolutionaryand disturber of the order and welfare of othercountries, who finds his expression in the ThirdInternational.      The International has expendedgreat efforts and spent vast sums of money, whichmust of course have been raised by taxation, currencyinflation, the profits of the State foreign trademonopoly and other government means, but its successhas been poor compared with its efforts and therehas always been the hope that the practical considerations of Russian welfare would tend graduallyto assume greater importance with the authoritiesthan the rather unorofitoble ambition of seeingrevolution, misery and disease spring up in everyforeign country.      Since one cannot but believe inthe ultimate power of sanity, there is still hope ofthis kind and the value of contact between Russia
and the outer world lies to a great extent inits effect in increasing the importance oforactical considerations, bringing the rulers-of Russia into touch with outside opinion and bringing home to them the obstacles which therevolutionary side of their work puts in the wayof their practical efforts to improve the welfare of their country.This is all to the good of the world in general as well as of Russia,      From the pointof view of the more immediate interest of thiscountry, there is ti is to be said in favour ofnot breaking off such relations as Russian policyallows us to maintain,     A certain amount of tradeis already in existence between this country sndRussia.      Its value to us in our oresent state of need cannot be dismissed fs negligible and it maybe hoped that it will gradually increase.      british firms have accepted orders on credits covering a considerable period, and these orders,  or thepayment for them, will no doubt be lost in theevent of a complete breach.      .7ha t, on the otherband is to be gained by a breach?      Our main ground of complaint is the propaganda of the Thirdinternational.      now will that be stopped if relations were broken off?      It is no doubt facilitated by thePresence of a  diplomatic mission and of trade agencies--n this country.      But sufficient organisation to maintainalways be maintained or created anew and money can
always be sent in by one channel or another;one war experience is enough to show that nothingshort of a complete censorship and a financialand economic control scrutinising and allowingrr forbidding every business transaction, will suffice to prevent it.      In some ways it is evenprobable that a  breach will lead to an Increaseof antagonism and an intensification of propaganda.The rulers of Russia will feel that &apos; othlng else isto be gainedjfrom us taut the delightful spectacleof revolution and ruin and the counter attractionsof practical economic advantage to Russia will disappear.It must furthermore, not be forgotten that Russia is almost invulneratale economicallyjust as she is invulnerable militarily.      She Isnot to be feared in either aspect and neither/is sheto be attacked with success.      She may cry aloudfor foreign credits or loans with which to buildup her economy, but she can exist- without themand a rupture of trade relations cannot deal hera blow which she cannot support and supportwith ease.      She would not even be incapaciatedif other countries such as Germany and the UnitedStates were to follow us.      AndfLt must be rememberedIthat the Russian and especially the Bolshevik minddoes not attach the same degree of importance tomaterial considerations as we should do ourselves.* Office, S.W.1,J*&apos;e 16th,  192 6.
