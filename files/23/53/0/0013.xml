Thelatter had intimated that in most districts noticeswould be posted either on Saturday or Monday next.The Minister of Labour was asked to notify tothe mine-owners that the Cabinet were profoundlydissatisfied with their failure to make known the wage rates for an 8-hours working day, and that theGovernment must have further particulars before theyparted with control over the passage through Parlia-ment of the  Coal Mines (Hours)  Bill.
2. The Cabinet had before them the Conclusionsof a Meeting of the Cabinet Committee on the Reportof the Royal Commission on the Coal Industry, heldon Thursday, June 24th,  setting forth the presentposition in regard to the various recommendationsof the Royal Commission on which Government action is required or has been promised (Paper CP.-258(26))   (Appendix) .The Cabinet approved the Report of the CabinetCommittee (Paper CP.-258 (26)), subject to the follow! ng:-(a) Paragraph 3 (b).     The functions of theNational Fuel and Power Committee, asset out in the Report of the RoyalCommission, should be exercised by a standing Committee of the Coal AdvisoryCommittee of the Mines Department.(b) Paragraph 6 (i) should read as followe:-That the Reports of the various Researchorganisations should be submitted to theDepartment of Scientific and industrial research, which would make suggestions for co-ordinating their work.(c) Paragraph 10.    The Minister of Healthstated that he was not yet ready to give his considered views on the proposal that Local Authorities should beempowered to trade in coal.Considerable  discussion took place onthe subject, but it was decided to await the Report of the Cabinet Committee after they had discussed the considered viewsof the Minister of Health.As the question was certain to beraised before long in the committee stage of the Eill, strong hope was expressed that tha Cabinet Committeeon the Report of the Coal commission would report in time for further con-sideration by the Cabinet next week.(d) Paragraphs 11 and 15.    The Prime minister asked the Minister of Labour and theSecretary -for Mines to take note of theimportance of setting up the Committeesreferred to in these paragraphs as soonas possible, in order that an announce-ment to this effect might be made duringthe forthcoming Parliamentary discussions.
1G3(e) Paragraph 14.    Profit-sharing.Considerable discussion took place inregard to the question of profit-sharing,and the Prime Minister intimated that before long be proposed to refer thegeneral question of profit-sharing in industry&apos;to a Committee under theCommittee of Civil Research,    In themeantime, so far as the coal indusrty was concerned, it was decided to adoptthe suggestion of the Cabinet Committeethat the Minister of Labour should, inthe first instance, circulate a Memo-randum on Model Profit-sharing schemes which might be suitable for adoption by Colliery Companies.(f) Paragraph 18.    The Secretary for Mineswas asked to discuss with the Ministerof Education the question of the regula-tions governing the qualifications of mine.managers, which, according to theReport of the Cabinet Committee, hasalready been taken up with the Boardof Mining Examinations.(g) Paragraph 31.

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that the King of Spain wouldbe arriving in London the same day.    Sir austen chamberlain reminded the Cabinet of the importance,if possible, of dissuading Spain from leaving theLeague of Nations.    There were two other questionswhich might conceivably be referred to by His majesty in conversation.    One was the desire of Spain for an exchange of Gibraltar for Ceuta, a matter on whichKing Alfonso had occasionally spoken to the MilitaryAttach!).   The other was the Spanish desire for an alteration in the Tangier Statute which would ineffect hand the Tangier zone over to Spain.    Neitherproposal was practicable.    Sir Austen also referredbriefly to the economic penetration of Portugal bySpain.   He asked his colleagues, if the opportunityarose in conversation, to express gratitude for theassi stance&apos; given by the SpaniBh representative onthe Council of the League of Nations, and to pointout the difficulty of securing unanimity at theLeague of Nations in obtaining a permanent seat forSpain,

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, as an adjournment of the technical committee on Reduction and Limitation of.Armamentsat  Geneva had been imminent, Lord Onslow had not as yet been asked to proceed to Geneva, though itmight be necessary for him to do so on the re-assembly of the Committee.   Progress at Geneva wasslow, and a number of rather impracticable sugges-tions had been put forward.    Sir Austen Chamberlainhimself had had some discussion with M. Briand andM. Boncour in regard to the French proposals,which had been postponed until September, to thegreat relief of the German Government.    He had now come to the conclusion that the only course was to let the French discuss their proposals and then toput questions  to them which would soon reveal theirimpracticability.   The Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence, under the Chairman-ship of Lord Cecil (of which Lord Onslow was recently made a member) had been re-assembled to watch the proceedings  at Geneva.-6-

Mussolini was responsible for thedemands and threats alleged to have been made bythe Italian Minister at Durazzo (Foreign office telegram, Mr. 0&apos;Reilly, No.18, dated June 25th).It was possible either that the Albanian PrimeMinister was misquoting the Italian Minister or thatthe latter was acting ahead of his instructions and authority.   Appropriate action had been taken bythe Secretary of State.

in,Bit ion the Committee considered in detail a memorandumby the Secretary for Mines recounting the position inregard to the various recommendations of the RoyalCommission on which Government action is required or has been promised.  (CP. 251 (26)), and had before them the Report of the Committee of Civil Research on theappointment of a Fuel and Power Committeeand other matters (CP. 141 (26)).1,      THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GIVE sympathetic consideration TO ANY PROPOSALS OF THE FUEL RESEARCHBOARD FOR THE FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF PROCESSES OF LOWTEMPERATURE CARBONISATION ON A COMKERCIAL SCALE.LORD BALFOUR called attention to the followinganswer to a Parliamentary Question which had been.given that same afternoon by Lord Eustace Percy on behalfof the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research:&quot;  Ln the opinion of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research,it is doubtful whether any of theexisting schemes for low-temperaturecarbonisation, though they contain manyelements of promise, have as yet gotbeyond the experimental stage.      Low-temperature &apos; carbonisation cannot, there-fore,  as yet form part of any scheme forthe re-organisation of the coal trade.As soon as any process or processes of low*- -temperature carbonisation are shown tobe commercially practicable, it cannot be doubted that private enterprise willrapidly develop them.      In the meanwhile,the Department of Scientific andIndustrial Research is carrying on its owninvestigation at the fuel research station,and is giving its assistance in testing*   ...        .    results which are obtained elsewher.&quot;(Hansard Col.197 No.89 Cols.551,532).The Committee endorsed this answer as reflecting thepresent position and agreed to recommend to the Cabinet:
(a) That the Department of Scientific and industrial research should continue to keen a carefulwatch on all experimental processes for the betterutilisation of coal and should be adequately,financed   for this purpose;(b) That if and when the Department of scientific and Industrial Research is satisfied with an experimental process offering real promise ofsuccess, His Majesty&apos;3 Government should beprepared to help to cerry such experiment through to the stage necessary to prove it commercially;(c) That for the purposes of (b) the Mines department should he allocated  250,000 from the sum of 3 million earmarked by the Treasury for theassistance.of the mining Industry;(d) That the sum so allocated should be spent bythe Mines Department on the advice of the.-Department of Scientific and Industrial research and in consultation with any Department, such asthe Admiralty, which may be specially interested.2.      THAT AN ANNOUNCEMENT SHOULD.BE MADE BY GOVERNMENTTHAT IF AND WHEN THE FUEL RESEARCH BOARD IS ABLE T(J)REPORT THAT A SMOKELESS SEMI-COKE IS AVAILABLE AS SUITABLEAS RAW COAL THE DEPARTMENTS WHICH ARE LARGE USERS OF coal should BE INSTRUCTED TO PURCHASE THE SEMI-COKE INPREFERENCEThe Committee agreed to recommend:the acceptance of this proposal subject to these -coke being suitable -in quality and price.3.      THAT A NATIONAL FUEL AND POWER COMMITTEE SHOULD be formed FOR THE PURPOSE OF A CONTINUOUS AND COMPREHENSIVESURVEY OF THE HEAT,  LIGHT AND POWER REQUIREMENTS OF THECOUNTRY.The Committee agreed to recommend:(a) That the proposal to set up a NationalFuel and Power Committee as a StandingSub-Committee of the Committee of civil research (CP. 141 (26)) should be rejected.(b) That the functions of the National fuel and Power Committee as set out in the Reportof the Royal Commission should be exercised by   a Ctimding    Committee :of the Mines Department,in association with the Ministry of Transport(for electrlciitjr)&apos;  and with representativesof the gas and olIU industries.
4 o nX 0 4/ \   That the terras of reference of the StftadLiJajg Committee^ should be:&quot;To consider and advise upon broad questions affecting the economic use of fuels, their; conversion into other forms of energy andcognate problems, Laving regard to the needsof  industry as a whole and in the light of technical developments.&quot;(el)   That specific problems respecting particular industriesarising out of the deliberations of the Advisory Committeeshould be referred to the Committee of Civil Researchfor examination and report.4, &apos;   THAT THE RESEARCH ORGANISATION OP THE COLLIERY OWNERS,SHOULD BE EXPANDED    WITH INCREASED FUNDS PROVIDED PARTLY BY TPIEOWNERS AND PARTLY BY THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND industrial research.5.     THAT THE WORK OF THE FUEL RESEARCH DIVISION OF THE DEPARTMENTOF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH SHOULD BE PRESSED forward and PROVIDED WITH AMPLE FUNDS.6.      THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL research should BE MADE RESPONSIBLE FOR CO-ORDINATING THE VARIOUS BRANCHESOF RESEARCH WORK.The Committee agreed to recommend:-(i) That the functions of the Department of scientific and Industrial Research should not be to co-ordinate the various research organisations, butthat the reports of these.organisations should besubmitted to the Department  which would make suggestions for co-operation between them.(ii) That with a view to stimulating research intocoal getting (as distinct from coal using)the Department of Scientific and Industrial research should be empowered to spend up to  50,000(from the  3 million earmarked by the Treasury)on the basis of roughly  1 from State funds to  3 from colliery owners.7.     THAT LEGISLATION SHOULD BE PASSED TO FACILITATE DESIRABLEAMALGAMATIONS.This is dealt with in the Mining Industry Bill.3,     THAT LEGISLATION  SHOULD BE PASSED TO IMPOSE COMPULSORYAMALGAMATIONS AFTER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS.This is dealt with in the Mining Industry Bill.
i Q Q.10 6vii.es.viii.ution,9.      THAT  GOAL ROYALTIES SHOULD BE ACQUIRED BY THESTATE.It is not proposed, to proceed, with this atpresent (See Cabinet 41 (26) Conclusion g)).10.      THAT LOCAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD BE EMPOWERED TOTRADE IN COAL.The Committee considered the Report of theSub-Committee on Municipal Trading (Appendix toC.F.  122  (26)  and R.C.C.   (26)  52).The Minister&quot; of Health stated that if theCommission&apos;s Report is to be carried out the methodindicated by the Sub-Committee&apos; seemed the most suitable,but there were obvious and important objections toembarking on municipal trading in coal.      Pressurev/ould follow in favour of trading in milk, bread andboots.The Lord President of the Council suggested using the Food Council for enchiiries into the allegations of profiteering in coal.The President of the Board of Trade stated that public enquiries had already been held but without goodresult.      He thought the remedy lay in direct salesby colliery       companies to the consumers,The Secretary for Mines stated that the agitation against the retailers of coal was persistent and wide-spread and not confined to one political party.      Heshould like to see some steps taken to counter the coalmerchants 0
The Committee agreed:To await the considered views ofthe Minister of Health on tho subject.11,      THAT COLLIERIES v:;OULD BE WELL ADVISED TO ESTABLISHCO-OPERATIVE SELLING ASSOCIATIONS.The Committee agreed:To request the Mines Department to submit tothe Prime Minister as soon as possible termsof reference and names of suitable membersof a Committee to investigate sellingassociations.12.      THAT THE QUESTION  SHOULD 3E EXPLORED OF ESTABLISHINGAN OFFICIAL SYSTEM FOR THE SAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF COAL.The Committee agreed:To request the Department -of Scientific andIndustrial Research to prepare for theconsideration of the Cabinet a report on the steps necessary to be taken to set up anofficial system for the sampling and analysis of coal.13.      THAT A JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE MINISTRY OF transport and THE MINES DEPARTMENT SHOULD BE APPOINTED IN ORDER TODO WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO EFFECT A GREATER MEASURE of standardisation OF WAGONS?    AN INCREASED PROVISION of wagons OF  LARGER CAPACITY,  AND AF  EXTENSION OF THEPRINCIPLE OF COMMON USER.The C ommit to e a gr e od :To request the; Ministry of Transport, afterconsultation with the Secretary for Minos, tosubmit to the Prime Minister as soon aspossible terras of reference and names ofsuitable members of a Committee to carryout this recommendation.
14.      THAT PROFIT SHARING SCHEMES SHOULD BE MADE 1 ;J&quot;COMPULSORY AT ALL COLLIERIES.The Committee were reminded that a clause hasbeen inserted in the Mining Industry Bill to facilitate the establishment of a profit-sharing scheme at anycolliery that desires to have one.      The Government havealso undertaken to appoint a Committee to examine the profit-sharing proposals of the Commission and alsothe question of family allowances,     But it is hardlypracticable to prooeed with this until the stoppage is over,The Committee agreed:To request the Ministry of Labour to circulate a Memorandum on Model Profit-sharing schemes suitable for adoption by colliery companies,15,      THAT THERE MAY BE AN ADVANTAGE IP THE TWO parties agree IN HAVING A NATIONAL WAGES BOARD WHICH SHALL bring in ALSO IMPARTIAL ELEMENTS OUTSIDE THE COAL industry itself.In view of the strong dissent of both parties,the Government have decided not to proceed with this at present,16,      THAT GREATER ELASTICITY SHOULD 3E INTRODUCED INTOTHE LAW GOVERNING THEiiOURS OF WORK UNDERGROUND,This question has been merged in the largerquestion of the length of the working day which isbeing dealt with in the Bill before the House.17,      THAT THE MINEOwNERS AND MINERS SHOULD CONFERTOGETHER WITH A  VIEW TO CONSIDERING,   IN CONJUNCTION WITHTHE MINISTRY OF LABOUR, PRACTICABLE STEPS FOR SECURING THETRANSFER OF UNEMPLOYED MINERS FROM ONE DISTRICT TOANOTHER AND FOR GIVING SUCH KIHEES THE FIRST CHANCEOF OBTAINING SUCH COLLIERY EMPLOYMENT IN PREFERENCE TO the recruiting OF OUTSIDE labour.
The Mining Industry Bill gives the Ministerof Labour power to make regulations on this subject.18.      THAT THE HIKES DEPARTMENT SHOULD CONSIDER THEREGULATIONS GOVERNING THE QUALIFICATIONS OF MINEMANAGERS.This has already been taken up with the Board forMining Examinations who are arranging conferences withthe education authorities concerned.19.      THAT THE STATE AS ROYALTY OWNER SHOULD ENSURE that adequate PROVISION WILL BE MADE FOR THE HOUSING OFTHE WORKERS.It is not proposed that the State shall nationaliseroyalties and the subject &quot;of housing does not, therefore,arise here, but under Recommendation 22.I,      20.      THAT ROYALTIES SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE WELFAREFUND AND THAT PITHEAD BATHS FINANCED OUT OF THE  WELFAREFUND SHOULD 3E MADE GENERALLY COMPULSORILY.Part III of the Mining Industry Bill gives effectto this recommendation.21.      THAT PIT  COMMITTEES SHOULD BE MADE COMPULSORY BYRS.    THE REVIVAL OF THE APPROPRIATE PORTIONS (MP PART II OF THEMINING INDUSTRY ACT,  1920.The Government have never committed themselves to legislation on this subject.     All they have undertaken to do is &quot;to prepare a scheme for the establishmentof pit Committees.&quot;     The mineowners have indicated thatthey are willing to see if arrangements cannot be made9for the general provision of pit committees on a voluntary basis, and in these circumstances it is clearthat no action can be taken by&apos;the Government until there has been an opportunity of discussing the matter with both sides of the Industry.
-0 PtvESSHT    22t      thai  THE GOVhTRLTELT SHOULD BE READY TO TAKE all practicable MEASURES FOR THE ASSISTANCE OF ANYLA OUR THAT MAY BE DISPLACED OR FOR FACILITATING&apos; ITS TRANSFER AND TO PROVIDE SUCH FUNDS AS MIGHTBE REQUIRED FOR THOoE PURPOSES ,This subject will be watched by the Ministry ofLabour.
