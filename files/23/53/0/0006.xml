APPENDIX.EGYPT.Telegram from Foreign Office to Lord Lloyd (Cairo), dated june 3rd.  1926, 6 p.m.No.  202.Urgent.Your telegram No.  269 of June 3rd.If Zaghloul adheres to this decision not to seek Prime Ministership, you will we presume pursuepolicy foreshadowed in your earlier conversations with Adly, encourage him to form ministry and to co-operate with you in pursuit of common Interests ofEgypt and ourselves.If Zaghloul again changes his mind, you willhave to announce the decision of His Majesty&apos;s -Government to him.His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully con-sidered observations contained In your telegram No. -268of June 3rd.      They have decided that our draft Is a shorter and clearer presentation of our case.      Theyapprove however inclusion of reference to officials and agreements with foreign powers.There remains the vital question whether the termsof our draft are such as to permit Zaghloul now toproffer dishonestly and with intention of later break-ing his promises the assurances which he refused togive in his conversation wi th you.This was not our intention.      We recited what had actually happened and gave our decision on the situ-ation thus created.      Last hour assurances given under
pressure would be valueless and cannot be accepted.Our feeling is that his attitude in conversationwith you was decisive as to his real intentions.To make this clear insert in our draft contained inmy telegram No. 195- after the words &quot;in the lightof the events of your last administration&quot; thefollowing (begins) I am bound to make it plain thatthe oonviction left upon my mind by our conversationwas such that I cannot advise His Majesty^ Governmentto reopen the discussion (ends).Opening words of next paragraph should read&quot;1 find it necessary to add&quot;.
