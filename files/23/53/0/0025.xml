IIMATES OPFIGHTINGhvioes .int Con-derationgviOtlSforence:biret 546), Con-conclusion d.)1. The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe following decision taken on July 28th last(Cabinet 48 (26), Conclusion 16):-&quot;That  110,000,000 should be taken as the total figure to be aimed atin preparing the Estimates of theServic e Departments, and that theSecretary of State for War, .theSecretary of State for Air and theFirst Lord of the Admiralty, inconsultation with their Chiefs ofStaff to such extent as they might deem desirable, should concert their estimates with a view to arrangingbetween themselves the incidence ofthe reduction on the Estimates ofeach Department, having regard tothe requirements of Imperial defence as a whole .&quot;Reference was also made to an earlier statementsetting forth the general lines of the procedure to be adopted for joint consideration of the Esti-mates of the three Fighting Services,  made by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech in the house of Commons on April 26th,  in terms whichhad been agreed with the Service Ministers.The Cabinet were informed that the Ministers atthe head of the Service Departments had not yet met,as it had been necessary to complete their respectiveEstimates to a certain stage before they could use-fully be discussed in common-   The preparation ofthese Estimates had been delayed, among other reasons,owing to the coal strike, which reacted more particu-larly on the amounts to be spent on naval construction in the present year,  thereby affecting expenditureon construction in &quot;future years,    A meeting of theService Ministers had been arranged to take placeon Thursday, November 4th,  out had been postponed until the following week, owing to the indispositionof the Secretary of State for Air.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while reeognis-ing the great economies already effected within thelast few years in the Service Estimates,  appealed to his colleagues, in view of the very serious financial outlook, which he explained to  the Cabinet,to do their utmost towards realisation of the maximumfigure of  110,000,000 suggested in Cabinet 48 (26)Conclusion 16.    As regards the question of the incidence of expenditure between this year and next,the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked that the service departments should carry out their programmes withall convenience and speed, without at present makingadjustments between this year and next, leaving tothe Treasury such minor adjustments as it might befound convenient to make at the last moment.\\N
OFduringBIKE.ust 24Con-n 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health on tha subject of Loans toBoards of Guardians in areas af fen ted by the coal strike (Paper CP .-362 (26)), in which the question was raised of the provision which is required to bemade immediately Parliament re-assembles to enablethe Ministry to make advances to Boards of Guardiansto meet current expenditure on relief due to the coalstoppage,  as well as the question of scales of reliefby Boards of Guardians.After careful consideration of the programmeof Parliamentary business, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of Health (in-con-sultation as necessary with theSecretary of State for Scotland, as responsible for the Scottish Boardof Health)  should base his Supple-mentary Estimate on the assumptionthat there could be only one Con-solidated Fund Bill in the present session, that is  to say, he shouldmake provision for relief up to theend of the frtoa-neri^d. year:(b) That arrangements should be made,in regard to Parliamentary business,so that the Consolidated Fund bill could receive the Royal Assent not later than November 22nd:(c) That, on the question of scales of relief, the Minister of Health, while -not excluding the possible necessityfor more drastic action if the strikeshould continue indefinitely, should confine himself at present to puttingpressure upon the Guardians to re-consider their expenditure in every direction as applications are madeto him fur further borrowing powers.He should not, however, except in very special circumstances, refuseborrowing powers because a reductionbelow the Circular scale cannot be  -secured by agreement.

3.    In the course of the discussion on thequestion referred to in the previous Conclusion,  thePrime Minister appealed to all his colleagues not toask for any further S\ipplementary Estimates (i.e.,beyond those required for relief, and by the Post-mas ter-General for broadcasting) before Christmas.If there were any unavoidable Supplementary Estimateshe asked his colleagues to let him know without delay.-4-
jypFRIAL 4 . The Lord President of the Council, aa Chairmanof the Committee of Prime Ministers and Reads of delegations at the Imperial Conference which ist 52       dealing with the question of Inter-Imperial Relations,Con-don 2.)     stated that progress was being made, though in the face of considerable difficulties.The Secretary of State for Dominions affairs said he felt it his duty to report immediately tothe Cabinet the result of a private conversation which he had had with the Prime Minister of theDominion of Canada which seemed to indicate thatMr Mackenzie King intended to raise at the Committeeon Inter-Imperial Relations not only the question ofthe status of the Governor-General but also that ofthe possible establishment of British High Commis-sioners in the Dominions.   Mr Mackenzie King&apos;s ideaappeared to be that what remained of the Governor-general s functions as an agent of the BritishGovernment in the Dominions should be withdrawnonlyand that his status in future should be^that of arepresentative of the King.    A corollary of thiswould be      an       increase in the direct coromunica-tion between the Dominion and Home Governments,from which the  establishment of a High commissioner to look after British interests in each Dominionmight pe rha ps  fo 11ow.The Cabinet were informed that the same question was likely to arise on a. Memorandum which theSecretary had received for circulation from theIrish Free State Delegation that morning just beforethe Cabinet Meeting.The Cabinet felt that the whole questionrequired careful consideration, and invited the
Lord President of the Council, if the question were raised at the Committee on Inter-Imperial Relations,to bring it before them, with an expression of theviews held on the matter by the British representa-tives on that Committee.
5. The Cabinet had a short discussion in regardto the present  phase of the  Coal Situation.Reference was made to a Memorandum (Paper C.F.-368 (26).), which Ministers were invited to return tothe Secretary as soon as read.The Secretary for Mines  said that, as a resultof a meeting of the Coal Committee on the previous evening, he had seen the Mining Association and had put strongly to them the desirability of bringingdown the price of coal, and had hinted that if theydid not do so the Government would have to take some action.    He hoped for a favourable reply.The Cabinet felt that there were no decisions which they could usefully take at the moment, butthe Prime Minister warned his -colleagues of thepossibility that in the event of an approach fromthe Miners&apos; Federation he might find it necessaryto summon a Special Meeting of the Cabinet.
iousCon-6. The Cabinet bad before then? a Memorandumby the Minister of Health fPaper CP.-357 (26))s tat inn that he and the Chancellor of theExchequer had agreed that action in regard torj \ the T-Tousing Subsidy should be taken as proposedin his Memorandum CP,-290 (.26),  except that thesubsidy in respect of houses completed afterthe 1st October, 1927, under the Wheatley Act of1924, would be reduced by  1:10:0 instead of by  1,and stating further that he had not yet reachedcomplete agreement with tha Chancellor upon theadministrative action described in the Memorandum,although he hoped to reach a conclusion shortly.The Cabinet were informed that, since theMemorandum, was circulated, agreement had beenreached on the outstanding points.The Cabinet took note of theMemorandum (Paper CP .-357 (26)).whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 3,  1926.
