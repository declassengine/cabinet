APPENDIX.HOVERING LETTER FROM Mr CHURCHILL TO&quot;       M. CAILLAUX.4th July, 1926.Dear Monsieur Caillaux,It being Sunday and my colleagues scattered, I cannot00 further than to say that I will consult them tomorrow morning on the enclosed Interchange of letters.    From our point of view they go very far and will expose me toaccusations of having been worsted again by the Americans .Nevertheless,  if everything else is settled on the linesdiscussed between Niemeyer and Pouyanne, I think it possibleI may succeed in persuading the Cabinet to agree.    AnyhowI will 1st you know by telephone through the French Embassybefore four o&apos;clock tomorrow.With good wishes,Believe, me,(Intd.) W.S.C.DRAFT LETTER FROM THE FRENCH MINISTER OFFINANCE TO THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER.Dear Mr. Chancellor,In assuming the responsibility of signing the agreement for the settlement of the French debt and thereby accepting the payment of the annuities fixed on the sole credit ofFrance, I feel bound to explain that, in the opinion of theFrench Government, the future possibility of making transferacross the exchange of the amounts required to assure the fulfilment of the debt settlements with the United Statesand Great Britain seems inevitably to depend largely onthe continued transfer of receipts from Germany under the dawes Plan.    If, therefore, through the fault of Germany,such receipts should cease completely or for the greaterpart, a new situation would be created and  the FrenchGovernment is bound to reserve the right in such an event ofasking the British Government to reconsider the question inthe light of all the circumstances then prevailing.RAFT LETTER FROM THE CHANCELLOR OF THEEXCHEQUER TO THE FRENCH MINIR^R OF FINANCE.Dear M, Caillaux,I have received your letter of the  .... July.   As I have explained, His Majesty&apos;s Government must maintain the position that the settlement which we have arrived at of the French war debt to this countv-  depends, like that debt itself, on the sole credit of France.   You will realise that in the hypo the t-ical circumstances that you mention, Great Britain wouldalready have suffered a diminution of the receipts from the dawes Scheme, which we have taken into account in arriving
at the various debt settlements, and this is one of the factors which would have to be borne in mind in the eventof any reconsideration of the question being desired by theFrench Government.    Subject to this I take note of the state-ment that yon make .In the event of any modification being made,  I should expect, in order to secure equal treatment among creditors,that other creditors of Prance would take into consideration a corresponding modification of debts due to them.
