The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (C ,P.-90 (35))circulated late on the previous evening, raisingcertain points for decision with * view to theforthcoming Debate in the Hous e of Commons onForeign Affairs,    The first point which he raised,and which resulted from a Meeting of the ministerial committee on &quot;Defence Requirements on the previous afternoon, related to the lord President of theCouncil&apos;s declaration of November 28th last thatPis Majesty&apos;s Government &quot;are determined in noconditions to accept any position of inferioritywith regard to whatever air force may be raised inGermany in the future&quot;.As the result of the discussion,  the formulasuggested by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs was modified to read as in Conclusion (b)below.&quot;&quot;he second, proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was to include in the openingstatement a passage which coupled the possibilityof agreement limiting the air forces  of GreatBritain, France,  Italy and Germany on the basis  ofparity with the further pr-omotion of negotiationsfor an Air Pact.    This,  it was pointed out, wouldinvolve a reversion of the Cabinet&apos;s decision thatan Air Pact should necessarily form part of a general settlement which would include the Eastern Pact,  theAustrian Pact, and general armament limitation.mhe results of the discussion on this point aregiven in Conclusions  (c) to (e) below.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) That as an undertaking had been given that a representative of the Government,would open the Debate, the PrimeMinister should be the first speaker and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, wind up the Debate onbehalf of the Government?-3-
ft) That the statement to be madePrime Minister should includeon the following lines:-by thea passageIE ?Y ^FE SECRETARY,Or. the urgent recommendation-Rctation of a CommitteeIgr the Chairmanshipffchp Secretary of Statefr the Colonies, which had.Bset up by the Minis-lial Committee on Defencerairements to consider1ftions relating to theipansion of the Royal Airfree, and which met in thefternoon after the Cabineteting, the Prime MinisterBped to omit the lastfteen words  of (b) ,i&apos;e Committee finds thatie industry can deal withie output required in thpSt] two years withoutij-organisa tion.flntlld.)  M.P,A.W.(c)fIn the debate last November certainestimates were put forward on thebasis  of our then information,  asto the strength of bhe German airforce, and the assurance was givenby the Lord. President on behalf ofthe Government that in no cireurn-stances will we accept any positionof inferiority with regard to whateverair force may be raised in Germany inthe future..    In the course o^ the visitwhich the Foreign Secretary and the .Lord Privy Seal paid, to Perl in at theend  of March,  the German Chancellorstated (as the Rouse was informed onApril 3rd) tha4- Germany &apos;had reachedparity&apos; with Great Britain In the air.vVhatever may be the exact interpreta-tion of this phrase in terms of air strength,  it undoubtedly indicates that the German force has been expanded to a point  considerably in excess ofthe estimates which .we were able toplace before thc House last year, andthat is a grave fact of which we havetaken immediate notice.    It will not bedesirable to use the debate today asthe occasion for further details, asit is intended very, shortly to providea farther occasion when the more technicalaspects of this matter may have- to begone into.   Put the Government takes theearliest opportunity, at the openingof the present debate, to state publicly that the Lord Presidents declarationstands:    His Majesty&apos;s Government arealready taking steps for further expansion and acceleration of the british air Force to fulfil this declaration,as well as for the reconsideration ofthe organisation of output which willbe required,&quot;That,  in view of the negotiations inprogress between the Governments  ofFrance and the U,S.S,R.,  it would be inadvisable, without having an opportunityto ascertain the views of the French and.Italian Governments, to make any definitestatement of policy coupling the possi-bility of agreement limiting the airforces  of Great Britain, France,  Italyand Germany on the basi^  of parity withthe further promotion of negotiationsfor an Air Pact,    It might be recalled,however,  that at the Stresa conference the representatives of the three Govern-ments had agreed to continue &quot;activelythe study of the question with a viewto the drafting of * Pact between thefive Powers mentioned in the LondonC ommunique......, &quot; , G ermany .  o^ cours e,being one of the five Rowers .    It mightbe stated also that this study was being pursued:
3 5 j.(d) That, particularly in view       thestatement which Ferr Fit ler has announced that he intends to makeat out the middle of the month on german Foreign Policy, and of the informalMeetings now in progress with PrimeMinisters  of the Dominions,  it shouldbe made clear that the London (Anglo-French)  Declaration of February 3rdhad not been altered by anything that had happened at Stresa and stillrepresented the policy o-p the Govern-roent notwithstanding that circumstances had since changed.    In spite of allthat had happened, the Declaration ofFebruary 3rd. stands, and the Governmentwould welcome any indication from germany that she was prepared, to co-operate.Some discreet reference might even bemade to a semi-official communicationissued in Berlin, which had. appeared,in the Press  of even date:(e) That it should, further be made clearthat the invitation given by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs during his visit to Berlin for the German Governmentto send, representatives to London totake part, in Conversations  on naval armaments still held good.-5-

The two Ministers, however, were satisfiedthat there was no greater prospect now than therewas at the Imperial Conference of 19 30 of sect-ringagreement among the Dominions on any further changes,  and. they did not think any useful purpose would, be served by bringing the matter again beforethe Dominions in any form,  although it would beimpossible to prevent a Dominion Representativeraising the question at ^he forthcoming Meetingsif he so desired.The Cabinet approved the Memorandum bythe Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs  (CP.  81 (35))as summarised above.
