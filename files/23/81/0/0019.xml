6. The Cabinet had before them a Most, secret memorandum (C.P.-72 (35))&apos; circulated by the PrimeMinister and prepared by Sir Claud Schuster as theresult of inter-departmental discussions on variousRegency quest 1 ons which it was proposed to discuss with the representatives of the Dominions who wouldbe in this  country on the occasion of His Majesty&apos;sJubilee,The Secretary of State -&quot;or Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that it was propose^ that thediscussions should take place with the &quot;Prime ministers of the Dominions  individually rather than collectively.mhe Prime Minister made it clear that the cabinet were not asked to commit, themselves at the present stage to legislation here irrespective of the attitudeof the Dominions, and that the only decision desiredwas as recorded below.^he Cabinet agreed  That during the Silver Jubilee celebrations-b rat ions the Secretary of State -&quot;orDominion Affairs should be authorisedto consult the representatives o^ theDominions on the Regency questions raised in C,P.-72 (35).

8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of labour (C .P.-7 3 (35)) bringingbefore his  colleagues the question of makingadditional payments  in respect of the JubileeCelebrations on May 6th to those unemployed who arein receipt of allowances from the unemployment assistance Board.   With regard to those unemployedwho are in receipt of public assistance, somelocalimportant/authorities had already arranged to make payments as the result of a Circular issued by theMinister of Health, and a somewhat .similar Circularhad been issued by the Scottish Department of Health.The Unemployment Assistance Board desired to give ana dextra allowance of 2/6 in respect of Jubilee week to all persons receiving an allowance from the Board.mhe cos4- would be about  100,000, an^ the Chancellorof the Fx chequer raised no objection to the action proposed by the Board.    A difficulty arose, however,in connection with unemployed in receipt of Unemploy-men t Benefit, who would receive no extra grants, thuscreating among a million unemployed a sense of grievance which might militate against the successthe Jubilee Celebrations,   ^he cost of paving ans dadditional 2/6 to all recipients of UnemploymentBenefit would be about  150,000, but the Chancellorof the exchequer felt that he was unable to agree toany extension of concessions beyond those classeswhose payments were dependent on need.    mhe Ministerof Labour therefore desired the decision of theCabinet as to whether he should inform the TJnemploy-?ment Assistance Board that the Government raised noobjection to the payments contemplated .In the course of the discussion the.Cabinet were reminded that at Christmas-time Boards of Guardianshad. been in the habit  of making an additional special
allowance to persons in receipt o* relief, and it. waspossible that *he Unemployment Assistance Poard, whenChristmas came, might wish to adopt the same practice.There had never been any grievance on the part ofpersons in receipt of unemployment relief that theydid not receive a corresponding additional allowance.It was suggested that the distinction could be sustainedon the ground that persons in receipt,  o^ public assist-ance were in actual need and that this need increased at such a time as Christmas or the Silver Jubilee.The Cabinet were remind.eo, however, that to obtainthe additional allowance it had been necessary to goto the Poor Law authorities, whereas any allowanceUnemplo:/raen4&apos;granted, by the &quot; /        Assistance ^oard would be drawn from the Unemployment Insxirance authority:    that isto say,  the same authority as the normal unemploymentinsurance allowance.The Cabinet were informed that any extension ofthe principle of an additional allowance beyond theUnemployment Assistance Eoard would involve legisla-tion,  during the passage of which it v-0uld be difficultto resist the extension of the principle to personsin receipt of other forms  of relief, such as Old age pensions, Widows&apos; Pensions and Wounds Pensions,  thetotal cost of which would be very heavy,    It wassuggested that the easiest line on which to defend theproposal to limit the additional allowances of theUnemployment Assistance Poard was that  legislation would be required.In the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState for War reported, an additional difficulty arisingout of the fact that territorial troops were to becalled up on May 6th.    Unemployed Territorials called up would lose their unemployment allowance ^or that-day, and the pay they received as soldiers would be
less than what they would have received, in umemployment pay,^he Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister       Labour shouldbe authorised to inform theUnemployment  Assistance Board thatthe G-ov eminent raised, no objectionto the payments they contemplated:(b) That it was not the intention ofthe Cabinet that an unemployedTerritorial soldier should losemoney by the fact that he was  called up for the day:    that the Secretaryof State ^or War and the Minister oflabour should try to find, a solution,but that, before taking action, theyshould report to the Cabinet the resultsof their enquiries.
