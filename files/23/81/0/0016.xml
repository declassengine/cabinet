Reference was made at the Cabinet to press reports of firing on a Mohammedan mob at Karachias the result of which a considerable number of casulties had occurred.

The Secretaryof State thought it would be advisable that the PrimeMinister or the Lord President 0* the Council shouldpreside over the first meeting, and. suggested that theMinisters primarily concerned, namely, the Presidentof the ^oard of Trade, the Minister o^ Agricultureand Pisheries and. himself, should   be appointed as aCabinet Committee.for the purpose of conducting thediscussions.

The First Commissioner also setforth in his Memorandum other arrangements he proposedto make in connection with the Celebrations.The Cabinet were informed that owing to thenumber of members of the House of Lords who desiredto attend the Westminster Hall ceremony on May 9th,the timing of the processions would be ratherdifficult, more especially as the Speaker desired that the House of Commons should not meet before11.0 a. rn.      The programme would be greatly facilitated if it could oe put forward half an hour.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That  the Home Secretary should speak to the Lord Chamberlain in order toascertain whether The King would be willing to arrive at Westminster Hallat 12 noon instead of 11.30 a.m.The Home Secretary was also asked tosubmit the preference of the cabinet for Levee Dress on this occasion.(b) That on the occasion of Their Majesties&apos;visit to Westminster Hall,  the first commissioner of Works should arrange to sell places in the stands which arebeing erected in The Mall and to devotethe proceeds to the British CharitiesAssociation.

kg ikon andItebl industry.f previous reference:Cabinet 5 (34)Conclusion 6).9.    The President of the Board of Trade recalled that for some time past duties of 33-g- per cent.ad valorem had been imposed on iron and steel 2 3 7products.      The industry had made a great effortat re-organisation which had proceeded rapidly,especially after the appointment of Sir Andrew Duncanas an independent Chairman of the ExecutiveCommittee of the Federation. In 1934 there hadbeen a substantial increase in imports of iron andsteel products which had continued this year,continental countries having continuously reduced their export prices.      An effort in which theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade himself had helped had been made toreach an agreement with the Continental Steel Cartelfor regulating the volume of imports of continentalsemi-finished steel into this country and the shareof this country in the overseas market for finished &apos;steel goods.      This attempt had broken down, and theImport Duties Advisory Committee had Recommendedan increase of the duty from 33-3- per cent.y(to 50AqMiVctiu*.no. jp-Q^ So to bo^/per cent.       When this report was received onFebruary 28th, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of Trade, with a view to avoiding if possible the imposition of such a high level of duties,  advised the representatives of theIron and Steel Federation to make one further effort to reach an understanding with the Steel Cartel,and authorised them, if a reasonable agreement couldnot be made, to say that they knew from ministers that the Import Duties Advisory Committee had madethe necessary recommendations for the increased duties.Continental steel makers had not been able to agreeto any voluntary restriction of their imports to this
country, but the United Kingdom steel makers expect that if a restriction of imports was enforcedthrough the imposition of duties,  the Continentalsteel makers would be able to tell their governments that a reduction Of their exports was inevitable,and there would then be a possibility that a reasonableagreement on the subject would be reached.      Inthese circumstances, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreedto the making of an Order putting the recommendationof the Committee into effect.        They had, however,drawn the attention of the Federation to theirassurances that prices would not be increased and had welcomed their suggestion that if an agreement was reached with the Cartel it might be possible again to reduce the duties.In reply to questions,  the President of thea. cUlraiu tTck IUcigj.Board of Trade said that when the announcement wa-sccfald Ik.made- on the subject, two statements had been quotedon keeping down prices;    one from the iff on and.

March 30. 1935.SECRETARY&apos;S NOTgS OF A DISCUSSION Q]g TBFFOR^CCFTNG VISF&quot; OF mBF SFCRF^ARY OF S^A^FFOR F0RFTGN AFFAIRS        BFRIIN.(Prepared for the personal ofthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, but not passed to membersof the Cabinet other than the PrimeMinister.)a      *     &amp;.; -: -\--!. .....     .mHF SFORF^AHY OF STA^F FOR FOREIGN affairs informed the Cabinet that the Foreign Office had done a Food deal of preparation for his visit to Berlin.Material had been collected, and he had held meetings with Officials.   Be proposed to take as his programme the topics mentioned in the London Communique ofFebruary Srd, as he had the German Government&apos;s agree-ment that all these subjects should come under consider-ation.   The order had still to be fixed.   Be hoped to spend a good part of Sunday going over the ground withthe Ambassador in Berlin.   Material for the discussion had been arranged on all these topics, but he had no intention of carrying any of the subjects to the pointof actual agreement.   What was more important was thegeneral line of the presentation of the British case toFerr Hitler.    He thought it should be presented crisply,but firmly.    Herr Hitler should not be allowed to take charge from the outset, as was his wont.    His idea,therefore, was to present firmly that there were two
directions in which the European situation might develop:-(1) By bringing1 jpts^ the system of regionalagreements, which might vary to meetthe circumstances of each case.Such an agreement already existed in western Europe,and it had been suggested to implement it by theAerial Agreement.   There were also suggested agreements for Austria and Eastern Europe.&quot;In that system it was absolutely essentialthat. Germany should take a full part.    If not, theywould arrive at -(2) A combination of States formed againstsome other combination which would develop as the result.That was a system which we disliked and did not believe in, though he would give no hint of what our attitude would be if that condition of affairs were reached.It depended on Germany which choice Europe had to take.The visit, he continued, was of course one of inquiry and exploration.    If a Debate took place he must make this clear.    France and Italy seemed to haveforgotten that that was the main object,  of the visit.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that the first essential in dealing with Herr Hitler was to make itclear to him why the visit had taken place.    It was partof British policy to get co-operation in armamentsagreements and peace, and unless Germany was preparedto share on the same footing as ourselve% progress wasImpossible.   Without that, Hitler might talk of peace,but he would only increase the prospect? of Europecombining against him, and already the German action had had the effect of upsetting the whole of Europe.He would like to make clear that the United kingdom wasnot in the least anti-German.   He would recall how wehad got Germany out of the reparations difficulty and-g-
secured equality to bring Germany back to tbe DisarmamentConference, though we hart never agreed in Hitler&apos;sreasons for leaving the Conference.   He thought  a veryfriendly talk on these lines was necessary to further progress.   He would also recall the Five-Power Conferenceand call Baron von Neurath to witness what we had done to help Germany there, and would make clear that we were still pursuing the same Holy Grail of Peace.THE SECRET ART OF staff FOR THF COIOWTES agreedthat the Prime Minister&apos;s line was absolutely right.He would like Sir John Simon to get in with a statement on those lines at the very start, making it clear that hitler had made disarmament impossible and. had almost-made European peace impossible:    further, that if heburst out again the consequences coul^ not be foreseen.begin like that would get over all the difficultiesof France and Ita1y.THE PRIME MINISTER said he would make quite clear to hitler that the British Government&apos;s representative had come to Berlin because he was seeking peace.   He wouldrecall how long we had been working for peace!    thatwe had made some considerable progress, but had reached a point where Hitler seemed unwilling to allow further progress.THE SECRETARY OF S*ATE FOR DOMINION affairs suggested that, looking&apos;a little further ahead, it mightbe desirable to begin by recalling Hitler&apos;s statementsabout his desire for peace.THE FIRS&apos;11 COMMISSIONER OF WORKS thought that this might be construed as weakness.   He thought that Hitlerought to be taken to task at once over the armamentsquestion, with a view to a Conference of Great Powers,^hat was the kernel of the new situation.
THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER said that theobject of the preliminary discussion was to clarifythe situation, to explain what our views and objectswere, what we stood for and why we were in Berlin.He would then try to find out what was Hitler&apos;s position.If, as Messrs Gcoring and Ribbentrop had suggested,the German idea was to get closer to this country at theexpense of other countries, the sooner TTitler wasdisillusioned the better.   He agreed that it ought tobe brought home to Hitler what were likely to be theconsequences to himself and his country if he were notprepared to co-operate.   He referred to the distressawakened in Prance and Italy at the proposed visit.THE PRIMP MINISTER said he wished to take theBritish line first.   We had been so accommodating toother countries that the present pass had been reached.He did not mind much what was said in Prance and italy in the interval before the Berlin visit.   &apos;yhen they heardtherewhat, had been said/they would be satisfied.THE FIRST COMMISSIONER OP WORKS thought therewould be a danger in allowing Hitler to think that in no circumstances could we ever fall back on an alliance withother countries .THE SECRETARY OP SmA*E FOR AIR was convinced ofthe rightness of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view thatthere should be a forcible expression of the british point of view at the outset.   Hitler, however, had hisanswer ready, namely, that Germany was being encircled.He would add that so long as the encirclement went onhe must continue in his present attitude.   We ought toknow, therefore, what our attitude was towards the French   i:and Italian policy of encirclement,   ^he French had missedmany opportunities to make progress:    but until we knewour own mind it was difficult to go ahead.
THE LORD PRIVY SPAT, thought that this was hardlyfair to France.   The French wanted Hitler to take a partin collective security in Pastern Europe.   The policy ofencirclement was only an alternative if that failed.THE PRU!&quot;&apos;P MINISTER said we ought to begin bygetting Hitler to understand the position of other people and what had been the effect of his action.THE PRESIDENT CP &quot;PP. BOARD OF EDUCATION pointedout that the lord Privy Seal had. already met Hitler.He could imagine that a great deal would depend uponwhether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was successful in finding that  &quot;odd streak&quot; in Hi tier&apos;scharacter that might enable him to make a real contact.Tf he could do that he might make Hitler understand the realities of the situation he had. created.TTFIt- SECRETARY CF STA^E FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, while recognising the value of the discussion, said that alldepended on how the matter was put.   Hitler had a tremendous case of grievance, which he held strongly andwas aoovstomed to ventilate with extreme vigour.   he might be willing to admit that he had no grievanceagainst the United Kingdom, but that would not helpmatters forward.   He had, however, a great grievanceagainst others.    He was anxious not to give witler an excuse to develop these grievances in great detail,^here was also the question of Russia, against whomHitler felt very strongly, and he would justify hisre-arming by the heavy armaments of the Union of Soviets .&quot;HE PRIME MINISTEB said he would avoid being drawn into detail, for, as usual in international matters, thearguments were not all on one side only.   He thought allthe Cabinet could do was to agree that the first taskwas to interpret to Hitler what had been said at thisMeeting as to the intentions of British policy and why
the visit was being paid.   Fe would be very frank on thesubject of the obstacles Hitler had created for british policy.    He would say that as the discussion was takingII place between Great Britain and Germany alone, otherscould be left out of it.   Ho doubt the United kingdom had made mistakes, and we should be ready to discuss themwith Rerr Hitler,   &quot;his would enable us to say what we thought had been Hitler&apos;a mistakes.   If that general line were taken the conversation could then be pursuedinto the details of the Ang-3o-French Communique ofFebruary 3rd.    It would have to be borne in mindthroughout that Prance and Italy would have to be toldwhat had happened.e Fast err. THF SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS said,et.that tTitler&quot;s attitude was likely to be that in no circumstances would he give a guarantee that would forcehim to fight in someone else&apos;? quarrel.    He did not minddiscussions on questions of boundaries,  or arrangementsfor consultation, but he would not fight because two other nations ha-i got into conflict.THP! PRIME MINISTER, turning to the Anglo-Frenchrommunique, pointed out that the arms settlement wasto replace Part V of the Treaty.   Hitler had torn upPart V, but this did not make it any less important toconsider how an armaments settlement was to be arranged in Europe,   ^here was also the question of gettingGermany back to Geneva.THE SECRETARY OF S^A^E FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thoughtthat. Hitler would say that peace could not be maintained in Eastern Europe by pacts of mutual  guarantee, and thatthe only way to maintain peace was for him to have alarp-e army.    If he said that, the answer would be thatthe only result would be to create combinations againstGermany in place of the combinations in which Germany had
a share.    In reply to a question as to Hitlerfs attitudetowards the Eastern Pact he said that his centralobjections were that if Poland got into trouble withRussia he objected to having to go to the rescue; andhe objected to the proposal that Russia should, under-writ e Locarno, on the ground that he did. not wantRussian aid in resisting a Erench invasion:   he had no desire to have Communists marching into Germany.It was difficult not to feel sympathy with that view.mHF. LORE PRIVY SEAL tittered a warning againstgiving countenance to any Eastern Pact which did not include a guarantee.    If that were done it. would make his position in Russia very difficult.&quot;HE PRIME MINISTER said that the delicacy of thesituation must not be allowed to draw us into sayingthat we were keen on the present Eastern Pact/  [Suo-h -aoohOTig-ffilght bel-t)nhg-t^--a-Lea.guo of Nations pact; thoughjJL^suml4 fee difficult by iav\ In p vac I leg&apos;J   Put, puttingit as the Foreign Secretary had put it, it was hardlylikely to prove workable.&quot;HE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIESpointed out that we had rather stressed the EasternPact,   &quot;he Russians might say that they would drop theEastern Pact if we would extend the Locarno guarantee to the East.   But we could not do that.THE SECRETARY OF S&quot;A&quot;E FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS agreedthat statements had been made in favour of the EasternPact, but we had always made it clear that we favouredit only on condition that  it led. to disarmament inEurope.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL thought it might be best tosay that we were not.  going to talk of the details ofthe ^aster-n Pact, nor to single it out, but that our object was to ascertain how security could be obtained
in Eastern Europe.&quot;HE PRIME MINISTER said, that of course he had no intention of suggesting that we should say that we were opposed to the Eastern Pact, but he would rather stress the real, end we had in view, namely, peace in Europe.THE CHANCELLOR OE THE EXCHEQUER thought that poland was in much the same position with Germany asBelgium was with Great Britain, since if Russia occupiedPoland she would become Germany&apos;s neighbour.&quot;HE SECRETARY OP S&quot;ATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidthat Germany wotild not mind an arrangement with Poland:in fact she already had one:    or even with the baltic states.   But she objected to the principle of mutuality.He thoucrht it possible that Herr Hitler might raise some very biff questions.   He might say &quot;You have given meequality, but the demilitarised zone, the position ofareGermans in Memel, and our lack of colonies, ssxagftg incon-sistent with equality&quot;.1 THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said the answer was that these matters could be discussed when securityhad been reached.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FTSHFRIES suggested the touchstone was as to whether Germany was going torejoin the League of Nations.   Hitler would have to eatsome of his words to do this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that what had to be donewas to go to ^erlin and to make Herr Hitler face theEuropean situation.    Of course if he raised such matters as colonies it would make things more difficult.THE SECRETARY OF STA^R FOR t?tf COLONIES thoughtthat  if Hitler raised the question of Memel the answer was that he ought to come back to the League and. then it could be discussed.-a-
&quot;HP. SFCRF^ARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS saidHitler&apos;a answer would he that he would not rejoin theleague of Nations so long as the league was one that could not do Germany justice.   He would say that theinjustices of the Treaty of Versailles could not berectified within the present structure of the league,was it possible, for example, to imagine a unanimousvote by the league in favour of an alteration in the frontiers of Germany?    Our reply to that ought to be to invite him to come back to the League and see what could be done to alter its constitution.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AN^ fisheries said that if he r^fuseH, that would be tantamount to adeclaration of aggression, and he thought that theCouncil of the league ought to be summoned.THE PRIME MINISTER said that was a point hawhich would come up after the conversations.8, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.1,March 80, 1935.
