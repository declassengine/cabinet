The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of the Cabinet to telegrams- whichhad been circulated by the Foreign Office, in theordinary distribution, reporting the growing coneernof the United. States Government in regard, to analleged utilisation of Newfoundland, as the chief centre of liquor smuggling traffic.   The seriousness of thematter was accentuated by the fact that the Presidentof the United States took a personal interest in thequestion and was threatening to make a public statement the Secretary of State assured the Cabinet that thematter had not been overlooked:    a Committee had been examining into it, and telegrams had already been sentto Washington and to Newfoundland as to appropriate action.The Cabinet were informed, that the clearancesfrom Newfoundland were for St. Pierre and. Miq\ielon,which were   well-known centres of the smuggling trade,but that apparently some ships       cleared for the high seas in the hope of getting an opportunity to landtheir cargoes.There was general agreement that the mattermust be handled in a sympathetic manner, as eontem-plated by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Be recalled that the question of Anglo-Japanese Relations involved, most important considera-tions from many points of view   our relations withthe United states of America, Russia, China, theDominions, as well as Naval questions, trading interestsof vast importance, and our general position in theworld.    It was therefore a question of high policy.It had been found that the matter was complicated bythe Silver policy of the United States of America,which, contrary to iftte-nt-ien, had proved very injurious to China.   The/Chinese suggestion -ed2 a Loan from ou*-g1**was not likely to help the situation.   &quot;*h.e Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had undertaken to consider whether some means could be found o^ bringing assistance to China inthe present position.The Cabinet agreed with the Prime Minister and.the Foreign Sec retary. that the question should be reserved until the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s opinion was available on the Silver position in China, and thatwhen the subject was taken up again CP.-233 (34), aswell as C.P.-8 (35) and C.P.-9 (35) should be takeninto consideration.

While the decision in princeple as to whether to proceed with the policy of insuringAgriculture against unemployment was reserved until thenext regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet, the following conclusions were reachedt-
(l) That the Cabinet regard, sympathetically thepolicy of insuring Agriculture againstunemployment.    (Amended.)(2) That the legislation, if decided, upon,should he introduced and passed into lawas soon as practicable, so as to ensurethat next winter may see payment of benefit and not merely collection of contributions,as will be the case during the first sixmonths of operation.

INDIANPROTECTIVEDUTIES.previous reference:Cabinet 2 (35)Conclusion 3).r7K.3A^)&apos;0-5.    The Secretary of State for India reportedthat, as requested &quot;by the Cabinet, he had been in correspondence with the Viceroy In an effort tosecure a reduction in the duty on cotton goods,and that his latest telegram had only.arrived late on the previous evening.      He recalled that over and above India&apos;s protective duty of 20 per cent,  on cotton goods, there was a revenue duty of 5 per cent,which Lancashire was very anxious to have reduced or removed.      No pledge had ever been given to thecotton interests in Lancashire and it had alwaysbeen made clear that the 5 per cent, was a revenuetax?,      Nevertheless , an idea had spread among the rank and file of the cotton industry in Lancashirethat the Clare Lees-Mody agreement had involvedits disappearance/      He himself had hoped that this might prove possible.      The estimates for thecoming year, however, were not so satisfactory as hehad hoped, and.he was now satisfied that the revenueposition of India was not sufficiently good toenable the tax to be dispensed with.      There was,however,  to be a tariff commission inquiry beforethe end of 1935, and he thought that as a result ofthat inquiry it might be possible to isolate the5. per cent,  revenue tax^and to get it removed.The Cabinet agreed -(a) To accept the opinion of the Secretaryof State for India that the 5 percent, revenue cotton duty could not bereduced in view of the Indian budgetposition.(b) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor India to take what steps hecould to get the matter dealt, withsatisfactorily in connection withthe forthcoming tariff inquiry.
MALTA. 6.    The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that at the meeting of the Cabinet(previous reference: referred to in the margin he had mentioned actionsCabinet 47  (34) &quot;Conclusion 11).      that had been brought in the Malta Courts top-.fi. obtain a declaration of invalidity of ordinancespassed by the present Government, and that if the malta Courts took the view that the Secretary ofState was wrong,  it would be necessary to legislateimmediately here to legalise the position.      he reported that up to the present his view had been supported in the Court of First Instance, but thatthe case would probably be brought to the Court ofAppeal.      If the Court of Appeal supported theCourt of First Instance, the legislation he hadforeshadowed would not be necessary.
THE MEATSITUATION.Negotiationswith theDominions.(previous reference:Cabinet 31 (34)Conclusion 5).ftfl7.    The Minister of Agriculture and. fisheries reported that on the previous day at 11.0 a.m.after a meeting of the Produce Markets supply committee, i&apos;he Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, the Home Secretary and he himself had met the High Commissioners for the Dominions.He apologised for bringing the matter to the noticeof the Cabinet without warning but circumstances had rendered this unavoidable.      At this meetingthe High Commissioners had finally pressed for the continuation of the present assistance to the meatindustry pending discussions with their governments and Premiers.      The meeting was very friendly and useful progress was made,  the Australian HighCommissioner,  in particular, indicating that public opinion in the Commonwealth was becoming moreand more impressed with the importance of theUnited Kingdom market for meat.      In view of therather garbled accounts of the meeting which had appeared in the Press, he asked if the Cabinet could find it possible to authorise the Produce MarketsSupply Committee  (of which the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade, theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs and he himselfwere members with the Lord President in the Chair)to decide, after hearing- the Report from the ministers who met the Dominion High Commissioners, whether theassistance now being given to the beef industry should or should not be continued after the 31st March.The Committee had arranged to meet on Monday nextjand a decis-ion to this effect would enable anannouncement to be made in the House of commons the same afternoon.
In the course of the discussion the view was expressed that the present quotas and restrictions werecausing difficulties both at home&apos;and in the Dominions,as well as with foreign co ntries, and that the delay in fixing a permanent policy was due to the time takenby the Dominions in making up their minds .The Cabinet were informed, that the continuanceof the subsidy would involve early legislation of a controversial nature,The Produce Markets Supply Committee was asked toconsider the terms in which the incorrect reportspublished in the Press about the Meeting with high commissioners of the Dominions should be contradictedimmediately after Parliament meets ,    It was suggestedthat it should be intimated that negotiations were still continuing and that it was hoped to make a statement inthe near future.The Cabinet agreed  To approve in principle an extensionof the meat subsidy for a period notexceeding a fixed period which would besettled at the next weekly Meeting ofthe Cabineto
