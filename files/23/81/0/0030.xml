GERMANY&quot;. 1.    mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs__nhe Proposed informed the Cabinet that, he had received two visitssir Pact.   FR.  ,__       35l[S$p.    from the German Ambassador,  one on the previousrv,e Franco-iRussisn afternoon and one the same morning.    On each occasion&apos; Agreement.the Ambassador had handed him a document.(previous The first was a German draft of the proposed reference&apos;Cabinet 30 Air Pact.   mhe German Government had communicated(35), Con-elusion 1.) this document to fhe British Government alone, theirexcuse being that recent speeches by members of theBritish Government had suggested that the germans should, tell us their ideas.   ^hey were willing,however, that the document should be communicated byus to other Governments, on the understanding thatif this were done we should hand to them any drafts of the Air Pact received from those Governments:e.g., the French Government&apos;s draft which had. been referred to in the Debate in the Bouse o^ Lords.mhey had. not asked for the British draft .The second document, which had been sent  to otherGovernments concerned, was a rather formidable indict-in en t of the recent Franco-Russian Agreement,  on theground that it conflicted with the Locarno Treaty.The Secretary of State explained to the Cabinet thetechnical grounds  of this contention.Particulars of the two documents are not reproducedhere as the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the documents themselves would be circulated in the near future.A short discussion took place as to the line to betaken in the forthcoming Parliamentary Debate on ForeigiAffairs, when enquiries were likely to be m??de as towhether we were working for a Conference on the air pact.    mhe French,  for the moment at any rate, appearedrather lukewarm on the subject, which made progress
difficult.    It could be said in the Debate, however,that if anyone imagined th?&quot;1&quot; this      ,3esty*s Governmenthad not shown themselves  energetic,, he was quite inthe wrong, but that the complications were greaterthan appeared at first sight,    mhe Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was  considering a suitable form of words.

AIR raids precautions.Draft ofCircularto LocalAuthorities.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(35), Con-elusion 2.)3. In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memo-randum by the uome Secretary (C.P.-109 (35))submitting for the consideration of his colleaguesa draft of the Circular on Air Raid Precautionswhich he proposed to issue to all Local Authoritiesin England, and -Vales.    It was intended that a similarCircular to Local Authorities in Scotland should beissued at the same time by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.   mhe financial arrangements described in the Circular had been discussed, and agreed inprinciple, with the mreasury.mhe Circular was discussed paragraph by paragraph.&quot;&quot;he   principal suggestions made are summarised below.General Criticisms :(i) *rore stress sb.ou.ld be laid throughouton the fact that the whole scheme isintended for the protection of thepublic.    mhe following are illustra-tions:-Paragraph 3: In the last line of page 1,after the sentence &quot;The-necessity forsuch measures must be apparent&quot;,  thefollowing might be added:-&quot;and the Government would beneglecting its duty to the civilian population -  men,women and children   if itfailed, to take these precautions.&quot;Paragraph 11.  the first, sentence of whthreads as follows:-&quot;The following notes are intendedto give a preliminary picture ofthe various air raid services&quot;,might be re-drafted to read  &quot;Tie following notes are intendedto give a preliminary picture ofthe various services for theprotection of the public against air raids ,&quot;(ii) It would be desirable to omit, or throwvery much into the background, anyreferences to the last War1.
(ill)  Some of the details,  e.g. in paragraph11, might be left  over either for thetechnical Memoranda to be issued lateror for conferences with the localAuthorities   tut the Home Secretarypointed out that the inclusion 0* acertain amount of detail was essential in order to prepare the way for ^hoseconferences.    In addition,  the uomeOffice staff was a small one and couldnot cover the whole country rapidly.There would, be serious complaints ifdetails were given to some Authoritiesearly and to others not. until muchlater.(iv) that the Circular might include an invitation to Local Authorities totake the possibility o^ air raids precautions Into consideration in working out town planning and. itsdetails  &apos;drainage and water schemes)and public works generally.fv) that the substance mi ght often besecured with rather less emphasis,of which the following examples werementioned:-Paragraph 11 (d) Police poroe3 . -   heavy additional duties .(e) Fire Brjgades . - ^he FirePrigade service will need, to be substantiallys trengthened if it isto be in a position todeal effect ively withthe results of heavy attack ^rom the air.Detailed Criticisms:It was urged that the firs4: two sentences of Paragraph * shoul^ be re-drafted so asto indicate that although His Majesty&apos;sGovernment repudiate *he use of indiserim-inate bombing, provision must be made tomeet it in case resort should, be made toit:    in other words, treatment of indis-criminate bombing in Paragraph 4 somewhat,on the same lines as the treatment ofpoison gas in Paragraph 5.Paragraph 4. Line 5- ^or &quot;mhe whole country would&quot;, put &quot;mhe whole country might&quot; .mhe last two sentences o^   Paragraph 4.giving the principal objectives,  it was strongly urged should be omitted, on theground, that it would, le^d. to a demand from these areas for special protection.Appendix.    Line 6:  It was suggested for&quot;additional hospital equipment&quot; to put&quot;necessary hospital equipment&quot;.
The Cabinet invited the HomeSecretary to consider the suggestions made at the Feetand. to present a re-draft attheir next weekly Feeling.
THE DEFEHCF(AIR FORCEBARRACKS)BILL.(Rr previous reference:Cabinet 30(35), Con-clusion 3.)2i \9$lf.4, The Oabinet. had before them a Rote by theSecretary of State for Air f CP,-110 (35)) statingthat the decision for the immediate and rapid expansion of the Royal Air Force, with the need fora considerable number of new aerodromes which it-involved, made it essential that powers for the speedy acon.isit.ion of land should be available tothe Air Ministry.   The existing powers were not suitable for the puirpose as they stood, and Sect-ion19 of the Defence Act, 1842, precluded the erection0&quot;p barracks on land, acquired.   mhe secretary ofState therefore attached to his Mote the draft of a one-Clause Bill designed, to remove the restriction in question when the. powers of the Defence Act were used by the President of the Air Council for theacquisition of land for Air Popop purposes.    he recommonded, the Bill to the Cabinet, for approval and. for authority to - introduce it at a very earlydate, with a view to it becoming law in the next fewweeks.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) that the Bill should be re-drafted,so as to become of general applica-tion to the three defence Services&quot;(b) that the revised Fill should besubmitted to the Committee of HomeAffairs:(c) That the Secretary of State for air should consult with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury as towhether the Bill could most conveniently be introduced in the House of Commonsor House of Lords, and,in the formercase,  on what date.

After setting forth the political considerations raised and summarising the main proposals contained in the recommendation o^ theGoverning Body, as well as the implications of theseproposals,  the Minister of Labour recommended thatthe British Government delegates should be instructed(i) that they should support only thesettlement at this Conference of points on which Governments should,be consulted, with a view to afurther discussion next year:    and(ii) that they should oppose the discussionan^ formulation of definite proposalsthis year before Governments had hada further opportunity of consideringthe various&apos;points raised.In approving generally the proposals of theMinister of Labour, the Cabinet agreed  That the British Delegates should,stand by the method of proceeding by Questionnaire, but should not fail to state what the Governmenthave done in this question, what,they are doing now, an^ the studiesthey are making with a view to furtherprogres s,-8-
