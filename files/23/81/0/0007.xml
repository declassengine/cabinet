Attached tothe Memorandum was a draft which had beenindependently prepared by Sir WilliamMalkin and which covered some pointsnot mentioned in the French sketch.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had invited the Lord Privy Seal to be present.In the course of the discussion the following^&quot;explanations were made on various aspects of  theFrench proposals:-That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeewere meeting that morning to considerthe effect on Imperial Defence of theFrench proposals,  and that a report would be prepared after their Meeting.That,  in the view of the Officials ofthe Dominions Office, the french proposals were likely to be unpopularin the Dominions.      As, however, theproposal provides a deterrent to air attack on London, its importance to home defence must be the determiningconsideration.That the proposed commitment would notbe confined to air forces but,  if itmatured, would involve all arms. .
That the question o** the participation of Italy was envisaged and would be thesubject of consultation and possibly flfspecial arrangements.fWjPJJf:    Early in the Meeting theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs had produced a formulaas a basis for discussion, whichwas amended by the Cabinet. .   Thefinal form is reproduced in theAppendix.)After hearing full explanations from the PrimeMinister, the Lard President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs and discussionof the question in all its aspects, the Cabinet,while    leaving to the negotiating Ministers thesame discretion as before as to the handling of thematter, agreed  (a) That they were very much Interested inthe French proposals and sympathetic to-the idea, but required, time to study themin detail before giving a final answer.They were also concerned about procedure.(b) That at the present stage not the slightest, encouragement should, be givento French Ministers to suppose that, inthe event of a German refusal of theseproposals, vis Majesty&apos;s Government .would themselves adopt them.(c) That, having dealt with the immediatedifficulty in the above manner4 the negotiation should be continued possibly,&quot;**or example, by accepting an invitation from the French Government to pay a return visit to &quot;Paris in the near future,(d) ^hat in the meanwhile the problem wouldbe worked out in detail by the ministers concerned,(e) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAtffairs should consider carefully themoment at which Germany anr? Italy were.to be informed of what&apos; was now proposed and whether this could be done at anearly stage.(f) fhat the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should exercise great care inhis communications with the Dominions onthis subject .K Whiteha 11 Gardens . S.&apos;&quot;. 1.February 2, 1935.
APPENDIX.In the course of these meetings,  the French andBritish Ministers have been impressed by the specialdangers to peace created by modern developments in theair,  the misuse of which might lead to sudden aerialaggression by one country upon another, and have givenconsideration to the possibility of provision being made against these dangers by a reciprocal regional agreementbetween certain Powers.      It is suggested that the signatorieswould undertake immediately to give the assistance of theirair forces to whichever of them might be the victim ofunprovoked aerial aggression by one of the contractingparties. The French and British Ministers, on behalfof their respective Governments,  found themselves inagreement that a mutual arrangement of this kind would go far to ensure immunity from sudden attacks from theair to the participating countries and they resolved to invite (Italy), Germany and Belgium to consider with them whether such a convention might not be promptly negotiated.
