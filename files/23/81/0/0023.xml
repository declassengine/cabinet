At Stresait had been contemplated that  the French should act   jIHalone in presenting the resolution on the German armaments declaration.    At Geneva,however,  circumstances had arisen rendering it advisable that the United Ringdom and. Italy shouldbe associated in its presentation,    ^he resolution was likely to be carried unanimously, though there might be two,  or possibly more, abstentions,^he main problem at Stresa had been to renew the confidence of the French and Italians  in thisIcountry, which had. been somewhat impaired,    mhisJhad been successfully accomplished,    ^he nextbusiness had been to get the French arid  Italians to renew the declarations  of Paris and Rome,    This had.been a delicate matter, as these Governments had formed the impression that the German armamentsdeclaration had broken everything down, and therehad been grave risk of getting back to the chaos ofnon-cooperation.    The Rotes  of-the Stresa Conference,which would be circulated, would show the way thesituation had been handled,  anJ the result.    In theend the French and Italian representatives had. agreedto everything previously declared, and to get that,result we had not had. to undertake any new commitment.In connection with the proposed Air Pact the PrimeMinister drew attention to the phrase in the statementwhereby we undertook &quot;to continue actively the studyo^ the question with a view to the drafting of a Pactbetween the five Powers mentioned, in the London
Communique&apos; and of any bilateral agreements whichmight accompany it&quot;.    The latter words had been inserted, to help W, &quot;flandin, but they went no further than an admission    of willingness to study,   ^here was absolutely no commitment.In reply to questions, the Prime Minister said he had had no opportunity of discussing the next stagewith the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whowould take the matter up.    mhe Rome Conference would discuss the Austrian situation and other matters.We were not committed either to the Eastern Pact orthe Austrian Pact beyond the willingness we had previously expressed to render good offices.   Re wasnot yet aware of the view of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs as to whether we should berepresented at the Rome Conference.

The Cabinet had before them a Most secret memorandum by the Secretary.of State for Air (C.P..-85(35))  on the subject of the German Air Programme andits Bearing on British Air Strength, to which he attached a Paper by the Chief of the Air Staffcontaining a reasoned appreciation of the Air situa-tion,  and detailed recommendations based thereon,drawn up in the light of considerations arising outof the Foreign Secretary&apos;s account of his  conversa-tions with Rerr Ritler in Berlin (C,V .-69 (35)).After reviewing Germany1s air expansion, the Chiefof the Air Staff proposed large additions to thepresent approved expansion scheme of the Royal AirForce in order to meet it, and outlined the measureswhich must be authorised in the present, financialyear if the proposed programme was approved inprinciple.   While the Secretary of State was satisfiedthat these, proposals were fully justified, he wouldbe content,  provided he could obtain Cabinet-authority for the steps immediately necessary for the inauguration of the programme of further expan-sion,  that they should be examined and reported upon by the Ministerial Committee on Disarmament- before adecision was reached upon the precise details of theProgramme of Expansion.mhe Secretary of State for Air,  in explanation of the short, notice at which his Memorandum had been circulated,  informed the Cabinet that he had felt it necessary to give them the latest information onthe subject of the German air programme and. his views as to its bearing on British air strength, in viewof the rebate that had been expected on ThursdayApril 18th, but which had now been postponed.After hearing a detailed statement by theSecretary of State for Air, the Cabinet, agreed. --3-

Act,  1934.    mhe Regulations would have to be laidbefore Parliament, and they might be annulled, by aresoluti.cn of either House during the next twenty-eightsitting days.    It had been found, possible to meetsubstantially the principal points made by theindustry without affecting the main principles ofthe proposals.    mhe President of the Hoard of Tradedrew attention to paragraph 5 of the Note, which dealt with applications from foreigners or foreigncontrolled companies.    He felt that such applicationsought to be admitted, subject to the safeguardsindicated, as any attempt to exclude foreigners mighthave serious  effects on the interests  of British oil companies now operating abroad.    He also doubted the praticability of taking steps at the present time to conserve, for purposes of defence, any supplies of natural petroleum which might exist in this  country,as their effect would be to discourage search anddevelopment by private enterprise.The Cabinet agreed  (a) -To approve the provisions of the draft regulations and Model Clauses governing the grant  of licences under the Petroleum(Production) Act, 1934.  as set forth in cp.-83 (35):  subject to the following:-(h) That in the event of any discoveries of oil, the President of the Board of trade should keep in close touch with the First-Lord of the Admiralty and should considerthe desirability of coming to terms withthe firm responsible for the discoveryas to the acquisition of the oil forGovernment purposesim - -8-

Select Committee,  andthat no eiridence should, be presented which would lead the Joint. Select Committee to assume that it came with Cabinet, authority.    The Minister of healthcould hardly give evidence himself without committing the Cabinet.    He thought, however,  that, with theauthority of the Minister,  a senior Official of thedepartment might give the Departmental view without committing the Cabinet.mhe Minister of Wealth, while realising theview of the Cabinet,  felt it possible that the joint select Committee might wish him to give evidence in person^ but  that was not agreed to,mhe Cabinet approved the following Terms  ofPeference to the Joint Select Committee, read to themby the Minister o^ tTealth:-&quot;that it is  expedient that a SelectCommittee of the Commons be appointedto join with a Committee of the lords to consider and to report on measures for the better conservation and organisation of water resources and supplies in Fngland. and Wales.&quot;
