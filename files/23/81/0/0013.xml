germany ant)Srussxa.ipr opos ed&quot;visit to&apos; previous reference reference e:Cabinet 12(35),  Con-elusion 4.)fA2. &quot;he Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the question o* the proposedMinisterial visits to Berlin, Moscow and &apos;&quot;&apos;arsav had been  complicated by Herr Hitlerfs indisposition,&quot;his had. been made the pretext for postponing theSecretary of State&apos;s visit to Berlin, but the realreason was believed to be his annoyance at. certainpassages in the White Paper relating to Defence(Cmd. 4827).    &quot;his was not the first time that herr hitler had suffered from a reaction to statements made to Parliament about German re-armament.   Hethought it important to deal with the German Govern-ment coolly and. ealmly;    to regret Herr Hitler&apos;sindisposition:    to point out that the postponement of the visit was inconvenient in view of other arrange-ments that had to be made:    and, without pressing too strongly,  to ask -Terr Hitler to fix a later date forthe visit.    At the same time he asked, approval inprinciple for a visit to be paid by a British Ministerto Moscow and Warsaw after the Berlin visit,    Tt wasinconvenient to postpone this matter much longer,owing to the constant enquiries being made by theSoviet Ambassador and. the public interest in it.&quot;here was  general agreement  that a position hadbeen reached where a British Minister ought to pay a visit to Moscow, which should, include Warsaw,    &quot;hegeneral view was that the visit should be paid by theLord Privy Seal rather than the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs himself, tut it was realised thatthere might be pressure that the visit to Moscow and-Warsaw should be paid by a Minister of the same stand-ins as in the case of the visit to Berlin.    It couldbe explained, however, to the Soviet Government thatit was difficult for the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs to be away except for a very short time and that a visit to Moscow and Warsaw involved a much longer absence than to Berlin,&quot;he Cabinet agreed.  (a) &quot;hat the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make afurther communication to the GermanGovernment regretting Ferr Fitler&apos;sindisposition and asking that a later date might be arranged for his ownvisit to Berlin:(b) &quot;hat a. vis it should, be paid to moscow and &apos;&quot;rarsaW by a. Britloh Minister,probably/ the Lord. Privy Seal:(c) &quot;hat decision (b)  should be announced in Parliament by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs during thepresent week.
3. &quot;he Cabinet had before them an Interim Reportby the General Purposes Committee (C.P.-46 (35)).&quot;he attention of the Cabinet was called  (l)  to Paragraph 3, confirming &quot;the con-cliBLon previously arrived at by. theCabinet that the amount of employmentprovided is insuf^iclent in itself tojustify a policy of public works,although it may properly be takeninto account when weighing up theadvantages and disadvantages  of aparticular project&quot;:and(.2)  to the opinion in Paragraph 4 &quot;that,at certain stages  in the process of recovery,  and particularly when money and materials are cheap,  the undertaking -in? of public works may provide a usefulstimulus by creating fresh confidence in the public mind, as well as by addingsomething to the flow of capital expend!-time&quot;,  and. that  &quot;given such conditions it may be justifiable to give thenecessary impetus by some form of state as s is lancaster e &quot; .In the course of the discussion reference was madeto the Prime Minister&apos;s correspondence with Mr Lloydat the appropriate stageGeorge,,and it was suggested that/it might be desirable for some Minister or Ministers to discuss With Mr LloydGeorge his proposals for relieving unemployment.No decision was taken on this point. which was left tothe Commit 1-ee&apos;s  discretion.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) &quot;o approve the Interim Report by theGeneral Purposes Committee (C.P.-46 (35)):(b) To invite the Secretary       State forScotland to make any representationshe might think fit to the general purposes Committee on the questions ofLand Settlement and water Supplies inScotland, which are included in thescope of fhe Committee&apos;s present Inquiry:To invite the Minister       Agricultureand Fisheries to discuss with theMinister of Health and.the Secretaryof State for Scotland the question of re-c ondittoning houses in Scotland,with a view to representations beingmade to the General Purposes Committee:(d.) &quot;o invite the First Lord of the admiralty to forward for special consideration a project for giving employment between
November and March (possibly to 4,000workers)  in certain, distressed, areas.nhis project arose out of the footnoteto Paragraph 4 of C.P,-46 (35):(e)  &apos;vo take note that,- in response to an invitation ^rom the General purposes committee, Mr Lloyd George had. under-taken to submit proposals for relievingunemployment, and that these were toreceive the most careful consideration and. investigation.

Kingdom) .The contract,  included, a clause allowing for a rise andfall in the agreed prices to correspond with fluctua-tions  in comparable Swedish or Finnish timber.    Although4:he President had little sympathy with the Canadiancase on merits, he proposed to inform number Distribu-tors Ltd. that as a &quot;fall&quot; clause suggested a possibleattack on prices  it was  open to objection, and. to ask them to make a new contract without it.^he Cabinet agreed  (a) mo authorise the President of thePoard of Trade to inform TimberDistributors,  Limited, that the&quot;fall&quot; clause was open to objectionand to ask them to make a new contractwithout it:(b) that if they should refuse, and difficulties should arise, he should report to the Cabinet in due course.
