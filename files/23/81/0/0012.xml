Almost any day now a further communication might be received, from Japan,  and it .was important, before. Conversations were resumed, thatthe attitude of France and Germany should, be known.Be asked that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, take advantage of his forthcomingvisits to Paris and Berlin to sound the French andGerman Governments on the question.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had. already had some conversation with M.Corbinon the subject and had explained the position to him.This was being followed up by a communication to theBritish Ambassador in Paris.

Oon-clusion 7 .)13. mhe Lord President  o&apos; the Council brought tothe notice o^ the Cabinet the following Question to beasked in Parliament the same afternoon:-&quot;Mr Crundy, - ^o ask the PrimeMinister, whether steps have yet-been taken to recommend, to all employers  o^ labour the paymentwages  on the national holiday tocommemorate the 25th ye-^r of wisMajesty&apos;s accession;    and. whether he has received a satisfactory response on the subject&quot;.we said that,  a good deal of pressure was being exertedfrom various directions  on this matter.In the course of the discussion it. was pointedout. that if the Government were to press employersthey might, very well invite appeals.ls for Governmentcontributions  or arrangements  for insurance payments.Employers would doubtless make payment so far as theircircumstances permitted.    Instances were given, however,where even large employers were confronted with great difficulties, and. it w$s known that many smalleremployers could not make these payments without loss.One suggestion was that the Government should gone further than on the 4-th February, but that theirannouncement should take the form 0* a more popularappeal.    It was realised, however,  that  that  involvedgreater pressure being put on employers .^he Cabinet were reminded that men working on a bank holiday under Trade Union Regulations would receivetime-and-a-quarter payment.    mha.t  involved additional expenditure for men on the railways,  and. so forth,who had. to work.The Cabinet agreed -that in the reply to Mr Grundy&apos;s Questionit would be inadvisable to go further thanthe&quot; reply given on February 4&apos;l&quot;h to asimilar Question.(NOTE: mhe reply on the 4th february was as follows:-
&quot;As I stated in my rejjly of the28th January to the hon. member for Plaistow (,Mr &quot;home)  the daywill be observed as a paid holidayfor employes in Government establish-ments/,  including industrial grades,&quot;his is not a matter in which theGovernment can issue any directions to private employers, but I have nodoubt that they can be relied uponto show full consideration for theirworkpeople, so far an circumstances permit.&quot;)2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,Pebrrary 27, 1935.
