WATERLOO1.       The Cabinet had before them the followingp   [ documents on the subject of Waterloo Bridge:-(Previous A Memorandum by the Minister ofReference: Transport f0.P.-9? (35)) collingQahinet 22 attention to the action o^ the(34), Con- London County Council in againelusion 12.) including in their Money Rill of* the present Session provision for&apos; , . v borrowing for the purpose of theirF-R-^^l    ) scheme for demolishing the existingbridge and building a new one, andin renewing their application for agrant from the Bead Bund towards thecost,   mhe course recommended by theMinister of Tans port was that heshould inform the Rouse that if parliament approved the provisions for borrowing in respect of the newbridge, the Government would take that action as an expression ofParliamentTs view that the questionof a grant should, be judged on its merits,  and that subject to details and estimates a grant woul^ be madeat the normal rate:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P.-96 (35))  expressingdisagreement with the course recommendedby the Minister of Tansport ,      we himselfregarded the question of a grant asclosed.    In destroying the old. bridge the London County Council had deliberate-ately adopted a course which the Fous eof Commons had rejected, without anyexpectation of a grant, and were prepared.-to pay the whole cost from the rates.There must now be a new bridge,and it. was not reasonable that thepresent rate-payers should be burdened,with the whole cost.    In his view,therefore, the O-oirernment, while making clear that the question of grant couldnot be reopened, should, advise theRouse to grant borrowing powders.In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to a Financial Memorandum covering theLondon County Council (Money) Bill,  the second paragraph of Yi/hich opened as f ollows:-&quot;(2)  In respect of such of the purposes ofexpenditure set out in Part I of theSchedule to the Bill as are mentionedin the following Table, government grants are involved or have &quot;been promised,
Attached, to the Financial Memorandum was a listof items in Part I of the Schedule showing thepurposes to which the grants related and theamount of the grants.      This list included thefollowing:-No.of item in       Purpose.  to which       Amount of grantPart I ofS chedule.zzmzigrant relates12)liLL9(So far asrelates tothe purposesmentioned in column 2).Demolition ofWaterloo bridge and the erection of a new bridge.The Council have again approached the Minister ofTransport with aview to a grantbeing made towardsthe cost of the demolition of thebridge and theerection of anew bridge.The attention of the Cabinet was also called to the following extract from the Standing orders of the House of Commons, 1934:218A.Every Private Bill or Bill to confirma Provisional Order which involves? orin respect of which there has been promised, a grant from any GovernmentDepartment shall,  on presentation tothe House, have bound with it a printedstatement in the form of a FinancialMemorandum showing the amount of suchgrant.It was pointed out that it was under thisStanding Order that the Financial Memorandum was attached to the London County Council (Money) Bill.Since Parliament had twice rtjuctcd the proposed grant for a new Waterloo Bridge, and had,  therefore,  ineffect twice decided against such a grant,  it washeld that no question of a Government grant couldany longer be involved.
The Cabinet agreed:-That the Minister of Transport should takethe line that the issue before the House ofCommons was one of borrowing powers which theGovernment would not oppose.      The procedure to he adopted in applications for borrowing powers in cases where grants were involved,was laid down in Standing Order 218a quoted above.        In the case of Waterloo Bridge,,   these provisions were not applicable, andthe question of the issue of a grant couldnot be raised.      The Minister of transport should make it quite clear that the government regarded the question of a grajnt as settled by the two previous decisions of parliament which had been accepted by the London CountyCouncil.
,.IR RAIDSI Issue off CircularI to local Authorities .I (previous ReferencetCabinet 46(3/1), Con-elusion 9.)3/(35)3.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Rome Secretary (0oR,-97 (35))  informing hiscolleagues that an Air Raid Precautions Departmentof the Rome Office had now been set up, and thatthe first important step to be undertaken by the new department would be the issue of a general circular to all Local Authorities in England and &quot;valesdirecting their attention to the action they wouldbe required to take.    There were three matters  ofgeneral principle upon which the Rome Secretary wishedto consult his Oabinet colleagues.    mhe first was theprovision of air raid shelters for the general public,as to which he suggested that it was impracticable to aim at such provision at the public expense;    second,the extent of the financial assistance to be afforded to Local Authorities by the Exchequer, upon which he pointed out the directions in which the Governmentwould need to incur expenditure in time o^ peace ifthe whole organisation of Air Raids Precautions was -not to be abortive, and asked authority to includereference to certain specified details  in fhe proposedcircular,  in terms to be agreed with the Treasury:and third, the means of providing respirators for theuse o^ the general population, - a matter into whichresearch was being conducted.    Re did not propose to mention this latter point in the circular, but ifquestions were asked in Parliament he ashed fordiscretion to reply on the lines that research was proceeding and until some results were obtained, it wasimpossible to frame a policy with regard either to production or to means of supply fo the public.    Fewould like to add that means wou1d. be found to preventthe sale to the public of respirators which did not reach a sufficient standard o^ efficiency, and,  ifpressed, to consider the supply of respirators to the
public free of charge, to reply that so far as he knew this policy had not tepn adopted by any other country, and in any case tint il the type of respiratorhad been designed and. its production cost ascertained,the Government could not decide whether it was possibleor justifiable to subsidise its manufacture.The Cabinet agreed:-(a) to invite the Home Secretary to submit the general circular to all localauthorities in England and Vales on air raids precautions to the cabinet for consideration before it was issued.(b) to concur with the Home secretary that the provision of air raid sheltersfor the general public at the public expense was impracticable5 but thatthe Home Secretary might considerwhether local authorites might not be encouraged to provide undergroundgarages or parking places which couldbe used as shelters in localities where this was a practicable course from a technical point of view.(c) that the financial proposals generallyshould be worked out in greater detail with the Treasury before presentation to the Cabinet.      This would includethe various items specified in paragraph5 of CP.   97(35) .(d) that the Government must be responsiblefor controlling the manufacture ofrespirators;, and that it should be madeillegal to-place on the market any.respirators that did not conform tothe standard settled by the Government.(e) that further details should be given tothe Cabinet as to what was proposed inregard to the provision of respiratorsand on their utility.(f) that when these matters had been dis-cussed with the Treasury the cabinet should again be consulted.(g) that the Secretary of State for scotland should keep in touch with the HomeSecretarys with a view to correspondingarrangements for air raids precautionsin Scotland mat at i s mat andi s.
THE MEATSITUATION.Negotiationswith theDominions.(previous reference:Cabinet 26(35) , Con-clusion 6).3 o(3 by.3.       The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsanticipated, that he might ash for a decision by theCabinet on the Meat negotiations at their next regular weekly meeting on Wednesday, May 22nd.
Carried wowSb JOlNmPBASOHS BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(25). Oon-elusion 19 .)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (0,P.-95 (35)) asking authorityto bring beforc the Committee of Borne Affairs a bill o deal with the Status of Married &quot;&apos;oroen and Jointmort Feasors.   These two subjects had been consideredby the Law Revision Committee, who had proposedcertain amendments in the law relating to eachmatter.    The Bill could be regarded as non-controver-sial,  and the Lord Chancellor proposed that,  if accepted by the Oabinet on the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs, the Bill should   beintroduced in the House of Lords.    He was anxiousto make progress with it at this stage of the Session.The Cabinet agreed: -that after the usual examination bythe Committee of Home Affairs theBill should be introduced in theHouse of Lords.
nrost in.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised as a matter of urgency a question which had arisen in connection with the unrest in Iraq whichrevious had resulted in an appeal from the Iraq Governmenteference:Cabinet 41 (32)      to the British Representative and to the Royal AirConclusion l).Force for assistance In dealing with a revolt of their Ll(jb ) 4   tribes.      The Iraq Government had not done very wellIn dealing with this revolt.      There had already been an earlier request to the Royal Air Force to transport ammunition for the police.      Under theIraq Treaty we were entitled to maintain Air Forcesin Iraq.      (7e had a duty to assist in Iraq against/aggression,  but we had no obligations in respect ofinternal risings.      We had, however, the right togiveprotect our Imperial communications and to/protection to foreign interests.      The British Representativereported that Government troops were still advancing,hut that there was a possibility of a widespreadtribal rising.      The Prime Minister of Iraq had made an appeal for assistance by the Royal i-tir Force.He wanted us to fly aircraft over the area in orderto produce a sedative effect.      We had already lostone machine in the area affected.      The first advice from the British Representative had been opposed torendering assistance,  out the situation had now changed,  end the British Representative^ inclinationwas to support the Prime Minister in his effort to restore order because,  (a) he could see no-one inIraq with weight enough to take the Prime Minister&apos;splace;    (b) if he failed the whole   administration mightcollapse with consequences that were difficult to foresee,  and (c) because,  if xhe Prime Ministersucceeded in quelling the revolt, his prestige would be
much enhanced, and the fact that we had refusedhim help in his urgent need might render our future relations with him difficult.      The british representative, however, felt that an essential condition of any support whatsoever should &quot;be aguarantee that a real effort should he made to redress the grievances of the tribes in revolt,and that meanwhile, every means  should be taken torepacify them without bloodshed.      He was encouraged to. hope that the use of agents might bring this about.Ah extended use of British agents accompanied bydemonstration flights by the Royal iiir Force would naturally be taken by the tribes to mean that wewere bacxing the Government and might have theeffect of turning the scale in the Prime Minister&apos;s favour.      But it would have to he made clear to the tribes that we were acting purely in the interestof stability and that we were concerned for theirwelfare.    &apos; The participation of the Royal Air Forcemight, however, also mean that in the end we shouldhave to take a more active share in quelling disorderand thus Decome more heavily involved.      In thecircumstances, the British Representative asked for guidance.      That was the general purport of his report.      The Secretary of State was clear that wewere under no ooligabions at all to render assistance.The Secretary of State for Air said he had also just received a telegram from Iraq on the same subject containing a suggestion that Sir K. Comwallis,a British adviser to the Iraq Government, might besent to the disaffected area in connection with the demonstration.      If the Royal Air Force was usedthey must have control of the operations.In the course of the discussion which was begunat the morning meeting and continued again in the
afternoon, it was pointed out that the situation that had arisen was one which had always been feared in theevent of a &quot;bad Government in Iraq.      The present prime Minister was anti-British and it was suggestedthat nothing was likely to change him in that respect.It was stated also that the Marsh Arahs, among whom the unrest had arisen, were among the &quot;best friends of theBritish Government,  out that the present Prime minister had himself come to power by stiring up difficultiesin that region,,After considerable discussion,  the cabinet agreed:-(a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government were notprepared to authorise demonstrationflights, and that their policy was toprevent .a-.BAsing. OtevicL Iteo^vuc^ Cuvtiv-tcL tu tr&amp;t iu^u*^(b) That,  if the Government of Iraq was prepared to get in touch with the tribesand to redress their legitimate grievances,the most suitable agents should beemployed to get in touch with the tribesand reach a settlemente(c) That the Foreign Office should replyto this effect.

The Cabinet had before their a, Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (C.P.-99 (35))seeking authority, for reasons given, to prepare and submit to the Committee of Home Affairs a Bill to expend the maximum loan period for water and drainageschemes in Scotland from 30 to 60 years, subject toa requirement that where a local authority desiredto borrow for a period in excess of 30 years theperiod of repayment should be determined, by theDepartment of Health for Scotland, with a consequen-tial amendment of the Public Health (Scotland) Act,1897, to enable borrowing from the Public Works LoanBoard over the extended period,    &quot;&quot;he Bill, which mustbe introduced in the Rouse of Commons, was unlikely to be opposed, and the Treasury and Minister ofHealth had no objection to the proposal.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State forScotland set forth/in CP.  99 (35).

The Cabinet had before them the SixteenthReport of the Committee on Economic Informationof the Economic Advisory Council (CR.-94 (35)),which had been circulated for the information ofthe Cabinet on the instructions of the Prime MinisterTwo points were dealt with in the Report,   mhe firstconcerned the intervals at which censuses of thepopulation should be held:    the second, a smalladdition which the Committee wished to recommend should be made to the particulars required to be furnished at the registration&apos;of births.The Cabinet took note of theReport referred to above,
8.        The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised, as amatter of urgency, a point which would have teenraised by the Minister of Health (who was absent onthe Bench in the House of Commons)   in connectionwith the National Health Insurance and contributory pensions Bill.      There was a question relevant tothe contents of the Bill to which the Cabinet had,as yet. given a provisional answer only.     UnlessParliament should otherwise determine, the weeklycontributions for pensions were to be increased by2d. for men and Id. for women from 1st January next.This was provided for by the Contributory pensions act of 1925.      The Cabinet Committee on this matter had reported (CP.  49(35)) provislonally   that this increase in contributions should be allowed to operate?but that this conclusion might have to be re-examinedwhen the Report and recommendations of the StatutoryCommittee.on Unemployment Insurance was available,in vie?/ of the possibility of a set-off againstthe increase in pensions contributions by a concurrentdecrease of unemployment insurance contributions.The Cabinet approved these conclusions (14(35),Wednesday, 13th March). When the Cabinet committee reported it was expected that the UnemploymentInsurance Statutory Committee would report before the health Insurance and Pensions Bill had to be intro-duced. This expectation had been disappointed.The Bill was needed as early as possible in July (toavoid recovery of arrears of contributions excusedby the Bill);    second reading was required bef6veY/hitsuntide.       The necessary negotiations with the approved Societies had been completed.      It was under-stood that the Unemployment Insurance Committee might
not report until the end of the month.      The Ministerof health did not doubt that the Bill should beintroduced without awaiting the Report of the Unemploy-ment Insurance Committee.      The need for the Bill wasindependent of the question whether the increase inpensions contributions was allowed to operate or not.The Billy it had to be remembered? provided for keeping the unemployed insured in Health and Pensions insurance and relieving them from the worst consequences of falling into arrears of contributions..        The Ministerof Health therefore asked for authority that the Billbe introduced in advance of the receipt of the Reportof the Statutory Committee.The Cabinet agreed:-to approve the introduction in the Houseof Commons of the National HealthInsurance and Contributory Pensions Billin advance of the receipt of the Reportof the Statutory Committee.

ANN5X TO CONCLUSION 9.    .His Majesty&apos;s Government wish to take advantageof Sir Brie Drummcnd&apos;s visit to London and return to duty in Rome to communicate directly and urgently withSignor Mussolini as to the meeting of the League Councilthis week, when the Italo-Abyssinian question is on theagenda.2. Great Britain attaches and has always attached a value which cannot be exaggerated to the intimate and long-established character of Anglo-Italian relations,,of which the conclusions at Stresa recently furnishedso conspicuous and so useful an example.      It is there-fore of the utmost importance that the course of pro-cedure at the meeting of the Council should be such asshall satisfy the due discharge of the duty of the UnitedKingdom as a member of the Council without impairingin the least degree the friendly co-operation between theUnited Kingdom and Italy in all matters.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government have learned with muchsatisfaction that Italy has nominated her two representa-tives on the Conciliation Commission and sincerely truststhat this will prove a further step towards the solutionof the dispute by agreement.      Signor Mussolini will be aware of the deep feeling that is entertained in theUnited Kingdom in support of promoting the peaceful solutionof international disputes by or under the League of Nations.This is the avowed policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government fromwhich they cannot depart.      The present position.is thatAbyssinia alleges that she entertains fears of aggressive
action on the part of Italy while Italy alleges that hercolonies and populations on Abyssinia&apos;s borders are exposed to a  serious danger of attack from the Abyssinian side.His Majesty&apos;s Government anticipate that at the meetingof the Council anxieties will be entertained as to whetherthe conciliation procedure, even when happily put in motion,will bring about an agreed and peaceful result in good time or whether, on the other hand, in view of the number of points which may be in dispute and the time which may be occupied in seeking to adjust them the dangers of conflictmay not still remain.      While, therefore, there may be strong reason for urging that the conciliation procedureif diligently pursued by both sides would be the appropriate method of adjusting the dispute,    His Majesty&apos;s government cannot help feeling that it will be impossible for theCouncil of the League on this ground to dissociate itselffrom all contact with the matter between the present meeting and the next ordinary meeting in September.      Whattherefore is wanted is some agreed method of maintainingcontact with the course of events such as would justifythe Council at its present meeting in leaving conciliationto pursue its natural course and produce its fruits inthe meantime.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore trust that instructions will be given to the Italian representatives to discuss with the other members of the Council the mostsuitable method to  secure this result.      Mr. Eden willbe attending the Council as the representative of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and will hold himself in readiness to confer with the Italian representatives and othermembers of the Council for this purpose.

The Cabinet took advantage of the presenceof His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome to consult him as to the effect of recent events, including the abyssinian episode and the strengthening of Franco-Italian relations, on the respective British andFrench general position in Italy.A summary of Sir Eric Drummond&apos;s remarksis attached in Appendix II.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.,17th May, 1935.-19-
APPENDIX      I.SUMMARY CP REMARKS BY THE RIGHT HON.SIR BRIO DBJJMMOND.  K .0 .M ,6, 0,B,,HIS&quot; MAJESTYTS AMBASSADOR AT ROME,  m0THE CABINET AT ^EIR MEETING ON FRIDAY.MAY 17,  19 55.(Sir Eric Drummond Had arrived by air atCroydon at 11,45 a,m., and. was introduced into the Meeting at about 12-30 p.m.)SIR ERIC DRUMMOND thought the first point theCabinet should realise was that the policy of sendingtroops and reinforcements to the African colonies was largely M. MussolihiVs own..   It was known to have been opposed by all his    advisers, both military and financial.As far as he knew, the only supporter of the policy wasdi Bono, the new High Commissioner of the two italian colonies.   M. Mussolini, however, had been careful neverto make any statement committing himself in regard to changes .territorial /    He had always said that, he was only sendingtroops to the colonies to defend them against possibleattack.    there was no doubt that  the Italians at  oneAbyssian attacktime had been really apprehens ive..of knowing to repre-sentations from officials in the colonies.    If anyattempt were made to talk fo M. ^ussolini on the militaryprogramme it would only result in infuriating him and.commit himself tohe might then     / things that he would afterwards regret.He thought that the immediate question for consideration was the attitude to be adopted at the Meeting of theCouncil of the league on May 20th,    The Italians hadalready nominated their two members of the OonciliationCommission.At this point Sir Eric Drummond was interrupted bya question as to why m, Mussolini was so greatlyinterested personally in the reinforcements to thecolonies, to which he replied that the Duce had really
if at all successfulfeared an attack, which/would have grave repercussions on his  o^n position.Sir Eric&apos;s attention having keen drawn to remarksin one    of his  own Despatches as to the military possibili-.cA w . Mu s s o 1 ini&apos; sf. ^ eg /involved in y Austrian policy and the factthat things were going none too well in mripoli, he added that       Mussolini was probably also glad, to havetroops mobilised, in case of trouble in Europe.    Fe had anto some extentidea also that the calling up of troops relieved ytheunemployment position.Reference having been made to a statement made bythe Italian Ambassador in London,  Sir ^ric said, that atany rate M, Mussolini had never committed himself in Rome toan aggressive policy, even if it might be in his thoughts.To a suggestion that M. Mussolini might have inmind the possibility of finding in Ethiopia supplies of oilhe replied that he had no information to that effect, butthat the Luce always kept in view the relief of pressure on the population and the desirability of finding a field for raw materials .Returning to the position at Geneva, Sir Fric brumroondcontinued that the Italian Government were proceeding onthe lines of their Treaty with Ethiopia for the conciliationof disputes.    As he had. said,  they had nominated their members of the Conciliation Commission, and by adding one additional member this could be converted into an arbitra-tion procedure,    ^he    Italians had nominated as theirrepresentatives two Italians:    the Ethiopians, one Swissand one French jurist,    ^he Italians maintained, that, thiswas not in the spirit of the Treaty, He thought that theItalians had some justification for this view and mightobtain some support for it at Geneva.   As to the terms ofreference,  the Italians insisted that they must be limitedto the original dispute over the Wal-wal incident, though they acknowledged that this should be followed later by a
delimitation of th^ frontier,    &quot;&quot;hey insisted, however,that the Wal--wal affair must eome first and the otherafter,    This also was not unreasonable.    If these difficulties could be surmounted at Geneva he thoughtthat procedure by this method was the test plan,    TheItalians still believed that they could settle direct and whenwith fhe Fthiopians, though if/ necessary a fifth memberof the Commission could be appointed,    wis own view wasthat within six weeks or two months M, Mussolini mightrealise that he was adopting a dangerous course and mightbe willing to find a way out,  provided he could save hisrealface, by obtaining some/economic advantages:   that was tosay, something on the line of the Secretary of State&apos;suggestion for action at Addis Ababa with a view tosecure an advantage of this kind.    There was some&apos;under their mreaty of friendship with Italyobligation on the Ethiopians^/to do something in that direction.    Within six weeks or so he thought theItalian Government might possibly ask us to make ademarche at Addis Ababa, and at the appropriate moment we ought to tell them that we were ready to do so.   we ought also to warn them that If they proposed anythingor territoryaffecting the independence/of Fthiopia we must insist on being consul4&quot; ed in accordance with the provisions of theTreaty of 1906.   He thought it was useless to proceed onthe lines o-r the Kellogg Pact or the Covenant,  and thatthe Treaty of 1906 was p better basis ,    we did not thinkthat M. Mussolini had decided exactly what he wanted in ethiopia, but if we insisted, on our rights under theTreaty of 1906 that would place us in a strong position,and force the Italians to disclose their hand.In the course.o^ a number of questions that werepnf to him. Sir Frie Drummond made some supplementaryobs erv^i t ions , s ummaris ed below ,On the procedure at Geneva he thought that, if thematter was skilfully handled it might be reasonable to
allow the Italians to go on with the conciliation procedure.The Council of the league might have to go into the questionof whether the Ethiopians were justified in nominatingforeign representatives, and into the terms of reference:but, subject to this, the conciliation procedure might beallowed to go on, though possibly resort might be had inthe end to arbitration.In reply to a suggestion that if no settlement was insight before September, when the rains came to an end inthe colonies,- the Italians might take forcible action.Sir Eric said that two things might interfere with this.First, M. Mussolini&apos;s realisation of what military actioninvolved, and,  second, a demand on our part to be consultedunder the ^treaty of 1906, which would put us in a strong position.    He thought that any member not only of the Councilbut of the leagi^e,  could demand a special meeting of theCouncil if in the interval the situation should, becomethreat ening.Asked as to whether something ought not to be done toavoid, the postponement of the question from Way until the september Meeting of the Council, he    agreed     that either a Committee or a Rapporteur might be appointed to follow the dispute.    It was possible that the Italians might agreeperhaps more easily to a Rapporteur than to a Committep,to some such procedure/   ^Te thought they would probablyobject less to that course than to an arrangement permittingconvokeeither party to    ^    a Special Meeting of the Council.In the course of the discussion,  observations were madeto the effect that leaving the conciliation procedure tocontinue offered no hope of a settlement,  owing, first, tothe fact that, it could not even start until  the difficulty about the nomination of *he Ethiopian representatives had been  cleared up, and, second, that the terms of referencehad not been settled, and. that the Council ough*  to clear up these points before agreeing t0 conciliation beingproceeded with.
On this suggestion Sir Fric Drtcroond commentedthat there was not much chance of a settlement either by conciliation procedure or through action by theLeague of Nations.    Pe was  convinced that at some pointpressure would have to be put on the Emperor of Ethiopiato afford some economic advantages to Italy, as had teensuggested.    If that failed he feared we were in fortrouble.    Fe thought that the Italian attitude was likely to be immovable both on the Ethiopian nominationsof foreigners and on the terms of reference.. Hotwithstand-ing the strong feeling in Italy against the expeditionhe thought I+  certain that. M, Mussolini would not give way at the present time to pressure from the League.In reply to a suggestion that M. Mussolini, might beasked not to give too rigid instruct ions to the Italianrepresentatives at Geneva, Sir Fric Drumr^nd thought this was hardly necessary.    At Geneva the Italiansfrequently changed their attitude from day to day, and kept in close telephonic communication with Rome,mowards the end of the Meeting, when the broadlines  of the Cabinet. &apos;s policy had been settled. Sir Ericsaid that he hoped, to get back to Rome on the evening ofMonday, May 20th,    He agreed that a communication mightbe sent to Rome to the effect that he was returning witha message from the Prii ish Government, accompanied by a request that in the meantime we hoped that the instruc-tions  to the Italian delegates might not be finally settled.In reply t0 a question as to the general attitudeof the Italian people towards the despatch of troops, he-said that they disliked the taking away of sons fromfamilies.    On the whole, the expedition was unpopular.Many people were rather frightened of a campaign in a country where prisoners were treated severely.   Manyyoung students who said they were prepared to die for
Italy did not want to go to Ethiopia.    He could addnothing to his despatches on the question of sickness,&quot;but he understood that action was being taken to dealwith the difficulties of water-supply. He did not thinkthat the unpopularity of the expedition was likely to affect. M, Mussolini personally at the present time, butin the event of any reverse the situation might becomes serious.Reverting to his earlier remarks as to a warning that we expected to be eonsxilted under the mreaty of 1906if any question of Ethiopia&apos;s Integrity was involved.Sir Eric explained that, he linked this in his mind notwith the immediate quest ion of what was to be done atGeneva, but rather with the questions raised in M.Grandi&apos;communication affecting Italian possible objectives.APPENDIX   II.Later in the Meeting Sir Fric Drummond. was asked asto the effect of our attitude towards the Ethiopianquestion on the position of this country in Italy.Sir Fric thought our position was only very slightlyaffected, by this.    mhe Italians were rather given tolaunching Press attacks on other countries, thinking that it might affect policy.    Our position in Italy wasnot quite so strong as  it had been when Franco-italian relations were bad.    Now the tendency in Italy was to turn to France in the first instance,  in the hope. that, we might take the s^me line.    He thought, however, that both Italy and France were very unhappy when we took adifferent line.    TJe had observed for a week or so alittle coldness in Italy as to our attitude, but he didnot take it very serioiisly.Asked as to whether Prance had any understanding with Italy on Ethiopian developments. Sir Eric did not
Whitehall Gardens, S.W,1,May 17,  19 35,think this was the case.   Re -understood that whenVa Laval made his agreement with the Italian government over Ethiopia he had said definitely that the free handonly affected economic questions and must not beconstrued, as affecting the territorial position,M, Laval had. called on him in Rome and. told him thathe had. only given economic concessions ,    ^he reluctanceo&quot;p the French Ambassador to carry out his instructions had not, he thought, been due to any understanding, but wasowing to a genuine conviction that M, Mussolini,  Ifapproached on those lines, might have &quot;n outburst whichhe would afterwards regret .
