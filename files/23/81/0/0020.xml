1. The Cabinet held a special Meeting to considerthe policy to be adopted at, and the arrangements tobe made for,  the Stresa Conference,  and had beforethem a Mote by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (C.P.-79 (35))  covering a Memorandum by theForeign Office,  prepared before the return of theLord Privy Seal from his European Conversations.The main points for decision were contained inPart TIT of the Memorandum, and related more parficu-larly to -(1)  The Fas tern Pact.(2) Austria.f,n. \ (face&quot;)5. (3)  Locarno .(4) The Air Pact.(5) Armamen+s of Austria, Hungary and bulgaria.Shortly before the Meeting the following additionaldocuments were circulated:-Notes of a statement which Mr Fden had hoped to make (if he had not been absentthrough indisposition):A memorandum by the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on a Conversation with the French&apos;   Ambassador on the 6th April, 19 35:A copy of a Despatch from the british ambassador in Paris, dated 5th April,1935:A record of Mr Eden&apos;s Conversation withdraw. Benes in Prague on the 4th April,1935:A record of Mr Eden&apos;s conversations with M, Beck, the Polish Minister forForeign Affairs,  in Warsaw on the2nd and. 3rd April,  19 35.The Prime Minister expressed the general regretof the Cabinet at the indisposition of the Lord privy seal, both for personal reasons and owing to its effecton the Streaa Sonference.    Be dre1&apos;&apos; attention to theMemorandum circulated by the Lord Privy Seal.(As the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Memorandum had only been circulated shortly before the Meeting,a short adjournment was made to  enable members to r ead it.)
At  the morning Meeting the discussion was confined to the general aims of British policy to be pursuedat Stresa and to the composition of thp United kingdom delegation.The discussion on general policy tended tosupport the line suggested by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs  in his introductory Note datedApril 5,  1935 (C..P.-79  (35)),  and the suggestions made were mainly from the point  of view of emphasis.Thus a suggestion was very generally supported that,if asked by France and Italy to put  an end toconversations with Germany and to do nothing morethan indicate our intention to stand firm with france and Italy, we should not agree to it:    while we should frankly admit that there was much evidence to show that Germany could, not be brought to an acceptable agreement, we should make clear that wewere not finally convinced that this was the caseuntil after fuller explorations.    Our line, therefore,it was suggested, should be that we could not agreeto make a complete breach with Germany, and to take no action except to threaten her.    Such an attitude,it was  pointed out,would not be supported in thiscountry.    At the same time it was suggested that we ought to reaffirm our commitments under Locarno withall possible emphasis, and express  emphatically our!intention to carry out the mreaty without entering- ... -into more specific undertakings for implementing the-treaty.    We should make clear that we should like tomake more propositions to Germany, admittedly inorder to test her sincerity.    It was pointed outthat if France and Italy asked us to join them in astatement that we would not stand a breach of thepeace anywhere, that meant in effect an undertaking
that &apos;we would be prepared to take forcible actionanywhere.    Germany was in a volcanic mood and notinclined to yield to threats.   We ought not to agreeto such a proposition unless we were prepared totake action anywhere,  e,g., in the event of trouble in Memel.    &quot;&quot;here was general agreement that we ought not to accept further commitments, but  .that we ought on no account to discouragePrance,  Italy and other countries from making suchsecurity arrangements as they deemed necessary byway of mutual assurances.   As a deterrent was ofgreat importance, it was suggested that we should state that we intended to have an Air Force at leastequal to Germany.    It was pointed out, however, that so far nothing had tended to steady Germany, and itwas suggested that any anodyne announcement fromStresa would only encourage her and would tend to throw many of the smaller weaker European nations on to what they thought was going to be the strongersidev   consequently it was very desirable to show a firm front .Another suggestion was that it would be a mistake to assume   that Stresa was the determiningpoint in policy.    It was rather a necessary stage in clarifying the position and  educating   publicopinion at home and abroad;    everyone desired peaceto be maintained by collective action, and thequestion at issue was whether it was  to be with germany or without her.    Paving established contact withGermany we ought to keep it, so the Stresa Confer-ence ought, amongst other things   to be used to &quot;ascer^in mind,tain further what Germany had/e*g-- as regards the demilitarised zone.    In this connection it wassuggested that we ought not to withhold from Germany
what was happening at. St rep a,  as that would undothe good of the Berlin visit.On the quest ion of whether we were going to stress to agree to close down conversations withGermany or not, the comment was made that this wouldhe a profound mistake.    To adopt  Signer Mussolini&apos;view would he to throw German public opinion morebehind Fitler ^han ever, and to drag us  intoescapades which we had no intention to follow.   TVeought therefore,  it was suggested,  to go f o Stresaintending to show the French and Italians howdissatisfied we were with the German position, e.g.,from f he point. 0-f viW of their atiibide towards theconclusion of an Fast era Guarantee Pact by thenations that  desired it,    &apos;Ve oiight to br--ing home toGermany the effect, of fhe position she was taking inappearing to be interested in peace and yet blockingthe only road by which it coul^ bp reached,  namely,mutual confidence,  e.g., mutual assistance arrange-ments   while all ^hQ time she expected Europe toaccept her appearance of goo^ will,    &quot;hat ,  it wassiiggested. ought4- to be in the minds  of the Brit ishnegotiators at  Stresa..    It. was thought   thai these considerations ought to be put with friendliness toGermany, so that the German people may be impressedmorally and  spiritually.    &apos;Ve should at  the same timehave to convirsc3 m , Flandin and Sign or Mussolini that,we had no intention of leaving them in the lurch,&quot;&quot;he idea of this was to get their confidence withoutisolating Germany at Stresa .    It was recognised,however,  that it. vould be a difficult  task to accomplish this without appearing to make a breachin the common front.An argument given for collective security against, the isolation of Germany was thf3 danger of bringing Germany and Japan together. I+ was suggested-.4-.
ti \j Jthat Locarno could be strengthened by emphasisingour intention to support the Treaty rather than inlaying stress,  as had been done In the past InParliament,  on the delays involved.In the course of&apos; the discussion a good deal ofstress was laid on the fact that the Stresa Confer-ence was to be followed immediately by a Meeting ofthe Council at Geneva.    In view of recent articles in&quot;&quot;&quot;he mimes&quot;, which had created a wrong impressionabroad,  it. was suggested that it was very important to emphasise the solidarity  of the members  of theLeague o^ Nations  in support o^ the Covenant. .    Other-wise Germany would say that  she had. had a diplomaticsuccess .   We could not accept, the commitments  inPastern Europe, but. we ought to give all the moral support we could, to the arrangements proposed by other powers,  on condition that this should be done throughthe League,Another     comment    was that while the Pritishpeople   had. come out of the late &quot;**ar realising that war was foolish. Germany had drawn the conclusion thatthe mistake was to make war on everyone at  once.If she realised that she could not deal with nationspiecemeal she would not take action.    Hence, thoughpublic opinion would admittedly be against assumingany further commitments,  the keynote of our policy atStresa should, be to keep close to Prance and Italy,as any breach would make war certain and lead to thedefection of the minor Powers .mhe Cabinet were reminded that the Naval part ofthe German Conversations had. not yet been reported tothe other Peers ,   nhey were also reminded that we werenot asked to join in either the Pattern Pact or theAustrian Pact,  so that we could go a long way in supporting these without, adopting any &quot;new commitmentourselves.   ,&quot;&quot;he Austrian Pact had. not yet been worked
out in detail, though France and Italy were under-stood to he at work on the subject,Pt the afternoon Meeting the Cabinet discussed in detail the various proposals made in C.P.-79 (35).The Catinet agreed  (a) mb.at at the Stresa Conference therepresentatives of the United kingdom should beThe Prime Minister,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.THE EASTERN PACm.(b) That the attitude of the United kingdom representatives should be in accordancewith the following extract from thePreface by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs  to C.P.-79  (35):-&quot;We should begin by ashing for full examination of the proposal made byGermany  (Annex i on page 9), urging that though it  does not go as far as some others desire,  it none the lessgoes some way and should not. be rejectedout of hand.    this may be expected tobring up the difficulty that. Hitler has indicated that he objected to such a pact of non-aggression and consultationbeing supplemented by agreements between certain, of the signatories to furnishmutual assistance if the Pact wasdisregarded.    We should indicate thatwe did not consider that Germany had any right to take such an objectionmerely because she was not prepared togo further herself.    It would be far better to agree to the German proposal as far as it went,-while indicating thatsome States would wish to make agreementsamongst themselves for mutual assistance.If Germany then took up the attitude that in such circumstances she was notprepared to offer to join in anyEastern Pact at  all,  that would, showwhere the blame for the breakdown reallylay.    On the other hand,  if at Stresathe German formula is merely rejected asworthless, Germany will certainlyexploit the position by saying that shemade an offer which was rejected.    in presenting this line of argument, we ought to lay stress on our own publicopinion and insist that we can only,approve of a course&apos; which would satisfyour public opinion that everything wasbeing done by the Powers to b^ingGermany into the agreement and to meet any reasonable objections.We should also sound the others atStresa on any o^her alternative to the
-9 0 9original conception of the Pastern Pact .A variant which, has been   suggested isas follows:    Germany professes to be Arerymuch afraid of Russia, and. Russia to bevery much afraid of Germany.   But thereis a large belt of country which liesbetween them  - Czechoslovakia. Poland,Lithuania, Latvia,  Estonia.    If Germanyundertook to respect her Pastern frontier and Russia to respect her Western frontier,and. if these undertakings were dulyobserved,  the intermediate belt, would notbe disturbed on either side.    If inaddition to these guarantees  (which are largely represented by non-aggressionpacts already entered into by germany or Russia), there were added a promiseby Germany to come to the assistance ofan intermediate country if attacked by russia,  and a promise by Russia to dothe same If the intermediate country isattacked, by Germany,  then this would bea real contribution to equal security.And  it avoids what  is now Germany&apos;s mainobjection, viz., that she will notconsent to agree to fight side by side with Russia.    there are probable objec-tions which would b^ raised by various parties to this scheme, but it none theless might be worth putting forward as another effort on    our.part to finding a plan in which Germany would, be included( c) that, subject, to (b),  the line we shouldtake up in Stresa in reply to any Frenchenquiry as to our attitude towards theform of the Fas tern Pact which France and.Russia will now want to negotiate,  shouldbe as set for*h in para.19 of CP.-79 (35):-(l) We should recall the part we playedlast July in modifying the Barthou pro-posal,  and in expressing our approvalof that idea.(2) We should express  our grave concern that neither Germany nor Poland seemsprepared to-join in the Pact, and oursatisfaction that the Pact would be sodrawn as to enable them to join it.(3) We should, repeat th01 it is well under-stood that  the United kingdom cannotundertake new responsibilities in respectof the Pact 0(4) But we should add that  as firm supporters of all practical methods  for collective security, and as  faithful Members  of theLeague of Nations, we should, be prepared,to accept the carrying through of such anarrangement in the absence 0^ a more complete agreement,  provided, that it  isentered into through arrj under the auspices of the League of Nations.(5) We should call the attention of theFrench and Italian representatives tothe German document  (Annex I)  and do
justice to what it. contains  (thoughit will be regarded as  insufficient),remembering that   the German Governmentare- presenting this  suggestion in theirr reply t. o Franc e .the AUSTRIAN QUESTION.(d) That the line to be aimed at when theAustrian question comes up at Stresashould be as set  forth in para.21 of.&apos;D.-79  (35),  as  follows:-(l) We should recall our previous d^clara-tions  on the subject and confirm them,Le.,  that we cannot undertake special responsibilities  of our own in thematter., but that we do regard the integrity and independence of Austriaas an object, o^ British policy and havealready so declared.(2) that we continue to favour the pursuit of the Rome objective, as stated in theLondon communique&quot;.(3) We should emphasise our continueddesire to see an Austrian arrangement which German;/ is a party, but shouldnot discourage an arrangement, withouther if every effort to get her concur-rence fails,(4) We should call attention to thedifficulties raised by Germany  on theground of the vagueness of the  express-sion &quot;interference&quot;, and ask whetherthe authors of the plan have as yetfound any more precise words,(5) We should insist that anything thatis done must be done under the auspices of the League of Nam ions and should    notbe an arrangement, made between certainStates without reference to Geneva.this last point is really covered bythe terms  of the Rome communique, but itwill be fo10 us to bring it  out  afreshand make much of it,C.6)  In these circumstances we should indicate that while we shall continue-to do anything that can be done to getGermany included, we nevertheless feelthat an Austrian pact, worked out in suitable terms and under the auspices of the League of Rations,  is a contri-bution bo collect iAre security which weshould approve,TRF DFMILITARISFD ZONE.(e) that on the question of the demilitarised zone the general line to be followedshould be as set  forth in Para&quot;, 17 of1.P.-79 (35), as follows :-
(l) Any declaration which we makeshould be made jointly with Italy.Our obligations under Locarno exactlycorrespond ..Cs) We should be prepared, with Italy,to make a puhJiu,. declaration that we regard the Locarno Treaty as a bindingobligation which we intend to dischargeaccording to its terms,(3) I should prefer not to make a specific declaration about the&quot;demilitarised zone&quot;, though thiswould be included in the general reference.    It would be better to speak of the obligations of the   treaty as a whole instead of picking out  oneset of obligations to the exclusion of others ,(4) We should avoid making any public declaration or giving any privateassurance which defines  exactly what we would ^o in a particular hypotheticalcase.    Indeed.-, we should endeavour toavoid being drawn into any such discus-sion and should suggest that our firmpublic statement that we mean the treaty to be duly observed is much more effective from every point, of view than going intohypothetical details .    If the Frenchpersist,  it may be necessary to pointout that French public opinion is likelyto judge very differently a minorinfraction like.a small fortificationfrom a major infraction like the mobility-s at ion of large forces in the demilitarised,zone.    But it is surely most umdesirableto be drawn into the discussion of thesedist.inetions .(5) We should remember throughout, andremind the French, that the main purposeof any pronouncement, about the sanctityof Locarno at Stresa is to give theGermans notice that,  thouigh they mayhave disregarded Treaty obligations aboutarmaments    they had better be warnedagainst disregarding Locarno.THE AIR PACT,(f) As regards Germany&apos;s  desire to negotiateand agree to the Air Pact, presumablywithout any agreed limitation 0^ respectiveAir Forces, to approve para. IS of CP.-79(35), which concludes as follows:-It may therefore be only an academicexercise to consider whether thiscounfry would like the Air Pact tobe carried through in the absence ofother collateral arrangements wi^hGermany.    It will be something done!it. is a proposal which has been warmly welcomed, by public opinion:    It provides a specific promise by France of help tothis  country.    Ptit to secure It as an
isolated conclusion would be contrary to previous Governmentintentions, and,  in any case,seems an unattainable object,(g) that if, as was anticipated,  theFrench should make a proposal thatthe Powers which were willing todo so should contract the obligation of the Air Pact among themselves,  itshould, be pointed out that it would,hardly be consistent with the locarno treaty if some of the parties agreed on action among themselves without reference to Germany, who was also a party..   The United Kingdom Pelega*    .-however, should agree   to drafting ofPact,  provided that Germany was broughtinto the negotiations as a party,RF-ARM AMEN&quot;1  OF mPF SMALLER POWERS.(h) that when the. question of legalisingthe re-armament,  of the lesser Powerswas raised, the United Kingdom Dele-gates should point  out that thetreaty of St. Germain and the peace treaties regulating fhe armamentsof other former enemies involve anumber o^ other nations that winnot be represented at Stresa.mHE MFF^ING OF mHF CSUNOIL AT GENEVA.(i) That pending the Stresa conference it was Impossible to foresee whatthe situation would be when theCouncil of the League of Nationsmet at Geneva, but that our generalaim should be pe^ce achieved by some system of collective security underthe League of Nations, withoutacceptance o^ new commitments,
8. Attenti on was  colled to recent articles in &quot;mhe Times&quot; newspaper on the subject of theproposals made by. the German Government on theoccasion of the visit by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the Lord Privy Seal to berlin, and to the deplorable effect produced bythese articles in various foreign countries where &quot;&quot;he Timesn newspaper was taken to repre-sent Government,  opinion,Careful consideration was given to the remarkson this subject by fhe Lord Privy Seal, whoseFemorandiim concluded as follows:-&quot;If,  on the other hand, we appear tothe outside world, to be weak andvacillating,  if we allow the 1 Times&apos;to continue to preach defeatism andto continue to be regarded as theorgan of His Majestyrs Government,then we shall encourage Germany&apos;demands, and,  no less serious,encourage the weaker Powers  to takerefuge with her, in the belief thatthe collective police system.&apos;,can never be effective becauseEngland will never play her partin its support .&quot;The Cabinet agreed -that the Secretary  of State forForeign Affairs,  in the statement the was to make in Parliament onthe following day on the resultsof the recent series of visits to european Capitals,  should beauthorised to  include a passagemaking clear that  &quot;mhe Times&quot;articles did not represent theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.
