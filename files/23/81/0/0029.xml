1. Pefore the Meeting, the Foreign Office had.been able to circulate to the Cabinet en clairtelegrams from His majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin(Nos. 19? to 197)  giving a translation oT&quot; the wholeof the speech delivered by Herr TJitler on the previous evening.A tribute was paid, to the organisation which hadrendered, this possible.mhe Secretary of&apos; State for foreign Affairs dr eve-attention to two corrections which,  as he had ascer-tained. that morning from Berlin, ha^ to be made inthe circulated, copies, viz.:-(l)  In paragraph 8 of telegram 19 5,the statement that  &quot;The 3-ermar.Navy has been limited to forty-five per cent. o-r fhe British Wavy...&quot;should be altered to &quot;thirty-fiveper cent.&quot;(2)  In paragraph 2 of telegram 196, theword &quot;material&quot; should read &quot;moral&quot;.The speech was discussed mainly from the pointof view of its  effect, on the statements to be madeby the Lord &apos; Pr es id ent of the Council in fhe Hou.se ofCommons and. the Secretary of State for Air in theHouse of Lords the same afternoon.It was recognised that Herr Hitler&apos;s speech as awhole was perhaps the most important speech made inEurope this year and deserved most eareful considera-tion.    It appeared, to have been made as a reply tothe Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion in the House of commons on Ma;/ 2nd that Germany should, &quot;promote in moreconcrete shape fhe ideas which her Chancellor hasformulated&quot;, and this might be recognised.    As the debate would take place within less than 24 hours ofthe delivery of the speech. Parliament, could not  expect any considered reply.    Subject, to this, it should be welcomed ond promised, careful and sympathetic consider-ation,  an early step being to consult France and. Italy
and other nations concerned.The detailed points which,  it was suggested,tore on the Government statements to he made that afternoon were as follows:-(l)  mhe following passages, taken together,support the idea that,  in connectionff^t with the proposed Air Pact, we ought toZXf%5*)M- obtain an agreed limitation of arroa-w&quot;     &apos; ments :-Berlin ^elegvam &quot;o. 196. para.8:&quot;Their limitations of the German air arm to a degree of parity with theother individual Western Great Powersmakes possible at any time the fixing of a maximum which Germany undertakes to observation reserve&quot;.Berlin Telegram No. 197. para.14:&quot;Germany does not intend to increase her armaments beyond all bounds,We have not got  10,000 bombingplanes, and we shall never buildthem&quot; ,Berlin Telegram No. 196,  para .7:The German Government are ready toagree to an Air Convention supple-mentary to the Locarno Pact and todiscuss it .&quot;Berlin &quot;telegram No. 196. Para.8:&quot;They are, however, prepared at anytime to limit their armaments to anyextent which is also adopted by theother States&quot;.The reference at the beginning of berlin melegram No. 197 to the placing of limitations on bombing.$uU-     st\c*Ud ]/a.p cud.

f2) The first of the quotations in (l)  above,stating the limitations  o* the German. air arm to parity with other individualWestern Great Powers, could usefully be quoted to reaffirm the basis of theAir Force expansion proposals, namely,German parity with France,f3) Berlin Telegram No. 196. Paragraph 8.&quot;The German Navy has been limited tothirty-five per cent, of the british navy and. is thus still fifteen percent, below the total tonnage of theFrench Fleet&quot;.It was suggested that this wouldenable the proposed Naval discus-sions to be inaugurated at once,and that some reference to this might be made in the speech.mhe Cabinet agreed -fa) that Herr Hitler&apos;s speech did not involve any modification of the proposals for theexpansion of our air forces that were tobe announced in both Houses of parliament the same afternoon;fb) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should draft a statement, whichthe lord President of the Council could use in the Debate, to indicate the firstreaction of the Government towards theproposals, as shown in the discussion:fc) That any reply to the attack in theearly part of Herr Hitler&apos;s speech onthe Treaty of Versailles and. the attitudeof the former Allied Powers towards it.should, be reserved for a future debate on Foreign Affairs:f d) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the First Lord of the admiralty should, coneert early action with a view toInitiating the Naval Conversations with german representatives which are to takeplace in London and had only been postponed owing to Herr Hitler&apos;s speech.^(35) A,
