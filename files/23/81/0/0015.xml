APPENDIX.NOTE DELIVERED BY HIS MAJESTY*S AMBASSADOR IN berlin to THE GERMAN GOVERNMENT ON 18th MARCH, 1935.1.        His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United. Kingdom feelhound to convey to the German Government their protest against the announcement made &quot;by the latter on the 16thMarch of the decision to adopt conscription and to increasethe peace basis of the German army to 56 divisions.Following upon the announcement of a German air forcessuch a declaration is a further example of unilateral action., which apart from the issue of principle, is cal-culated seriously to increase uneasiness in Europe.        Theproposal for an Anglo-German meeting arose out of the termsof the Anglo-French communique of the 3rd February and theGerman reply of the 14th February supplemented by furthercommunications between His Majesty&apos;s Government and theGerman Government.      His Majesty&apos;s Government consider itnecessary to call the specific attention of the GermanGovernment to the effect of those documents.2,        The London communique of the 3rd February, whilenoting    that armaments limited by treaty could not be modified by unilateral action., declared that the British andFrench Governments favoured a general settlement freelynegotiated between Germany and other Powers which would makeprovisions for the organisation of security in Europe onthe lines therein indicated9 and would simultaneouslyestablish agreements about armaments which, in the case ofGermanys would replace the relevant provisions of Part V
&amp; w *Jof the Treaty of Versailles.      The communique&apos; went on tostate that it would he part of the general settlement which it contemplated that Germany would resume heractive membership of the League of Nations and proceeded to sketch out the terms of an air-pact between the locarno Powers to operate as a deterrent to aggression and to ensure immunity from sudden attacks from theair.3.        The German Governments reply ten days later wel-welcomed the spirit of friendly confidence which theAnglo-French communique expressed and undertook thatthe German Government would submit to exhaustive examina-tion the questions raised in the first part of theLondon communique.      It agreed that the spirit^ expressedin that communique;, of free negotiations between sovereignStates could alone lead to lasting international settle-ments in the sphere of armaments.      In particular itwelcomed the proposal for an air-pact s and the Germanreply concluded by saying that before taking part inthe proposed negotiations the German Government considered it desirable to clarify., in separate conversations with the Governments concerneds a number of preliminaryquestions of principle.      For this purpose it invitedHis Majesty1s Government to enter into a direct exchangeof views with the German Governmento4.        Since His Majesty&apos;s Government desired to make sure that there should be no misunderstanding as to the
scope and. purpose of the proposed Anglo-German meeting,they addressed a further enquiry to the German Governmenton 21st February to which the German Government repliedthe next day.      The result was that it was definitelyagreed between the two Governments that the object ofthe suggested meeting would be to carry consultation a stage further on all the matters referred to in theAnglo-French communique.        It is upon this basis,therefore,  that His Majesty&apos;s Government have beenpreparing to pay the visit to Berlin which the GermanGovernment suggested.5. Thus, what was contemplated was ,fa general settlement freely negotiated between Germany and theother Powers&quot; and &quot;agreements regarding armaments, whichin the case of Germany would replace the provisions ofPart V of the Treaty of Versailles.&quot;      This has throughoutbeen the purpose of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy and upon its achievement they have concentrated all their efforts at Geneva and elsewhere.      But the attainment of a comprehensive agreement which by common consentwould take the place of treaty provisions cannot be facilitated by putting forward, as a decision alreadyarrived at, strengths for military effectives greatlyexceeding any before suggested - strengths, moreover,which, if maintained unaltered, must make more difficult,if not impossible,   the agreement of other Powersvitally concerned.6. His Majesty&apos;s Government are most unwilling to abandon any opportunity which the arranged visit might
afford, of promoting general understanding, &quot;but in the new.circumstances, before undertaking it,   they feel bound tocall the attention of the German Government to the aboveconsiderations and they wish to be assured that theGerman Government still desire the visit to take place with the scope and for the purposes previously agreed,as set out in paragraph 4 above.
