CHINA.mhe embassy in.(Pr evioiisReference:Cabinet 9(35), Con-elusion 3.)1, After hearing a report from the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, following a Meeting of theCommittee on Political and Economic Relations with japan on(a)(e)the previous day, the Cabinet agreed  That the headquartersDiplomatic Mission tomoved to Nanking, bura c c oromo da t i onret obtained:o^ the BritishChina should bethat the present at Peking should beThat the necessary arrangements togive effect to this decision shouldbe made forthwith by the Foreign Officeand the Treasury (the Departments mainly concerned)  in consultation:That at the moment, pending a communi-cation by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to the Chinese Govern-ment and his decision as to the rightmoment for an announcement, the utmost-secrecy should be preserved, in thismatt er .
THE naval conference,1935 .Anglo-GermanC onyersations(PreviousRefefence:Cabinet 30(35). Con-conclusion ion 1.)2, mhe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the First lord of the Admiralty made reports tothe Cabinet as to the result 0* the Meetings held onthe previous day between British and German repre-sentatives who were considering the question ofNaval Limitation.    The outstanding point in these conversations arose out of Ferr Filler&apos;s announcement that Germany did not desire more than a ratio of35 per cent, of the British Fleet,  expressed,  it was understood,  in categories.    Herr Hitler was also prepared to let it be known publicly that in no circumstances would he ask for a larger percentageeven if other Po\&apos;Ters increased their building programmes,  or if Germany should acquire colonies.mhe German representatives, however, had adopted theattitude that acceptance of this proposal was anessential preliminary to further discussion.Tn the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat the German proposal offered advantages as  comparedwith unlimited building, an^ that  if it were nowrejected Herr t1 it ler might in the near future raisehis percentage.    It was felt, however,  that theGovernment of the United kingdom could not very wellaccept a proposal involving a marked, departure fromthe provisions  of the Treaty of Versailles without prior communication to the French and. Italian Govern-ments.    This, however, was a matter in which we were entitled, to take., the lead.mhe Cabinet were reminded that in the case ofthe Conversations with Japan and the United States ofAmerica an effort had been made to get rid of ratiosand to substitute programmes:    and. it was suggested
that possibly the German representatives might be induced to convert their ratios in each categoryinto programmes,It was also suggested that it might be explained to the German representatives that, while we ourselves had. no intention of letting the Oonversa-tions come to an end on the question of a ratio, wecould not well agree to it without consulting Franceand Italy,The Cabinet agreed.  fa) that the British negotiators, beforethe Conversations adjourned forWhitsuntide,  should try and find outexactly what was meant by the Germanproposal for a 35 per cent, ratio:Cb) That the results of the conversations should be reported to the ministers who have been dealing with the naval conference, 1935, namely.The Prime Minister,mhe Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAf f a Irs .The Secretary o^ State for DominionAffairs,&quot;mhe First Lord of the Admiralty,who would give any instructions tothe Delegates that might be required..

AIR PARITY in western EUROPE(PrReference:Cabinet SO(35). Con-clusion 1,)4, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air ^C.P.-116 (35)) quotingstatements by Herr Hitler expressing his willingness to limit the sise of Germany&apos;s Air Force to paritywith the other Western European Powers, viz,, a strength of 2,000 first-line aircraft, which he hoped to attain this year.    The Air Attache&quot; in &quot;Paris,however, had now been informed that the Germans were taking the French figure as 2,500 and claimingparity, whereas the French had actually less than,000, not all of which were modern in type and performance.    If, therefore, some limitation couldbe agreed, by Germany, and. if they could rely on the sincerity of such an undertaking, the French would be only too glad, not to have to build up to that number.The Secretary of State felt that the first step should be to convince the Germans that they were over-estimating the present French strength and that thefigure for agreement should be in the region of 1,500first-line aircraft.   Fe thought also that the projected Naval talks with Germany provided, anopportunity for a tripartite conference with a french representative on the limitation of air armaments,and suggestthat Fis Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors in ParisIan^ Perlin should be instructed, to sound, therespective Governments as *o the acceptability of an invitation to discussions of this kin-i in london.After discussion,  the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Air question (including bothAir Limitation and. the Air Pact) shouldbe taken up as a separate question andshould, no longer be considered, to benecessarily linked up with a general settlement (See Cabinet 12 (35),Conclusion 7, and Minutes o^ the268t.h Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence) .(b) that the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should, consider this decisions with a view to early action.

As the Act stood the provisionsas to crediting contributions could not apply to anychildren who left school earlier than September 3,1935, whereas a definite pledge had been given inthe Rouse of Commons by the Parliamentary Secretaryto the Ministry of Labour that the credit would begiven to those leaving school in the summer of 1935.The   proposed amending Bill would involve no charge on the Exchequer.After some discussion  mhe Cabinet authorised the Ministerof Labour to make enquiries throughthe appropriate channels as to whether there was likely to be any oppositionto the proposed Bill, and,  if therewas no opposition, to proceed withthe Bill.
