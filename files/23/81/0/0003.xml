GERMAN RE-ARMAMENT .For the omingConferencewith their ench Pr imeMinister andForeign Min-ister.General In-struetions toNegotiators.f previous reference:Cabinet 2(35), Con-elusion 1.)f. ft1. The Cabinet held a Special Meeting toconsider the question of German Re-armament, andhad the following Papers before them:-The Report of the ministerial committee (CP.-302 (34)):A Resume of a Conversation inParis between M. Flandin, M.Lavaland M. Leger, representing theFrench&apos;Government. and Sir john simon, Sir George Clerk andMr Campbell (CP.-303 (34)).(Both the above documents hadbeen before the Cabinet atthe Meeting referred to in the margin.)A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-6(35)), furnished in response to a request by the Cabinet at their previous Meeting and containing aseries of propositions as to theline to be taken at the forthcoming conference in London with FrenchMinis ters :A, Record of a Conversation between sir John Simon and M. Laval atGeneva on Saturday, January 12th,at 3,30 p.m.The Cabinet took C.P.-S (35) as the basis oftheir discussion and examined it paragraph by paragraph.   The result of the first pant of this discussion, relating to the general -attitude to beadopted by British Ministers engaged in the negotia-tions, subject to a good deal of flexibility being allowed to them in the conduct of the discussions,was that  The Cabinet approved paragraphs %to ? of CP.-6 (35), which are reproduced in the Appendix.(NOTE: Possible contributions to security^which might be made from our own sideif the circumstances required there are dealt with in the summary and conclusions which follow.)
POSSIBLE S. This part of the discussion was conducted on british&quot;CON- .TRIBUTTOW TO       the basis of 0.P.-6 (35), paragraph 8.SECURITY.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that his proposal was that the cabinet should examine his propositions not so much asinstructions, but as lines of advances on which theBritish negotiators would be authorised to proceedif the circumstances rendered this necessary and.desirable.The Secretary of State for War suggested thatbesides emphasising that the accommodation we were seeking was needed in the general Interests of europe and was  just as essential to France as to anyone else(as already decided:    Appendix,, paragraph 7), the negotiators should recall, the agreement in favourof equality of armaments in a regime of security.They might point out that the Germans are now gettingequality without security.   To prevent German equality of armaments appeared now to be impossible, and we wanted the French, to receive some degree of security.From, the first the French had. insisted, that one /ereatessential of security was inspection and supervision of armaments .   We might now notify that we were willingto accept a system of supervision to which we had hitherto hesitated to agree.    If that argument were used rightly we should have in it a real counter to french demands for further security, and. we might avoid,any further contribution with that object,   we shouldmake it clear that we were not doing this for ourselvesbut for the French interests, and. that we were surrenda?-ing something to which we   attached - :H the greatest importance.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthat meant some change in policy.   Although it was mentioned in the Paper by the Secretary of State for
Foreign Affairs (CP. 6 (35), Paragraph 8 (d)),neither he nor the Secretary of State for War,he thought, had yet agreed to it.The Secretary of State for War pointedout that we had for some time past admitted thatif supervision were the only impediment in theway of a general Disarmament Convention we would consider it, and inside the Cabinet it had &quot;been generally understood that in such circumstances we should accept.   .   A change of emphasis was involved in his present proposal.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs thought it was rather a change of tactics than of substance.The Cabinet approved the above proposal that the negotiators should use the question of supervision as a counter to French demands for afurther contribution on our part to Security,on the understanding that the concession shouldnot be made too readily or ?/ithout emphasisingour reluctance.The Cabinet approved the proposal in &apos;paragraph 8 (a) that, as we had-already indicated general approval to the .Rome Agreement,we could undertake to support the French inany way we could to bring about the adherenceof Germany to the proposed multi-lateralnon-interference pact in Central Europe agreedupon in Some,
As regards paragraph 8 (b) (M. Laval&apos;desire to secure the adherence of Germany and poland to the proposed Eastern Pact),the British negotiators should agreeto continue support to the French effort,  towhich we were already committed, hut should not allow themselves to/be persuaded that the success of this difficultnegotiation was an essential.Paragraph 8  (c)  (suggesting that we ought to be ready in principle to support french proposals that Germany should conclude non-aggression pacts with her neighbours, notwithstanding the doubtful utility of such pacts except inparticular cases) was approved.Paragraph 8  (d)  (Supervision)    --    seeabove and Conclusion (a) below.The Cabinet then passed to paragraph 8 (e)Proposed re-definition of our obligations under Locarno.The Prime Minister said that he felt hesitancy
rather than objection to this proposal.    Re wanted to he very care fill lest we should walk into a trap.The proposal did involve some change.   One of the safeguards of the Locarno Treaty was that   whileother nations might take a different view as towhether circumstances were such as to involve our intervention, no-one could say that we were committed to an automatic response to a view taken by other signatories as to violation of the Treaty.   this position might have weakened to some extent ourifinfluence with the French. But/we now entered into anagreement which public opinion held to have weakenedthe existing safeguards, strong public objectionsmight be raised.   He felt that the Cabinet ought toweigh this question very carefully.The Secretary of State for the Colonies recalledhis observation at the previous Meeting, that theproposal in (e)(i) would vary the Locarno obligationin respect of Belgium but not of Prance.   This would,put us logically in an impossible position vis-a-visFrance, as we should be saying that our obligationto France was less stringent than it. was to Belgium.If, as the Secretary of State for Air had suggested at the previous Meeting, Germany could be induced togive a guarantee to Belgium, a new situation wouldhe created in which we could differentiate in the case of Belgium.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,there were three&quot;key&quot; words or phrases in his proposal, namely, in line 3 &quot;flagrant% in line 6&quot;immediately&quot;, and in line 8 &quot;by all the means in her power&quot;.   The word, &quot;flagrant&quot; was not a new word,since it occurred in the Treaty of Locarno&apos;    but the judgment of what was a &quot;flagrant&quot; invasion depended on the judgment of the party concerned   for example,-4-
the case of flying across a corner of Belgian territory would not necessarily be deemed, a &quot;flagrantaggression:   The word &quot;immediately&quot; did involve a newcommitment, and we should also be committing ourselvesunder the phrase &quot;by all the means in her power&quot; .The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not like the presentation of the case in paragraph 8 (e)(i).    Ifwe gave any undertaking to Prance it would have to bemade public in some form or another.   He liked theidea of linking the matter up to British security.What the country disliked was a possible Quixoticinterference.   That was why he did not like linkingthe proposed, declaration with the Locarno Treaty.To alter the interpretation of Locarno would createpublic misgivings as to how far we were going.   We hadalready made a declaration to the effect that theindependence of Belgium was a vital British interest,and he would link up a declaration to that.The Lord President of the Council and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs inclined tothe same view.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs alsosupported the Chancellor of the Exchequers view from,the standpoint of public opinion in this country.There was a strong public opinion opposed to being .drawn in to assist France.   The Chancellor*s proposal would make clear that there was no new commitment,and would put us into a strong position with France.The First Lord of the Admiralty also supported the proposal, to which no objection was raised.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs raised the question as to whether the word &quot;immediate&quot;help should be employed.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatif we stated that the Integrity of Belgium was vital to us. Immediate action would follow logically.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs pointedout that the test would depend, upon whether the attack involved a violation of the integrity ofBelgium.The Secretary of State for War Insisted that wemust remain in a position to judge for ourselves asto whether Belgian territory was violated.   Be wouldlike to avoid the language of the Locarno Treaty, forthe reasons given by tine Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for the Colonies, and toget back to the speeches of the Lord President of theCouncil and the Secretary of State mr Foreign affairs as to our interest in Belgium.The Prime Minister pointed out that on this occasion the Cabinet were not discussing the policy to be adopted, so much as the means of sectoringagreement with France,   He wished to test the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s proposal by its value from that point of view,   He was reminded by Sir Maurice Hankeythat we ought to exercise care not to make a declara-tion which might involve the risk of our having to goto the rescue of Belgium without the support of France,which, for reasons known to the Cabinet, we could not undertake.    That point ought to be borne, in mind.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssummarised the point which the discussion had reached by saying that if the negotiators were faced with french proposals to &quot;put teeth into Locarno&quot; theywould have to make it clear that it was necessary tocarry British public opinion with the Government,and that from this point of view it was necessary to
speak of a &quot;vital British interest&quot; without mentioningLocarno, although as a matter of fact the handling of the question in this way would be a contributionto general security.   Re thought also that care oughtto be taken about the demilitarised zone, as the time was certain to come -when the Germans would not- be willing to put up with it.   The French would see that by a declaration as to the importance of Belgium in place of defining our attitude towards Locarno weshould be adopting a weaker attitude towards the demilitarised zone.The Prime Minister thought that the cabinet agreed --(1) Not to re-define our obligations under Locarno as such?    and(.2) That if the French reproached the negotiators with this they should say they had no instructions ande ould. not do it.He thought it would be wise for the Cabinet to warn the negotiators against making any statement as tothe demilitarised area.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thoughtthat the answer to Sir Maurice Hankey*s point wasthat if an invasion of Belgium took place, france would be involved under the Locarno Treaty.The- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed,and. recalled that no doubt what Sir Maurice Rankeyhad in mind was, first, that we were not powerfulenough to come to the rescue of Belgium single-handed?and, secondly, that we should actually require theuse of French ports    in order to come to the assist-ance of Belgium.   He thought that the decision asregards (e)fi) was to the effect that if the french ministers should raise any quest-ion of our definingwith greater precision our attitude towards the
Locarno Treaty, the Cabinet would wish the negotiatorsto deal with the question without any actual referenceto that Treaty,   ^he Cabinet would prefer them todeal with the Question from the point of view of ourown vital interests .    it could be pointed out thatthat would inure to the benefit of France.The Cabinet then discussed paragraph 8 (e)(ii)suggesting a reaffirms,tion that Great Britain stillconsiders the demilitarisation of the Rhineland as a vital British interest and will treat it as such inaccordance with the Treaty of Locarno.It was pointed, out that as the demilitarisationof the Rhineland was included in the Locarno treaty and that in certain circumstances we might be compelled to fight for it, we could not repudiatethe point if raised, by the French. Ministers .   Theview of the Cabinet, however, was that demilitarisatiorof the Rhineland was not a vital British interest,and that/if the French raised the question of the demilitarisation-tion of the Rhineland the British negotiatorsshould state that we were bound by the Locarno treaty and. had. no intention of repudiating it.The Cabinet then discussed, the proposal made bythe Secretary of State for Air at the previous meeting, that in connection with the forthcoming negotiations steps should be taken to give Germanyan opportunity to declare, in coneert with other signatories, that she would do nothing to violateBelgian integrity.    The Cabinet were reminded,underhowever, that/Article 1 of the Treaty of mutual guarantee (Annex &quot;A&quot; to the Final Protocol of the locarno Conference, 1925) the High ContractingParties, which include Germany, coilectively andseverally guarantee the maintenance of the
territorial status quo resulting from the frontiersbetween Germany and Belgium, etc., and the inviola-inviolability of the said frontiers.   Herr Hitler had accepted the Locarno Treaty.   There appeared some risk that if he were asked to make a specialdeclaration as to Belgium it might tend to weaken the remainder of the Locarno Treaty and of theTreaty of Versailles .The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to look into the point.Paragraph 8 (e)(iii)  (proposing a Britishdeclaration that any attempt to interfere with theindependence ot: integrity of Belgium was dangerous to her peace and security)&apos;.   This had already beenapproved in principle, but the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs was asked to drop the phrase&quot;the British Monroe doctrine&quot;,&quot;he foot-note to the above paragraph, raising the question of whether Holland should be mentioned,was then discussed.   It was pointed out that Holland,a country of very independent attitude, might resentor repudiate any declaration that the independence and integrity of Holland, was as important to the peacand security of Great Britain as Belgium.   there wasno disposition to question that the integrity of holland was of great importance to this countryand was probably of some importance to France owingto the risk of a German movement through the Limberg&quot;appendix&quot; on the right flank of the Belgian defencesThe Cabinet felt, however, that it was unnecessary to raise the question in the course of the conversa- ,tions with French Ministers,   It was decided, there-fore, to delete the note from the instructions toBritish Ministers,
Paragraph 8 (e)(iv)  (the proposed declaration to the effect- that violations of frontiers are considered: by Great Britain to apply equally toviolations by air as well as by land) was considered to be covered by the decisions as to the new para-graph 8 (e)(i), and was dropped.The Cabinet then disetissed paragraph 8 (f)(raising the question of what attitude was to betaken if, as was probable, French Ministers askedfor regular consultations between the General staffs of Great Britain, France and Belgium).One suggestion was that such conversations werepremature, since neither the Germans nor we ourselveswere yet sufficientIv armed to necessitate such dls-cuss ions .    It was also suggested that if the french ministers raised the question, the British ministers should reply that the object of the policy nowproposed was to bring the Germans back to Geneva,and that conversations between the General Staffs,which would, inevitably become public, would be incon-sistent with that policy.    It might further be addedthat the British Ministers had to consider publicopinion in this oountry and from that point of viewcould not enter into any such engagement.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that if Germany came back to Geneva andGerman re-armament was recognised, the French would say that this made security arrangements more important than ever and that conversations were an essential part of such arrangements .^he Prime Minister thought it would be a mistake to look too far ahead in this matter, and invited,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to considerthe question in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion..
DISARMAMENT. The attention of the Cabinet was called to afor Foreign Affairstelegram from the Secretary of State/, dated. January- 11th (Geneva No.3) recording a conversation between mr Eden and M. Massigli, who had expressed himselfsceptical about the possibility of negotiating aDisarmament Convention owing to the attitude of japan and other reasons, but had thrown out a personalsuggestion that perhaps the Committee on the Mania-fact tare of, and Trading in. Arms, might extend itslabours to the extent of drawing up the suggestedrequirements of a number of Powers for the next few-   .       years in certain arms, such as heavy artillery andaeroplanes, the manufacture of which could be checkedby supervis ion.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs warned the Cabinet against assuming that the possibility of getting Germany back to the League could be linked up with the likelihood of reaching a great disarmament convention with all nations.   He did not want it tobe assumed that the coming negotiations would be a failure if they did not lead to an early disarmament convention.   He thought, however, that the possibilityof more limited agreements with Germany and other states ought to be considered in conjunction with- the return of Germany to the League.   The telegram//from^Cleneva recording the conversation with M.Massi.gl.itended to show that French Ministers had not yet. had.time to devote themselves to all aspects of the comingconversations .   He expressed, himself very satisfied,with the results at this meeting.
he Cabinet agreed  That on the subject of general security and. the possible British contributionsthereto, the Br-ti sh repres entativesshould be authorised (subject to the flexibility in the conduct of negotia-tions referred to in Conclusion 1) toproceed, in so far as cireurostancesrendered this necessary and &quot;desirableon the following lines&quot;:-(a) That as a counter to Fretsch. demands for a. contribution on our part towardsgeneral security and in return forsome important advance on the part ofFrench Ministers, the British repre-s representative ives might- c ons ent to acceptinspection and supervision of arma-ments as part of any scheme of disarm-aroent that might result from the present negotiations.   This great concession,however, should not be made too readilyor without emphasising that it involves the surrender of a principle to whichwe attach the greatest importance:(b) That    since we had. already indicated,general approval to the Rome Agreement,we could undertake to support the french in any way we could to bring about the adherence of Germany to the proposedmulti-lateral non-interference pact in central Europe agreed upon at Rome:(c) That we could support the French effort,to which v/e were already-committed, to&apos;secure the adherence of Germany :and poland to the proposed Eastern Tact, buttbthe British negotiators should not allow themselves to be persuaded thatthis was an essential part, of thenegotia11.ons w 1.1h Germsny:(d) That an expression could be made of our readiness in principle to support aproposal, if advanced by French Ministers,that Germany should, be pressed to concludenon-aggression pacts with her neighboursin accordance with the offer made by herr Hitler last year:(e) That no attempt should be made for ere-definition of our obligations under,Locarno .    If the French Ministers shouldmake proposals to &quot;put teeth into Locarno&quot;the British negotiators should make itclear that it was necessary to carryBritish public opinion, and. that fromthis point&apos; of view it was necessary toavoid any actual reference   to that treaty.   They would, prefer to dealwith the question from the point ofview of our own vital Interests, andto link up any further declaration tothe public declaration we had already made as to the importance of Belgiumfrom the point of view of Britishsecurity.   This, however, would alsoinure to the benefit of France.-IS-
(f) That the negotiators should avoid at^ffimaJvlon, that Great Britain considers the demilitarisation of the Rhineland asa vital interest.    If French ministers should raise the question of the de militaires-tarisation of the Rhineland the Britishnegotiators should be authorised to statethat we were bound by the Locarno treaty and had no intention of repudiating it:(jar) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should examine, in the light ofthe discussion at the Cabinet, the questionwhether, having regard to existing commit-ments under the Locarno treaty, It. was desirable to obtain from Germany a declara-tion, in concert with other signatories,that she -would do nothing to violate Belgianintegrity:(h) That the British negotiators should, beauthorised, if they found it necessary and desirable, to make a declaration tothe effect that- Great Britain would,consider any attempt to interfere withthe independence or integrity of Belgiumas dangerous to her peace and security.(The phras e &quot;Br it ish Monroe D oc trine&quot;should be dropped, and. the question of including Holland should not be raised byBrit ish Minis t ers at the 0onveraations.)(i) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consider, in the light &quot;ofthe discussion at the Cabinet    thequestion raised in 0.B.-6 (35), paragraph (f), as to the attitude of the Britishnegotiators if the French representatives should raise the question of regularconsultations between the General staffs of Great Britain, France and Belglvm),
QUESTION 0CONSULT, AT IONWITH THE PAR-LIAMENTARYOPPOSITION.5. The Prime Minister said that certain leadingfigures in national life outside of politics had suggested the desirability of taking steps to securethat foreign policy should be non-oontroversial.This raised the.question of whether some cammunica-tion should be made to the Leaders of the opposition parties in Parliament at the present juncture.The view of the Cabinet was that the moment wasnot opportune for any such discussion.
THE FORTHCOMING 4. The First Commissioner of Works asked that heCONFERENCE WITHTHE FRENCH PRIME   should be informed at the earliest possible momentMINISTER ANDFOREIGN MINISTER, as to the date of arrival of French Ministers, inQuestion of order to make the necessary arrangements for hospital-Hospitality .ity.   He contemplated a Government Luncheon, at which members of the Cabinet would be asked to meet theFrench Ministers.The Prime Minister thought that as he was taking part in the Conversations it would be desirable for him to offer some entertainment.

APPENDIX.THE IMPENDING DISCUSSIONS WITH FRENCH MINISTERS.Paragraphs 2 to 7 of the Memorandum by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP. 6 (35)), as approved by the Cabinet on January 14, 1935(Cabinet 3 (35), Conclusion 1). - &apos;/\2. It will be agreed, in the first place, that this is not a case for hard andfast instructions, and that a good deal of flexibility must be allowed to Ministersconducting the discussion. We can only speculate as to the line&apos; which ourFrench visitors are likely to wish to follow, and, if new matters of greatimportance emerge, it will, of course, always be possible to discuss them on thebasis that final decisions must be reserved for the Cabinet as a whole.3. We shall naturally begin with some reference to my Paris, interviewof the 22nd December and to the Franco-Italian agreement reached at Rome.As regards the former, it will be useful to note that French Ministers have recognised that the position taken up in the French note of the 17th April can-no longer be maintained. We shall have to point out that, in the interval,Germany has not stood still, and that it is therefore to be expected that anyproposal for recognising the existing limit of armaments reached in germany will involve something more than was contained in the German document ofthe 16th April. &quot; .       ;4. As regards the recent Franco-Italian agreements reached at Rome:, thepart which is most immediately in point is the proces-verbal announced to-day to the following effect:  -   , -&quot; The Italian and French Governments, referring to the Declarationof Equality of Rights of the 11th December, 1932, have found themselves inagreement in their recognition that no country can modify by unilateralact its obligations in the matter of armaments, and that in the case of thiseventuality being established they should consult each other.&quot;We should inform the French Government that we had already taken up withthe German Government a similar attitude, though we had not previouslypublished the fact. After the House of Commons&apos; Debate of the 28th november and our communication to the German Government as to our information on german rearmament, we felt bound to make it clear to the German Governmentthat they must not assume that we considered the Disarmament Clauses of Part Vas no longer binding. We therefore told them that His Majesty&apos;s government do not recognise the right of any signatory to a Treaty to free itself from theobligations imposed upon it without negotiation and agreement with the other signatories.5. After these preliminaries, our main line with French Ministers must bethat it is worse than useless to allow the existing situation to drift. Germany is,in fact, increasing her armaments, and the facts must be faced and dealt within the only practicable way. It is impracticable to expect Germany to scrapwhat she is in process of building up in regard to armaments in order that afresh start might be made in a new agreement. We must deal with the Germansituation as it is to-day, bearing in mind that the return of Germany to theLeague and to the Disarmament Conference is essential for the establishment[11023]
and maintenance of peace in Europe. We should put forward the view that,while we do not in any way condone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League,we can conceive of no real basis for the establishment and maintenance of peace in Europe so long as Germany remains outside. We do not question the illegalityof Germany&apos;s rearmament in breach of the Treaty, but the stage has been reachedwhen its recognition has become inevitable. We should press strongly the point that it is far better that this rearmament should be controlled than that it should remain uncontrolled. To the objection which the French may raise that this concession amounts to condoning illegality and surrendering to what they maydescribe as blackmail, we should ask the French Ministers whether they have a practicable, alternative. We should point out that Germany has alreadydemanded, and will continue to demand, equality of rights. It may be that shewill not be content with the idea of the status quo as far as she is concerned. Butwe should seek a basis for negotiation which would recognise nothing beyond what has already been done. A further increase in Germany&apos;s arms strengthnecessarily raises new questions as to the security of others. If the French raisethe question of action under Article 213 of the Treaty of Versailles, we shouldpoint out that it would appear extremely unlikely that this article could been forced. On the other hand, if we can once get a new basis for negotiation anda prospect of agreement, Germany might be expected to take up a differentattitude to a system of inspection or to a system of supervision agreed to as partof a convention about armaments, provided that it is of general application to allcountries.(The contents of this paragraph are in effect a summary taken from paragraph 3 of CP. 302 (34) to which the Cabinet has already givenapproval at its meeting to-day.)6. French Ministers may certainly be expected, in reply to the above, toraise the question of &apos;&apos; security &apos;&apos; and to insist that the agreement of France toequality of rights was conditioned, by the terms of the document of the11th December, 1932, by the phrase &quot;in a regime providing security for all nations.&quot; We must therefore expect to be asked what proposals we have tomake to satisfy this condition. Again, we must expect to have placed before us by French Ministers proposals of their own on this subject.7. On the topic of security we should first emphasise that the accommo-dation which we are seeking to bring about with Germany is not designed speciallyfor our benefit and not advocated from any willingness to prejudice the Frenchposition. Our conviction is that such an accommodation is needed in the general interests of Europe and is just as much essential to the position of France as to anyone else. We are not asking France to make sacrifices in our interest forwhich some special compensation is required, any more than our recent contri-bution of troops to police the Saar was specially in the interests of France andcalled for a quid pro quo. In both cases it is the general pacification of europe which is in question, and in that matter we are all equally interested. the longer we all hesitate to take the bold action which is now so urgently called for,the worse the situation will get for all of us and the less chance there will be of getting a contribution towards agreement from Germany. Moreover, we have announced a programme of rearmament, especially in the air, and are thereforealready burdening ourselves with what amounts to a more material contribution from which the Locarno Powers gain advantage.
