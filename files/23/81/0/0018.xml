HELD  AT   the chancellors PALACE, BERLIN, ON MARCH 25 AND 26, 1935.Present:United Kingdom. *Sir John Simon, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Mr. Eden, Lord Privy Seal.Sir Eric Phipps, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador, Berlin.Mr. Strang, Foreign Office.Mr. Wigram, Foreign Office.Germany.Herr Hitler, Chancellor and &quot; Fuhrer.&quot;Baron von Neurath, Minister for Foreign Affairs.Herr   von   Ribbentrop,   Special   Commissioner   for   DisarmamentQuestions.Herr von Kotze, Baron von Neurath&apos;s Private Secretary.Herr Schmitt, Interpreter.FIRST MEETING.March 25, 1935, at 10-30 a.m.PRELIMINARY.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he and Mr. Eden were very glad to be in-Berlin and that he himself much welcomed making Herr Hitler&apos;s acquaintance.He would first ask to make a short general statement before entering uponthe discussion of the list of topics which Baron Neurath and he had agreed upon.The British Ministers gladly accepted the proposal for bi-lateral discussionmade in the note from the German Government of the 14th February, and werehappy to carry consultation a stage further on all the matters indicated m theLondon Declaration of the 3rd February. As he wished to speak frankly, hewould say that there had been difficulties in undertaking the present visit as a7874   [11375] B
result of the new developments in the course of the preceding 10 days. He didnot desire to discuss these events, against which we had protested, but he andMr. Eden had come in spite of them. It was an important decision to take, butthey had thought it worth taking for the sake of coming into personal contact with the Head of the German Government. They were glad to note that thescope and purpose of the conversations would be as previously agreed.Sir John Simon said that he wished to present to the Chancellor on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government the view which His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe British people took of the present situation, and to describe the anxietythat occupied their minds. The object of British policy was to preserve generalpeace by helping to secure co-operation amongst all European countries. HisMajesty&apos;s Government most earnestly wished that Germany should work withall countries for that object. They felt that the future of Europe would takeone of two forms. It would either take the form of general co-operation forsecuring continued peace and this was the form which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment earnestly desired. Or it would take the form of a division into two camps-isolation on the one side, and combination (which might look like encirclement)on the other. The message which he had to deliver on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was that they were convinced that the future would develop in oneof these two ways. They wished to do all in their power in co-operation withGermany in order to secure that it would be the first and not the seconddevelopment which would occur. He would conclude this preliminary general statement by giving his own account of the state of British opinion.British opinion looked upon the situation as follows.   People in england had been very greatly disturbed hy a series of acts on the part of Germany liedid not wish to discuss the question whether these acts were justified or not, but merely to report the fact.   The withdrawal of Germany from Geneva, eventsrelating to Austria, and the recent unilateral announcement connected with the rearmament now going on at a great pace in Germany, these all made it difficult for the British Ministers to fulfil their engagement to come to Berlin.  The resultof these events was that public opinion in England was doubtful, and was tryinganxiously to estimate what was the real course of German policy.   Sir john simon thought it right to say this frankly because Great Britain was a country where the general opinion of the people was of great importance, and where thespirit and character of the people made it important for the future of Europethat their opinion should be taken into account.   The British people was notanti-German; but it was very strongly opposed to any policy or to any country which was likely to disturb the peace.   Germany ought to recognise that it wasBritish influence which had operated to improve the situation in the past: hewould instance reparations, the evacuation of the Rhineland, the declarationregarding equality of rights, and the arrangements for the Saar.   This was evidence that the British people had tried to be fair and just.   But the presentsituation was one in which the British people were in doubt.   They were quite prepared to pay proper attention to authoritative statements that German policy was directed towards peace.   They would take Herr Hitler&apos;s word for it.  Whatthey were anxious to discover was whether there was any line of action which germany would find it possible to take, in co-operation with other Governments,in order to persuade friendly peoples and Governments that they would bejustified in abandoning their attitude of doubt and in throwing their energiesinto the work of co-operation with other European countries, including Germany.Sir John Simon emphasised that he had not come to Berlin to produce anycut and dried plan. He well understood the objection to presenting suchplans. They were at the stage of free and frank consultation, and the chancellor would understand why he had thought it well to speak firmly. The british ministers believed that the Chancellor and the German Government attached importance to British opinion, and they gladly seized the present opportunity toimprove the relations between the two countries and to secure peace.HERR HITLER said he wished Sir John Simon and Mr. Eden to be assured that the German Government and people were happy to receive them.He saw in the present visit the first great possibility of reaching understandingthrough direct conversations, which could not be replaced by exchanges of notesor by communications through third parties. At the time of Mr. Eden&apos;s visita year before, it had been possible to clarify a number of questions.   The present
visit would give a true picture of what the German people and the GermanGovernment wanted and could do, and of what they did not want and could not do and would never do. On a historic occasion like the present, it was uselessnot to speak with absolute frankness.SIR JOHN SIMON agreed.HERR HITLER continued by saying that he met the representatives ofGreat Britain as a man who had had no part in past events such as the outbreak,the conduct and the conclusion of the War. He would therefore approach current problems with impartiality and objectivity, and in a more unbiassed manner thanprobably any other European statesman could do.He emphasised in the first place that the first and only great aim of his policy was to revive and make happy a people stricken by immeasurable disaster. Thiswas his life&apos;s work. He could solve it if he succeeded in combining the revival of the German people with the preservation of peace and the avoidance of a repetition of the disaster. The revival had ttuee aspects, economic, political and moral.This policy was in accordance with the mandate received from the Germannation, and he must have the confidence of the people, for only so could he speak with authority to foreign representatives. It was a mistake to think that therewas in Germany a dictatorship which violated the will of the people. The GermanGovernment were mandatories. Like the British Government, they depended upon the will and action of the German people. It was therefore clearlyimpossible for him to pursue any policy which the German people did not support.His political acts during the last two years had been willed and approved by theGerman people, just as all his future acts would likewise be willed by the Germanpeople.Turning to Sir John Simon&apos;s observation about the two alternative courses of developments in Europe, Herr Hitler referred to the three aspects of his task.The development which the German Government and people ardently desired wasalong the line of solidarity and co-operation. He felt bound to point out thatthe experience of the past 15 years had been a bitter one. Such co-operation as the German people desired was only realisable with the disappearance of apsychosis Avhich had been inherited from the War and was a burden upon every kind of co-operation. Such co-operation had, he might almost say, beencontractually made impossible because of the absence of true equality betweenthe parties. Any attempt to organise co-operation in conditions of inequalitycould not succeed and would destroy any results achieved in the past.True solidarity required that the objects of policy should not be a menace to other States, or an attempt to annul their existence. The object of german policy, in its new political conception, was not a menace to anyone. It was apity that people abroad had not sufficiently studied the spiritual foundation ofthis new conception. What was often made a reproach was, in fact, a guarantee against menace from attack. National Socialism had no expansive character.National Socialism was born from the distress of the German nation and was intended to apply to the German nation alone. It was not designed for exportbeyond the limits of the German people. There were, indeed, a number of otherconceptions abroad which were designed to conquer the minds of other peoples.This was one of the most serious threats to solidarity and co-operation in Europe.This threat was not a matter of theory only he had himself been fighting for15 years to defend the German people against such foreign ideas. This threatwas still actively in existence and all European nations were menaced by theclanger of infection. This, the chief danger to European co-operation, didnot come from Germany. In accordance with their own new doctrine, theGerman people had no interest in pursuing an imperialist policy. germany was surrounded by national States which were either as densely populated as germany herself, or inhabited by intensely nationalistic peoples. To say thatGermany intended to tear away territory from others was to disregard thedifficulties of the economic situation from which Germany was at present suffering.His problem was to find an economic basis for the life of 60 million people.Annexation of territory would merely add to the political and economic difficulties with which he was faced. The annexation of other countries where the economic difficulties were greater than in Germany would not solve Germany &apos;s economic[11375]   &quot; b 2
problem.   The German Government had not taken a single step which couldbe interpreted as a territorial menace to other countries.As regards the uneasiness in England to which Sir John Simon had referred,Herr Hitler said that the measures in question had been required for the achieve-ment of the Chancellor&apos;s third task, namely, moral rehabilitation and reconstruction of the German people. Economic measures had a purely internalcharacter, except in so far as they were connected with international trade. Thenagain, political reconstruction, the creation of a new constitution for Germany jin keeping with the tradition and character of the people, need be of no interestto the outside world. Incidentally, foreign peoples ought not to accept storiesabout Germany spread by self-styled political martyrs of whom the GermanGovernment were only too glad to be rid. The measures taken for moralrehabilitation, however, were not to be understood merely by references tocontractual engagements, but by putting oneself in Germany&apos;s place. If england had been as unlucky as Germany since 1914, every Englishman would have actedexactly as the Chancellor had done. If importance was attached to co-operationwith the German nation, and if there was an invitation to Germany to participate in more international agreements, these agreements could only have a sense andmeaning if the Government which concluded them had a mandate from theGerman nation. It was because the German Government had a mandate for the moral rehabilitation of Germany that they could speak in Germany&apos;s name.That was the Chancellors strength. The German people were convinced thathe would do his utmost to bring about the moral rehabilitation of Germany. Ifthere were any doubt upon this point in Germany, that would be his destruction.This German Government and every German Government could make concessionsor sacrifices for the sake of European co-operation, but there was one field inwhich they could make no concession, namely, where the rehabilitation of theirhonour was concerned.The Chancellor then turned to the acts which were regarded as disturbingby British public opinion. The decision to withdraw from the League had beenapproved by 94 per cent, of the German nation. He was convinced that in similar circumstances Great Britain would have done the same, and, in fact,would never have joined the League at all. The League of Nations was acceptable to Germany and would become so as soon as she could participate withabsolutely equal rights. Germany did not wish to disturb European solidaritybut to collaborate with equal rights.Turning to Austria, the Chancellor said that Germany did not threaten, andhad never threatened, Austria. He could not, however, forget that the regime un austria was in contradiction with the overwhelming majority of the people over which it maintained power; from this many difficulties resulted. Germany couldnot co-operate with a Government which, both at home and abroad, insulted theGerman Government and the German ideal.The same was true of Lithuania. Germany did not wish for a conflict withLithuania. But it was not to be expected that Germany could look on withequanimity while a small State oppressed 100,000 Germans whose sole misfortunewas that they had been born Germans. As soon as the situation was clarified by international agreement, no one would be happier than Germany. She had no desire to interfere by violence or force.As regards armaments, Germany had been accused of violating the Treaty.If he had been Chancellor in 1919, &quot;he would never have signed the Treaty ofVersailles. He would rather have died. A weak Government and a disheartenedpeople had been forced to accept it under pressure. Germany would respect theterritorial clauses of the Treaty, however terrible they might be for Germany.But as regards moral defamation, that they would never accept. Those parts ofthe Treaty which defamed Germany were themselves immoral. He had neverconcealed his view on this point, and had always promised that he would liberatethe German people from these clauses. He recalled that on an earlier occasionGermany had had to violate a treaty. In 1806, Napoleon had imposed a treaty on Germany. But on the evening of Waterloo, Wellington did not protest whenthe Prussian army arrived, although that army could only arrive in violation of atreaty.The Chancellor emphasised that Germany had no interest in sabotagingco-operation between other nations.   He saw it stated in the press that Germany   /intended to separate Great Britain from France, and that this was why the British
Ministers had been invited to come to Berlin. He would recall that he had invitedFrance five times to take part in separate talks. He had made a solemndeclaration after the Saar plebiscite that there were no further territorialdifferences dividing the two countries. France had not done anything of this kindafter 1870. Nevertheless, France had merely noted, and had sent no reply. On thecontrary, French Ministers preferred to go to Moscow. He had invited Sir john simon and Mr. Eden in order to establish direct contact; he had no desire to disturb European co-operation. He was glad that the British Ministers had come and that they had come as &quot; loyal and honest brokers,&quot; as an English newspaperhad put it. He asked them to understand what were the feelings of a country which, in a situation of isolation, had suffered unprecedented humiliation fortwenty years. He was prepared to make concessions, except where honour was concerned. If he made concessions on this latter point, he would no longer beChancellor, and he was not sure whether this would be a help to Europeanpacification.SIR JOHN SIMON thanked the Chancellor for his full and clear exposition.He was convinced from the experience of that morning that the Chancellor was right when he said that direct contacts were capable of doing more than exchanges of despatches. There was only one point on which the Chancellor appeared to be under some misapprehension. He had spoken more than once as if the british people were unable to understand the motives which had led to the determinedefforts on the part of Germany to rehabilitate herself in the moral sphere and inother spheres. He would say most definitely that if the Chancellor thought this,he was quite wrong. The British people understood quite well, and it was becausethey did understand, that they were anxious to see whether they could find some basis of co-operation with Germany on a footing of real equality. It was notpast events which determined the situation, but the decision which might bereached at present in collaboration with Germany and other States for the imme-diate future. The British people harboured no resentment. They were apractical people with generous instincts, and that was why they wished to use thepresent opportunity to the full. He was grateful to the Chancellor for his reference to the absurd idea that the invitation was an attempt to separateFrance from Great Britain. This would be exactly contrary to the British con-ception of European co-operation. Faithful to this conception, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment thought it essential to devote themselves to the tasks of the immediatefuture, in collaboration with France and other nations.Sir John Simon asked whether they might now turn to the separate questions for discussion.HERR HITLER agreed.EASTERN PACT.SIR JOHN SIMON said that in these circumstances he would explain theBritish Government^ position with regard to the Eastern Pact.When the Eastern Pact was first proposed last summer, the British Govern-ment made it clear that they had several criticisms to make. Their interest inthe proposed pact was due to the fact that they did not see how European peace and solidarity were to be assured unless in the East of Europe there was some additional contribution to security by means of the co-operation of the powers in that region.In Western Europe there was Locarno, and the British Government wereglad to know that the obligations and rights of Locarno were recognised andaffirmed in their fullest sense by the Chancellor and by the German Government.In Western Europe then there was that element of solidarity.As regards an Eastern arrangement, it seemed to Sir John Simon that therewere three elements to be considered : (1) A Covenant of non-aggression between the Powers participating in theEastern Pact;(2) Provision for consultation between those Powers if any one of themthought that the Covenant of non-aggression was in danger of beingdisregarded;(3) Provisions for mutual assistance.
The position of the British Government was as follows: They believed thatthey were contributing to the solidarity of Europe in making their criticisms of the original proposals; and its outline was to some extent modified to meet their criticisms. They had formed and expressed the view that they would liketo see such a pact concluded; and the British Ministers present in Berlin that day would be glad to learn from the Chancellor how Germany regarded the suggested pact under the three heads of (1) Non-aggression;(2) Consultation;(3) Mutual assistance.HERR HITLER said that he had already declared that, according to allthe possibilities of human anticipation, the German Government had nothing to expect from warlike developments. He himself and the German military experts considered that a new European war must have terrible repercussions.From the military point of view it was now necessary to take account of airforces; and from that point of view Germany was more threatened than certain countries on the Eastern confines of Europe. Those countries with large open spaces were not as vulnerable as Germany with her densely populated industrial areas. G ermany was 95 per cent, more vulnerable than those countries. There -fore Germany was the country most interested in the preservation of peace.The object of the Eastern Pact was to secure peace or, in other words, toprevent war.Here the question arose as to the possible parties to any war in eastern europe.   Such a war, for example, might be between Germany and Poland;Russia and Germany;Russia and the Baltic States;Poland and the Baltic States;Germany and the Baltic States;Poland and Czechoslovakia;Germany and Czechoslovakia.As regards the practical probability of war between any of these groups ofPowers, Herr Hitler wished to observe that Germany and Russia had no common frontier and therefore there would be no war; there would be no war between germany and Poland because of the non-aggression, pact between the two Powers;again, Russia and Poland had a non-aggression pact which was still good foreight or nine years; war between the Baltic States and Russia could, Herr Hitlerthought, be excluded because there were to a large degree non-aggression pacts;war between Germany and Czechoslovakia could be excluded because there was an arbitration agreement.Therefore the real possibilities of conflict in those regions of Europe were limited.But there was another question as to which Powers might declare war on other Powers in those regions. It was impossible to suppose that the Baltic states would declare war on Russia, or that Poland would declare war on Russia.Further, Herr Hitler could give the British Ministers the assurance thatGermany would never declare war on Russia.He had not the same conviction as regards Russia. He thought that therewas an aggressive tendency in Russia to-day. The Bolshevist theory and the aims of the Soviet Government were identical. He had many press extracts whichconfirmed this impression. He did not believe that the old mentality of thebolshevism of fifteen years ago had changed. Further, the Russian population hada certain hostile tendency against Poland. Therefore political tendencies andthe national objective seemed in the case of Russia to complete one another.It might seem that the Russian anxiety for the Eastern Pact contradictedthis assumption. But Herr Hitler thought that Russia&apos;s desire in this matter was to have a freer hand in the Far East; and he thought that after the situationin the Far East had been liquidated Russia would show less anxiety to have an Eastern Pact.
They were discussing very frankly that day and therefore he was giving afrank opinion. It was not a question of whether or not he was right; but he wanted the British Ministers to know what his ideas were.Herr Hitler repeated that because of the combination of Bolshevist doctrineswith the political aims of Russia and because of the strength of the russian military and economic organisation, it seemed to him that from Russia there was greater probability of war than from other countries.Moreover, the risks for Russia in a possible war were smaller than those for other Powers. Russia could with impunity allow the occupation of greattracts of her territory as large as Germany; she could permit bombardment ofgreat regions; she could therefore wage war without risking destruction.The German Government were convinced that security in Eastern europe would be increased by the conclusion of non-aggression pacts; and they had taken the initiative vis-a-vis Poland; they would extend these non-aggression pactsto other Powers with the exception of Lithuania.But Herr Hitler wished to be clear why he refused a non-aggression pactto Lithuania. Elis refusal did not mean that he wanted war with Lithuania;but that he could not conclude a non-aggression pact with a Power who treatedher German minority as Lithuania did. If the guarantor Powers would bringLithuania back to a legal basis, then the obstacle from the German side to theconclusion of a non-aggression pact with Lithuania would have disappeared.Herr Hitler desired to assure the British Ministers that he did not wantwar with Lithuania; and that he would not risk war with her on behalf of the comparatively few Germans in Memel. But he would not give Lithuania anon-aggression pact unless she respected her obligations. If Great Britain andthe other Powers wanted a non-aggression pact for Lithuania, then they must make her observe her obligations.Mr. EDEN said that the Chancellor had spoken of the menace of Bolshevism.It seemed to the British Ministers that the menace of communism was an internalrather than an international problem. No doubt the Communist leaders wouldlike other countries to adopt their creed; but it was improbable that they would go to war for that.The country which had most to do at home was Russia, who had greatterritories to develop. Further, he would not have thought that a nation couldwin a war by the air weapon alone; and he would not have thought that russia was a military menace for many years. But if there was such a danger, was it not exactly such an arrangement as that which they had in mind for strengthening the solidarity of Europe which could best meet it?The British Ministers fully accepted the Chancellors assurance respectingGermany&apos;s attitude to Russia. He was sure that the Chancellor would not mindhis mentioning the fact that one element in the fear of Russia for Germany was what was known as &quot;Herr Rosenberg&apos;s plan.&quot; That plan was one of the elements in Russia&apos;s fear of Germany. (At this point the Chancellor and Baron vonNeurath smiled.)The interest of Britain in this matter was to secure a European Easternsettlement as useful as Locarno had proved to be. The British Ministers &quot;didnot know enough to enter into the details of such an arrangement; but they were confident that there could be no general settlement without it.Mr. Eden wished to ask the Chancellor one further question. Would he be willing to include his bilateral pacts in a multilateral settlement ?HERR HITLER said that, when he had referred to the Russian menace, hehad not meant to suggest that European co-operation and solidarity wereunnecessary. He was firmly convinced that one day that co-operation andsolidarity would be urgently necessary to defend Europe against the Asiatic andBolshevik menace. He thought that Russia saw in Germany the champion ofEurope against that menace, as Germany saw in Poland the bulwark against that menace.   &apos;If he was wrong, Europe would be all the happier; but if he was right, it wasnecessary to take account of the possibility.He agreed with Mr. Eden that the air arm could not decide a war, certainly not a war against Russia; though an air attack might be much more serious for germany, England or France.
As to the value of Russian land armaments, he thought they had a great value and that they were very important. Fifteen years ago Russia had had noarmy. Ten years ago she had begun to reconstruct; and five years ago she had aconsiderable army. To-day she had a very strong army; in five years she would bestill stronger; and in ten years she might have 20,000 to 30,000 military aeroplanesand 20,000 tanks and 16 to 18 million men under arms.vi;&apos;i:Her;:;war industry was very favourably situated. It was safe from bombing-attack and invasion; and this conviction was shared by the German military experts. Whatever might be said about German military officers, at least they knew their business. In ten years&apos; time, then, Russia would be a very formidablePower.Mr. Eden had asked him if he would include his bilateral pacts in a multi-lateral system. The German Government had no objection except as regardsLithuania, with whom a pact would only be possible when she respected her legal obligations.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired as regards Lithuania and Memel whether herightly understood that, when Herr Hitler said he would be prepared to includehis bilateral pacts in a multilateral arrangement, but made an exception in the caseof Lithuania, that was not an exception of principle but because of the difficulties about Memel.Was the Chancellor willing, in principle, to include Lithuania in a bilateralpact ? If that was so, it would be most useful to the British Government toknow it because of any efforts which they might make to secure that Lithuaniareturned to the proper regard of her obligations.HERR HITLER replied in the affirmative.He turned to the point of consultation; and said that the German Govern-ment were ready to accept consultation as part of an Eastern Pact if difficultiesarose.As regards the third point, that of mutual assistance, that was the centre of the difficulty. The practical realisation of mutual assistance depended uponwhich Power was considered to be the aggressor.It would take about 20 years to define the aggressor. In the last war people in England were firmly convinced that Germany was the aggressor; and inGermany people were equally convinced that France and Russia were the aggressors.There would never be agreement on points of that kind. Many honourableGermans would swear that in their deepest conviction Germany had no respon-sibility for the outbreak of war; and as many honourable Englishmen andFrenchmen would swear in the opposite sense. Therefore it was impossible toagree on that point. Where could they find the wisdom of a Solomon who could reach in a moment a decision on the question of the definition of the aggressor.The German object was to avoid war. Herr Hitler feared that the only result of mutual assistance would be better to organise war.Herr Hitler considered that mutual assistance was nothing else but whatthere had been in the pre-war treaties. What were the Entente Cordiale andthe Triple Alliance but defensive agreements to defend the parties against an aggressor; but they had launched the world into a terrible war. mutual assistance would merely serve to organise war. It gave the appearance ofrespectability to those who wanted allies.SIR JOHN SIMON said that there was a difference between the philosophyof mutual assistance and the old pre-war system exemplified by the Entente orthe Triple Alliance.Herr Hitler might be right in his criticisms of the new system; but it was certainly not the old pre-war system. The difference was that under the old system three Powers agreed to operate together against external attack. the essence of the new system was not a combination of numbers to stand against external danger; but the agreement of the Powers concerned to restrain thewrongful act of one of their number.That was the essence of Locarno and that was why the British government thought Locarno useful. Herr Hitler might be right if he objected to bothsystems; but the two systems were not the same.
HERR HITLER accepted this criticism, but said that it must not be-forgotten that the conclusion of pacts of mutual assistance did not remove thedivergence of interest between the parties. Under cover of these pacts the-differences might go on.During the last fifteen years a certain practice had established itself, underwhich, when two countries quarrelled and there was a great difference in their strength, it was the general custom to take the side of the stronger and to help the stronger, and to make the weaker give way. That was done to preserve peace and avoid war. But that practice (which was followed even by the League ofNations) resulted from the fact that the stronger Power had the opportunity of attacking the weaker, but that all the same it got the help of the other Powers.The question of the definition of the aggressor was one of the utmost importance. It was indispensable that it should be possible to define the aggressor beyond all doubt; for under the proposed mutual assistance he himselfmight have to lead the German people to war if other Powers were quarrelling.Under the proposed system he would have to undertake to lead millions of germans to war; and he would not know which of the Powers was right andwhich was wrong. In the East there would be a great difference between theproposed system and Locarno, which was limited to a few countries whose main difficulties were known.   Those countries lived together with common frontiers.It would be very difficult in the East, where there were many countries withcomplicated situations. They were faced in the East with an agglomeration of countries with problems which were difficult to understand; and there was, more-over, a constant change of the governing personnel. There were, in fact, possi-bilities of conflicts the causes of which it would be hard to fathom.Moreover, the participants in Locarno had a greater sense of their responsibilities and realised more clearly what was at stake.It would be very difficult for him to lead the German people to bloodshedand war when he was not clear about the problems at stake or what germany would be fighting for.He could do this all the less because he had solemnly given up Alsace-Lorraine; it must be remembered that Alsace-Lorraine had originally beenGerman, and that it had been retaken by Germany after a terrible war and thenlost by Germany after another even more terrible war.Now he had given up his claim to Alsace-Lorraine for the sake of peace;but, having done that, how could he bring the German people into a new warand impose upon them all the sacrifices which would be involved when thequestions at issue would be quite foreign to Germany?He did not know if an. English statesman would lead his country ro war for problems which had nothing to do with England.If a German statesman signed an Eastern Pact including a mutual assistance system, he would be exceeding the mandate given him by the Germannation. Then, if serious circumstances arose, such a treaty would be valueless.For if he signed anything he wanted to be sure he could keep to it and stick to it.He could not undertake to lead Germany to war for problems of the kind whichwould be involved under a mutual assistance system in the East.What else was involved in this mutual assistance system ? It was thoughtthat, in certain circumstances, Germany would receive help from Russiaagainst France, or help from France against Russia. But he must make it clearthat nobody in Germany wanted to be protected by Russia. They were moreafraid of Russian protection than of a French attack.If they were to receive an assurance of assistance from Britain, that wouldbe welcome, and British troops on German soil would be very welcome, butcertainly not Bolshevist troops. He said that as one who had seen Bolshevismin Germany.If he called in the Bolshevists to protect Germany, that would be likeopening a box of pestilence germs at the front. The object would be to kill theenemy, but the germs would destroy one&apos;s own troops as well.Therefore Germany did not want Russia&apos;s protection.Further, he could not tell a National Socialist to fight for Bolshevism. Thatwould be like inviting the Pope or the Catholic Church to send their monks tohelp Buddhism or Mohammedanism.Some things were impossible, and to invite National Socialists to fight forBolshevists was impossible! ,[11375] c
He could not sign such an agreement. National Socialists could notfight for the Bolshevists; and he thought the British Government wouldunderstand that.But he might be prepared to take negative measures and to say that no partyto the proposed pact should give assistance to an aggressor.(The meeting then adjourned.)9
SECOND MEETING.March 25, 1935, at 4 p.m.EASTERN PACT (continued).SIR JOHN SIMON said that he would raise one question about the EasternPact which he had not put during the morning meeting. He quite understoodHerr Hitler&apos;s contemplated multilateral pact of non-aggression and consultation,and Herr Hitler had explained why Germany could not favour being a party to a.pact of mutual assistance in the East. But supposing it were possible to frame a multilateral pact of non-aggression and consultation, might it not be that someof the other parties to the multilateral pact might wish to enter into agreements of mutual assistance as between themselves, Germany not herself offering toassist? This was a possible development. While His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere not, of course, directly concerned, the British Ministers thought that itwould be useful to obtain some information. What would the German view be ifsuch a situation presented itself ?HERR HITLER thought that the idea was dangerous and objectionable. Ifwithin the Eastern Pact a group were to conclude a separate agreement of mutual assistance, this would be an exact copy of the pre-war system. It would not be ageneral system, but special group interests within the wider system. There wouldbe two groups within the general arrangement, namely, those who were partiesonly to obligations of non-aggression and consultation, and those who were partiesto obligations of mutual assistance. It was unlikely that if a conflict were to arise between a member of the first group and a member of the second group, an impartial decision could be reached. The decision would probably be inaccordance with the weight behind the two several groups. The parties to theobligations of mutual assistance could not be expected to take an impartialdecision, but would be bound by their special obligations. This would be an exactreproduction of the military alliances before the war. Although they were calleddefensive, they involved an extension of the conflagration, with the result thatthere was a world-wide conflict out of all proportion to the point of departure.It was necessary to localise conflicts and prevent them from spreading, and togive members of consultative pacts time during which to consult.There was a further possible consequence. There might be within a singlelarger framework, two separate groups bound by obligations of mutual assistance. There might, for example, be a group comprising France, Russia and czechoslovakia, and another group comprising Germany, Poland and other States.This would split the general Eastern Pact into a number of groups, contrary tothe spirit of the Covenant, and these groups would draw their moral sanctiononly from the fact of their inclusion within the framework of the Eastern Pact.The German Government thought the best course would be to conclude ageneral pact containing obligations of non-aggression and consultation, and anundertaking not to afford assistance to an aggressor. This would be sufficient ifthe parties had confidence in the signatures to the pact.Herr Hitler thought it necessary to say that there were no military agree-ments, open or secret, between Germany and Poland. Neither the GermanGovernment nor, he believed, the Polish Government, had any desire for such agreements.SIR JOHN SIMON said he understood from Baron von Neurath that it was intended to communicate to His Majesty&apos;s Government more detailed proposalsof the German Government in reference to an Eastern Pact. He understoodthat Baron von Neurath would state the German proposal in greater detail later in order to save the Chancellor&apos;s time.He had also been informed that the French Government had asked theGerman Government for their views on the proposed Eastern Pact, but that theGerman Government had not yet replied. He of course disclaimed any desireto play any more active part in this than was fitting, but he took the liberty to hope that the German Government would reply to the French Government at anearly date.[11375] c 2
BARON von NEURATH recalled that the French Government had sent arejoinder to the first German reply to the proposal for an Eastern Pact. ThisFrench communication contained nothing to justify any change in the german attitude. The German Government were ready to reply to the French Govern-ment if the latter so wished. The reply wouldbe on the lines just stated by theChancellor.&apos; In no circumstances would the German Government acceptprovisions of mutual assistance, but they were quite willing to accept the other aspects of the proposal. There was another point which had not been mentioned by the Chancellor, namely, that the German Government was also ready toaccept arbitration as already in force between Germany and other countries as regards the question put by Sir John Simon at the opening of the meeting,he remarked that Germany would, of course, be in the group which did not affordmutual assistance. The proposal would be tantamount to legalising alliances.Agreements of mutual assistance were, in fact, military alliances. If Germanyentered the pact in such circumstances, she would be merely giving her sanction to a Franco-Russian alliance. The situation would, in fact, be the same as ifthere were no pact at all and the same two countries had concluded an alliance.SIR JOHN SIMON made it clear that he was not recommending any courseof action about the French note, but merely asking for information. It was not,of course, for him to say, but he would have thought that the despatch of aGerman reply to the French Government would clarify the situation, whateverthat reply might be.HERR HITLER interposed to say that a conversation like the presentclarified the situation more than fifty diplomatic notes.SIR JOHN SIMON observed that there was, however, no french representative present.AUSTRIA.SIR JOHN SIMON then suggested that the subject of Austria might bedealt with and he would ask Mr. Eden to begin.Me. EDEN said that the German Government were apparently not satisfied with the latest reply received from the French Government. He believed thatthe German Government favoured the Central European Pact in principle, butthat they found difficulties in practice. The only feeling of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the matter was that it would be a good thing if these practicaldifficulties could be surmounted, and the sooner the better.HERR HITLER said he wished to offer some observations on the generalaspects of the Austrian problem. The inhabitants of the two countries had thesame national origin, and until 1866 both countries formed a single political unit,although they were under different sovereignties. He had no doubt that if a free vote were possible, the population of Austria would vote for closer relations,:if not complete union, with Germany. Germany and Austria had always had certain ideas in common, in literature, poetry, music, arts and sciences, in legalconceptions and historical traditions. They also had common political ideas.Socialism had prevailed in both Germany and Austria, as also had liberalism&apos;,and communism and now National-Socialism. A further element was that of very close personal relationships. Hundreds of thousands of Austrians hadrelatives in Germany and vice versa. There was a very strong German colony un austria and over 275,000 Austrians were living in Germany, with relations un austria. The Chancellor himself was Austrian born, and most of his relationslived in Austria. This was a decisive element for the comprehension of therelations existing between the two countries; The difficulties arising put of the separation of two members of one and the same unit were increased by economic difficulties. A very great many Austrians were convinced that economicallyAustria could not live alone. He would assert, however, that no one in germany had any thought of annexing Austria, or of depriving her of her right ofself-determination, or of imposing upon Austria any union with Germany. Thepresent difficulties between the two countries had arisen from the fact thatin Germany National-Socialism had conquered the nation, while in Austria a
similar organisation had been successful, but had then been met by a counter -organisation financed by Italian Fascism. This was an internal Austrianconflict. The present regime had declared itself a sovereign and permanentinstrument of government and had suppressed all organs of expression of thepeople&apos;s will. This had driven more than 40,000 Austrians to emigrate toGermany. Another 100,000 addressed themselves to relations in Germany. TheAustrian emigrants in germany were more numerous than the German emigrantsin England, France or the Netherlands. The important fact was that a largenumber of Austrian emigrants in Germany had relations in Austria. This waswhere the problem of interference arose. He would point out that a large amountof literature was published in Paris, Warsaw, Prague and London severelyattacking the German Government, advocating its overthrow, and inciting todisobedience, although 96 per cent, of the German people were in favour of theNational-Socialist regime. Attacks were even made upon the. legal institutions-of Germany, such, for example, as during the Reichstag fire trial held inLondon. Millions of leaflets and hundreds of thousands of pamphlets wereprinted abroad, and Governments declared that they were unable to stop this atthe very moment when the same Governments reproached the German Govern-ment with its inability to put a stop to similar action by Austrian emigres inGermany. If the regime in Austria was supported by the Austrian people, theemigres would have no moral foundation for their activities, just as the Germanemigres had no moral foundation for theirs.Not for one minute did Germany think of violating Austrian territory ordisregarding the treaty or imposing any regime upon Austria. He would assure the British Ministers, as one who knew Austria, that he had no desire to increasethe economic difficulties of his own country by the annexation of a country whoseeconomic difficulties were greater still. He would be glad if Austria coulddisappear from the chess-board of European politics. Germans would like toleave Austria severely alone, but of course other countries would also have to dothe same. He was here of course not referring to England, but to another country which looked on Austria as a field for political influence and as a basis for future hopes. Germany was ready to do her utmost to contribute towardsthe appeasement of the Austrian situation.BARON von NEURATH observed that Germany accepted the idea of a central European pact in principle, but raised doubts as its practicability. Onedifficulty was the definition of non-interference. The reply received by Germanyto the question on this point was obscure. The difficulty of finding a definitionwas illustrated by the following incidents. A fortnight ago he had received a protest from the Austrian Government in regard to a remark made in private conversation by the Chancellor at saarbrucken to the effect that if there were a vote in Austria the result might be the same as in the Saar. The austrian government thought this was interference.Then, again, Sir John Simon had said in the House of Commons that theAustrian Ministers when in London had understood the lively interest takenby the British public in the Marxist riots in Austria. In view of this difficultyof definition, the German Government thought they could now await further proposals from those who had initiated the proposal for the pact..   . SIR JOHN SIMON remarked that he had said nothing about riots.BARON von NEURATH tried to repeat what Sir John Simon had said,but had to confess that he could not remember the precise words.SIR JOHN SIMON suggested that he might look it up.HERR HITLER said that he would be glad if a good definition of the notionof non-interference could be accepted. He could easily bring into the roomseveral hundred Communist criminals sent into. Germany from Russia, who hadreceived training in the handling of explosives and in making bomb attacks.There were 400 or 500 of them in German prisons. This showed how elastic, non-interference could be. The country which was sending these people into Germanywanted Germany to enter into a pact of non-interference. When the Communistcentre of Berlin was seized, they had found military maps prepared by GenerailStaff officers in preparation for civil war in Germany. These had come froih.Russia, as well as money.   This was a striking example in non-interference..
HERR von RIBBENTROP remarked that there were also leaflets in english and in Indian languages.HERR HITLER added that there were special sections of the Cominternfor England, India, Poland, Spain and United States of America.Mr. EDEN said that he quite admitted the existence of these terroristorganisations. The problem had recently been raised in an acute form by the murder of King Alexander. A committee had been set up by the Council of theLeague to see what could be done about it. The problem was not necessarilyinsoluble. It would be a pity if, on this ground alone, the Central Europeanpact were to be abandoned.HERR HITLER said he had raised these points merely in. order to show how difficult it was to define non-interference.Mr. EDEN recalled that the point at issue was the French reply to theGerman Government, but he saw no reason why this particular difficulty should hold up the whole scheme.SIR JOHN SIMON said that His Majesty&apos;s Government would be glad ifthe German Government would favour the idea of a general pact, the object ofwhich would be to exclude external non-interference from Austria; but he recognised the difficulty of definition. Perhaps the German Government would contribute by suggesting a new draft. He did not want to set Baron von Neurathan insoluble problem, but he would be glad if he would try.HERR HITLER remarked that they would leave the initiative to those whohad first taken it. The German Government had never threatened the sovereignty of Austria nor had they any intention of attacking Austria. Germany mighthave mobilised two or three divisions in 1934, and Germany would to-day be ina position to do so if she desired to exercise pressure. Germany had not mobilisedand would not do so. She did not seek diplomatic success through militarypressure. If it came to the worst German soldiers would do their duty as bravelyas those of the country which had thought it necessary to mobilise and to call upyoung men to the colours.   Austrian sovereignty was not threatened by Germany.HERR von RIBBENTROP recalled that the Chancellor had said that hehad no desire to intervene in Austrian affairs and would welcome a solution ofthe Austrian problem to the satisfaction of all concerned, so that it might cease to be the object of international quarrels. The British Government had ofcourse given serious consideration to this problem. Could Sir John Simon say what their ideas were ?SIR JOHN SIMON said that he had stated that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould like to see such a policy pursued as would ensure the integrity and independence of Austria. But His Majesty&apos;s Government could not treat Austriain the same way as a country like Belgium which lay at their doors. HisMajesty&apos;s Governments only desire was to see that part of Europe settle down.In their view interference by one side was as objectionable as interference by theother.HERR HITLER said that that was an. idea which he could perfectly wellaccept.SIR JOHN SIMON said that it only needed working out. Was it possibleto make any progress in practice at the present moment ?HERR HITLER said he was convinced that the moment they reached apractical solution, the elements now obscuring the situation would be eliminatedby the solution which had been found. The draft agreement in its present formhad met with objection from others besides the German Government.      .&apos;. \SIR JOHN.SIMON said that he did not like to finish a discussion so longas there was something not clear in his mind.. The Chancellor had said thatas soon as a practical solution had been reached all difficulties would disappear.His colleagues might ask him what: the Chancellor had meant by a &quot; practical solution.&quot; was there anything Herr Hitler could say to make clear his idea ofsuch a solution? . -
HERR HITLER said that the solution he had in mind.would be a solutionacceptable to all other countries. The scheme at present in contemplation wasnot acceptable to most of the countries concerned, in fact only to Italy and France,that is to say to countries either indirectly interested or only unilaterallyinterested. What he had in mind was something satisfactory to all countries concerned. He did not like others to prepare a meal which none of them reallyliked, but which they called upon Germany to taste first, the result being thatthey could plead that they could not be expected to taste it because Germanyrefused to do so. It would be better for the other parties to draw up something which they ail liked, and then the German Government would probably come in.SIR ERIC PHIPPS pointedly remarked that this was contrary to thecommon German thesis. The usual German complaint was that other peoplepresented her with a dish already cooked, whereas she claimed the right to take part in the cooking.HERR HITLER said there was a great difference between the Austrianquestion and the questions to which Sir Eric Phipps had drawn attention.The Austrian problem did not interest the German Government or concernthem. The other questions in regard to which the German Government had com-plained of not being consulted from the outset were questions of vital interest toGermany.Germany did not intend to threaten the independence of Austria. There-fore there was no reason why the German Government should say anything withregard to Austria. The German Government thought that the question ofAustria had been artificially created. Therefore they would make no sacrifice,because Germany had no intention of attacking Austria. The question of arma-ments was entirely different, for in that the German Government were vitallyinterested.In the Austrian question the German Government were not interested. they wanted, of course, to be agreeable to other Powers in regard thereto and to makea contribution to the settlement of the question. But they did not think theAustrian question a problem at all. Why should they guarantee non-interferencewith Austria when such a guarantee was not deemed necessary in the case of othercountries ? Germany, for example, was bothered by the question of the emigres,but nobody wanted to guarantee her.The German Government were indifferent to the Austrian question, which did not necessitate sacrifice or concessions by them.Why could not the question be settled by a non-aggression pact? TheGerman Government feared by the suggestions which were put to them to com-plicate a troubled situation. They preferred clear-cut solutions, a non-aggression pact, for example.They did not see the utility of a guarantee of non-interference. They needmake no sacrifices in the Austrian question because Germany did not intend to threaten the independence of Austria.Herr Hitler was not so foolish as to think that he could localise the questionof the union of Germany.and Austria. Of course, an attempt at union wouldhave wide repercussions. Germany did not see why special safeguards were necessary, for she did not intend to threaten Austrian independence.      .THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he did not feel able to say any more on theAustrian question, but there were still three matters for discussion. He wouldlike to hear the German Government^ views on the League of Nations. Hewould like to say something about armaments, and he would like to communicatehis ideas about the Air Pact and to hear Herr Hitler&apos;s views on that question-HERR HITLER suggested that the question of the League of nations should be taken immediately, and the other questions on the following day.SIR JOHN SIMON: As regards the League of Nations, Herr Hitler mustknow how sincerely the British Government was attached to this new conception of a League of Nations.     It provided an essential meeting-place where the
discussion of difficulties might take place and where it had been possible to reachadjustments about many matters which might otherwise have become dangerous.Even recently, the value of the League had been made manifest in thequestion of the policing of the Saar. There, it was true, the British Governmenthad taken the initiative, but the other national contingents could not have been so easily secured or general agreement reached without the useful machinery ofthe League. Sir John Simon wished to acknowledge the Chancellors promptreply about the British proposal for the international force for the Saar.Another recent instance of the great value of the League was in the matterof the difficulties between Yugoslavia and Hungary.The British Government knew that the German Government felt that theyhad criticisms to make on the League of Nations, and he had heard that theGerman Government thought that the League Covenant should be modified.In England they were deeply attached to the League, and they did not wishto see it used on behalf of one side or the other. That was one reason why they attached such importance to the German return to the League, for in the presentcircumstances they had not the same contact with Germany as they had with thePowers at Geneva.Sir John Simon explained that the British Ministers wished particularly to mention the League on this occasion because the German return to the Leaguewas a great pre-occupation to the average British citizen, who wanted to do whatwas fair and right, and who wanted to facilitate Germany&apos;s return to theLeague.That feeling was very widespread in Britain, and it was a feeling of regretto ver)^ many British people that Germany was not at Geneva. In these circum-stances anything Herr Hitler could tell the British Ministers on this matter would be very helpful to them because they wanted to be &quot; honest brokers,&quot; asHerr Hitler himself had said a little earlier in the meeting.HERR HITLER said that the League of Nations was the most difficultof the matters they had to discuss, because Germany, in the belief she hadin the League of Nations in 1918, had laid down her arms. The League had been one of President Wilson&apos;s 14 Points, &quot; a society of free nations where there shouldbe no victors and no vanquished, and which should unite all the nations to preventthe recurrence of war.&quot;Although all the nations had suffered from the war, none had suffered likeGermany with her 2 million dead in battle and 800,000 who had died fromstarvation. In Germany opinion had at the end of the war been more favourable than in any other country to the League because German opinion thought, thatthe League would be a way to solve all these problems.Then came a great disillusionment owing to the coupling of the Covenantwith the Treaty of Versailles. German opinion had realised that the League, inwhich it had placed such high hopes, was the only organ by which the treaty was to be executed. That Treaty had classified the nations as victors andvanquished, as the superior and the inferior.Certain German Governments had accepted that classification;  but theGerman people had never accepted it.In the war the German soldiers had never had any feeling of inferiority;and they who had come in their millions to fight had taken no previous part in public affairs, and therefore could not be made responsible for the war.He himself had only been 25 in 1914; and he bad not been responsible forthe war; but he had done his duty to his country.The German soldiers had had no feeling of inferiority to others. Theyhad had, indeed, admiration for the soldiers of their enemies and, particularly,for the British soldiers. They might have lost the war; but they felt no moralinferiority.If Herr Hitler had been Chancellor in 1914 there would have been no war,and certainly not a war with England; and if he had been Chancellor the war,had it taken place, would not necessarily have been lost.The Treaty of Versailles had imposed upon the German nation an inferioritywhich they had never recognised. The imposition of that inferiority was thegreatest mistake in the Treaty. It was not the territorial changes imposed by theTreaty or the reparations; but it was the inferiority which rankled, the divisioninto two classes of nations.
Once the League of Nations had associated itself with that system, it wasimpossible for any honest and truth-loving German to associate himself with theLeague. If Britain wanted relations with Germany, she must want them withthe good and honest Germans and not with the bad Germans; the good germans would not have accepted the idea of inferiority. If those good Germans were toagree and shake hands with the British, the latter must take the hands of the goodGermans as the Germans would wish to take the hands of the good English.Mr. EDEN wished to emphasise once more what Sir John Simon had said about the British Governments belief in the League. The British Governmentwere convinced that some such organisation was indispensable in the modernworld. The only alternative was the alliances. &amp;c, which did not prevent the war of 1914.Another feature of the League to which importance was attached in britain was the fact that it could never be effective if it did not include at least all theEuropean nations. That was one reason why the British Government wantedGermany back.Mr. Eden did not follow Herr Hitler&apos;s argument about the victors and thevanquished. It was true that the Covenant was born of the Treaty of Versailles,but technically one could divorce the two. He wished to emphasise that in the minds of the British Government there could never be any conception but thatGermany was the complete equal of the other Powers in the League itself and onthe Council.Germany had entered the League after the Locarno Treaty. One service ofthat Treaty had been that it had brought to an end the conception of victors andvanquished. Then Germany took her place at the Council as one of its permanent members. There was no inferiority about that, and Germany had certainly been treated with full equality at Geneva.Mr. Eden was not surprised to hear that the German soldier never admitted to inferiority. He had never had any doubt on that point when he had beenopposite the German soldiers in the line. He did not truly believe that amongstthe other nations there was that sense of two classes. There were many nations at Geneva who had fought on either side in the war. Of course, if some technicalchange was wanted, the matter could be explored.The British Government did want Germany at Geneva, and British opiniondid not understand why Germany or any other country that sincerely desiredpeace could not come back. Certainly no one in England wanted her in a placeof inferiority.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired if the separation of the Covenant from theTreaty of Versailles would help to bring Germany back to Geneva. No doubtthere were other points; but there was no use in spending time on formalities if that would not help.He fully appreciated the point of view that the Covenant would be better asa self-contained document standing by itself. He was sure that the founders ofthe League did not regard the Covenant as part of the Treaties. They were trying to create a world-wide thing. If the separation of the Covenant from the treaty would alter Germany&apos;s point of view that would be a new reason for seeing if itcould be done. If that matter would have a substantial influence, then they musttry and cut the two documents adrift so that there should be no question of tyingthe Covenant to the tail of any Treaty.HERR HITLER said that as regards the League of Nations he had definedthe German position in May 1933. Unfortunately his speech on that occasionwas interpreted like the speeches of other German Chancellors, such asHerr Miiller, Herr Fehrenbach, &amp;c. If his declaration on that occasion had beeninterpreted like his present speeches and like his future speeches would be, therewould have been no misunderstanding.On that occasion he had made it clear that Germany would&apos; not continueto participate in a disarmament conference and the League of Nations, &amp;c, if she was to remain a country of inferior right. That was still the position. he agreed with Mr. Eden that the problem was partly one of the technical separation of the Covenant and the Treaty. But what remained over and beyond that wasthe actual fact of Germany&apos;s position of inferiority on all those points which she had not rectified for herself.[11375] &apos;   d
Germany had rectified for herself the questions of conscription and militaryequality which touched her honour.   He did not refer to European territorialquestions.   He knew that it was difficult to modify the territorial statute of iEurope, unless Germany was ready to face the danger of the whole structuretumbling.He would give one illustration of the German position of inferiority. Suppose Ithat Germany returned to the League and that Japan was still not a member.Then Germany would still not be thought fit to administer a colony, while japan would administer a former German colony.  What a clear illustration of Germaninferiority!Perhaps France and Britain did not derive advantage from the formerGerman colonies. Perhaps Germany would not get anything out of them; andmany Germans said so before the War; and added that England had conqueredthe good colonies whilst Germans were quarrelling about religion; and that nothing good had been left for them.Herr Hitler did not know the economic value of these colonies. Perhapsthe3r had little economic value for the British Empire. Probably they causedfinancial loss to the British Empire and would cause financial loss to Germanytoo. But it was the moral and legal aspect of the question, and the whole position which Germany occupied in the world was affected by it.Herr Hitler then produced a diagram on which the colonial possessionsof the various Powers were illustrated, together with the corresponding size of their territories in Europe. Herr Hitler said that this diagram would givethe British Ministers a clear idea of what he meant. It was a position ofinequality and inferiority under which Germany, with a population of 68 millions and 460,000 square kilometres of territory with 137 inhabitants to each squarekilometre had no colonies.This question of Germany&apos;s equality could not be solved by some solution which might be regretted on the following day by the Powers who were partiesto the settlement. It could only be solved by absolute satisfaction on every side.No temporary solution was possible; the solution must take account of all theaspects of the question to which Herr Hitler had referred.If a satisfactory solution of this question was found, then Britain wouldhave engaged Germany; and Germany would blindly and loyally fulfil herundertakings.Herr Hitler was not asking the impossible, because he knew that certainthings were impossible now. But he was asking the absolute minimum; and ifthey looked into the distant future, the British Government might ask themselveswhether British interests would be served by allowing Germany to become apariah when she might have allowed Germany to take part with her.The moment would come when the European nations must stand together,For the time being they were engaged in preventing their own controversies from Iexploding. But the moment might come when the European nations must stand ptogether, in particular, when Germany and Britain must stand together&apos;.In times of peace there had never been hatred against Britain in Germany;and in the National Socialist movement there was no anti-British feeling.The German Government wanted agreement with Britain and also with IFrance, but in the case of the latter it was very difficult to dissipate certain 1misunderstandings; and an understanding with Britain would be a valuable iasset.Herr Hitler&apos;s proposal was a very bold one, but as Germany knew that she 1could never defend alone her colonial possessions, so it might be that even the british Empire might one day be glad to have Germany&apos;s help and Germany&apos;s Iforces at her disposal. If they could find such a solution and give satisfaction Ito Germany&apos;s most urgent and primitive demands, they would lead Germany Iback to co-operation and friendly relations with Great Britain.He had outlined a bold idea, but he had wished to put it forward.ISIR JOHN SIMON said that there had been frank speech on both sides; Iand he must now make two observations. first, Herr Hitler had been sketching out a thought in his mind which would [seem to involve on the part of Britain some willingness to separate herself from Igeneral co-operation in Europe and which might almost seem an invitation to gBritain to regard France as less associated with her than Germany.   The British i
Government wished to have the closest association with Germany, but they wantedthat without prejudice to their relations with France. They did not wish to substitute one friend for another, because they wanted to be loyal friends to all.He must say that at once. Otherwise he would not be acting faithfully to thosewho were not present that day.Britain had no special engagements. She was free and wished to remainfree and to give friendship to all. But she was not open to the solicitation thatshe should not be faithful to her old relationships when seeking to improverelationships elsewhere.Secondly, as to the question of colonies, he took note of and would report ,what had been said, but he must point out that as regards mandated territories &apos;they were not at the sole disposal of Britain.   Other Powers were concerned.It was right to point that out.Then as regards that large area which had represented British colonial territory on Herr Hitler&apos;s diagram, Herr Hitler must remember that that areaincluded not only colonies comparable with the colonial possessions of other powers, but the great Dominions of Canada, of the Union of South Africa, of theCommonwealth of Australia, and of New Zealand.There had no doubt been a time when those great Dominions had beendependent on Britain; but that had long since passed, and to-day they were inno sense whatever in a relationship to Britain comparable^in any way to thecolonies of other Powers. The matter was very important. IHe did not wish toleave the Chancellor under any misapprehension that he held &quot;out any hope what-ever that the British Government could do anything about the colonial question. IHe took note of what had been said and he would report. But he did not wishto leave the Chancellor under any mistaken impression.   It was best to be frank.&quot;&quot;)(The meeting then adjourned.)f11375 I
THIRD MEETING.March 26, 1935, at 10-30 a.m.NAVAL ARMAMENTS.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he regarded that morning&apos;s proceedings as  \a continuation of those of yesterday, and therefore had no general remarks tomake at the moment.  He proposed to take up the next subject on the programme,namely, armaments.   He wished to make a statement about the naval side ofthis matter.The German Government would be aware that representatives of HisMajesty&apos;s Government had recently been engaged in bilateral conversations with representatives of a number of other Governments in view of the fact thatin 1935 the continuation or modification of existing naval treaties comes underconsideration. He would like to inform the Chancellor what had beenhappening. Separate conversations had taken place in London with represen-tatives of the United States of America and Japan, and somewhat less elaborateconversations with representatives of Erance and Italy. The object in eachcase was to prepare the ground for the naval discussions of 1935.The first thing he had to say was that His Majesty&apos;s Government hopedthat the German Government would take part in any general conference ofnaval Powers that might be held in the near future. With this in view, it wouldbe useful if informal exchanges of views could now take place on the navalquestion between representatives of Elis Majesty&apos;s Government and the GermanGovernment. London would probably be the best place for these. the conversations with the United States, France and Italy took place in London,and were conducted on their part by Ambassadors helped b)^ technical assistants.His Majesty&apos;s Government would like in these discussions to learn from theGerman representatives the view of the German Government as to therequirements which Germany would wish to be discussed at a naval conference.It would be understood, of course, that this proposal was made withoutprejudice to the validity of existing treaty provisions, and was made with allreserve on this point and without prejudice to any agreement regardingarmaments generally which might be reached as part of the general settlementforeshadowed in the London communique.There was one other communication he would like to make on this subject.He wished to inform the German Government that the method that HisMajesty&apos;s Government thought most likely to give results was not to raise orseek to formulate proposals in the form of ratios, but to consider whether itwas possible to reach agreement about programmes for the next period of years.During the preliminary discussions in London it had been suggested that thisperiod might run to 1942. No country was able in a very limited number ofyears to construct at an unlimited rate, whatever its ultimate programmemight be. This applied to Great Britain as well as to other Powers. he therefore hoped that, in the preliminary Anglo-German discussions in London-on naval issues preparatory to a general naval conference, this method wouldbe thought practicable by the German Government. At the present stage,however, it was necessary to do no more than make the enquiry as to a preliminary meeting. The method His Majesty&apos;s Government hoped would be adoptedwould not pre-judge or lay down figures for the distant future by the method ofratios.HERR HITLER asked what would be the date of the Naval Conference.He said that this proposal came as a great surprise, and was completely new.Hitherto naval conferences had tried to fix ratios. The Washington treaty had laid down ratios up to which the parties were free to build or not as they wished. So far as the new proposal was concerned, he thought it necessary tosay that a number of States were fully equipped with fleets sufficient for their needs under previous conferences. Under building programmes, building wouldbe limited, or there might be no building at all. It might, for example, bearranged that there should be no fresh construction for a period of five years. ^In that event Germany would not be able to build anything for five years, and
Germany&apos;s sovereign rights, which she could not in any event give up, would merely exist on paper.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the date for the naval conference had notyet been fixed and was a matter for negotiation.He wished at once to explain that the Chancellor was mistaken in supposing that he had proposed or indicated a method that was entirely novel. There were two quite distinct points. The first was the proposal that there should be api&apos;eliminary meeting between British and German representatives to see whether an exchange of views on naval subjects would be useful in preparation for thenaval conference. He would be glad at some convenient time to receive a replyto this proposal. This proposal was, of course, made subject to reserves andwithout prejudice to the provisions of existing treaties.The second point was merely a piece of information, and not a proposal.His Majesty&apos;s Government were trying to do with Germany what they had already done with the other naval Powers. He wished therefore to inform the GermanGovernment that the method that His Majesty&apos;s Government had found most useful to consider was whether it would be possible to propound programmes. Itwas better that he should tell the Chancellor this than that he should not tell him.There was no occasion for surprise. The Chancellor may not have understoodthat the method did not mean that each State should have the same programme.What was intended was that States should discuss what their respectiveprogrammes should be. It was not suggested that X should be the same for all.Each country would discuss with every other whether their requirements over aperiod of years could be stated in programmes rather than in ratios. This,surely, was not a very revolutionary proposal.BARON von NEURATH said there might have been a misunderstanding.HERR HITLER said that the first proposal was accepted.He added that even the proposed building programme would have somerelation to each other, and that in the end the effect would be similar to that ofratios. It was obvious that, if Russia reconstructed her fleet, this must have repercussions on the German programme. In the same way, if France builtgiant ships of high speed, this must have its effect upon the German programme.There was bound to be interaction. It would probably not be possible to discoverthe best method until the conference met.On a point of principle, he wished to say that Germany did not want to pursue an unlimited naval armaments race as had been the case before the War.Germany did not think it politically necessary, and had not the necessary financial resources for such a race. On the other hand, Germany must take account ofcertain vital necessities in the matter of her own protection, and could not makethose necessities dependent upon a conference the date of which had not been fixed and the results of which were not certain. While he was prepared to give every assurance to His Majesty&apos;s Government that there would be no naval armaments race between Germany and Great Britain, Germany could notsubordinate the requirements of her own security to a conference the date andresult of which were unknown. If Russia and France increased their fleets,Germany must be in a position to do what she thought necessary to safeguardher own security.  No responsible Government could do otherwise.He wished also to make the reservation that, at least from the theoreticalpoint of view, a possible new agreement reached at the conference would notnecessarily replace the Treaty of Versailles.SIR JOHN SIMON said, as regards this last observation, that the resultsuf the naval conference were of course a matter for the future, but His Majesty&apos;sGovernment earnestly desired that an agreement should be reached which wouldtake the place of existing provisions. All that he was concerned to make plainwas that, in inviting the German Government to send representatives to london for a preliminary discussion on naval matters in preparation for the naval conference, it was clearly understood that this invitation was not an abandon-ment of existing treaty provisions, but was given and accepted with all reserveon this point, because it was for the future negotiation to reach a new agreement.
Sir John Simon continued that Herr Hitler had been good enough to saythat Germany was not contemplating an unlimited armaments race in the, navalsphere. The British Ministers were, of course, very glad: to hear that. - Hethought, since they were speaking with such complete frankness and in order toinform one another, that he ought to point out that a figure which he believedhad been mentioned to the British Ambassador of 35 per cent, of the british fleet would appear to the British Government apart from any other question to be so large as to make general agreement almost impossible. The result would therefore be, if that figure were insisted upon, to promote the unlimitedarmaments race which the Chancellor said the German Government wished toavoid.Such a figure would inevitably increase the demands of France, for theFrench figure was, roughly speaking, 50 per cent, of the British figure. If itreally was contemplated that the German Government intended to build up to do  large a figure as that indicated, that meant new tonnage, and therefore themost efficient ships. It was quite obvious that this must result in putting up the size of the French and therefore also of the Italian navy. This would have serious results on the British figures.The consequence would be that the unlimited armaments race which Germanywished to co-operate in avoiding would, in fact, be stimulated and hastened.Sir John Simon made this observation because he did not want the GermanGovernment to be under any misapprehension as to the view which the BritishGovernment would take on any such figure. But he understood that the Chancelloragreed that the preliminary meeting should take place in London, and that thebest way in which the needs and intentions of the different Powers could be formulated would be a matter for consideration at that meeting.He only made the statement which he had just made because he thoughtit would be of no advantage to any one if there was any misunderstanding asto the grave impression which would be made on the British Government by the mention of the figure in question.HERE, HITLER said that there had been a mistake. The present ratio of the French fleet, he understood, was 35 per cent, of the British fleet, thoughunder the Washington Agreement it had been 50 per cent.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the French fleet was at present in tonnage50 per cent, of the British fleet or rather over. The Washington Treaty wasnot the only treaty which had to be considered. The Washington and Londontreaties must be taken together. In fact, if these two treaties were taken together,it would be found that French tonnage was 667,000, as against 1,200,000 tons ofthe British fleet.Those were the present figures.BARON von NEURATH then went out of the room to check these figures.He returned after a few minutes and admitted that the British figures were right.FIERR HITLER said that his claim to 35 per cent, of the British fleetimplied unequivocal recognition of British naval superiority. He emphasised that he did not make this claim for a limited period of 2, 5 or 6 years. any assurance which he gave with regard to it would be for ever.On the other hand he did not see any heavenly or earthly authority who could force Germany to recognise the superiority of the French or Italian fleets.Germany&apos;s requirements for the protection of her trade were just as great as those of France or Italy for the protection of their trade.In those circumstances it was hard for him to see how a figure of 35 per cent,of the British fleet claimed by Germany could give any right to France to increase her percentage demand.He claimed 35 per cent, of the British fleet for Germany, but not 35 per.cent, for all the different categories of ships.He based his claim on the need for the protection of the long coastline inthe Baltic in particular, and further on the protection of German communications with East Prussia, which, for Germany, had almost become an overseas colony.As regards the objection that the 35 per cent, would be new tonnage, HeruHitler said that he could not possibly build up the 35 per cent, within three or five years. It would take much longer than that, and that would give othercountries an opportunity to modernise their fleets.
Further, his 35 per cent, would be burdened with the ships built underthe Versailles conditions. The cruisers so built were too slow and inadequatelyarmed.SIR JOHN SIMON took note of the agreement in principle for a meeting in London under the conditions indicated.HERR HITLER wished at this point to make ah observation of principle.The meetings of the 25th March and of that morning were the first which hehad had in this highly official manner with the representatives of the BritishGovernment.He thought that they were not in that room concerned with the problems ofto-morrow or of the day after.But it was necessary to define the German conceptions and wishes as clearlyas possible, so that on the basis of those clear definitions co-operation over a long period might be possible with all countries.He would therefore think it wrong to advance demands now in order toincrease them after two or three years; and he would think it just as wrong toremain silent on demands which Germany would put forward after two or threeyears.For that reason he had very frankly and fully explained the conceptions heldby the German Government as to the conditions to which Germany&apos;s return tothe League of Nations must be subordinated and as to the possibilities of concluding a naval agreement.He had put forward Germany&apos;s demands in respect of that naval agreementfrankly; he was guided not by the circumstances of the moment, but was taking account of a more distant future.It would be an impossible situation if Germany returned to the League toput forward new demands so far unknown to the world after two of three years.That might imply, if those demands were rejected, a fresh German withdrawal from Geneva.Thus there would be continuous disturbances and uneasiness.It was because he had put forward certain demands at that moment that hehad thought it best to indicate those demands frankly. He well understood thattheir fulfilment could for the moment only be a fulfilment of principle; and thattheir practical realisation, e.g., as regards the navy, would have to take place inthe course of time.KOVNO VERDICT.At this point HERR HITLER read out a telegram which he had just received announcing the Kovno verdict. He said that that was an illustration ofwhat he had said on the preceding day, and showed the kind of co-operationexisting in Eastern. Europe. He asked what Britain would do if the Treaty ofVersailles had torn away a part of her territory and placed it under a countrylike Lithuania, and if Englishmen merely because they were Englishmen weretortured and put in prison.MILITARY ARMAMENTS.Mr. EDEN said that the German Government must be aware that through-out the long negotiations on the armaments question the British Government had worked for agreement by every means they could find. In the post-war years theyhad reduced British armaments and tried to find a basis of international agreement.Mr. Eden wished first to ask if the German Government still wanted an armslimitation agreement.He would not conceal from the German Government that the recentannouncement about the German Army had created a new set of difficulties in theway of agreement. It might even be said that upon the basis revealed by thatannouncement (viz., the 36 divisions) agreement seemed impossible. In allprevious discussions parity between the Western European Powers had beenaccepted as the basis.If these 36. divisions implied, as had been suggested to His Majesty&apos;ambassador, 500,000 men, that seemed a figure to which the other western european Powers could never attain. It would make parity impossible and giveGermany superiority.
It was clear that the British Government could not accept this figure as abasis of discussion. Subject to that reserve he wished to ask certain questions :  (1) Was it correct that the proposed German strength in effectives was500,000 men.(2) What was to be the length of service and the role of the para-militaryformations and the police troops.(3) Would Labour Service be maintained.(4) What training would reservists receive in the future.Those were some of the questions on which the British Ministers would likeinformation to enable them to assess the position.HERB, HITLER then produced a diagram which showed the strengths indivisions of Germany and the neighbouring Powers as follows : Germany : 36 divisions.France : 34 divisions, plus 10 divisions in North Africa.Italy : 34 divisions.Czechoslovakia : 17 divisions.Belgium : 8 divisions.Poland : 34 divisions.Russia : 101 divisions.Herr Hitler then said that people were accustomed to compare with the36 German divisions a French strength of 25 divisions. But the difference withthe French strength as set out in the diagram was explained by the methods ofcounting adopted by France.France only counted infantry divisions, while Germany counted all forma-tions (infantry, police troops, cavalry, motorized troops and formations of short-term trained soldiers, the Landwehr).If that method was applied to the French strength, it would be found that france had 34 divisions to which must be added the 10 divisions in North AfricaIt was comparatively easy for the French to bring over their North African troops to Europe; and Germany had no means of severing the communications between france and North Africa.Therefore, France, in fact, had 44 divisions, as against the 36 german divisions.   Further, out of the 36 German divisions, 4 were in East Prussia.Again, there was in the German Agreement with Poland a specific clausestating that nothing in that agreement should in any way alter the arrangementsexisting between Poland and France. In the case, therefore, of a Franco-german war, 34 Polish divisions must be added to the French strength; and even if poland was neutral there were 17 Czech divisions available. Then Italy had 34 divisions,too; and she (apart from the Swiss frontier) had a very short frontier to defend.Germany had a frontier of 3,600 kilometres.On the other hand, against the 36 German divisions were 101 (sic) Russiandivisions.Now, in the Locarno Agreement, Germany had undertaken to respect the demilitarised zone; but in that zone there were no protective fortifications; and yet France had in that region a large network of fortifications. Moreover, themost easterly German fortifications on the East were very near Berlin.AIR ARMAMENTS.Herr Hitler then produced a further diagram showing the strength ofthe Air Forces of the most important of Germany&apos;s neighbours.This diagram showed the following air strengths : Britain August 1934, first line, 1,045 machines; including reserves, 1,847machines.April 1935, including reserves, 2,100 machines.France August 1934, first line, -1,986 machines; including reserves, 3,800machines,;., .-&apos; &apos; &apos;&apos;   \ \ *    v,&apos;..-   *April 1935, including reserves, 6,000 machines.
, Italy-     &apos;.      -,     * -    - - ^ .:f:i    August 1934, first line, 1,059 machines; including reserves, 1,600machines.April 1935, including reserves, 2,100 machines.Czechoslovakia- August 1934, first line, 570 machines;  including reserves, 960machines.April 1935, including reserves, 1,200 machines.Russia August 1934, first line, 1,979 machines; including reserves, 2,918machines.April 1935, including reserves, 4,300 machines.Poland August 1934, first line, 695 machines; including reserves, 1,430machines.April 1935, including reserves, 1,500 machines.Belgium- August 1934, first line, 246 machines; including reserves, 400&apos;machines.April 1935, including reserves, 450 machines.SIR JOHN SIMON said he did not recognise the figure attributed by thediagram to Britain.   He thought we had 690 first line machines.MILITARY ARMAMENTS.Sir John Simon then asked what effectives the 36 divisions represented.HERR HITLER replied that the figure of 550,000 men would never be exceeded; and that that figure had not yet been reached.Mr. EDEN asked if it was suggested that the French now had 500,000 menin France.HERR HITLER replied that with their North African troops they had500,000 men. Herr Hitler said that he was chiefly speaking of France, Germanyand Italy; but France had Russia and possibly Poland to help her. If Russiaattacked Germany the latter had only Poland.Germany, moreover, had only begun to train her population within the lasttwo years. In these circumstances the 101 Russian divisions could not be disregarded or the 17 Czech divisions.Finally, there was the fact that all the German frontiers were entirelyunprotected.Herr Hitler then pointed out that France was now saying that she hadcomparatively weak classes, for she was entering the lean years. Therefore she had established two years&apos; service. But Germany also had lean years and onlyone year&apos;s service. If the German Government said that 550,000 mencorresponded to 36 divisions, it was not absolutely necessary to have all thesemen with the colours. If Franco-German relations improved and realco-operation between the two countries became possible, then there might be some cuts. But the German Governments intention was to fix a figure whichwould not be exceeded even if the French introduced three years&apos; or five years&apos; oreven seven years&apos; service.Mr. EDEN then asked if he was correct in assuming that the Germanperiod of service was one year.HERR HITLER replied in the affirmative; but the technical troops wouldhave more. He added that the police troops would now definitely pass tothe army.Mr. EDEN enquired about para military formations.HERR HITLER replied that there were no para military formations inGermany. He added that in foreign countries para military organisationsreceived training with rifles even at Eton.    - ; &quot;      V[11375] : E
HERR RIBBENTROP said that it was a wrong conception; and thatthere were no para military organisations in Germany.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired if the S.S. were included in the 550,000 men.BARON von NEURATH replied in the affirmative and said that therewas one division of S.S.SIR ERIC PHIPPS asked if the labour service counted; and theCHANCELLOR replied that they did not count at all.HERR HITLER said that out of the total S.S. only 10,000 men were armed;one-third of these was in Bavaria, one-third in Berlin, and one-third in the restof Germany.Mr. EDEN asked about war material.BARON von NE (JRATH said that the German Government had destroyedit all under the Control Commission, but war material took so long to make thatthey were obliged to work night and day in Germany to replace what had been destroyed.HERR HITLER said that the German Government required the necessary material for 36 divisions, plus reserves.Mr. EDEN asked about big guns; and the CHANCELLOR said thatGermany wanted all the arms possessed by other countries.BARON von NEURATH said that if other countries would abandon types of arms, Germany would do the same.Mr, EDEN asked if the German Government would agree not to constructcertain types bf material above a certain limit if other Powers did the same.BARON von NEURATH replied in the negative, because other countries had stocks.Mr. EDEN asked again if Germany would not construct above a certainlimit if the other countries agreed.THE CHANCELLOR repeated that the other countries had stocks already.He then said that, in principle, Germany would participate in any agreement for international limitation. If there was an agreement that on the 1st January,1938, no nation should possess guns over 15 cm., Germany would not have suchguns from that date. Such an agreement would, of course, not prevent germany from possessing such guns up to that date and, if necessary and other Powersagreed, destroying them afterwards.If other Powers had certain material Germany could not be defenceless.Herr Hitler added that he did not believe that any nation would destroya gun as long as it thought that gun represented an advantage over others. Itwould only destroy a gun when it knew that it constituted no advantage.SIR JOHN SIMON enquired whether^ if an agreement were reachedcovering arms limitation, Germany would still be prepared to accept and work asystem of permanent automatic supervision, in order to ascertain that the agree-ment was being duly observed and upon the understanding that such supervisionapplied to all Powers equally.HERR HITLER said that the German Government would certainly accept that.He added that he would like to ask Sir John Simon a question. What werethe British Governments views regarding the proportionate strength between germany and Russia, in view particularly of the approaching Franco-Russianalliance which the German Government believed already existed in the form of amilitary agreement? .Britain declared she required the strongest Fleet. He thought that was just and fair, because of her position. But what was the British view on the Germanproportion to Russia and France ?Mr. EDEN replied that the table in the British Draft Convention (theso-called MacDonald Plan) gave Germany, France and Italy equality at 200,000
effectives and gave Eussia 500,000. He remembered that it was generally agreed at Geneva that a soldier of Eastern Europe did not count as high as one from western Europe.HERR HITLER enquired what was the relative value of a Russian tank ascompared with the German tank. He claimed that a Russian bomber would fightjust as well as a German bomber.Herr Hitler then produced a chart showing the distribution of industrythroughout Germany. The iron and steel industries were located in anunfortified region, the demilitarised zone; so were a large part of the coal-mines.Mr. EDEN said that nobody wanted to touch Germany, especially in thewest; and there was Locarno.HERR HITLER replied that Germany had no protection all the same;and that it was a very short way by air from the frontier to the industrialdistricts of the centre.AIR ARMAMENTS.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Chancellor had shown on his diagramthat Germany was to have 36 divisions; but there was nothing in that diagramabout the strength of the German Air Force.HERR HITLER said that he had left open two matters: the question ofthe strength of the fleet and that of parity in the air between Great Britain,France and Germany if Russian development was not such that revision of thefigures by common agreement would become necessary.Flerr Hitler said that Russia based her 100 divisions exclusively on thenumber of her population, because she was not exposed to attack; and she wasbuilding, too, the greatest air fleet in the world. Germany was very modest in not basing her army on the numbers of the population and in asking only forparity with Britain and France.SIR JOHN SIMON said that in the United Kingdom there was an AirForce which was a metropolitan force. The first line strength of that force was690 machines. But, on the other side of the world, the British Government had certain other first line machines.Sir John Simon enquired whether, when the Chancellor referred to parity,he meant parity with the Air Force in the United Kingdom or overseas also.HERR HITLER said that if Britain would bring her air strength for theUnited Kingdom up to the French strength, i.e., to parity with France, then itwould be that parity which Germany would demand.If Britain persuaded France to come down to the British level, the GermanGovernment would be delighted, because they would have to spend less on theirAir rorce. But even if Britain did not consider herself threatened by Franceand preferred to have a smaller force than France, Germany could not help itbecause of the necessity of protecting herself.HERR von RIBBENTROP said that Germany did not care how manyaeroplanes there were in England.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the Chancellor had explained that he wasclaiming parity with the metropolitan Air Force so far as the United kingdom was concerned, but what did he mean when he talked of Britain coming up tothe French figure ? Was he referring to the air strength in Metropolitan france or to the larger figure which included the air strength in the French colonies andeven in places like Indo-China on the other side of the world ?HERR HITLER replied that the distance from East Prussia to the Rhine-land was the same as the distance from North Africa to France. The paritywhich he demanded was parity with the Force in Metropolitan France plus thatin North Africa.Herr Hitler added that there could be no question of German hegemony overEurope. What was in question was the hegemony of Russia or the hegemony ofa combination of smaller States with France.SIR JOHN SIMON said there was one more question he must ask.When he had asked Herr Hitler what air force he claimed, the Chancellor had
said parity with Britain and .France.y; NpWjjit;-would be very material to thediscussion if Herr Hitler was able to state the strength of the German Air force as it was.  He felt obliged to putlthe qujestioii.: vHERE HITLER replied that Germany had reached parity with GreatBritain.Herr Hitler said that if Russia continued to build on the present scale she would be the greatest Power in Europe. He saw the Russian danger, though he felt himself to be a solitary prophet in the desert. But, later, people would find out that he had been right.EASTERN PACT.BARON von NEURATFI then handed to the British Ministers the note onthe Eastern Pact contained in Annex I.(The meeting then adjourned.)Annex I.Eastern Pact.In the opinion of the German Government the Powers interested in EastEuropean questions might, following up the fundamental ideas of the KelloggPact, conclude a pact on the following basis : 1. The contracting Powers agree not to resort to aggression or to force inany form against one another.2. The contracting Powers agree to conclude among themselves, as far asthey have not yet done so, treaties of arbitration and conciliation providing foran obligatory procedure of arbitration in the case of disputes of a legal nature,and for a procedure of conciliation with a view to arriving at an amicable settle-ment in matters of political conflicts.3. If, nevertheless, one of the contracting Powers believes itself to be threatened with aggression or with the employment of force on the part of anothercontracting Power, then, on the demand of the Power in question, a conferenceof representatives of the Governments of all contracting Powers will immediately be convened, in order to deliberate on the situation and, if necessary, on the stepsto be taken for the maintenance of peace.4. If, in spite of the above agreement, hostilities should break out betweenany two contracting Powers, the other contracting Powers engage not to supportthe-aggressor in any way, neither economically nor financially nor in amilitary way.5. The pact is to be concluded for a period of ten years, with the possibilityof extension for a further period.
FOURTH MEETING;&quot; - March 26, 1935, at. A; pm.NAVAL&apos;: ARMAMENTS:&apos;SIR JOHN SIMON said, with reference to the proposed naval conversation,&quot;it is, I think, clearly understood between us that the invitation is given inorder to prepare for the Naval Conference, which will aim at a new naval agreement in the future. Accordingly, if I have hereafter to make a statement in England about the basis of our meeting, I will employ the terms I have justused and in the meantime I understand it is agreed that neither side will makeany statement about the Naval Conference and that what I have said will hereafterdefine the basis of our meeting.&quot;BARON von NEURATH agreed.AIR PACT.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the one subject which now remained was theair pact.In the thought of His Majesty&apos;s Government the air pact which they had joined in proposing would be strictly in line with the scope and obligations of the locarno Treaty. It would involve obligations and action by a signatory in thecases to which Locarno applies. But though it would not therefore apply to anew class of case, it would involve greater precision in two respects.In the first place, in the event of unprovoked aggression by air attack, itwould oblige the signatories to come immediately to the aid of the attacked party.There would not be a discussion at Geneva first. -In the second place, the method by which the signatories would undertaketo perform their obligations immediately would be by use of their air forces.These were the two elements which would be characteristic of the air pact.They would not be new in the sense that a country would be under an obligationto act in a case which did not come under the obligations of Locarno. But theywould make more precise and more immediate the cases to which Locarnoapplied.The second point about the air pact would be this. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were glad to take part in putting forward the idea, because it seemed to them that recent developments of the possibility of sudden and violentattack by air over the borders of a country had become much more prominentsince Locarno was signed, and the slower methods which would be appropriateif there was to be the mobilisation of an army would be quite inappropriatein the event of sudden and almost instantaneous use of air power. The object,therefore, would not be so much to secure that if one of the signatories disregardedits obligations that signatory would suffer by reprisal, as to create so strong a deterrent and so strong a reason to know beforehand that a sudden assaultwould not be to the advantage of the aggressor, that there would be everyinducement for the signatories to refrain from disregarding their obligations.There was also a third point. His Majesty&apos;s Government would greatlyregret if the conclusion of an air pact could possibly have the consequences of appearing to recognise as legitimate indiscriminate attacks from the air uponthe civil population and industrial areas. His Majesty&apos;s Government would therefore like it to be carefully considered by those who were studying the ideaof an air pact whether it would not be possible to introduce, perhaps only byway of preamble &apos;or by some general expression, a repudiation by all signatories of indiscriminate attacks from the air as being contrary to the rules whichshould be observed by all. It would probably need a good deal of thought tofind the proper expression for this idea.Finally; His Majesty&apos;s Government conceived the air pact as not being the document which should contain the figures for air strengths. The air pactitself would merely pledge the signatories to use air forces for the purposes andin the manner described. It followed that air strengths must be agreed in someother documents. His Majesty&apos;s Government thought of the air pact, therefore,hot as being an agreement that could be reached quite apart from otheragreements, but as forming a portion of that more general agreement which was- [11375] f 2
ad:Sha-iobjeet of -the : Anglo-Fcengh cqmmiuiique,- and which. \formed the ;scope .ofthe conversations:-ia-vEerim.? mxtt scf blaodfs obsoi us Paul dorffw -.!;o&amp;ssS&amp;JlJ John ?S imon feared thatuthe t discussions: so, far; - friendly.,and. frank asthey :had. been, worer by no;, moans encouraging to the prospects of generalagreement. However that might be!, His Majesty&apos;s Governments idea was thatthe air pact would not stand by itself, but form part of the complex of agreements with which His Majesty&apos;s Government most firmly believed theultimate peaceful future of Europe to be bound up.BARON von NEURATH having interpolated during the translation thathe ^understood that Italy was not included, SIR JOHN SIMON explained thesituation as follows.   If one took the five Locarno Powers and made an agree-ment between them, it would, unless qualified, involve, inter alia, Britain assistingGermany against Italy and Italy Britain against France.tU UmWcL \     &apos;    So he thought that a protocol might be added to say that there would be nok^Qrdftn.   I   obligation upon^any signatory to assist another signatory unless theyfernae?(/\ j   signatory..was already under obligation to do so.&apos;.. HERR HITLER and BARON von NEURATH agreed.HERR HITLER said that the idea and proposal of the Air Pact had twoaspects.&apos;The first aspect was very clear and practical and could be realisedcomparatively easily. The German Government gave their wholehearted support to that&apos;aspect of the Pact. That was the Air Pact properly speaking. TheGerman Government also particularly liked the idea of the prohibition ofindiscriminate bombing of densely populated regions. The German government thought such indiscriminate bombing was in itself in absolute contradiction withthe Geneva Red Cross Convention, because women and children would be bombedeven if the attack was not accompanied by a gas attack.&apos;*&apos; The German Government were entirely in favour of the Air Pact proper and ready to! join it at any moment. For that reason they regretted that the BritishGovernment thought it necessary to subordinate the Air Pact to the realisation of an international settlement about air strengths.The German Government thought it particularly regrettable that the orderof priority contemplated by the British Government was first an international agreement on the limitation of air forces and only after that the conclusion ofan Air Pact.This order of priority was regrettable because the Air Pact itself was such a clear and practical proposal.Herr Hitler thought that the second aspect of the proposal, the limitation ofair forces, raised many difficult and complicated problems which it would takelong to settle.Further, it was regrettable that while the Air Pact was to be concluded by alimited number of nations, it was to be subordinated to general conditions whichwere quite outside the disposal of the signatories of the Air Pact.Herr Hitler gave the following example : vi In&apos; Order to have an Air Pact, it would be necessary to reach agreement onthe limitation of the air forces not only of the Locarno Powers but also respecting the .air-strengths of other countries quite outside. Now if Russia&apos;s air strengthwere to. be four times as great as at the moment, Germany would have to draw-consequences from that. Russia, moreover, was dependent on the Japanese air strength and, therefore, the British proposal really meant that a problem which applied to a limited territory and which was clear in itself would be subordinate to imponderables throughout the world..... Therefore the Chancellor regretted the order of priority in which the two proposals. were made.He.added that Germany might be very glad if an international settlement on air strengths could, be reached because even under the parity proposals she would.not be the strongest Power. He would be glad if such an agreement could include ^Powers outside the parity group, though he did not know if that wasreal Impossible.       , ,    r. t,j jon j^cjr^.  m.oow ^tvtoh uea.

If the Pact came first it would greatly improve the atmosphere for the parity agreement, for its existence would deprive air forcesof much of their value. The signatories of the Air Pact would be very contentif air armaments could be limited and financial burdens alleviated.        S&apos;He thought they should contemplate first the Air Pact and then, the air pact having deprived the air forces of some of their value, the countries wouldbe less opposed to reduction of air strengths.If parity could be realised among the signatories of the Air Pact, thosecountries might form the pacifying bloc from which a fresh effort to limit airstrengths might be made.SIR JOHN SIMON thanked the Chancellor for his clear explanation onthis very important point. What the Chancellor had said would be carefullystudied and considered. He did not think it quite correct to speak of an orderof priority for the idea contained in the London communique was simultaneousnegotiation. If there were some prospect of making progress on the. other subjects mentioned in the London communique it certainly would not be necessaryto postpone the Air Pact negotiations until everything else had been settled.,;..!The idea underlying the London communique was that a number of matters:should be pursued by discussion between the Governments. He agreed that theAir Pact was a simpler and limited conception because it only applied to five powers and the subject matter was simpler.There was one other observation he must make. He was very glad to,hear the Chancellor say that this opportunity should be used to promote together andwith other States the vitally important object of the prohibition of bombing:,,He had seen statements that the German Government and the Chancellorhimself favoured efforts to prohibit bombing. He would remind the GermanMinisters that the British proposal of March 1932 contained provisions directed to that object. It provided that the Permanent Disarmament Commission shouldtake up without delay the preparation of an agreement which would prohibitmilitary and naval aircraft; but at the same time it pointed out that that would never be possible unless there was adequate control of civil aircraft. yA similar reflection occurred to him about bombing. Undoubtedly civil and commercial machines as now constructed had a power of lift and range and :veryconsiderable speed; and in the nature of things were constructed to carry bombsas well as passengers.What was the German Government&apos;s view on this point?In England people were deeply concerned at the danger which alienationsmight be preparing for one another while the useful and peaceful service, pi theair was developed.He would like to know if the Chancellor when mentioning the restriction of bombing had considered how it could be secured that machines destined for civilian purposes could defeat the prohibition against bombing. -;ii&apos;Hi --fHERR HITLER said that he would first make an observation of principle.The reason why so many attempts to reach agreement had failed was&apos;1 becausenegotiators followed the practice of film companies which he understood was called &quot;block booking.&quot; Film companies tried to sell good and bad filmstogether. So also in international affairs the attempt was made to deal witheasy and difficult questions together. People seemed bent on getting all :orrnothing. The Chancellor preferred another method, namely, that which,&apos; whilebearing all questions in mind for ultimate settlement, tried for the moment onlyto achieve what was possible. This was the method which he thought-&apos; ought tobe followed. - n  - . noAs-regards air bombing, this, he said, was not a military question;/of technical possibilities, but a question of reaching international agreement7:bywbicli signatories would,, undertake not to use these technical possibilities&apos;; for ^nwataryJ urposes.ort Itrwa^d^ltilbvVhmhe&apos;r? uhlBss^dMl^avMiom&apos;was abolished-a^getfae^ooMli s&amp;M^mQU^b^tis&amp;a^m possibility &apos;6f use for militUrf

In the same way, in spite of the technical possibilityof using civil aircraft for military purposes, it would be possible to come to aninternational agreement not to do so. This might be achieved by some amendmentof the Red Cross Convention..! fi In this matter also they ought to aim at such agreement as was immediatelyrealisable. What might be achieved at once were : (1) the prohibition of theuse of gas and incendiary bombs; (2) the limitation of bombing to the fighting-zones; (3) possibly the complete prohibition of all bombardment from the air.This had nothing to do with technical possibilities, but could be the subject ofinternational agreements which would embody the will of the signatories.SIR JOHN SIMON said that he would report what the Chancellor had said to his colleagues. He would also consult with other Governments and perhaps, if the Chancellor allowed, communicate further with the GermanGovernment.CONCLUSION.SIR JOHN SIMON recalled that the conversations had opened with amutual promise to speak with frankness. This they had carried out. He thankedthe Chancellor for the opportunity he had had of meeting him personally and forthe way in which the British Ministers had been welcomed.But, observing the rule of frankness to the end, he must say that the british ministers did feel somewhat disappointed that it had not been possible in thesetwo days to get a larger measure of agreement. They regretted that such difficulties were thought to exist on the German side in connexion with some ofthe matters discussed. He did not in the least regret having come to Berlin. Hewas sure that this meeting was the best way of continuing this investigation intothe various points of view. What he regretted was that they had not been ableto do more in the direction of promoting the general agreement which he was sureboth sides wanted.It showed that these things were more difficult and complicated than manywell-wishers believed them to be from a distance. At the same time, he felt thatthey had gained very much by learning so frankly the point of view of the GermanGovernment; and he hoped that the German Government felt that it had beenvaluable to learn from the British Ministers the points on which they felt that difficulties in the way of agreement still lay.Mr. Eden and &quot;he would report to the British Government, who would continue to use their utmost efforts in the spirit of friendly co-operation.:The&apos;British Ministers were sincerely thankful for the way in which they hadbeen received in Berlin, and would take away very pleasant memories of thekindness&apos; and hospitality shown them.HERR HITLER wished to assure the British Ministers how happy he hadbeen to talk frankly with them. The gratitude of the German Government for the visit was&apos; shared by the German nation. The German Government were very muchgratified-by this opportunity of free and frank discussion.Herr Hitler was also grateful to the British Government for the loyal effortsthey had made in the matter of the Saar vote, and for all the other matters onwhich .  hey had adopted such a loyal and generous attitude to Germany.Herr Hitler thanked Sir John Simon in particular for the loyal attitude of anofficer of the Saar police, which had prevented a very dangerous situation; be referred to Major Hennessy.Herr Hitler had tried to give the British Ministers a sincere and frankpicture of what the German Government wanted and what were their views.He asked them to gather from that picture not that Germany was not readyto co-operate in bringing about European solidarity, But that Germany hoped to co-operate.
i&apos;; But he -hoped- the British Ministers i would&apos; have seen1 the-difficulty; roirtheGerman:(5wernment&apos;s&apos;position; they were- struggling;to lift up-a;country.whichhad lived during 16 years under moral depression;;.; They were trying to lift her to that level of equality where the other nations(were;&apos;&quot; &apos;b        iuubc.   ;J o&apos;iIn taking over the past from previous German Governments Herr hitler had decided to liquidate it honestly and sincerely. If he came into international agreements he would bring into them another Germany to that of the past 16years; otherwise the value of those agreements would be diminished.The German Government had in mind as an ultimate end not the establish-ment of a hegemony, which must always be a theory, but the establishment of a community of nations in which Germany would co-operate as an equal member.If some claims put forward by Germany seemed excessive, the british ministers must not forget that they had been discussing not a settlement for1935, but the solution of problems which would take long to settle and could onlybe settled in a distant future. -Without a fundamental revision of Germany&apos;s present position they couldnot find a solution of pending problems.Herr Hitler said that in his political life he was not a man who went in and out. At a certain moment he had regretted leaving the League, It was theardent desire of the German people and Government to be able to return to theLeague on conditions, however, which would render impossible the recurrence of a situation in which in order to re-establish germany&apos;s equality of status theymight be forced to withdraw again.The British Ministers should be convinced that many of the Germanobjections arose out of the feeling that if the present German Reich gave anundertaking, and freely gave it, it would be necessary for the Reich more strictlyto observe such an undertaking than any other State in order to restore the reputation-tion which had been lost in the last 16 years.Herr Hitler would not sign anything which he thought he could not accept;but if he gave an undertaking he would never break it.The communique was then drafted and appears as Annex I to these notes.(The meeting was then concluded.) .Annex I. -Communique. \The Anglo-German conversations conducted between the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, Sir John Simon, and the Lord Privy Seal,Mr. Anthony Eden, and the German Chancellor and the German Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, Baron von Neurath, in the presence of His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Sir Eric Phipps, and the German Commissioner, Herr . von ribbentrop, which have taken place during the last two days, were concludedto-night. The subjects under discussion were the matters set out in the london.Communique of the 3rd February. The conversations have been carried on inthe frankest and friendliest spirit, and have resulted in a complete clarification of the respective points of view. It was established that the aim of the policyof both Governments is to secure and strengthen the peace of Europe bypromoting international co-operation. Both the British and the German.Ministers are satisfied as to the usefulness of the direct conversations whichhave been taking place.Sir John Simon will leave Berlin by aeroplane to-morrow on his rdturn to:London,  while Mr. Eden will proceed as arranged to Moscow,  Warsawand Prague. i
