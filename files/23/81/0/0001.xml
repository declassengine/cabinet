2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.I.,9th January, 1935.(iii) The Convention now under consideration,however, is not one for disarmament,out for -one following two purposes:-(a) The regulation of the traffic in arms, so that an embargo,when it is decided on, can atonce he made effective:(b) In order that figures relatingto arms traffic and manufacturemay be published.(iv)  If the figures so returned are challenged,the Permanent Disarmament commission will charge itself with the matter andcommunicate with the parties concerned(who undertake to co-operate) so that areport may be issued with a viev/ to establishing the facts.In view of the importance of this question the Prime Minister suggested that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should formulate theabove propositions with precision and circulatethem at once, with a view to consideration at thenext weekly Meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet were reminded that the AmericanDraft Convention included no reference to thequestion of the grant of export credits for themanufacture of arms.      There was general agreement that this point ought to be dealt with in theLord Privy Seal&apos;s instructions on the subject.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should draft in precise languagethe propositions referred to above,and circulate them for consideration at the next weekly Meeting of the Cabinet,when any other points still outstandingwould also be dealt with.(b) That v\rhen the American Draft convention is discussed at Geneva,  the Lord privy seal should press other countries toadopt our own policy of refusing export credits for the manufacture of arms.
