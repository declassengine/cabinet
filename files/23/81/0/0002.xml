GERMAN RE-, ARMAMENT .(previous reference:Cabinet, 47(24)&quot;,&quot; Con-pi elusion 4.)FA,1. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to German Re-armamentt-A Report, by the Cabinet Committee on german Re-armament (0.P.-302 (34)),which had been tinder consideration atthe Meeting referred to in the margin:A Resume of a Conversation in Parisbetween **, Flandin, F. Laval andM. le&apos;ger, representing the FrenchGovernment, and Sir John Simon,Sir George Cleric and Mr Campbell(G.P.-303 (34)).The object of the Meeting was to consider further the attitude to be adopted during the forthcoming visit of M. flandin and M. Laval to London.&quot;?he Secretary of state for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the date had not yet been fixed, but was likely to be&apos;Monday, January 21st.Following the Rome precedent, the French ministers would probably arrange for two clear days in London.In view of the public importance attached to therecent Franco-Italian Conference in Rome it was important that the London Meeting should also producesome, result.Turning to C.P.-303 (34) he recalled that onthe occasion of his conversation at the Quai d&apos;0rsayon December 22nd f M. Laval had insisted on visitingRome before coming to London, but had conceded thatthe London visit should precede the negotiation ofthe Eastern Pact and other matters which will betaken up in combination, with, and not before, discus-a ion with Germany of an agreement about armaments.M. Laval had insisted also that the discussions should take on the wider aspects of a &quot;regime of security&quot;,    M. flandin and M. Laval, after retiringfor consultation in private, had admitted that theposition taken up by M. Barthou on the 17th Aprilcould no longer hold, and had given the impression
?that they would discuss German re-armament from a broader point of view.    Reports from Rome indicated that M. Laval was rather inclined to discuss thematter on the 1ines of the Italian proposals ofJanuary 31, 1934, which had been based rather on a recognition of the existing facts as to German re-armament .Turning to the Report of the ministerial committee on German Re-armament &apos;CP.-302 (34)),the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs drew attention to the decisions of the Cabinet quotedon pages 2 and 3, and pointed, out that Conclusions(a) and (b)  (in favour of an approach being made toFrance at the earliest possible moment but that weshould not at the present stage have detailed discussions with the Italians) had been carried out.Conclusion (c)  (i) and (ii), therefore, (in favour ofindueiner the French Government to face the actualfacts as to German re-armament and of taking thesituation vis-a-vis Germany as it is today) had probably been rendered obsolete owing to what had.happened, at Rome.   He then drew attention to(c) (iii) and (iv), which were reaffirmed by theCabinet. (See Conclusions.)In connection with (c)Civ) (where it issuggested that recognition of Germany * s re-armamenthas become inevitable) the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs called attention to a Protocolaccepted by M. Laval and S. Mussolini, in whichthe French and. Italian Governments, referring tothe declaration on equality of rights of December 11,19 32, agreed &quot;That no country can modify by uni-lateral act its obligations in the matter of arma-ments, and that in the case of this eventualitybeing established they should cons tilt each, other&apos;&apos;&apos;.-2-
We had already made representations of this natureprivately to Germany, and. he proposed now to informFranc e a cc ord ingly.The Prime Minister said that we could now come out into the open in this .Referring to Conclusion (c)(v) (as to the line to be taken if the French Government should point out.that Germany had in fact succeeded, by a policy ofblackmail) the Secretary of State thought it probablethat this had been covered by the Rome Conversations.He suggested that Conclusion (vi) referred to a later stage of negotiations, when Germany would be bargainingabout the disarmament figures, and need, not be raised in the Conversations with the French Ministers.He passed over Conclusion (vii) without comment.Referring to Conclusion (viii) he thought a decision was necessary as to whether British Ministers should raise with the French Representatives the suggestionthat if a Convention can be negotiated at Geneva onthe proposed lines, it should be on the clear under-standing that it would replace only those Clauses ofPart V of the Treaty of Versailles which are directly affected.   .A decision was also required as to whether we should, raise with the French Ministers the questionof what action we should take if Germany was notprepared, to accept the suggestions put forward.   he did not discuss Conclusion (x), dealing with thepossibility of arranging by international agreement for a system of armaments inspection -  which had formed the subject of discussion at the Cabinet thesame morning.Passing on to paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of CP.-308(34), the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the order of events he contemplatedwas, first, to settle with France the terms on which-3-
she would concede equality of status to Germany:next, to get Italy to agree:    ana then to induceGermany to accept those terms:    our own particularconcern beins Germany&apos;s return to the League andsome limitation of her armaments.Passing to paragraph 8 (c) (a suggestionthat Germany should be asked to accept a limitation to the figures given in the German Memorandum of the16th April, plus some undertaking regarding theGerman NavyJ he thought that Germany was no longerlikely to agree, for the reason that she was now known to possess bombing aeroplanes.   Referring to paragraph 8 (d)  (Germany to join in the declaration in regard to Austria) he recalled that events had&apos;moved, on a good deal since that was written.Turning to paragraph 10 of CP,-302 (34)(where it is suggested that our first object shouldbe to try and set France to regard Germany *s aoces-sion to an Eastern Pact, or its equivalent, and thereturn of Germany to the League and the DisarmamentConference as satisfying her conceptions of security)the Secretary of State commented that we should atthat point probably be brought up against a demand bythe French for some   British contribution towardssecurity.   That was probably what was bringingM. Laval to London:    and in this connection he recalled that M. Laval, in voicing his delight at theBritish decision in regard to the Saar,. had expressedsurprise that we had asked for nothing in return.The Secretary of State then drew attentionto paragraphs 12 and 13, in the latter of which isset forth the sort of contributions which the UnitedKingdom might possibly make towards European andFrench security, all of which would primarily&apos;bemeasures to - obtain British, security,   taking these in turn, in regard to (a) (an interpretation of
Locarno), he -said that, so far as he could see,: theproposal that &quot;a flagrant invasion of, or attack upon, the territory of Belgium, Would automaticallyhe considered by Great Britain as an unprovokedact of aggression requiring Great Britain to comeImmediately to the help of Belgium.......n did notappear to add to our obligations under theTreaty of Locarno, since we ourselves would remain the judge of whether the aggression was &quot;flagrant&quot;.The only new factor would be that if we did judge the aggression to be &quot;flagrant&quot; we should, undertaketo come in automatically.The Secretary of State for Air urged, that out ofthese negotiations we should obtain the neutralisationof Belgium and. Holland.   We had nothing else to gain from the negotiations.The Prime Minister quoted the precedent of 1872.At a later stage of the discussion it was pointedout that the Treaty of Locarno applied to Prance jxistas much as to Belgium.   The French Ministers, therefore,might insist that our interpretation should, apply toFrance also.   This would not be popular.   If, however,we could get Germany to guarantee Belgian neutrality,as suggested by the Secretary of State for Air, thiswould be a new factor which might justify a newdeclaration to the British people.^he Prime Minister agreed that this was a point to be considered in connection with the Secretaryof State for Air&apos;s proposal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscontinued that paragraph IS (b) was merely a re-affirmation that the demilitarisation of the Rhinelandwas a vital British interest.Paragraph (c) was a suggested declaration of a&quot;British Monroe Doctrine&quot; to the effect thatGreat Britain would consider any attempt to interfere
with the independence or integrity of Belgium tobe dangerous to her- peace and. security .   Be drewfoot-attention to the/note as to Holland.The suggestion in (d), that violations of the frontiers of Belgium and France under the locarno treaty were considered, to apply equally to violationsby air as well as by land went no further than (a) .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat certain further considerations that had occurred since the Report of the Cabinet Committee (C.P.-302(54)) had been incorporated by him in a further Memo-randum which he had hesitated to circulate at short-notice, but which the Prime Minister asked him to circulate before the next Meeting of the Cabinet.The Prime Minister asked, that this memorandum should contain the principal points to be discussed with the French Government.   Certain points had alreadybeen agreed to, and there would be a number of doubtfulones to be considered, such as those raised in G.P.*^02(34), paragraph 13,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs asked,if France would be content with a statement that wewould intervene if our own vital interests required it.He thought that public opinion was not ready for anything further than this.^he Prime Minister suggested that great caremust be taken that we did not put ourselves  in a posltdknwhere the French were able to bring Great Britain into action automatically as it were by pressing a lever.mhe Secretary of State for TUar suggested that atthis early stage we ought not to enter on discussions on the basis that Great Britain ought to make any contribution at all.   The arrangements which it was proposed to invite the French, and afterwards theItalians, to join in suggesting to Germany were as-6-
much in the interests of Prance as of ourselves.What right, then, had Prance to ask or expect conces-sions from us, when they were gaining as much as wewere?   We should make our propositions in the form of consultation with partners who had a common interestwith ourselves.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was inclined to agree.The Secretary of State for the Colonies- pointedout that our position was different from what it hadbeen in the past, owing to the fact that we were re-&apos;**arming.    France knew that, when it came to action,we were likely to do more than we were able to promise.The President of the Board of Education agreed,and pointed out that this was borne out. by the resultof our attitude on the Saar.He agreed with the suggestion of the Secretary ofState for War, and laid, emphasis on certain acid testsas to German bona-fides, such as their willingness toenter into an Fastern Pact and the proposed guarantees of Austrian independence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer compared thesituation vis-a-vis Germany with the position vis-a-visJapan in the recent Naval negotiations.    So long asthe ratio had been maintained, Japan was unwilling todiscuss, but the moment conversations took place on adifferent basis to the ratio her attitude was moreforthcoming.    Re thought some similar attitude mightbe adopted towards Germany, namely, to enquire whatwould be their requirements in a Disarmament Conven-tion if equality of rights were conceded.The Prime Minister said, that the Cabinet would bein a better position to discuss this question whenthey received the Paper by the Secretary of St-ate forForeign Affairs.
The Cabinet- agreed  (a) That the British Representatives atthe forthcoming Conference with theFrench Prime Minister and ForeignMiniate^   should be  -&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister,mhe Lord. President of the Council,&quot;&quot;he Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,who would carry on negotiations, andif anything should arise which requiredconsultation either with, the Cabinet orany particular Minister, would, actacc ordingly:(b) That the quest ion should be further discussed by the Cabinet on Monday next, January 14th, at 4 p.m., whenthe Cabinet should consider further the line to be taken in the Oonversa-tions with the French Ministers:(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in the interval should circulate the^e-u^thgr Memorandum to which he had(d) That the following Conclusions reached by the Cabinet at their Meeting held onDecember IS, 1934, should, be reaffirmed,namely(c)(.iii) In developing the question ofGermanyTs return to the League,we should put forward our viewthat f while we do not in anyway condone Germany&apos;s action in leaving the League, we can.conceive of no real basis forthe establishment and. maintenanceof peace in Europe so long as germany remains otrtside.( iv) The point should be made that weare fully convinced of the illegality of Germany&apos;s re-armament,but it is considered, to havereached the stage when its recognised -nition has become inevitable,and to press strongly the point that it is far better that this -armament should be controlledthan that it should remain uncon-trolled .(e) That at their next Meeting the cabinet should consider,  inter alia, whetherthe following points in their previousdecisions of December 13th should, beraised, at the meeting with, the french ministers:-&quot;(viii) If a Convention can be nego-tiated at Geneva on the lines suggested, above, it is on the clear understanding that itwill only replace those Clauses
of Part V of the Treaty ofVersailles which are directly affected.   This would mean, forexample, that the Clause dealingwith the Demilitarized Zoneswould not be a matter for dis-cuss ion.(ix) The possibility ....... thatGermany will not be preparedto accept the suggestionsput forward .....(f) That the question should be further considered of including within thescope of the negotiations an inter-national declaration that the SignatoryPowers would respect the neutralisationof Belgium and Holland:(g) That the various points on which adecision was still required shouldbe set forth by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs in a further memorandum he intended to circulate tothe Cabinet.

The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to a Trade Agreement with. India onthe subject of Indian Protective Duties:-A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (C.P.-1 (35)) explain-ing the provisions of the Agreement,which was supplementary to the mainOttawa Agreement, and pointing out its value to this country:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor India (C.P.-4 (35)) containing hiscomments on the Agreement, with special reference to the present 25% duty on british cotton goods Imported intoIndia, and pointing out that theViceroy and his Council were facedwith real and. serious revenue diffi-culties which might make it impossiblefor them to reduce the duty this year.After hearing a statement by the Secretary ofState for India, in which he mentioned that the-President of the Board of Trade had just signed theAgreement, the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of State forIndia to inform the Viceroy that, froma home political point of view, they attached, great importance to a reductionin the duty on cotton goods, and to ask him to do his utmost to secure this .If, however, he was unable to secure animmediate reduction, owing to thefinancial situation in India, he should obtain a statement by the Government ofIndia that they would make the reductionas soon as the financial position permitted,

The Minister of labour informed the Cabinetthat the Unemployment Insurance Statutory Committee,set up by the Unemployment Insurance Act, 19 34, was required by Section 20 of that Act to give immediate consideration to the question of the insurance ofAgriculture against unemployment,   ^he Committee had heard evidence from all the interests concerned, andhad made a unanimous Report, which submitted a definitescheme of insurance.    It was important that theCabinet should come to an early decision with regardto these proposals.   If it were decided to proceedwith them, the time-table would be a matter ofconsiderable importance.    He asked, therefore, forthe immediate appointment of a Cabinet, Committee toconsider the matter urgently and report.The Cabinet agreed  That the Report of the UnemploymentInsurance Statutory Committee, setup by the Unemployment Insurance Act,1934, on the question of the insurance of Agriculture against Unemployment,should be referred, immediately to aCabinet Committee composed as follows:-sThe Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs ,&quot;Tie Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Agriculture and.Fisheries,The Minister of Labour,The First Commissioner of Works.56The Chancellor of&quot; the Exchequer onlyundertook to, serve, -on this Committeeon the und-erstanding that he could berepresented&quot; by the Financial Secretaryto the Tpeasurv.2, Whitehall Gardens, S,^.l,January 9, 1935.
