MACAO. 1. The Cabinet had before their the following documents on the subject of the Japanese offer to theGovernment of the Portuguese Colony o^ Macao to buy alarge concession there,  including the development o^ anew port:-A Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.P.-68  (35)), furnishedin accordance with the conclusion referred to in the margin, reviewing the strategic, political and economic implications of the Japanese o^fer,which were closely inter-locked.The Chiefs of Staff had reached theconclusion that it would be to ourgreat disadvantage  on all grounds that. Japan should obtain any con-trolling interests  in Macao, and asa result o^ consultations with theForeign Office and Colonial Officethey submitted for consideration thatin the first instance TTis Majesty&apos;sGovernment might review the possibilityof an approach to the Portuguese Govern-.  ment, with a view to that government itself taking steps to prevent theintrusion of Japanese Interests inthe Macao Concession:A telegram ^rom the Governor o^ Hong-Kong to the Secretary, of State for theColonies, dated March 15, 1935, togetherwith a Note prepared in the Colonial&apos;   Office (C.P.-67 (35)), both of whichhad been under consideration by theChiefs  of Staff Sub-Committee.A view was expressed that, on the commercialside, the more the question had. been looked into theless was the disadvantage found to be.    Coasting trade would merely pass up the coast and the river.    Tranship-ment trade was still likely to come to Hong-Kong owingto the immensely superior facilities of all kinds-  and,even if a harbour capable of taking 5,000-ton ships were created at Macao it would, not suffice to divert-much trade.    In addition, Hong-Kong had the advantageo^ railway communication from Kowloon with Canton,The importance o^ the question, however, from the strategical side was recognised, but it was felt thatour present information was rather inadequate.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(35), Con-clusion 3.)Report 0-pChiefs p-pStaf-p Sub-Committee .
The Cabinet agreed  Thar  the Secretary of State &quot;&quot;or ForeignAffairs should brine the matter to theattention of the Portuguese Ambassador,saying that we had no adequate&quot;-information on the subject and enquiring whetherthe Portuguese Government had definite information as to any approach byJapanese interests and what action they had in mind.    It was suggested-that emphasis should be laid on thedanger of th- proposal to Portugueseinterests  in Macao rather than to ourselves .

The Cabinet had. before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for dominion Affairs and theSecretary of State ^or the Colonies (C.P.-5P (35)).pointing out that the hope expressed in the Gone lbs ionreferred to in the margin,  that the New Hebrides Condo-minium Administration would again be self-supporting by1934, had not been realised,  and stating that in thecircumstances they saw no real alternative to proposing a further postponement,       the question of an approachfo the French Government for the purpose o* ending theCondominium0   They accordingly invited, their colleagues to agree i (i) That,  in view of the fact that the new hebrides Condominium Administration isnot at. present self-supporting, and the uncertainty as to when its finances willbe rehabilitated,  the question of an approach to the French Government forthe purpose of terminating the british -French Condominium in the New Hebridesbe further postponed,  Say until 1939,unless a particularly opportune occasion for reviewing the question should occursooner:    andCii) ^hat the Commonwealth and New zealand governments be informed accordingly.The Cabinet, while agreeing that the presentsituation was unsatisfactory, accepted, theview that there Was no alternative in thecircumstances to the above proposals,which were approved.f^he Parliamentary Under-Secretary, ForeignOffice, withdrew.)

As the contero-plated discussion on the subject, with the Prime Ministerof the Commonwealth might lead, to the Government being in some measure committed in respect of certain of therecommendations which involved inter-Governmentalco-operation, the Secretary o* State thought the Cabinet-should take note of the Report, and especially o-p therecommendations on pages 73-74, numbered (2),  (3),  (7),(8),  (9)  and (10).&quot;&quot;he Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the Report of the Interdepartmental Committeehad been sent to all the Dominions, but as yet onlyNew Zealand had replied.
