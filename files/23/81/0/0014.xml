Dominion Appeals to Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.

(Previous Reference: Cabinet 72 (31). Conclusion 4.)

1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (C.P.-54 (35)) relating to Irish and Canadian Petitions coming before the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on March 18th, concerning the Prerogative of His Majesty to grant special leave of appeal from the Courts of a Dominion, and raising the political issue which might arise if the Attorney-General should be called upon by the Judicial Committee to express the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government.

(The Lord Chancellor withdrew from the Cabinet Room during the discussion of this item as he was presiding over the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the Appeal known as the ?rne Fishery case.)

The Cabinet then discussed the question at issue with the Attorney-General, who stated that he had received a report that Lord Atkin had intimated, that the Judicial Committee would later wish to have information as to the views of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom. He himself could not see how such views could be relevant to the question of law which the Judicial Committee had to decide, and he felt confident that the real  intention of the Judicial Committee was only to invite his assistance on the legal and constitutional issues involved. On being asked as to whether he wished to receive any instructions from the Cabinet, the Attorney-General made clear that he would prefer to have no instructions and to be left with a free hand to exercise his own jud?ment if he were consulted by the Judicial Committee. 
mhe Cabinet took note that if the Attorney-General was asked by the Judicial Committee forhis assistance in this appeal, he would o^e^ suchhelp as seemed, proper as a lawyer dealing with thelegal issue, and that no declaration       the view ofthe Government on any political question was involved.    In these circumstances the cabinet agreed  That no instructions should begiven to the Attdrhey-General(^he A11 orney-G enera 1 withdrew .)-la-

Government p&apos; INDIA BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 12(35) , Con-clns ion 9 .)fit.mm -35 (35)5:4. The Secretary of State for India made a verbalreport to the Cabinet . on     the present position ofthe difficulties raised by the Indian States inconnection with the Government of India Bill,    He hadreceived from those Indian Princes who had taken theleading part in raising these difficulties, particulars of their criticisms of the Bill, together with covering letter.    He had (through the Viceroy)obtained permission from the signatories for thepublication of the letter and enclosure, and theirpermission had been accompanied by x Private letter^(which *ould not be published)  of a somewhat apologeticcharacter,    The tendency of the Princes had been torake up every kind,    of difficulty, including matters that had been settled long ago at the Round &quot;ableConference, and undue importance had been attached todetails that/were a mere matter of drafting.    Inaddition,  the Princes had made demands on the questionof paramountcy, with which the Bill did not deal.After consultation with/members  of the Joint Select. ,Committee and after getting in touch (with the approvalof the Princes) with their leading Counsel in London,he thousht  i4&quot;  probable tha4&quot;  the majority of the points raised could be met by drafting amendments withoutaffecting the substance of the Bill ,   T-Te also proposedto send a full answer to the Viceroy,  in which he wouldmake clear that most  of the points coul^ b^ met bydrafting^ and would express regret that questions ofparamountcy had been raised,  as they had nothing to do with the Government of India Bill and ought to bediscussed independently of that measure.    nhe Secretaryof State made It clear that the amendments proposed would not be in the nature of concessions on points of g-ufe-s-fca-a^e--, but only in order to make
quite clear to the Princes what was  intended.    Forexample,  on the question of the method of accessionhe intended to stand quite firm.   Pad there been more time he would have consulted, the Cabinet Committeeon the details of what he proposed to publish, butfor political reasons it was essential that the newWhite Paper should, be issued, not later than Friday,March 15th,  and he asked the Cabinet to leave thevery technical issues involved in his letter to theViceroy to himself and his advisers.After discussion of various details, the cabinet a gr e e d.  (a) To authorise the Secretary of State forIndia to publish a white Paper containingdetails  of the demands by the IndianPrinces, together with the letter coveringthose demands, as well as his reply,conceived on the lines he had mentioned tothe Cabinet, which are summarised above:fb) &quot;hat, whatever the att itude 0* the IndianPrinces, the Pill must he proceeded, with,and. it must be made clear that the Pillwas  drafted on merits and was not designedto please any particular sections  in India.,although drafting modifications could bemade to facilitate acceptance,  on the&apos;  understanding that no question o-&quot; substancewas surrendered :fc) &quot;hat the Secretary of State for india should, have full discretion,  in consults,-tion with his advisers, to settle theterms oT&quot; the letter to the Viceroy replying to the points raised by the Indian Princes,which would be published, together with the communication from the Princes,
g COTTONpXfjWTNGflPNNPANCYoposedill.PreviousKeferenc e:Cabinet 8(55),  Con-clusion 10.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board, of Trade (C.P.-50 (35))asking authority to proceed, with the drafting of aBill, for submission to the Committee of Home Affairs,to give effect to the Cotton Spinning Red/undancyScheme,    &quot;he Bill would cover the establishment o&quot;p aBoard to administer the scheme, with powers to collecta leAry imposed, on all spindles, to raise loans on thesecurity of the levy, and to buy and sell spindles:and. roust also provide for a Government guarantee.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that, although many o^ the spindles that would be disposed, of unde^ the scheme would have been out ofaction for years, nevertheless there was nothing inthe scheme to prevent a manufacturer who was runninghis business at a loss from closing his works and.offering the spindles to the Board,    &quot;he workersthereby thrown out of employment would then have a grievance,  on the ground that Government resources were being used for purposes  of a guarantee which,would apply in certain circumstances, but that no government resources  (other than the ordinary provisionof Insurance and Assistance) were available to guarantee the position of the workers suddenly thrown out ofemployment.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the President of the 1-1 oardof Trade to proceed with the drafting o41a Bill,  for submission to the Committeeof Home Affairs, to give effect to theCotton Spinning Redundancy Scheme:(b) ^o accept a proposal, made verbally bythe President o^ the Board pf Trade,that he should consult Lord Colwyn&apos;sCommittee with a view to securing,  ifpossible, that arrangements should bemade for a.pplying the scheme on a pro-grossive basis,  in order to avoid therisk of causing apprehension among workingpeople lest they shoul^ be thrown out  ofemployment without warning:
(6.) To give&apos; no &quot;undertaking to provideschemes  cp work in time to absorbpersons thrown out of employment as the result  of the Scheme, butto take note of a suggestion madein the course of the discussion that,if possible, the introduction of theBill should be timed to coincide withany announcement that the government might find it possible to make as theresult of the explorations  of theGeneral Purposes Committee forutilising Government resources  forthe creation of additional employment.
6. &quot;he Cabinet had before them the Report  (0.P.-49(35))  of the Cabinet Committee on the National HealthInsurance and Contributory Pensions Bill, which hadbeen appointed at the Meeting mentioned in the margin.Attached to the Report was a Memorandum summarising the questions examined by the Committee, and fiveseparate Memoranda elaborating them and makingsuggestions for their solution.    In view of theirlength, both the questions and the recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee thereon are reproduced in theAppendix t. o thes e 0 one 1 us ions .On Conclusion I (?.)  of the Appendix, the cabinet were reminded that  the increase in contributions dueto take place on the 1st January, 1936, would haveto be taken into careful consideration in connectionwith agricultural labour.On Conclusion II (s.) attention was called to thefact that under the scheme submitted by the minister^ Health and the Department o-c Health for Scotland&apos;C,P.-49 (35),  page 4, Para, B (b), a person continu-ously insured for not less  than ten years whose insur-ance was bein^ kept in force from year to year would not,  during such prolongation, be entitled tomaternity benefit, which,  it was stated, was a particularly popular form of benefit,   &quot;he cabinet were informed, however, that there was no questionof deprivation of maternity benefit, but only of notrestoring it - after it had already been lost, and that from this point of view medical benefit was generallypreferred to maternity benefit, as being more generally applicable .After examining the whole Memorandum in detail,the Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the proposals of the CabinetCommittee as summarised in the appendix to these Conclusions:
(b) That when the draft Bill was submittedto the Cabinet they should considerthe date at which if could best beintroduced from a political pointo^ view.
7.    No discussion took place on the subjectImperial Defence Policy, and the Cabinet agreedmh^t the question should no longerremain as a continuing item on theCabinet Agenda Paper.
UATEMPIOYMENtINSURANCE for agriculture.Second Reportof OabinetCororoitt ee.[previous reference:Cabinet 12(35), Con-conclusion ion 10 .)p. &quot;he Cabinet had. before there a Second Report(&apos;C.P,-52 ^35)) by the Cabinet Committee on Unemploy-ment Insurance for Agriculture, dealing with thequestion referred to them at the Meeting mentionedin the margin, viz.,  the practicability of securing that the necessary legislation should be passed sothat contributions should commence not later thanJuly,  and also the rates 0* contribution and benefit-to be adopted.    mhe Conclusions and. Recommendationssubmitted, by the Committee to the Cabinet were asfollows :-&quot;(l) It is unlikely that the necessary legis-lation can in present circumstances be passed, to provide for the commencement ofcontributions at a date prior to the 1stSeptember, 1935, at the earliest.    In-order, therefore, to secure that paymentof benefit should begin early in thecoming Winter, it falls to be consideredwhat alteration should be made in thebenefit conditions and whether any defici-ency as compared with six months contribu-tions can be provided from the Exchequer&apos;we submit this for the consideration ofthe Cabinet .(2) mhe scales of benefit proposed by the. -Statutory Committee appear to us undulylow, having regard to the amounts whichunemployed agricultural workers are nowreceiving by way of relief,    A scale ofbenefit which is so low that it must, ina great number of cases be supplementedfrom the rates cannot be regarded as asatisfactory insurance scheme from thepoint of view,  inte-&quot; alia,  of the main-tenance of the contributory principle.For these reasons the scales of benefitsuggested by the Statutory Committeeshould not be adopted.&quot;Attached to the Report was a liable setting out threescales  of benefit based upon contributions of 4d.(the Statutory Committee&apos;s recommendation), 4^d.and 5d. per week respectively.    mhe 4d. rate of contribution not being a practicable one politically,the Committee sought Cabinet authority to examine in further detail the choice between the two alter-native schemes based upon the 4%d. and 5d. ratesrespect ively,
^he Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated thathe did not rule out the possibility of the provisionfrom the Exchequer of funds to make up the deficiencyreferred to above in (l) ,  provided, that a satisfactory scheme was  evolved.In the course of the discussion cowment was madeon the proposed Unemployment Insurance for- Agriculturefrom the point  of view of the increase in medical^payments loth by the farmer an^ the labourer &apos; SeeCone Ins Ion 6):    the danger of increasing the burdentoo much:    the importance of not bringing the benefitstoo close to wages:    the danger of eliminatinginducement to work: the increasing dislike of thescheme in Scotland:    and. the bearing on the schemeof the new Unemployment Assistance Regulations,mhe Cabinet agreed  &quot;o authorise the Committee to examine in further detail the choice betweenthe two alternative schemes of contri-buttons based, upon 4-g-d, and 5d, ratesrespectively, but to invite the Committeeto take into consideration the variouswide-1&quot; comments referred to above.
