Payments to unemployed Territorial Soldiers.

(Previous Reference: Cabinet 19 (35). Conclusions 8.)

8. With reference to the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before them at Memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C.P.-78 (35)) relating to payments in respect of unemployment to Territorial soldiers taking part in Jubilee Celebrations on May 6th or alternative days. The Memorandum stated that it was understood that the Unemployment Assistance Board did not propose to have regard to anything which the Territorials might receive by way of Army pay and allowances for such duties when determining allowances under the Unemployment Assistance Act. In the case of Territorials in receipt of Unemployment Benefit, however, the benefit conditions would not be satisfied if they were attending a parade during the Jubilee celebrations, but as the result of consultations between the War Office and the Ministry of Labour it had been arranged that the War Office would make good to the man the unemployment benefit he lost.  After describing the machinery by which the payment would be made in such cases, with which the Treasury had agreed, the Minister of Labour proposed, subject to cabinet approval, to take the course indicated, so as to ensure that Territorials attending parades shall receive the amounts to which they would, otherwise have been entitled, in addition to their army pay and allowances.

The Cabinet agreed -

(a) To approve the above arrangements in respect of unemployment payments to Territorial soldiers taking part in Jubilee Celebrations on May 6th or alternative days:

(b) That similar arrangements should be made for corresponding cases arising in respect of Royal Wavy or Royal  Air Force personnel.
