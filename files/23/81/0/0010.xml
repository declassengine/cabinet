Tn Despatches annexed to the memorandum the Figh Commissioner now sought additional permission for the use of tear gas by the Police Force indealing with bandits who entrenched themselves incaves in the mountainous country or conceivably ina building in some small and isolated village, wherethere would be a serious risk of casualties being incurred by the Police Force if they we^e unable touse gas and had to rely on other weapons,     mheSecretary o^ State considered that this permissionmight reasonably be granted, and proposed, if theCabinet approved, to inform the Figh Commissioner inthis sense.After considering the proposal carefully in thelight of Indian experience, as well as  of localconditions  in Palestine,  the Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary o^ State for theColonies should, be empowered toauthorise the Figh^Oommiss ionei&quot; topermit the use of/gas by the police force in circumstances such as dealingwith banditry, where there is a serxousrisk of casualties being incurred bythe Police Force if the Police were unable to use gas and had to rely on other weapons.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Scotland (C-.P--40 (35))stating that, since the publication of the Housing(Scotland) Bill, representations regarding the ratingof unoccupied property had been made by. bondholdersand property owners (mainly from areas in the west of Scotland.) which had much impressed the Government&apos;ssupporters in Parliament.    Owners&apos; rates are payable on unoccupied house property in Scotland, whereas  inEngland there is no corresponding liability,    Thedecrowding provisions  of the Bill would eventuallyresult in one and two-apartment houses being leftwithout tenants.   This would be offset to some extent-through readjustments  of occupation, but a considerablenumber o^ small houses would become unoccupied, and.there appeared to be some unfairness  in continuing to charge rates on such empty houses,    mlie particularpoint would be met by the inclusion in the Bill of aprovision exempting from owners&apos; rates unoccupiedhouses  of one and two-apartments.    mhe Secretary -ofState desired, authority to include this provision inthe Bill.   Before the Bill reached Committee, however,he proposed to consult with representatives of theLocal Authorities  on the matter.While recognising that the question involved anumber of difficulties,  the Cabinet agreed -mo authorise the Secretary of State forScotland to consult with representa-tives of the Local Authorities before theinclusion in the Bill of a provision^exempting from owners&apos;  rates unoccupiedhouses  of one and two-apartments.
