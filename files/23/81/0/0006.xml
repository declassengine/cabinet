1, The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that since the formation of the National Government it hadbeen the habit of the Leaders of the three political parties represented in the Cabinet to meet, togetherinformally and occasionally to talk over the politicaloutlook in the light of developments, in the interestsof close co-operation.     They had frequently had discussions on proposals for the establishment of aCabinet system analogous to that of the War Cabinet,They had unanimously rejected this proposal, for reasons which would probably be in the minds of all his colleaguesThey had, however, come to the conclusion that it wouldbe useful to have a small body to co-ordinate the workof the Cabinet and discuss matters which did not belongonly to one Government Department.   Without suggesting that an early General Flection was in the least likely,it had to be remembered that a General Flection mustoccur in due time, and the policy of the national government ought to be determined in advance.   What theycontemplated was not exactly an ordinary Committee ofthe Cabinet, but primarily the recognition by the cabinet of the consultations of the heads of the Parties repre-sented in the Government.   &quot;&quot;he new body would worksomewhat on the lines of the Committee of ImperialDefence:    that is to say, it would have a nucleus of regular members drawn from the three Parties, to which,it was proposed to add the Leader of the Rouse of Lords,in order that he might not only be informed of therecommendations of the Committee, but take part in thediscussions when these recommendations were being con-sidered.   Tie new body, like the Committee of ImperialDefence, would have no executive authority, but would,be charged rather with making recommendations on questloreof policy, of which a large number require^ consideration at the present time.   As in the case of the Committee of
Imperial Defence, it was proposed that Ministers whowere not part of the permanent nucleus hut who had some special concern in the subject of discussion,whether for Departmental or other reasons, should beinvited to attend, and that the recommendations onthese subjects should be made with their full knowledge and consent.    If the Committee was to function success-fully and in a businesslike manner,  it must be small.This also would facilitate its meeting more frequentlythan could a large body.   When the General purposes committee had a recommendation to make to the Cabinetthe Prime Minister proposed that it should appear as thefirst item on the Cabinet Agenda, in order that there might be time for its proper discussion by the Cabinet.After discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, as an experiment, the following ministers -The Prime Minister The Lord President     The Secretary(in the Chair). of the Council.       of State forThe Secretary of The Chancellor of       Foreign AffairsState for d orpin- the Exchequerion Affairs. , The Presidentof the Boardof Tra.de,The Secretary of State for war, as leader of the House of Lords -should, for purposes of consultation andco-ordination of business, form thepermanent nucleus of an advisory andconsultative General Purposes commit-tee to consider questions of government policy which do not fall solely withinthe scope of any single Department, and.with authority to submit to the Cabinetreports and recommendations:(b) That other members of the Cabinet who might be specially concerned, whether for Departmental or other reasons, inthe subjects taken up by the Committee,should be invited to attend for theconsideration of such questions:-S-
(c) That members of the Cabinet who didnot form part of the permanent nucleus of the Committee should have the rightto suggest subjects for the Committee!consideration:(d) That reports and recommendations fromthe General Purposes Committee shouldbe considered by the Cabinet as thefirst item on the Agenda Paper:(e) That the Committee should form a continuing item on the Agenda Paper,in order to give the Chairman anopportunity, when this was deemed necessary,  to report progress:(f) That the experiment should be reviewedlater if necessary.
-THE BOLIVIA-PARAGUAYDISPUTE.Arms Emb ar corporation previous reference&apos;Cabinet SO(34), Con-elusion 3.)P   mhe secretary of state for Foreign affairs recalled that on the *iet November last the Assemblyof the League of Nations had adopted a Report providing,inter alia,  for the setting up of an Advisory Committee,consisting of representatives of 25 States, to considerdevelopments in the Belivia-Paraguay dispute, and alsoto advise as regards questions arising in connectionwith the arms embargo.   This Committee met recentlyat Geneva, and, in a Report adopted on the 16th January,recommended that the embargo on the supply of armsshould, not continue to be in force against Bolivia,though it would still be in force against Paraguay.It was already rumoured that certain nations had raised the embargo and were arranging to supply Bolivia witharms.   His suggestion was to inform the Advisory Committeethat we were prepared to accept and intended to carryout their recommendations;    otherwise British trade would suffer an unfair handicap.The, President of the Board of Trade mentioned that one application had been received, on the previous day for a licence to export arms to Bolivia,The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the Cabinet that on the previous day he had circulated a Memorandum on this subject (C.P.-36 (35))which raised other matters in addition to the raising of the embargo, and which he hoped, would be considered,at the next Meeting of the Cabinet.   He warned theCabinet, however, that if the embargo was raised againstBolivia it might prove impossible, owing to the actionof other countries, to maintain it against Paraguay,After weighing the advantages and disadvantages ofthis proposal, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to informthe Secretariat-General at Geneva that
His Ma ;j es ty&apos; s G overnment wereprepared to accept, and. intendedto carry out   the recommendationsof the Advisory Committee not tocontinue the enforcement of the embargo against Bolivia:(b) That the other questions raised in CP.-36 ( 35) &apos;should be considered at the next weekly Meeting of theCabinet,
GFRMAW RE-ARMAMENT .Forthe owingDisc us f- ionspith French&apos;Minis ters .(previous reference:Cabinet 4(7-5), Con-6insion 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following papers, prepared in connection with the forthcoming discussions with French Ministers:-.A Memorandum (CP,.-19 (35)) revisingCP.-6 (35) in the light of Cabinet&apos;3 (35), Conclusion 1:A Report prepared by the Foreign Officeand the three Defence Services (C ,P,-r33(35)) containing recommendations as tothe maximum armed forces of all kindsto which, having regard to our own security, we should, be prepared toagree that the Germans should obtainif by so doing we could secure ageneral settlement:A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, dated&apos; January 85, 1935,circulated direct to members of theCabinet by the Foreign Office, informing the Cabinet as to further steps that hadbeen taken as the result of consultation between the Prime Minister, the lord president of the Council and the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs in preparation for the Meeting wi*h the French Ministers.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs    inexplaining the origin of the latter Note, drew theattention of his colleagues to a draft formulatransmitted to Paris in telegram No.18 Saving, and analternative draft formula suggested by the FrenchGovernment (Paris telegram No. 12, of the 87th January),together with subsequent telegraphic correspondence onthe subject.   The last telegram, received during the night, indicated that- the French Government might be approaching more nearly to our point of view.    In reply-to a question as to whether Germany might not treatthis formula as another attempt by the Powers to askher to sign, as it were, &quot;on the dotted line&quot;, he explained, that if discussions were to take place with france some basis was necessary, and it had been deemedbest to let the French Government know in advance that   (I1we had a definite view.    It was not a declaration that   f- was to be presented by the Powers to Germany.   Itwould, however, be a great advantage   if France could be.
induced to agree that  &quot;those provisions of Part V ofthe Treaty of Versailles which at present limit the arms and armed, forces of Germany shall he abrogatedas part of a general settlement&quot;, etc.    Even if it-did not produce positive results with Germany, people could, no longer say that Germany had not had a fairdeal.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to consider the words underlined in thefollowing sentence:-&quot;and. the maintenance of security asmay be settled by free negotiationcarried, on between Germany an^ otherpartleg to the Treaty o  Versa illes&quot; .These words, it had been pointed out, excluded Russia,a country to which Germany attached, importance fromthe point of view of disarmament.The Catinet agreed  That if the British negotiatorswere unable to reach agreementwith France, they should    not make any communication to theFrench Government as to what action Pis Ma,iesty*s government proposed, to take in consequence ofthe breakdown without prior consult-ation with the Cabinet.
4.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP. Si (35))  raising thequestion whether the second infantry battalion whichhad to be provided to complete the Garrison of Singaporeshould be despatched at the end of the financial year1935 or should wait until the end of 1936.The Secretary of State for War, in his Memorandum,stated that he had received a detailed appreciation ofthe situation in Singapore from the General OfficerCommanding, Malaya, who recommended that the secondbattalion should be despatched at thS earliest possible moment, that is, during the trooping season 1935-36,and stating deliberately that in his view we were running an unjustifiable risk by any further delay.As the Chancellor of the Exchequer had raised noobjection on financial grounds, the only question beforethe Cabinet was one of policy, namely, as to whether&apos;the despatch of the Infantry Battalion would be likelyto excite hostility in Japan, who, however, must for various reasons be aware of the intended despatch ofthe Battalion.After hearing the views of the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, theCabinet agreed:-That the Second Infantry Battalion tocomplete the Garrison at Singapore shouldbe despatched at the end of the financialyear 1935.
I IMPERIAL[DEFENCE[POLICY.gfpreviousReference:Cabinet 4 (35)Conclusion 7).5.    The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinetthat increased estimates for the Defence services would be published in the near future.      This would increase the pressure in Parliament for a general debate on Imperial Defence to precede the debates on the estimates for the Defence Services.      Therewere already signs of such pressure, and there was much to be said for it at the present time.      Asuggestion had been made to him that the best wayto get the debate without creating an inconvenientprecedent would be to issue a White Paper, setting out the Government1s policy on Imperial Defence as awhole which would provide a general introductionto the estimates of the Defence Departments.The Cabinet agreed:-That, with a view to a general debate in Parliament on Imperial Defence toprecede the debates on the estimates of the Defence Departments, a white paper should be prepared under thedirection of the Prime Minister whichshould be submitted for the approval-of the Cabinet before its communication to Parliament.
6.       The Cabinet had before them a further Reportby the Cabinet Committee on India covering the draftof a Statement to be made by the Secretary of Statefor India in the course of his Second Reading speech on the Government of India Bill (CP. 27 (55)).In a covering note by the Prime Minister, as chairmanof the Committee, it was explained that the Secretaryof State for India had telegraphed the draft Statementconfidentially to the Viceroy for his comments, andthat should the Secretary of State on receipt of theViceroy&apos;s reply desire to make any material change,his proposals would be brought later to the notice ofthe India Committee, and, if necessary, to theCabinet.The Cabinet approved the draft statement to be made by the Secretary of State forIndia in the course of his Second Readingspeech on the Government of India Billin the form attached to CP. 27 (35)which had already been approved by the .Cabinet Committee on In&amp;ia*

The Cabinet had. under consideration a Noteby the President of the Board of Trade (CP. 17 (35))annexing a Memorandum setting out the facts relatingto the negotiations conducted during the past sixmonths for a trade agreement.      It was stated in the note that under existing conditions the proposed agreement   would lead to an increase of  500$000 ayear in the value of our exports to Poland9 and thePresident of the Board of Trade expressed the viewthat it was highly desirable on all grounds thatwe should strengthen and develop our commercial relations with that country.      He accordingly askedfor authority to conclude an agreement on the lines indicated in the Memorandum? the agreement to runto the end of 1936, the date already adopted for similar agreements recently negotiated.The President of the Board of Trade said thatif the Cabinet would give general approval to his memorandum, he would make the best bargain he couldon the one outstanding question, that of shipping.In reply to a question he said that the Board of trade had carefully considered the objections to the runningout of so many trade agreements with foreign countriessimultaneously, but that on the whole the adoptionof different dates was even more inconvenient.Some of these treaties could be carried on while anew one was being arranged.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, whohad been consulted and had agreed to the Memorandum,warned the Cabinet that this would add one more countryto the list of those which prevented us from makingonany alteration in the duties on bacon and/eggs before
the end of 1936.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to conclude an agreement onthe lines indicated in his Memorandum(CP.  17 (35)), and to make the bestagreement he could on the outstandingquestion of shipping.
