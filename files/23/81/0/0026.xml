IMPERIAL DEFFNCF&apos;,ForthcomingDebates in fheHouse of commons and. House ofLords .(previous reference:Cabinet 26(35),  Con-clusion 2 .)1. mhe Secretary o^ State for &quot;%r,  as Leader ofthe Government in tbe House of Lords% recalled thaton a Motion by Lord Lloyd a Debate on ImperialDefence had been arranged for Tuesday, May 21st,and a ^ouse of Commons Debate on the same subiecffor Wednesday, May 22nd.    He had. received a letterfrom the Secretary to the Cabinet to the effect that from the point of view of the House of Commons- debate the Parliamentary Secretary to the -reasury had urgedthat the House of Lords Debate should, if possible,be postponed and that- both Rebates should, take placeon the s^me day.    Before consulting Lord Lloyd, theproposer of the Motion on May 21st, he had got intocommunication with the Secretary o^ State for Air,who was to reply on behalf of the Government in the debate and who took the view that there were advantages in his making a statement on Air Policy in the Houseof Lords before the Debate in-the Rouse of Commons.The Cabinet were- informed that. Herr Hitler was tohave made his statement on Friday,. May 17th, but,owing to Marshal Pilsudskifs  death, had postponed it until Tu es day, May 21st.After full discussion and after hearing the reasons why the Secretary of State -for Air preferred that heshould announce, the policy of the Government beforethe House o^ Commons Debate, the Cabinet agreed  (a) that, in a?-lew of the postponement of herr t-Titler&apos;s announcemen4-.,  it was very desirable to avoid a statement beingmade on the Government&apos;s Air ForcePolicy before Ferr Hitler&apos;s statementof German policy was available, andthat, since the Rouse o^ commons debate could not be postponed asecond time, it was unavoidable thatthe Secretary of State for Air&apos;announcement of the Government&apos;policy on Air Defence should be postponed until Wednesday, May 22nd,&apos;when it could be made simultaneouslyand on agreed lines with an announce-roent in the House of Commons:-1-
(b) That the Secretary of State for war should endeavour to secure a post-ponement of the Debate in the Rouseof Lords,  and might,, if he thought fit,  inform Lord Lloyd that he was likely to receive a more satisfactoryanswer from the Government Pench ifhe would agree to postpone 4he debate on his Motion until a^ter Ferr Hitler&apos;sstatement of German policy:(c) That the Secretary of State for war should also try and obtain a re-arrangement of the business  o43 theHouse of Lords so that Lord Strachie&apos;motion on foot-and-mouth disease inDorset  could be taken on muesday. May21st,  instead, of Wednesday, May 22nd:(d) that if it was found impossible toarrange for a postponement of the debate in the Rouse of Lords, itwould have to take place as  originally contemplated,  on mu.esd.ay May 21st,and the Secretary of State for Air&apos;announcement would have to be adjustedaccordingly.(tnTOWE:    See also Conclusion 6 as to thearrangements for considerationof Air Defence Policy by the ministerial Committee on defence requirements and the Cabinet,consequential on this Conclusion.)-2-

grrfTTTOPIA) .&quot;by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs[previous (C.C-98 (35))  containing a full appreciation of&quot;Reference:Cabinet 26 the Italo-Ethiopian situation,  including an historicalI (35), Con-clusion 9,) survey of the present dispute;    the Italian militaryp  preparations:    the possible repercussions at the(dS)CmU.    approaching session of the League of Nations Council:Cuth^c, the difficult decisions confronting Fis Majesty&apos;sGovernment:    the position relating to the supply ofarms to Abyssinia:    and. the action taken by FisMajesty&apos;s Government to avert the accumulation ofdangers arising from the existing situation.The Lord Privy Seal was present during thegreater part of this discussion.The following new factors in the situationwhich had arisen since the circulation of CP.  98 (35)were brought to the notice of the Cabinet:-1.    The names of the Italian members of theConciliation Commission had been published as requested &quot;by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs at the last meeting of the Council ofthe League of Nations.      The representatives were an ex-Ambassador in Berlin and a memberof the Italian Foreign Office.      The ItalianGovernment had also urged the Ethiopian Govern-ment to appoint as their members of theConciliation Commissions Ethiopians and notforeign representatives in accordance withtheir original intention.      The Italianrepresentative at the Council meeting at Geneva&quot;would, therefore, be in a position to say thatthe conciliation procedure was being carried-6-ILlSPUTE BETWEEN 5.    In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inRnALY ANT)4byssinta the margin, the Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum
out and there was nothing to be done &quot;by theCouncil of the League of Nations.      As the subjects of the conciliation procedurewere in dispute  (the Italians wishing to takefirst only the Ihlwal incident),  there was everyprospect that unless an initiative were takensomewhere,  the question would be postponed untilthe next regular meeting of the Council inSeptember,      By that time the rainy season in ethiopia would be over and the Italians mightbe on the verge of hostilities, if they had. not already begun.His Iv&apos;ajesty&apos;s Ambassador and the french ambassador in Rome had both shown reluctance to carry out their instructions (Cypher telegram to Sir E.  Druiiiuiond, No.  283)  to approachS. Mussolini in a final endeavour to prevent a crisis, including the proposal that the twoGovernments should recommend the ethiopian government to follow a policy more in accordancewith modern conditions by recognising Italy&apos;sclaims to taking fuller part in increasing thetrade between Ethiopia and the outside world,and in assisting the development of the economic resources of the Ethiopian Empire.   (CP.  98 (35)).The Secretary of State for the Colonies hadreceived information of a project that was underconsideration by a British firm  (Walford LinesLimited, a Subsidiary of Vickers)  to undertake a contract for the supply-of armaments to Ethiopiato the value of  500,000, part of which might besupplied by Messrs. Vickers, though, alternatively,the war material might be obtained in whole orin part from outside British territory.
The intention vas to ship   a    consignment toBeroerasand the firm wished to know if theycould obtain an assurance that it would heguarded in its passage through Somaliland,without which insurance could not he obtained.In no circumstances could military guards beprovided for this purposes, though it wasconceivable that if the firm undertook the contract at their own risk, some action mightbe necessary to prevent the arms fallingintothe hands of Somali tribes,4. The French Government had decided to prohibit the export of war mateiial by Frenchcitizens to Ethiopia and Italy ali..ce,  and thatshipments from Germany would be stopped anywherewithin French territory by virtue of the relevant provisions of the Treaty of Versailles.They would, however,  comply with their obliga-tions under the Treaty of 1930.5, A military appreciation submitted by theChief of the Imperial General Staff to theSecretary of State for War indicated that in thesouthern (Italian Somaliland) area the rainyseason would not he an oostacle to militaryoperations which might be begun there when theItalian Commander in Chief was ready and concerted with later operations in the northernarea (Eritrea) in September.In the course of discussion, various suggestions were made for dealing with the question at the meetingof the Council of the League of Nations, e,g.:-(i)      That the British representative should, ifnecessary, ask for the postponement of thesubject to a special meeting later on in orderto review the situation.
(ii) To suggest an adjournment of the subjectleaving liberty to either party to apply fora special meeting.(iii) The appointment of a Rapporteur, thoughit was recognised that it might be difficultto find one.(iv)  That the French representative might be willing to taKe an initiative on one or other of the above lines since they were as muchinterested as ourselves in the maintenance of-one League of nations.i(v) That there were advantages in postponing actionin view of the accumulating evidence of theunpopularity in Italy of the anticipatedEthiopian expedition.(vi)  That the British representative at the council should be given discretion as to how his instructions should be carried out.After somewhat prolonged discussion, the cabinet agreed:-(a) That as regards the position to be taken atthe meeting of the Council of the League ofNations, His Majesty&apos;s Government could notacquiesce in a procedure which must result,not only in nothing being done before september to prevent hostilities, but &quot;which gave no opportunity for anything to be done.(b) That the British representative  (the Lord privy seal) at the meeting of the Council,  should begiven a wide discretion as to the best course to be taken in his endeavours to secure this aim.(c) That the Lord privy Seal should on his arrival at Geneva, get in touch with the representativesof other countries concerned and discuss thequestion with them, especially from  the pointof view of the risks to the League of Nations.He should keep His Majesty&apos;s Government closelyinformed as to the position at Geneva.(d) That the advice of His Majesty&apos;s Amoassador in rome as to making further representations toS. Mussolini in person, should be accepted,and that,  for the present, the proposalreferred to in CP.  98  (55), paragraph 11,should he reserved, though it might be usefullater on if S. Mussolini should himself showany disposition Of a desire to reach asettlement.(e) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should ask His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rometo return a t once to this country for consul-tation, which would be an indication toS. Mussolini of how seriously His Majesty&apos;sGovernment was concerned with the course ofevents.
That as regards the shipment of arms, theSecretary of State for the Colonies should inform &quot;vi/alford Lines Limited that he couldnot undertake to provide a military escortfor the passage of a consignment of warmaterial to Ethiopia during its passage throughSomaliland, and should make quite clear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government wishes toavoid this transaction being carried outin the present difficult situation.That, pending any decision to the contrary,any small &quot;bona fide consignment of armslanded in British territory for transmissionto Ethiopia should oe allowed to go throughprovided that all the provisions of the Treatyof 1930 are complied with.That a decision as to the issue or refusal of licences for the exportation of arms fromthis country to Ethiopia should be postponed until the question actually arises.That the Cabinet should meet on Friday next,May 17th, at 11.0 a,m.  in the Prime Minister&apos;room,  House of Commons,  in order to discussthe question with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Rome.

The Oabinet had before their a w0st SecretInterim Report  (C.R.-100 (35)) by the AirParity Sub-Committee,  submitted by the Finis-terial Committee on Defence Reouiir ements, towhom the Cabinet had referred the Most secret memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air(C.R.-85 (35))  on the subject  of the German AirProgramme and its bearing on British Air Strength.The recommendation of the Ministerial Committeeto the Cabinet was as follows:-&quot;That the Air Ministry should beauthorised to proceed with theprogramme so far as it referredto fighter and light bomber aircraft, subject to the normalfinancial procedure between theAir Ministry and. the Treasury.&quot;With reference to paragraph 11 of D*Gjvr.( 32)141,attached to C .P.-1O0 (35), the Cabinet were informedthat it was not possible to verify the exact numberof German pilots .over and above the 1,100 trainedmilitary pilots.    a statement to the effect thatthere were 8,000 such pilots was not substantiated,but there was room for some &quot;backlash&quot; in thefigure of 4,000 mentioned in paragraph 11.    It wouldbe most inadvisable to use any figures  on thissubject in public.The Cabinet were informed that a further Reportby the Sub-Committee on Air Parity would, be availablefor the Ministerial Committee on Defence Requirementsnot later than the evening of Friday, May 17th.mhe Secretary of State for Air mentioned ascheme that he had had drawn up for giving publicity to the plans to be approved by the Government forRoyal Air Force expansion, with a view to stimulatingrecruiting,  and so forth.    An early decision wasnecessary.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Sub-Committee on Air Parityshould circulate its next report before the end of the week to the ministerial Committee on defence requirements :(b) That the Ministerial Committee on defence Requirements should meet-on Monday, May 80th,  at 10, downing street,  at 11,30 a,m. and again inthe Prime Minister&apos;s Room at .thePTouse of Commons &apos; on the s^me day at p.m., since the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs wou^d almost certainly be unable to attend the morning Meeting owing to a memorial service to Marshal Pilsudski:(c) That a Special Meeting o* the Cabinet,for the consideration of the proposedexpansion of the Royal Air Force,should be held on muesday, May 21st,in the Cabinet- Room at 10, downing street, at 11 a.m.:Cd.) that,  If necessary, the Expansion ofthe Royal Air Force should be thefirst subject for consideration bythe Cabinet at their regular weekly meeting on Wednesday, May 22nd.

There are still a numberof details to he settled, and I am not in a position to indicate whenit will be possible to introduce legislation&quot;.35A suggestion was made that the words  &quot;important matters&quot; should be substituted for &quot;details&quot;,but the decision was left to the ministers concerned in this question.
