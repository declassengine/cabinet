He did not know the detailsof the Sub-Committee&apos;s recommendations as the lord privy Seal had not felt justified in communicatingthem on the telephone.      The Lord Privy Seal, however,thought that they were satisfactory.      He understoodthat the Sub-Committee did not propose to fix theactual date for handing over the Saar to germany as the position of certain officials had first to be cleared up.

(a) The regulation of the trade 4 ($in arms so that an emcargo,when it is decided on, can at once he made effective;(b) In order that the figuresrelating to arms tradeand manufacture may he published.(iv)    If the figures so returned arechallenged,  the Permanent disarmament commission will charge itself withthe matter and communicate with theparties concerned (who undertake toco-operate) so that a report may beissued with a view to establishing the facts.F.

5.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Anglo-Japanese Relations:-A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (C.P.-9 (35)) covering a confidential letter from the Directorof the Federation of British Industries,written on behalf of the Mission sent by the Federation to Japan and Manchykuo,and recording certain general impressionsformed, on subjects outside the scope ofthe Mission as such.   The Mission heldstrongly that Japan was bound to be thedominating force in the Far Fast, andbelieved, that she desired an understand-ing with us, which might begin by co-operation as regards China:A Memorandum, by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP.-8 ?35))circulating a Despatch from HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Tokyo, enclosinga Memorandum by the Commercial Counsellorto the Embassy, on Anglo-japanese relations from the economic point ofview, from which it was clear thatthe latter&apos;s views were at variance with those of the Mission referred toabove.   The Secretary Qf State had. no hesitation in considering that theopinion of the Commercial Counsellorto the British Embassy in T0hyo, whowas generally acknowledged to be thegreatest living authority on Japan,must be the authoritative one in thismatt er,The subject was only discussed briefly and in a preliminary way.The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned that the silver policy of the United States ofAmerica had put China into a serious position whichmight involve intervention from outside.      This was^ J..        .     as it might necessitateone of the questions for consideration/ conversations with both Japan and the United States of America.He suggested the appointment of a Cabinet Committee..   The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat the China Committee of the Board of Trade, towhich he paid a tribute, were anxious that the questionof our relations with Japan, should not be allowedto drift.
The Secretary of State for War suggested the possibility of a China or Par Eastern Committeeon the lines of the Disarmament Committee whichcould handle such questions continuously.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said there was an important Dominion aspect tothese questions and he hoped that some of Sir maurice hankey&apos;s reports would be before any committeethat was appointed.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should consult with the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade and.   any other colleague that might be specially concerned, and should report at the next meeting of the Cabinet as tothe best way of handling these questions./

Sir John Eldon Bankes,a formerLord Justice of Appeal, had consented to act as chairman of the Royal Commission on private manufacture of and Trading in Arms.     The Chairmanwished to have a Committee of six persons besideshimself.     The&apos; Prime Minister gave the Cabinetsome of the names he had under consideration as members.

7.   The Secretary to the Cabinet reported that,in accordance with the instructions received on31st July, 1934 (Cabinet 31 (34). Conclusion 1(c)),he had reported to the Prime Ministers of SouthAfrica, Australia, New Zealand and Canada about thegeneral results of the Inquiry into Defence Require-ments ,   He had. made this verbal report as eompre-hensive as was possible in the time that had beenput at his disposal, which varied from, ih to 2 hours.In all cases,, after hearing his report, the P^imeMinisters had expressed their understanding and theiracquiescence in the policy of the Cabinet.In view of the extreme secrecy of these Reportsthe Cabinet adopted, a suggestion by the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs -That the communication of the Reportof the Ministerial Committee on Defence.Requirements (CP.-205 (34)) to thePrime Ministers of the dominions should be held over until their arrival in London for the silver jubilee.
8.     The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerof Agriculture and. Fisheries and. the Home Secretary(C J?.-10 (35)) circulating, in accordance with theConclusions of the Meeting referred to in the margin,a revised Herring Industry Hoard Bill.   The MemorandumfrK.(*yto. explained the Clauses of the Bill, and sought author-ity to circulate it in its revised, form in order that progress might be made as soon as Parliament meets.THE HERRINGINDUSTRY BOARDKILL .(previous reference e.r enc e cabinet 4?( 34), 0 on-conclusion 13,)The Secretary of State for Scotland askedfor authority to insert a clause in Committee,after consultation with the Secretary of State forWar and the Law Officers of the Crown, which would impose a time limit within which the whole scheme could be attacked if the procedure in the bill had not been complied with.     He also asked for authority to delete Clause 2, Sections (6) to (9).of the Bill.The Cabinet agreed -to approve the above proposals ofthe Secretary of State for Scotland,and to authorise him to introduce the Bill attached to CP. 10 (35)with the omission of Clause 2,Sections (6) to (9).
CENSUS, 1936. 9. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (C.P.-305 (34)), in which the(previous reference:       - Secretary of State for Scotland concurred, on theCabinet 54(30), Con- question of whether a population census should beelusion 4.)taken in 19 36,    After setting out the reasons for and-.fi-.3*(3^7 against, the Minister of Health recommended, that a census should be made in 1936, because of its utilityas a basis for national planning in such matters ashousing, but he would not    press strongly for it ifthe Cabinet thought that considerations of economy and. public convenience should prevail.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, thoughfavourable on merits to the taking of a Census,felt that the Cabinet ought not to ignore that aQuinqiiennial Census was a luxury costing 350,000.On financial grounds  the   Cabinet agreed -that a Census should not be takenin 1936.
10.  The Cabinet had before them a.Memorandumby the Postmaster-General (CP.-11 (35)) asking the Cabinet to approve in principle the introductionof the Post Office and Telegraph (Money) Bill.The Bill would authorise the issue of  34,000,000,and it was anticipated that this sum, when addedto the unexpended balance of  .2,700,000 available as at the 31st March, 1935, from the previous Act,would meet the capital requirements to the 30thSeptember, 1938.The Cabinet approved in principle theintroduction of the Post Office and telegraph (Money) Bill.m&apos;2, Whitehall Gardens, S.w,l,,16th January, 1935.POSTOFFICETELEGRAPHTHEAND(MONEY) BILL,H1935.:(previous!

APPENDIX.THE GOVERNMENT OP INDIA BILL.TRE SECRETARY .OP STATE FOR INDIA apologised forthe short, notice he had given the Cabinet for the disous-sion of a Bill which was perhaps the largest ever knownto any Parliament, but this course had been inevitableif the Bill was to be got through Parliament by a reason-able date.    It had been found Impossible to avoid, producing a Bill that was both complicated and. long. There had beengreat difficulties from the point of view of Constitu-tional draftsmanship, but the task had. been madeharder owing to the need to consult the Government ofIndia   6,000 miles away   upon almost every Clause,and. by the need, to think constantly of very sensitivesensibilities in Great Britain and in India.   The main reason for the size of the Bill was that it dealt -withthe Federal Government    the Provincial Governments and.Burma.   From, the point of view of the House of Commonsit had been found necessary to repeat certain things in.each Part.   The alternative would have been legislation by a system of cross-references that would have confusedthe House of Commons and led to waste of time.   That was particularly true in the case of Burma.    There were morethan one hundred Clauses in the Part of the Bill relatingto Burma which were a kind of mixture of Clauses fromthe Parts dealing with the Central Government and theProvinces/,    It had to be remembered that the Act wouldprovide the future Constitution of Burma, and cross-references to&apos; the Government of India Act would be most $a Id Ha fiiU ^IWLCULfinconvenient in such a document. ^ Ir-had to be takeninto account, also that this was a Consolidating bill and. that it made statutory a number of Rules issued bythe Secretary of State in&apos;the past (e,g., there were-1-
e- Question 01Preamble.some forty Glauses applicable to the Defence services to which these remarks would apply).    In reality only about one-third of the Pill dealt with new issues.A second point was that the Bill was almost entirelybased on the Report of the Joint Select Committee,every detail of which had been thoroughly sifted, bypicked members of both Bouses .    One point of difference was that the provisions for the jurisdiction of theFederal Court had been modified at the request of theCover rimer; t of India and, after consultation with the princes, to make it easier for the Princes to adhere.There was only one substantial point of difficultybetween the Government of India and himself, namely,-the question of a Preamble to the Bill *   The history ofthis was that the Joint Select. Committee had more than once considered the question of a Preamble.    They had made no recommendation, but generally they had. been opposed to a Preamble, more especially Sir austen chamberlain, and his group.    Instead, they had. inserted,a ilba^ptett-ecapitulating out5 pledges and stating that nothing had either been added or subtracted, therefrom.&quot;&quot;&apos;Consequently the first draft of the Bill sent to india had contained no Preamble.   A telegram had then beenreceived from the Government of India, not pressing thepoint strongly, but advocating a Preamble on the groundthat Indians attached, great importance to the Preambleof the 1919 Act.   As the Act of 1919 was being repealedthe Indians would think we were repudiating the Preamble.Experts, however,    informed, him. that the repeal of theAct did not involve the repeal, of the Preamble.    Inadvocating a Preamble the Government of India had been supported by the Aga Khan and the Governors of Bombayand Madras,    the India Office had consequently consideredthe question further.   They had found that the preamble to the Act of 1919 could not be inserted in the new Act.
A new draft Preamble had then been prepared, includingthe main points of the Preamble to the 1919 Act and making some additions to bring it up to date&apos;,    and. thatwas sent to India.    It was then found, that a new situation had arisen in India.   The Government of India wanted, aPreamble containing some phrase such as &quot;dominion status&quot; or &quot;the equality o-f the Dominions within theEmpire&quot;.   The question had then been gone into afresh, and the  Cabinet Committee had endorsed the view of theSecretary of State himself that a Preamble on theselines would be dangerous from the point of view ofParliamentary discussion.   He personally accepted thestatement made by Lord Halifax in 1.929, but he thoughtthat a Preamble containing phrases such as  &quot;dominion status&quot; and. &quot;the equality of the Self-governing Dominionswithin the Empire&quot; would be dangerous .   The phrase&quot;Dominion status&quot; nowadays was a term of art, and. itsprecise meaning was uncertain.   He thought the Dominionsthemselves differed in regard to it.    to use it in aPreamble to the Bill would trouble Conservative opinionhere and would start a controversy In India as towhether by &quot;Dominion status&quot; was intended something on thesealed, pattern of the Statute of Westminster,    It wouldalso cause trouble with the states In India&apos;    for example,Hyderabad.   That did. not mean that he contemplated, that owing to colorr or some other differences the status ofIndia, was to be on a lower level than that of theDominions, but he did find it difficult to contemplatean identical status where the circumstances &quot;ere sodifferent,   The Cabinet Committee   after a long discussion, .... ^had come, to the conclusion that a Preamble was inadvisablehahtand that a tetter plan would be to ioemc a statementduring the Debate, not repudiating Dominion status,making clear that the status of India would not beinferior to that of the Dominions, but pointing out the
differences of the Indian position which actuallyexisted and which could not be ignored. His advice,therefore, was that there should be no Preamble^ butthat a statement should be made early in the Debate.THE PRIME MINISTER recalled, that at the end ofthe Round. Table Conference September-December, 1931,he had made a statement which had included thefoil owing:-&quot;The view of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis that responsibility&apos;for the govern-ment of India should be placed, uponLegislatures, Central and. Provincial,with such provisions as may be necessaryto guarantee during a period of transition the observance of certain obligations and to meet other specialcircumstances, and also with such guar-guarantees as are required by minorities toprotect their political liberties and rights ..In such statutory safeguards as maybe made for meeting the needs of the transitional period it will be a primary concern of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to see that the reserved powers are so framed and exercised as not to prejudice the advance of Indiathrough the new constitution to full responsibility for her own government&quot;*(Cmd.  5972 of 1931.)In that statement he had not. used, the term &quot;dominion status&quot;.   He feared that if some indication was not given that the Preamble to the Act of 1919 was stillapplicable although the Act was- repealed, there wouldbe trouble.   He pointed out that in some-respects Indiaalready had Dominion status:    for example, they hadseparate representation on the League of Nations.THE PRESIDENT OP TEE BOARD OP EDUCATION supported the Secretary of State for India.   There were three courses:    (l) to repeat the 1919 Preamble:,   (s) toinvent, a new one:    (3) not to include one...  Of these(1) was&apos; the worst, (3) was impossible&apos;    so he thought the Secretary of State was wise to have no Preambleand. merely to make&apos;a statement..
After the LORD PRESIDENT OP THE COUNCIL, theCHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and the POSmMASTBR-general had. supported the Secretary of State for India,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS also expressechis concurrence, pointing out the danger of a Preamblesince it might be amended by the House of Commons,   he hoped, however, that the Cabinet were not considered by implication to be deciding that the statement would include a reference to Dominion status, which was amatter requiring careful consideration.THE.PRIME MINISTER said he felt strongly on thissubject.   Both here and. in India there would be a gooddeal of criticism at the omission of a Preamble.   Thenumber of safeguards in the Bill would also be criticised.It would, be pointed out also that the Constitution wasnot self-expansive.   The Bill might pass the House ofCommons, but difficulties would arise in the country,and. it would strengthen the hands of Congress.   Conse-quently he would await with a good deal of interest the draft of the statement on Second Reading which wasto be discussed.   Care would have to be taken lest theabsence of a Preamble should destroy the psychologicalatmosphere required for the passage of the Bill.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said he contem-plated a full and sympathetic statement which would meet the Government&apos;s critics better than any Preamblewhich cotiId. be devised.THE PRIME MINISTER suggested that he should consult the statement of 1931 to which he had referred.He thought the Cabinet v.1 ere agreed -(1) That there should be no Preamble.(2) That a Statement should, be made on thesubject on the Second Reading of the Bill..(3) That the draft of the Statement should bebrought before the Cabinet.This was accepted.
Rigidity of As regards the Prime.Minister&apos;s remark that thetionfnStlt^   Constitution was not self-expansive, TO SECRETARY OFSTATE FOR INDIA said it was bound to be rigid owing tothe number of safeguards that had to be inserted, and.H . because, the different sections of Indians, which wereauspicious of one another, insisted, cn the last wordbeing in the Statute.    In this connection, however, hemhe Instruments drew attention to the use of/Instruments of Instruction0f instruction to the Gover nor*-Genera 1 and to the Governors .   Theletter of the Constitution was laid down in the Act,fai/wAd 1*4.but the spirit of its working wee/&apos;contained in the o-a-idInstructions ,    Again and again it would be found., on aperusal of the Bill, that its working depended on theInstructions issued, to the Governor-General and the governors.   The Joint Select Committee had attached somuch importance to this point that they had proposed,the procedure under which, at an early stage of thediscussion of the Bill, draft instructions would be circulated so that they might be in mind during the debates.   Ultimately they would be approved by Parlia-mentary Resolution,   That was the answer to the criticism that the Bill was too rigid, for these Instructionscould be modified.   He thought the Cabinet could not-pay too much attention to this new phase of Constitu-tional development.   The Instructions held the balance between the unavoidable rigidity of the constitution and the possibility of development if things went wellin India.THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that this was a goodanswer to the criticism of rigidity.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said he proposedto send the draft Instructions soon to the Cabinet andthat they should be published early in the Debate.
S9fpefinition of THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA said he hadResponsibility.tried to avoid some of the confusion and anomaliesarising out of Dominion Constitutions, and especially the Irish Treaty   for example, as to what res pens lb11-ity still remained to be exercised in London and whatwas exercised in the Dominions respectively -- by laying&quot;down very clearly the responsibility of all concerned.In particular, the responsibility of the Governor-General and the Governors was differentiated according as it was exercised on the advice of Ministers, on their individual judgment (that is to say, where they could,over-ride the advice of Ministers) and &amp;&amp;t their IndivuLd-vaA discretion.   He had also drawn a careful distinctionbetween the prerogative powers of the Crown and the functional powers conferred on the Federation.   there could, for example, be no question as to the appointmentof Governor-Generals, High Court Judges, Auditor-Generals,etc.   In reply to the PRIME MINISTER he said that theconferring of Honours would be a prerogative of theCrown exercised on the advice of the Secretary of Statefor India or the Prime Minister.    There had been some criticism that there was nothing to prevent the app-oint-ment of a bad Viceroy being made in the United Kingdom.That had been looked into, and he could see no means ofguarding against that risk, which affected all appoint-ments of that kind.THE PRIME MINISTER pointed out that the PrimeMinister and ofaher Ministers here would always get thebest possible man they could, to avoid trouble in India.B^rma- ^HE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA then passed tothe question of Burma.   The difficulty here was that&quot; for ggnaratioiafr India had been tied up to Burma, andone could, not deal with India without dealing also withBurma,   There had in the past been pledges that Burmawould, not be worse off than India, and. the best way
was to deal with Burma In the Government of India Bill.His idea was to deal with Burma in the Bill and. then,at some later stage, to pass a one-Clause Bill takingBurma out of the Government of India Act and making ita separate Act,   He was informed that there were prece-dents for that.   The only difficulty that arose inconnection with Burma was a trade difficulty.   Theproblem was that Burma depended on India and India on-Burma, and some arrangement must be made to prevent them from cutting each other&apos;s throats by a trade war in theearly -&amp; .&amp;g&amp;s^   The Joint Select Committee, therefore,had - thought that the best plan was for the present-Governments to make a short-term agreement, to provide abreathing space,   British firms in Burma wanted thestatus quo to last as long as possible, but Lancashirewanted it as short as possible, in the hope of getting a lower tariff in Burma than in India,    That was aquestion that would arise soon and on which he wouldhave to consult the Cabinet.THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP trade, withoutwishing to raise the question at that Meeting, warned the Cabinet that he was anxious lest Burma should givea Preference to India which, would act to the detriment of the cotton trade.   The matter was of considerableconcern to Lancashire, and he did not wish to see theposition of Lancashire prejudiced.   He though4:  some means should be devised, of getting over the difficulty.the SECRETARY OP STATE FOR the COLONIES suggestedthat as Burma had no cotton industry they had no excuse for a tariff on cotton goods except for revenue purposes.notSurely they could/give a Preference to India on a revenuetariff?THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA pointed out thedifficulty that Burma eould only exist by exportingrice to India, and was therefore economically dependenton Tnd5a. which was in a/position to oapgnin7 -p-
He thought the/subject had better be posfe-p one d,THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OF TRADE agreed, onthe understanding that the point would be raisedlater, as it was an important one.THE PRIME MINISTER said the point was bound tocome up.The Length of THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRSthe BurmaSection of pointed out that there were 150 Clauses of the bill the Bill.dealing with Burma.   He asked what was the reply tothe criticism that the Bill ought to have been lightenedin this respect?THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA said that theParliamentary answer was, first, that a great deal oftime would be saved by dealing with Burma in theGovernment of India Bill, since discussion of matters that had already been settled in the earlier sectionof the Bill and were reproduced in the Burma Sectioncould be avoided.   The second, answer was an even morecogent one, namely, that Burma was at present part ofIndia and consequently had to be dealt with in some wayat the same time as India itself:    otherwise the wholeof the Indian Bill would have to wait until Burma was settled.   He thought, both these points might be madein the White Paper that was to be issued.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES pointedout that there had always been two conditions precedentto the bringing of the Pill into force by Proclamation.The first was the accession of a certain number of theIndian Princes, which was provided for in Clause 5 ofthe Bill.   The second was the bringing into operationof a Reserve Bank.    Nothing was said, in the Bill onthis latter subject.
THE SECRETARY 0? STATE FOR TITO IA pointed out thatI the Reserve Bank had started two years ago and was already in full operation.   He thought it inconceivable,however, that Parliament would, adopt an Address bringing the Bill into force if the financial position at themoment rendered federation impracticable.   He had alwayscontemplated that the decision as to finance was an executive act which would be reported to Parliament..Borrowing. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER pointed, out that under Clause 173 of the Bill, loans, guarantees and otheifinancial obligations of the Secretary of State inCouncil, which immediately before the commencement ofPart III of the Act were secured upon the revenues ofIndia, would, after that date, be secured upon the revenues of the Federation and of all the Provinces.That was satisfacto^v so far as 1t vent, but the interimloans whi h the Secretary of State for India was allowedto contract on behalf of the G-governor-General in council under Clause 294 of the Act were not safeguarded in thesame way.   Apart from that, he would, like to see thewhole position as regards borrowing set out in Clauses157 to 162 of the Bill, so as to avoid having to searchthrough different parts of the Bill to ascertain the exact position on borrowing.feud  LLal&apos;THE SECRETARY OF STAmE FOR INDIA had nome doubt.$&amp;&amp;&amp;ei&amp;-al-&amp;-*   the present arrangement of Clauses 173 and894 hady(been adopted, -an - the &quot;Ctdvic e&apos; -of the Governor ofthe Bank of England, to keep distinct and separate thetwo mattero........dealt -with thoroin^   He st.ig.gested that thesubject should be taken up between Officials of theTr eas ury and. Ind la 0 ffic e .
safeguards against. PenalTreatment ofT rad e .hePar1lament-ry Time-able .THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE pointed outthat Clause 12 (f) contained the phrase &quot;discriminatorytreatment of a penal character&quot; instead of the term&quot;dis-criminating or penal treatment% which latter had been proposed by the Joint Select Committee and accepted bythe representatives of trade and industry.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIA undertook to look into the question with the draftsman and representa-tivds of the Board of Tade .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA reported thatthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury&apos;s original estimate of the time required in the House of commons had been 35 days for Committee and. 10 days for Report,According to that programme the Bill would not be through the House of Commons before the middle of July,and the House of Lords would postpone its considerationuntil the Autumn.    In the interim there were risks thatthe political situation might be influenced and. pre.ju.dicetheir consideration of the Bill.   After considerationhe himself had come to the view that SO days for for ParlinTrentqi^y discuss ion o^ major questionsCommittee and 5 days for Report would suffice^ when itwas remembered how much detailed work had already beendone on the Bill by Parliament&apos;s own Joint Select Com-mittee.   He advocated that there should be either anagreement with the Opposition Parties or a time-table.He thought that action should be taken at once to consult with the official Opposition, Mr Churchill&apos;s group and Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s group, with a view to anagreement, and that, failing that, the time-table shouldbe drawn up and passed.THE PRIME MINISTER said he was already at work onthis aspect.   Before settling the time-table, however,he wished to learn from the Secretary   of State forIndia which were the really essential points that hadto be discussed, with a view to reducing them to a-11-
compass-able number of points to work to, -Whether thetime-table was reached by agreement or not.No decision was reached on this point, which,however, it was understood, would be brought up at theCabinet after further investigation.In conclusion, THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR INDIAwarned the Cabinet that there would be many vicissitudesin getting the Pill started and in getting it success-fully worked.    For the next few years the government must expect to be attacked both in the East and inthe *res1 on the subject.    It might be that at times theAct would appear to have been a failure.   None the less,be was convinced that the only wise course was to pass the &quot;ill./   and in the distant if not in the nearer future, the wisdom, of this course would be justified.THE PRIME MINISTER said that all members of theCabinet would agree that the Secretary of State forIndia&apos;s handling of this long and difficult question had been worthy of all admiration and. praise, and. thathe could rely on the support of his colleagues.
