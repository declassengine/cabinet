LONDON SQUARES. 9. The Cabinet were reminded that no decision(Previous had been taken at the previous Meeting in regardReference:Cabinet 30        to the Memorandum by the Minister of Health on(29)    Con-clusion 7.)       London Squares (Paper C.P.-227 (29)).   They were informed that the Prime Minister was considering whether a measure could        be introduced.The Cabinet agreed  That if the introduction of a Billshould be sanctioned,(a) The question of compensation should be dealt with on thelines of the reservation madeby the Rev. A.G.Pritchard andMr Snell to the Report of theRoyal Commission, viz,:-&quot;It appears to us that the provisions ofthe London Building Act as to generalbuilding lines, and more especially theprovisions of the Metropolitan CommonsAct, 1866, do, in effect, provide forsterilisation - a maintenance of thestatus quo - without compensation, andthat there is no reason why these enact-ments should not be regarded as providing a precedent for the non-admission of theclaim for compensation in regard to thesterilisation, or the maintenance ofthe status quo, of the existing squaresand enclosures.Our conclusions on this matter arestrengthened by the consideration that,if the claim for compensation be allowed.,not only will the danger to the preservation-tion of the squares be increased, butowners will be tempted to involve theLocal Authority in lengthy and expensivearbitration proceedings, especially inview of the complicated question ofbetterment&apos; that would doubtless arise.The admission of the claim for compensa-tion might actually endanger the exist-ence of the squares at a time when public authorities feel unable to increase their financial commitments.We are unable to see that the maintenanceof the status quo would inflict injuryupon, or reduce the value of the propertyof, the owners of the squares......,&apos;7&apos;(b) The question of legal claims to compensation ation should be carefully looked into, andthat where such claims arevalid compensation should bepaid.
