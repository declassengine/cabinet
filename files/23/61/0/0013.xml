The Cabinet had before thera a Memorandumby the.Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Paper CP.-259 (29)) circulating the followingdo ouns nt s: -A record of the Secretary of State&apos;soonversation with M. Dovgalevsky onSeptember 24, 1929.A list of subjects communicated tothe representative of the SovietGovernment for consideration as abasis of a discussion of the ques-tions outstanding-between the twoGovernments.A Memorandum of Suggestions in regardto the procedure which might be adoptedin subsequent negotiations, which,subject to the approval of the Cabinet,the Secretary of State proposed to use as the basis of his proposals toM. Dovgalevsky.This latter Memorandum of Suggestions was read aloudby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs anddisoussed paragraph by paragraph by the Cabinet, whoapproved it, subject to the following observationsand amendments:-(&amp;) PROPAGANDA. Article XVI of the 1924Treaty, which is used in the memorandum to interpret the formula in regard toPropaganda on the resumption of diplo-matic negotiations is sufficiently wideto cover &quot;propaganda by the Third Inter-national.(b) TH3 ARRANGEMENTS IN REGARD TO DIPLO-MATTC[AND CONSULAR MI  Sio^ AHQHSPlBSTAFPS were approved, on the under-standing that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs would do his best to confine the granting of special diplo-matic privileges to the head of theSoviet trading organisations in London,and if he found it indispensable toextend the privilege the number ofpersons to whom it ^should be grantedshould be as few as possible andshould be definitely specified.   In any event diplomatic privileges shouldnot extend to the buildings occupiedby the Trading Organisations.(c) Although their attention was drawn to the objections to any increaseIn the number of Ambassadors, theCabinet felt bound to accept the &apos;view of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs that
in the present case the exchangeof Ambassadors was an Indispensableelement in an agreement.Cd) DEBTS.    The oroposal that Inter-governmental debt and claimsincluding War Loan and counter-claims should be reserved fordiscussion at a later date was approved by the Cabinet, who took note that the Treasury were special-ly interested in this branch of thequestion of debts.(e) The proposal for a Joint Committee,oonsis-oing of not less than fiveand not more than seven repre sen ta-tives of each Government, to considerthe claims of British holders, of pre-revolution bonded governmental and municipal debt, claims by british companies and nationals in respectof nationalised properties and concessions, and MiscellaneousClaims, as well as the Terms ofReference to the proposed JointCommittee, were approved, but asregards the composition of theBritish Committee it was agreed to omit on page 4 of the Memorandum,,after &quot;a representative of industry&quot;(line 5) the following words:  &quot;nornin-ated after consultation with Federa-tion of British Industries&quot;;    andafter the words &quot;A representativeof the organised workers&quot; (line 10)the following words, &quot;to be appointedafter consultation with the general council of the Trades Unions&quot;,It was left to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to arrangedetails as to the precise nature ofthe British representation on theCommittee after consultation withthe Treasury and the Board of Trade,the latter of which was specially interested in this question.
S. The Cabinet took note that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, who had been engaged on public business constantly throughoutthe Recess, would, after attending the LabourParty Conference at Brighton, try to secure a shortholiday before Parliament meets.The Prime Minister asked that his colleagues would arrange, unless conditions made it quite impossible, that during their absence from their offices a Parliamentary Under-Secretary should be-in charge of the Office and should be available inLondon. This should be independent of thearrangement whereby, in the absence of a SecretaryOf State, documents requiring his signaturehave to be signed by another Seoretary *f State.

DOWS&apos; ,$BANS&apos;0 OLD AGE[JTRIBUTORYJISIONS ACT.posed,,commanding Bill.-eviousjeferenoe:cabinet 31(29), Con-fusion 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-249 (29)) by the Minister of Health andthe Secretary of State for Sootland reporting theconclusions they had reached as the result of aMeeting held on September 18th in pursuance of theCabinet Conclusion referred to in the margin, tothe effect that the Minister of Health, the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland should &quot;concert the most effective&quot;measures they could with the money available&quot;to carry out the policy of the Government&quot;.    Inthis Memorandum the two Ministers reported that,on the assumption that the proposals to be insertedisi the Amending Bill are not to involve expenditurein excess of the money available as reported byatthe Government Actuary, it was generally agreedthat the soheme outlined by the Minister of health in his Memorandum (Paper CP.-232 (29)), whichhad been before the Cabinet at the Meeting referredto in the margin, made a selection of the newbeneficiaries on as fair a basis as could be devised in the circumstanoes.    As regards pre-ActWidows, however, the selection was a purelyarbitrary one, and the proposed Amending bill would still exclude from pension -(i) All childless pre-Act Widows(that is, childless women whobecame widows prior to the 4thJanuary, 1926) until they reach the age of 65, and(il) on reaching 65 all of thesewidows who were under 50 yearsof age when their husbands died.As the exclusion of the classes above mentionedwas bound to evoke strong criticism, It vas urged the Treasury were represented at the Meeting.
or their representatives,should be set up at once(!)    to undertake in accordance withthe statement contained in the King&apos;sSpeech a general survey of thevarious national insurance and pension schemes, and(ii) to consider the larger policy Ofthe Government thereon, withpoorer to co-opt other members from outside the Cabinet if they deemed necessary and adyisable.(b) That when the Bill based on CP.-252 (29)is introduced In the House of Commons, itshould be made clear from the very outset that the Government are considering theirinsurance policy as a whole;    that theCommittee referred to in (a) has been setup for this purpose;    and that the present bill is only a first instalment,  introduced in-order to deal v&amp;th a class which in thecdurse of the Investigation it was foundhad&apos;a grievance &quot;of its own -which it waspossible to deal with immediately.      Itshould further   /in the Memorandum that, if the Bill was to be proceeded with on tho lines proposed, the announcement should bemade emphatically that the Bill is only a first instalment of the Government^ proposals on the subject  as already decided&apos;by&quot; the Cabinet In the Conclusion referred to Inthe margin,,The Cabinet- approved the proposals of the Ministerof Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (subjectto&apos;a&quot;small financial alteration mentioned below in (d);but,^recognising that it was essential to make quite clearthat -this was only a first instalment of a comprehensive scheme for dealing with the larger question, and that unless they could be somewhat extended the presentIpropdffal must inevitably come in for some severe%arlia^nentary criticism, agreed  (ra) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed of -The Minister of Health,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Labour,
be made clear that the government recognised that many other classesof persons with legitimate grievancesin regard to pensions existed, andthat these would be dealt with whenthe larger policy was completed.(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should consider whether it would bepossible to find any additional funds to enable the Minister of Health tomake provision for some of thosewidows with admittedly sound claimswho will still be excluded frompension under the proposals setforth in CP.-249 (29).(d) That in order&apos; to avoid the suddenrise in the present Exchequer contri-bution in the. financial year 1935-36from  4,000,000 to  13,500,000(Fara.1 of the Financial statement by the Government Actuary attachedto CP.-232 (29)), the charge on theExchequer should be increased at the rate of, say, 1,000,000 a year,, during the yearsintervening between the presenttime and 1935-36.
UNEMFLOY-10 INSURANCEm 30 Oon-ributionsale. .previous reference:Cabinet 30(29), Con-conclusion 8(a). )6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper C. P. -253 (29)) by the Minister of Laboursubmitting for approval the Report of a Committeeappointed as the result of the Cabinet conclusion referred to in the margin to examine the questionof relieving the Unemployment Insurance Scheme ofthe charge in respect of persons not in possessionof the 30 contributions qualification, with a viewto provision being made for them In a Bill to beintroduced in the Autumn.    In their Report theCommittee thought it unnecessary and impossible to deprive these persons of any part of the rights which they at present possess during the transitional period.    They also rejected, ascalculated to bring the Unemployment Insurancesystem into disrepute, any further extension of thepresent transitional period benefits to personsnot possessing the minimum insurance qualificationat the expense of the fund, which financially isalready in such difficulties that increased revenuemay be necessary.    They dismissed the alternative of allowing the persons concerned to be driven tothe Poor Law, and recommended a scheme that maybe summed up as follows:-(i) The examination of the possibilityOf taking the whole of the able-bodied unemployed under a nationalrelief scheme (so far as they arenot covered by unemployment insuranoe)which Hould include those persons nowIn receipt of out-door relief.(ii) Pending the development of the abovescheme&quot; (which will take some consider-,able time) the adoption, as a temporary expedient, of a plan to make grants, sofar as they need them, to those persons whose insurance benefits cease byreason of the contribution qualifi-,cation.    The Canmiittee1 s provisionalscheme Is attached in the appendix to their Report, and is reproducedas an Appendix to these Minutes.The cost is estimated not to exceed 5,000,000 in a full year.
In the course of a long discussion it became clear that, in the view of the Cabinet, thetemporary expedient summarised above in (ii)would be exposed to severe criticism in Parliament,on the ground that persons whose insurance benefitsceased through their not being in possession of the30 contributions qualification would, under thescheme, become subject to those investigations andtests which are so strongly objected to in theadministration of the Poor Law;   in fact therewould be introduced a new class of unemployedprovided for outside both of the UnemploymentInsurance Acts and of the Poor Law Acts.    Theadministrative practicability and desirability of creating this new class was felt to require fartherinvestigation.    Prom the point of view of theGovernments policy as a Whole, also, and havingspecial regard to the discussion referred to in theprevious Minute, it was felt to be undesirable,if it could be avoided, to introduce an interim measure in regard to Unemployment Insurance aswell as in regard to Widows1 Pensions.In the circumstances the Cabinet agreed  That the Committee should be askedto re-examine the question ofUnemployment Insurance in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s discussion and toreport their recommendations to theCabinet at an early Meeting.1
NEXT MEETTNG 7.      The Cabinet agreed -OP CABINET.To meet the same afternoon at5ol5 p.m. to take up the remainingitems on the Agenda Paper.2, Whit eha 11 Card ens, S. W. 1,September 25, 1929.
The proposed Scheme will cover, subject to theconditions seated below, persons who, though not havingpaid 30 contributions in the preceding two years, are,if unemployed, eligible for receipt of unemploymentbenefit under the &quot; transitional1&apos; provisions and whoserights to benefit will cease at some time during the yearbeginning April, 19;?0.The chief provisions of the Scheme would be asfollows:-1.      The payments would be in the nature of aprivilege to be granted where they are needed.2.      One of the aims of the scheme would be to. improve the employability, where necessary,  ofthe applicants, and, accordingly, where theapplicant&apos;s chances of obtaining employment wouldbe increased by a course of training or some such treatment, acceptance of it would be acondition of receipt of the grant.      The payment would not be continued to a person who refusedunreasonably to move from an area where the chances of his re-employment were slight.3.      The payment would not be continued after it became clear that the applicant was unlikely to regain a footing in industry.if.      The weekly rates of payment should be thepresent rates for unemployment benefit includingthe alloyrances for dependants-.
The persons covered by the scheme beinglimited to those eligible for unemployment benefit,under the transitional provisions,  the conditions to be fulfilled should include tyae same conditions as for unemployment benefit.In addition,  the applicant must be willingto undertake any work suited to his capacity.Further, as the new payment is not a rightbut a privilege,  it should be clearly limited to applicants who can satisfy an appropriate irneedsutest..G.      The payments will be made through the EmploymentExchanges out of a separate account of theUnemployment Fund to be financed by the Exchequer;J.-     The final decision on an application must rest with the Minister, who vzould have power to referapplications for advice to local persons or committees so far as necessary.2k
