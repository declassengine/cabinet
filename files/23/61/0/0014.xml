ONDON[BAPFIC.(previous reference:Cabinet 25(29 ), Con-conclusion 6.)2. The Cabinet had before- them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport (Paper CP.-251 (29))on the subjeot of London Traffic, in the course ofwhich he reported that, as a result of the cabinet conclusion referred to in the margin, in intimatingto the leaders of the London County Council and toLord Ashfield the Governments decision that the bills promoted in the last Session of parliament would not be allowed to proceed, he had stated, uponthe authority of the Prime Minister, that he wouldbe ready at an early date to explore with all theinterests concerned the best means of resumingconsideration of a problem which the government recognised to be urgent.    His conversations,however, did not lead him to expect that either ofthe parties would take the initiative in proposing a solution.   After discussing the various possible alternatives the Minister of Transport stated inhis Memorandum that he inclined to a solutionbased on an assertion at once of the principle ofpublic ownership, and the transfer of the ownership and operation of all the existing London transporta-jtion undertakings, both private and municipal, tosome new joint authority, which he oontemplatedmight be formed on the lines of the central electricity Board or the British broadcasting corporation, with a ssoiewhat similar relationship tothe Minister of Transport and. to Parliament.Before giving detailed examination, however, to proposals of this kind, which vould raise political issues of substance and important questions of publicfinance, the Minister of Transport wished to knowwhether his colleagues would be prepared, in-2-
principle, to take into consideration proposals ofsuch a character involving legislation in thepresent Parliament.   He suggested a Cabinet Commit&apos;tee to explore the whole situation.Without expressing any opinion as to anyparticular solution of this problem, the cabinet agreed  That a Committee, composed of -The Minister of Transport(In the Chair),The Chancel lor of the Exchequer .(or representative),The President of the Board of Trade(or representative),Mr Ben Smith, The Treasurer ofthe Household, -should explore the whole situationin regard to London Traffic andreport their conclusions to theCabinet.
THE LORD PRIVY 3.

He had everyhope that next year they would place orders in this country to the extentof  16,000,000.    This, however,  couldnot be announced until the canadian parliament had approved it.The cargo of Welsh coal which he hadtaKen to Canada had been examined byCanadian experts and proved to be
10 per cent, better than he had antlci-pated.    He had brought back a cargo ofNova Scotian coal which was now being examined toy experts.    It was hoped toproduce a combination of Welsh andNova Scotian coal which would out outUnited States coal.    The Coalowners hadalready expressed their appreciation of what he had done in this matter.He hoped to see representatives of the steel Industry on the morrow, and theFederation of British Industries onthe following day.    He would see therepresentatives of the Cotton industry as soon as advices from Canada enabledhim to make an announcement to them.The Prime Minister, on behalf of the Cabinet,thanked the Lord Privy Seal warmly for his successfulef i or-ts.

IRAQ,. 6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-247 (29)) by the Secretary of state the Baghdad-Haifa Railway for the Colonies covering the Report of a cabinet and Pipeline.Committee on the proposed Baghdad-Haifa Railway(Previous and trans-Desert Pipeline.    The Majority Report ofReference:Cabinet 21 the Cabinet committee, signed by the Secretaries(29), Con-elusion 3.) of State for the Colonies, War and Air, contained the following summary of recomnendations:-(a) That there appear to be, prima facie,a number of advantages in construct-ing a raib ay from Baghdad to Haifa,and that, despite certain objections,the chief of which is an added mili-tary commitment in certain of theareas, we are of the opinion that thewhole project is worthy of closerinvestigation.(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should take early steps toascertain the opinions of the Govern-ments of Palestine and Iraq on theproposal to construct a railway line from Baghdad to Haifa, and whetherthe latter Government would be pre-pared to be financially interested inthe project.(c) That His Majesty&apos;s Government should undertake a detailed survey of thealignment Baghdad-Haifa, with a viewto ascertaining accurately the costof constructing a railway between these two points.(d) That part of the cost of the surveyshould be borne by the colonial development Fund, and that the IraqGovernment should be approached witha view to securing their financialco-operation.(e) That no final decision should be madein regard to this project until theresults of this survey are available,and have been carefully examined insuch a manner as the Cabinet may direct.In addition there were attached Minority reports as follows:-By the President of the Board ofTrade, recommending that consideration-tion of the proposed survey can besafely deferred until some definitestep is taken by the French, which makes It certain that they will incur the e-s^rmous expenditure required tomake Tripoli a suitable port and to
complete the railway to the Iraqfrontier.By the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, opposing the proposal on grounds summarised in his memorandum as follows:-In brief summary, it is sub-mitted that the project commitsus  1. In the military aspect, toa greater and dangerousobligation.2.  In the foreign policy aspect,to a struggle with the French,of wide reactions.3. In the business aspect, toa gamble in which no authoritycan assure us a commercialreturn.4. In the unemployment,yment aspect, toa possible curtailment of our resources for the promotion of sounder and more usefulprojects, and to the certainty that money thus expended wouldemploy more men if expended athome.By the Financial Sec ret ar?/ to theTreasury, recommending that no decision be taken forth-, present,but that the matter be reconsideredif any new facts come to light.In his Note covering the above Reports theSecretary of State for the Colonies laid stress onthe danger that, if we take no action in regard tothe trans-desert railway and pipeline, the French,will forestall us in Syria, and recommended the carrying out of a detailed survey.As a natter of Cabinet procedure it wassuggested that the Note by the President of theBoard of Trade, who had not personally been a memberof the Committee, might more appropriately have appeared as a separate Memorandum rather than as a minority Note to the Committee&apos;s Report.The Cabinet thanked the Committee for theirvaluable Report, and agreed -
That no immediate decision should&quot;be taken, hut that the situation should be carefully watched by theDepartments concerned (e.g. , ForeignOffice, Colonial Office, War Officeand Air Ministry) more particularly from the point of view o.f a.ny action by the French in the direction of constructing the proposed railwayto the Syrian frontier.    If any minister should think that thesituation had changed, he should ask the Cabinet to re-examine the question.
IRAQ.Incidence of cost of HighOoramlssion.&quot;(previous reference:Cabinet 32(29), Con-elusion 1.)7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-252 (29)) by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies raising a point which had beendiscussed in Paragraph 9 of his earlier Memo-randum. (Paper CP.-239 (29)) on Future Policy InIraq, but on which no decision had been takenwhen that Memorandum was discussed by the Cabinet,namely, the incidence of cost of the british high Commission.    Briefly, the proposal of theSecretary of State was that, since our relationswith Iraq are already governed by a Treaty of alliance, ostensibly between equals, and since in1932, when Iraq becomes a Member of the Leagueof Nations, the cost oi the High Commission willin any event have to be borne by this country, thewhole expense of British representation in Iraq(the Iraq half share of .       ^^whioh Is greatly resented in that terrxtoryjshould be transferred to the Eritish Exchequer atonce, as recommended by the late Sir GilbertClayton.The Cabinet felt that, in present circum-stances, this question presented no urgency, butauthorised the Secretary of State for the colonies to raise the matter again if it should bsoome oneof pressing importance.
IHE GENERAL(STOPPAGE OP1926.The Positionof EstablishedAdmiraltyEmployees who took part.(previous reference erence:Cabinet 46(26), Con-elusion 18.)8. The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the position of establishedAdmiralty employees who took part in the GeneralStoppage of 1926:-A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (Paper CP.-248 (29))in&apos; which he recommended a remission of the penalties announced in 1928,not on any grounds that might be held to imply a general admission of theright of established employees ofthe State to go on strike, nor anycondonation of the action of parti-cular men who have already been declared by the officials of theirUnions to have acted wrongly, butas an act of grace, with the object of removing a widely-felt sense of grievance   or what is thought to havebeen an unduly harsh decision:A Memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (Paper C.P.-258 (29))covering a Memorandum by Sir WarrenBasher.    In the latter memorandum the First Lord&apos;s proposal was strongly opposed on grounds of principle as affecting the civilian employees of the State on whom the government must rely for carrying out its first duty of safeguarding the existenceof the community.    In his covering memorandum the Chancellor of theExchequer arrived at the conclusionthat, on the whole, it would be dangerous if the request to remitthe penalties in the cases referredto by the First Lord of the admiralty were conceded.In the course of the discussion it transpired that a number of other Departments would be affectedby any decision that might be taken in regard to the established Admiralty employees.    The Cabinet were also informed that a problem of a somewhat differentkind had arisen in relation to the position of employees of His Majesty&apos;s Office of Works who hadtaken part in the General Stoppage of 1926.The Cabinet were deeply impressed by the widereactions which were likely to spring from there opening of this question, affecting not only
Government Departments but other branches of natioxsllife, such as the railways.    It was realised alsothat these reactions would not be confined to theGeneral Stoppage of 1926 but would almost certainlyspread to similar cases which had arisen in the more distant past as the result of strikes in the PoliceaM among Postal workers.The Oabiriet agreed - (a) That the First Lord of the Admiralty,without seeking an interview on thesubject, when he met those personswho were pressing him to take action should explain the wide ramificationswhich wouid be involved by taking upthe cases in which the Admiralty wereconoerned:(b) That the First Commissioner of Y/orksshould circulate a Memorandum inregard to the particular difficultiesaffecting his Department.
9. The Cabinet had before theru a Memorandum(Paper CP.-240 (29)) by the  Secretary of Statefor the Colonies in regard to the proposals of aSpecial Commission appointed by the late Governmentto consider the Ceylon Constitution.

In this memorandum the Home Secretary explained that, in order to giveeffect to the Cabinet&apos;s desire that more prominenceshould be given to the civilian aspect of theArmistice Day Ceremony than on past occasions, he proposed, in consultation with the Ministers of theService Departments, to make a reduction in thenumber of troops on parade, but beyond that to make no changes in the traditional ceremonial which hasbeen adopted as a model for similar Services in manycities throughout the Empire.    Before submittingthe programme for the King1 s approval the HomeSecretary asked whether this course would meet withhis colleagues&apos; views.The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thathe had made arrangements for the Leaders of theOpposition in Parliament to be present officiallyat the ceremony.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Home Secretary for submission to His Majesty the King.

In these circumstances the Minister ofTransport had caused the owner of the LansdowneHouse site to be informed that he was unable toproceed further with the negotiations for safe-guarding the line of the&apos; proposed tunnel under his property, and had also apprised the WestminsterCity Council, as the local highway authority, ofthe&apos; position.The Cabinet took note of theMinister of transport s memo-randum.

These Ministers were asked, in particular,to ascertain whether the safeguards provided by existing legislation had been observed by theand generally;Companies concerned/ for example, in regard to suchmatters as the publication and forwarding of copies of balance-sheets and the appointment of directors;   and to consider whether any amendments to existing legislation were desirable.
THE indian statutory commission.(PreviousReference1.Cabinet 31(29), Con-elusion 1.)17.    The Secretary of State for India made astatement to the Cabinet in regard to the proposedinterchange of letters between the Chairman of theStatutory Commission and the Prime Minister which hadbeen proposed by Lord Irwin when he made his statement to the Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin, and which had then met with the approval ofthe Cabinet.    The letters were to cover statementsas to Dominion status and procedure subsequent tothe Report of the Statutory Commission.    This inter-change of letters, so far as it concerned the questionof procedure, had now been agreed to by the statutory commission and the letters were actually in draft.In these letters it was now intended to make clearthat after the receipt and consideration by HisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Government of India ofthe Report of the Statutory Commission, but before their own proposals were formulated, the Governmentwould give representatives of public opinion in Indiaarid of the Ruling Princes an opportunity of exchang-Ing views and seeking agreement on matters In regard,to which proposals would subsequently be laid beforeParliament by His Majesty&apos;s Government.    A draft had also been prepared of a statement to be made in Indiaand in this country making clear that Dominion statuswas still the ultimate aim of the Government&apos;s policywhich they were trying to help the peoples of Indiato achieve by stages.    Mr Baldwin had approved the correspondence arid the draft statement, but theSecretary of State had not yet been able to ascertainMr Lloyd George&apos;s views.    Sir John Siruohand lord reading had expressed grave doubts as to the wisdom of making a statement on Dominion status.    The.Governor-General (Lord Irwin, now on leave) and-22-
Lord Goschen (the Acting Governor-General) held strongly that, besides the intended interchange of letters, this statement on Dominion status should be ns.de by the PrimeMinister himself in view of the threat of a campaign ofnon-cooperation and non-payment of taxes throughout india at the end of December next and of the widespread belief in India that the British Government and people hadreceded.from the declaration of 1917 in regard to dominion status as the ultimate aim of the government&apos;s policy.   The Secretary of State made clear that he supported the views of.the Governor-General and the acting Governor-General.The Cabinet approved in principle the generalplan embodied in the letters, proposed to be exchangedbe Ween Sir John Simon and the Prime Minister on theunderstanding that it would be clear (from the text ofthe letters) that the initiative came from the former.As regards the proposed statement on the subject ofDominion status, the Cabinet considered that this shouldbe made in the first instance by Lord Irwin immediately on his return to India from his vacation.  The questionof the precise moment and procedure for the PrimeMinister&apos;s confirmation of the Viceroy&apos;s statement andthe general arrangements for carrying out the plansoutlined above were left for settlement between theSecretary of State for India and the Prime Minister,who undertook, before his departure for Washington, tosee Lord Irwin.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.vv. 1,September 25, 1929.
