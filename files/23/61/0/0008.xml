their share in the total Germanpayments, and secondly, that weshould get our full share of anymarket issue in America, as wellas complete control over anyissues in London;    but providedthat we were safeguarded on these points we should not press ourobjections to the French priorityas a sine qua non.After considerable discussion the cabinet agreed  (i) That at the Plenary Meeting atthe outset of the ReparationsConference the British Repre-sentatives should make a statementbased on principles (a),  (b) and(c) proposed by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and quoted above.At the second stage of the Confer-ence, after Committees had been set up, the Chancellor of theExchequer should develop and pressour claims under these three headsand should do his utmost to securethe adoption of our views,   if heshould find it impossible to secure their adoption he should refer tohis Cabinet colleagues for instruc-tions:(ii) That members of the Cabinet should consider, with a view to a decision at their next Meeting, the most appropriate means by which a decision should be arrived at if the Chancellorof the Exchequer should find itnecessary to ask for the assistanceof his colleagues during the Parlia-mentary Recess:(iii) That as regards the place of theproposed Conference, if the Frenchcould not by any means be induced to come to London, Brussels andThe Hague are the most suitable,with a preference for The Hague,for climatic reasons ,

MEMBERS OP 12.   The attention of the Cabinet was called the cabinet and THE PRESS.       to the following Question addressed to the prime minister ter :-&quot;Commander Bellairs, - To ask thePrime Minister whether the ruleenforced on members of the late government against writingpolitical articles is to becontinued by the present Govern-ment&quot;.The reply was left to thePrime Minis t er .2, Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.1,July 17,  1929.
3th July,  1929.My dear Ambassador,I have been giving a good deal of consideration tothe situation which has been clarified by the talks we havehad up to now, and this is what is in my mind as the result:1.      I think it would be a very useful thing if our twoGovernments were to announce our agreement that we are totake the Pact of Peace - the Kellogg Pact - as a vital and controlling fact in our relations and use it as the starting point in negotiations regarding disarmament.2.      We should then proceed to declare that on that basis the object of negotiations must be reduction in existing armaments, and that between us the relations are such that we both agree to parity.3.      We adopt the U.S. proposal that parity should be measured by an agreed &quot;yardstick&quot; which enables the slightlydifferent values in our respective national needs to bereduced to equality.if.      In order that the elements which enter into&apos;the&quot;yardstick&quot; be determined, I venture to ask you to send foran officer of your Navy - or Naval Department - with the requisite knowledge to come here and be at your service and act with a similar officer whom I shall appoint, to guideboth of us in agreeing as to the &quot;yardstick&quot;.5.      I think it would expedite matters if your officerwould take with him a proposal which your people areprepared to make as to the &quot;stick&quot; in all fairness to us.6.      When we agree as to the &quot;stick&quot; we can proceed asto its application, and so far as I can see, little troublewill arise about this between us.      If it does,  its cause hascertainly not been evident to me yet.
J.      Whilst this is going on between us we must keepJapan, Prance and Italy generally informed in ways which wecan decide from time to time.8.     We should also decide when the moment had come for(1)  the general conference to meet in London,   (2)  when Ishould go to Washington, and (3) when the final conferenceof ratification should take place.My own view is that if you got your officer over atonce, you and I would soon settle the preliminaries.      the stage indicated in paragraph 6 might be that when thegeneral conference should begin,  though we should know where we stand, first of all.9.      We should also agree upon the wording of the invitation to be sent to the other Powers and to the scopeof the discussion.      I think it ought to be confined to naval matters, and that we should agree that the actualnegotiations should he in the hands of politicals and that officers should he in attendance, or at call,  only forexpert and technical advice.If you will let me have your views on this note wecould go ahead.      I feel that time is precious and shouldnot be lost.      People are expecting much from us and Iam sure we can satisfy them.I am, my dear Ambassador,Yours very sincerely,(Signed)    J.  RAMSAY MACDONALD.(H.E.  The American Ambassador).
COPY OP LETTER FROM THE american ambassador TO THE PRIME MINISTER.Embassy of theUnited States of America.LONDON, July 12,  1929.My dear Prime Minister:The contents of your letter of July 8th on naval matters I duly communicated to my Government,and I am today in receipt of an instruction from theSecretary of State to communicate the following toyou on behalf of the President himself:&quot;We wish to express our great appreciation of the letter from the Prime Minister.   It is most constructive in its tenor and practicalin its proposals .   We have some variants tosuggest as to procedure, which, by simplifyingthe problem, would even further expeditepractical results .&quot;Referring in detail to his suggestions:&quot;(A) Paragraph one:- We are in agreement.&quot;(B) Paragraph two:- We are in agreement asto reduction of naval armaments .
&quot;(C) Paragraph three:-   We are in agreement -with the understanding that the expression&apos;slightly different values in our respectivenational needs&apos; refers to characteristics ofcombatant ships but does not refer to reasonableequality of the respective total combatant strength.?(D) Paragraphs four and five:- These relateto the method of developing a yardstick by ourtechnical advisers.    It seems to us that thesuggestion made may perhaps, by its short cut,lead to technical difficulties and, more important,to conflict within and between our different navydepartments, and their experts.   We believe that instead of this suggestion we should take a littlemore time and direct our activities on both sidesto securing a common line of thought in ourdifferent navy departments.    To bring this about,we make the following suggestions to Mr MacDonaldfor consideration which we think will greatlysimplify the technical questions.&quot;(E) These points are:  (a) We suggest thatthe scope of agreement shall cover all combatantships.    (b) We suggest that combatant strength
shall be considered by categories of capital ships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers and submarines.    (c) We suggest that right of limited transfer between these categories berecognised and that such transfer be made inaccordance with an agreed yardstick.    (d) As ourcapital ship and aircraft carrier status is fixed by the Washington Treaty of 1922, we suggest thatthese categories require no further discussion asto relative combatant strength.   The only question for consideration in these categories is defermentof replacements.&quot;(F) We suggest that, in measuring relativecombatant strength of ships, we should consider the elements of such yardstick to be:  (a) Displacement;(b) guns;    (c) age.&quot;Our general viev; is that protection, speed,habitability, etc., are entirely relative to theother factors and do not require special considera-tion.&quot;(G) We suggest that these factors may deservedifferent weight for different categories .
&quot;(H)  It is not expected that any yardstick willbe a mathematical nicety.    It would appear to us that, if these suggestions in paragraphs E, P, and Gmeet with approval, we shall have enormously simpli-fied the problem which we have to lay before navalexperts and that they could quickly come to conclu-sions.&quot;(I) Paragraph six:- We are in agreement.&quot;(J) Paragraph seven:- We are in agreement.&quot;(K) Paragraph eight:- This raises the question as to the location of the final conference.   We stillbelieve that this should be held open until ourprogress in these preliminary steps enables us todetermine these final questions with the best chances of ultimate success.n(L) Paragraph nine:- Is affected by comment on paragraph eight.   We are entirely agreeable as tothe desirability of expediting matters as rapidly aswe can and to do so with an assurance of success .We should hope to do this by simplifying our problem as much as possible by these direct discussions .If we could agree upon the principles in E and F,we could at once send a naval expert if it-is desired,
aor we could mutually exchange views upon the weight to be given factors mentioned in P with hope of early decision.&quot;I am, my dear Prime Minister,Yours very sincerely,(Signed)  CHARLES P.DAWES .The Right Hon.J. Ramsay MacDonald,etc., etc., etc.,10, Downing Street,Whitehall, 3.W.I.
