D1 DTuesday, June 25th,1929at 5 p.m.No.   10 Downing Street.I saw general Dawes and Mr.  Gibson and discussed thequestion of the preparations for a conference on naval dis-armament.    They proposed that a conference should be held withthe five Powers interested for the purpose of surveying theproblems generally,  to be attended by political representatives,whilst concurrently naval experts should be employed in workingcut schemes arising out of the proposals and agreements come toby the main conference.      I asked who would call the conference.They said that they had considered that point and that they thought either Great Britain or Japan should do it.    The reasonfor suggesting Japan was that they wished to enlist to thefullest extent the support of the Japanese Government.     I pointed out that,  whilst in no way objecting to Japan, therewere certain matters to be considered:-(l) Where would the Conference be held after Japan called it?(2) Would it not give rise to suspicions if Japan initiatedsuch a Conference?They said that the world expected that Great britain should do it;    that if we would agree, so would they;    that asa matter of fact they thought we should, but in that event theywould urge that Japan,  by the most important chairmanship or insome other way,  should get a leading rCle assigned to it.    Tothat I agreed.We then-discussed the  situation generally and Mr.Gibsonsaid that his experience at Geneva led him to consider whatwould be the position of America,  Japan and Great Britain if other powers rejected the sort of agreement which ,,e might beprepared to sign,  and proposed that in the event of thefive-power. . .\COPY-SECRET.
five-power conference &quot;breaking down, we should have at the hackof our mind an immediate setting up of a three-power conference which would come to a really satisfactory agreement and that that should he executed.    We discussed the effect of such an idea and decided that nothing Whatever should be said of it until it was clear that the five-power conference would break down.    We agreedthat the proposal to go straight ahead with the three-power con-ference might have an influence in getting a five-power agreement in the last resort.I then raised the question of Geneva and asked what mr.  Louden,  the Chairman of the Preparatory Disarmament Commis-sion,  would say to the proposal.      Mr.  Gibson stated that he(Mr.Louden) had suggested such a. thing and that,  particularlyin private with him,  Mr. Louden had said, that such a conference could produce an agreement which woiild become at  once an  agree-rnent of the Preparatory Commission,  and that he would summon theCommission immediately the five-power conference had producedresults.Both General   Dawes and ivir.   Gibson were most cordial intheir relations to League contacts and. had no intention of setting up anything rival to the Geneva commissions.      They em-phasised that  their object was to prepare the way.I then raised the question of where the conference should be held and they agreed that London should be the place.I said that I would, like to sleep on the whole problem and a meeting at 6 o1 clock tomorrow,(Wednesday)  afternoon    was arranged.    The three-power conference would include Japan, UnitedStates and  Great Britain.If the five-power conference fails t i.e.  includingPrance and Italy) then we,  Japan and the United States will immediately resolve ourselves into a three-power conference.
