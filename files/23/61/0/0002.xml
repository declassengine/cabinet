A P P B g D I X.Appointed Guardians*Hie KajcstyTa Government have had under consid era-tion the arrangements for the administration of the poorlaw in those areas of the country in which the electedguardians were superseded by guardians appointed by thelate Minister of Health under the Board of Guardians(Default) Act, 1926.     The areas affeoted are the poor LawUnions of West Kara, Chester-le-Street and Bedwellty,Under tke Local Government Act, 1929, which waspassed on 27th March, 1929,it was provided that no elections of guardians should &quot;be held after the passing of the Act.The Act further empowered the Minister of Health, whereBoards of Guardians had been superseded, to make an Ordercontinuing appointed Guardians up to the 1st of April, 1935.The Government have always held the view thatthere is the gravest constitutional objection to a system under which local administration is divorced from the elected representatives of the people.     They have therefore decided that they will not in any case propose to make use of the powers under which appointed guardians may becontinued until 1935.     The result will be that after the1st April, 1930, tho poor law administration in each ofthe Unions affected will bo transferred to the councils of the counties and county boroughs concerned exactly a3in the oase of any other Union and the provisions of theLocal Government Act, 1929, will apply to those councils in the ordinary way.     With regard to the period up to
the 1st April next there is now no machinery in existencefor the election of guardians.    It is proposed, however,to substitute for those at present in office appointedguardians who will bo members of local authorities in thedifferent areas and who will be nominated &quot;by the localauthorities.     It Is hoped to make the change as from 1st August and the Minister of Health will take an early opportunity of conferring with the Sfcyors and Chairmen ofthe Councils concerned.A
