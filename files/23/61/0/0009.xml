RUSSIA. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRelations with.       called the attention,of the Cabinet to announce-raents in the Press to the effect that the Soviet(previous reference: Government had decided to accept the british cabinet 29(29) Con- invitation to send a responsible representativeelusion 3.)to London in order to discuss the most expeditionsprocedure for reaching a settlement of outstanding questions, and that their Ambassador in Paris wasto proceed to London for this purpose.Mr Henderson had not yet received an officialconfirmation of this, but he was already being pressed by Members of Parliament as to whetherofficial recognition could not take place without waiting for the re-assembly of Parliament.   Thisbrought up the question of the extension of theExport Credits Scheme to Russia, as proposed bythe Lord Privy Seal in Paper CP.-233 (29)   .The decision of the Cabinet on this latter subject is recorded in Conclusion 2, immediately following.The Cabinet agreed  That if the above informationproved correct, the Secretaryof State f&amp;r Foreign affairs should have authority to givethe emissary of the SovietGovernment all facilities for negotiations, including theuse of a cipher code, on theunderstanding that no accrediteddiplomatic representative couldbe received until after parliament had debated the subject.(See also Conclusion 2.)
EXPORT CREDITS.Extension of scheme toRussia.(previous reference:Cabinet 50(38), Con-clusion 1.)2. The Cabinet hcdTbefhre them a Memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal, raising as a matter of urgencythe question of an immediate extension of theExport Credits Scheme to Russia (Paper CP.-233(29)).   Mr CHoThomas stated in this memorandum that he was assured that considerable orders oouldbe secured at once by British firms if the facili-ties of the Export Credits Scheme were available.He indicated the following difficulties:    First,the political difficulty that the possible extensionof the Export Credits Scheme to Russia is animportant asset in our hands in negotiating ageneral settlement with Russia, so that if thisasset were given away now our hands would be weakened in discussing the general terms of thesettlement.   Second, the practical difficulty thatall applications for assistance under the scheme are examined by a statutory Committee.   ConsequentlyMr Thomas proposed that if the Export credits scheme were extended to Russia the first step would be for the President of the Board of Tradeto see the Chairman of the Advisory Committeeand to ascertain from him what the attitude of theCommittee would be.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the President of the Board ofTrade should see The Hon. Sidney Peel,the Chairman of the Advisory committee set up under the Export Credits Schemeand inform him, on behalf of theCabinet, that the Government proposedto ask the Advisory Committee toconsider the use of export creditsfor Russia on the same general lines as in the case of other countries:(b) That after his consultation with the hon. Sidney Peel the President of theBoard of Trade should have authorityto announce the decision of theGovernment in the House of commons before the Adjournment:-2-
(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should be at liberty,if he deems appropriate, in thecourse of his negotiations for there-establishment&quot;of relations withthe Soviet Government, to informtheir representative that theGovernment had taken this decision in regard to the extension of theExport Credits Scheme as an earnest of good faith in their desire tore-establish relations with Russia.-3-
THE naval construction programme.Announcem entin Parliament3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had communicated to the American Ambassadorthe gist of the statement he proposed to make inParliament the same afternoon in regard to theslowing down of the Naval Construction programme in relation to the negotiations for the reduction and limitation of naval armaments .    General Daweshad informed him that morning that president hoover agreed in and welcomed the terms of thestatement. Moreover, President Hoover, accordingto that morning&apos;s Press reports, had already made the first part of his own statement; and. in the next few day3 the Prime Ministerunderstood that the President would himselfannounce a reciprocal slowing down of naval construction.
EGYPT.Resignation ofthe HighCommissioner.(previous reference:Cabinet 27(29), Con-elusion 2.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to his colleagues correspondence he hadexchanged with the British High Commissioner inEgypt, in the course of which lord Lloyd asked mr Henderson to submit his resignation to theEiing, a request the Secretary of State had accepted with regret, accompanied by expressions of appreciation of Lord Lloyd&apos;3 services.After a discussion as to the form in which lord Lloyd&apos;s resignation should be announced inParliament, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of state forForeign Affairs, in answer to aPrivate Notice Question the same afternoon, should state the barefact that the High Commissionerhad offered his resignation andthat it had been accepted:-  (b) That if the question of lord lloyd&apos;s resignation was raised in the Horse of Commons, on the adjournment or otherwise,Mr Henderson should.have authorityto read Lord Lloyd&apos;s letter of resignation and his own reply,but to accompany the reading ofthe letters with a statement toshow that the difference ofopinion between Lord Lloyd andthe Home Government had existedlong before the present Governmentcame into office.
EGYPT. 5o  The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (Paper C.P.-(previous reference: 224 (.29)) covering the First Interim Report of theCabinet 27(29), Con- Cabinet Committee on Egypt, and asking the Cabinetelusion 2B)to approve in principle the following:-(a) An attempt to conclude a treatyof alliance with Egypt, freelyentered into on both sides, onthe general lines advocated byLord Milner in 1920.(b) The procedure favoured by theCommittee, namely, that the draft treaty should not be signed, but merely initialled, and handed tothe Egyptian Prime   Minister totake back with him to Egypt, onthe understanding that if andwhen it is accepted by theEgyptian Parliament, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, for their part, will put it into effect.(NOTE: The Prime Minister was absentduring the discussion of this item.)The discussion revealed that the proposals ofthe Committee, as summarised above, as well asthe procedure suggested in Paragraph 13 of theCommittee&apos;s Report, commended themselves to theCabinet.The Cabinet -(a) agreed that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs should have authority to proceed on the lines recommended by the Cabinet Committee(which includes, inter alia, a withdrawal of the British forces from Cairo and Alexandria):(b) took note that, subject to conclusion (a) the military aspects of the question would bediscussed at the Committee ofImperial Defence, to whom thePrime Minister would make astatement on the following day,and that the articles of thedraft Treaty would be examined in detail by the Cabinet Committee.
GERMANY.Reparations,(previous reference:Cabinet 29(29), Con-clusion 6(ii).RHINELANB.Evacuation of.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(29),  Con-clusion 1.)6. (NOTE:    The Prime Ministerreturned during thediscussion of this item.)The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet of the international diffi-culties which had arisen in regard to the selection of a meeting-place for the Conference to dealwith the Report of the Experts Committee on german Reparations.   The French refused to cometo London, the Germans to Belgium, and the belgians to The Hague.The Cabinet discussed the possibility of removing the French objections to coming toEngland, first, by making it clear that theBritish representatives would not expect toprovide Chairmen for both the proposed Commit-tees, and, second, by arranging the meeting ofthe Conference in some town such as Brighton,which would be free from the alleged influencesof London.A discussion took place on the relationhitherto established between the Conference on reparations and the decision to evacuate the rhineland.    It was realised that if, as atpresent seemed possible, the Conference had tobe postponed until after the Assembly of theLeague of Nations, the evacuation of the rhineland might be delayed until the nextcalendar year.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to impress on theFrench Government the import-ance of proceeding rapidly withthe Reparations Conferencein order to expedite the decision-
in regard to the evacuation ofthe Rhineland:    and, at suchmoment as he might deem most appropriate   to make clear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government werenot prepared to postpone indefi-nitely the evacuation of the rhineland, for which they mighthave to fix a date:(b) That in the event of the reparations Conference being arranged,(i) besides the Chancellorof the Exchequer and theSecretary of State forForeign Affairs, thePresident of the Boardof Trade should be oneof the British Delegates:(ii) the Secretary to the cabinet should be attached to the delegation in a Secretarialposition, working in the closest co-operation withthe Foreign Office, Treasury,and other Departments con-cerned.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (paper cp.-196 (29)) covering preparatory Memoranda byInterdepartmental JJommittees on the subjectsrespectively of the Operation of Dominion Legisla-tion and Existing Merchant Shipping Legislation,in connection with the Expert Inquiries recommended in the Report of the Imperial Conference^ 1926.In his covering Memorandum the Secretary of Stateput forward the following recommendations:-&quot;In these circumstances I recommend to my colleagues that I should beauthorised to inform the Dominionsthat it is the intention of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom that members of the Govern-raent should be their principalrepresentatives at the Committeeand Sub-Conference.   The membersof the Cabinet more particularly concerned are the President of theBoard of Trade (for MerchantShipping matters) and myself, andthese might, I think, be appointed,with the Attorney-General, asprincipal representatives.   Theyshould, I suggest, be empoweredto invite other Ministers to assist them who may be specially concernedwith the various problems underdiscussion.   At the same time, imagine that it may be necessaryto ask the Prime Minister to take some part in the proceedings;    thiswill be especially necessary if anyof the Dominion Prime Ministersattend.   But I should not antici-pate that it would be necessary for him to do more than appear at oneor two meetings , especially at thefirst and final meetings, unless anyquestion of primary importance ininter-Imperial relations should arise in the course of the discussions.Finally, I would propose that theInter-departmental Committee whichhas already devoted so much attentionto the subject, and contains repre-sentatives of all the Departmentsinterested, should be continued in being so that both its collectiveadvise and that of individual membersmay be available as required;    this procedure would have the further53 OPERATION7 DOMINIONjC-Legislation&quot;;.:D MERCHANTHIPPINGjGl SLAT ION.bppreviousReference:Cabinet 2(29), Con-elusion 12).
advantage that the members of theCommittee would provide liaison between the principal represents-tives and the Departments.   It would,I think, be of much advantage if the attorney-General could assume theChairmanship of this Committee,since, the problems involved being,as indicated above, primarily of a legal char acter   the main burden of conducting the Conference and repre-senting the vie^s of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdommust, I think, inevitably fall on him rThe Cabinet approved the above proposals.

the Governmentof Bombay toLegislationproposed by india.control Picket-in regard to certain legislation which theg and intimidation-dation in TradeDisputes .Government of Bombay have proposed,, with theconcurrence of the Government of India, to intro-duce at once, as measures of urgency,, for thepurpose of more effectively preventing orsuppressing the disorder and rioting which still,after many months, are liable to break out indirect or indirect connection with the longstandingtrade dispute in the Cotton Mill Industry.   the bills in question were as follows:-The Criminal - Intimidation Bill.In regard to this the Secretaryof State said that he could notcontest the strong evidence thatcriminal intimidation has been and is widely practised inconnection with the cotton industryand other trade disputes, and couldnot oppose the strong view of thelocal government, of Lord Irwin andothers whom he had consulted&quot; that,in the state of terrorism that has:prevailed in Bombay in the past year or more, it was necessary ^ to give thepolice and magistrates more drasticpowers to deal with the offence.Captain Benn considered it undesirable,however, to limit the offence toconnection with trade disputes, andpreferable to proceed againstcriminal intimidation, in whatevercircumstances it may be practised,where the Governor is prepared to notify that, for whatever cause, astate of emergency exists.The Picketing bill following fairlyclosely the Picketing Act   of 1927 passed herebut prescribing a severer penalty,to apply only in the Presidency area,to have validity for five years only,an d to be brought into effect only when the Governor notifies that itis necessary to do so.The Secretary of State felt that,in view of the Government&apos;s declaredintention to repeal the correspondingSections of the British Act, it wasimpossible for him, without hiscolleagues&apos; prior consent, to
authorise the introduction of this measure by the Bombay Government. &apos;The Bill for safeguarding Life and property,  following, mutatis mutandis,the same lines as the Bengal SecurityAct of 1926,  and applicable in the&quot;Presidency area&quot; only.The Secretary of State said thathe could not recommend refusal of permission to test the opinion ofthe local legislature by the intro-duction of a Bill of the kind proposed,though in the abstract its provisionsmight be open to criticism.The Secretary of State asked fora decision as to whether, in thecircumstances disclosed in his Note,he should inform Lord Goschen andSir P. Sykes (with whom he was in private correspondence) officiallythat he did not object to their^proceeding with the/Piokoting bill and the Bill for safeguarding life and Property provided that they agreed (as he understood they did)that the Criminal Intimidation bill had no specific reference to tradedisputes .The Cabinet approved the attitude of theSecretary of State for India, as summarised above, and agreed with him -(a) That the Introduction by the bombay Government of the PicketingBill should not be approved;(b) That the Criminal Intimidation bill and the Presidency Area EmergencySecurity Bill should be sanctionedif carried in the BombayLegislative Council.
INDIA.Hunger-strike ofcertain of the accused in theLahore Conspir-acy Case. .24.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (Paper C.P.-2-9 (29)) circulating for information a copy oftwo telegrams from the Government of India, thesecond of which indicated the possibility thatof two of the accused in the Lahore Conspiracytrial who are hunger-striking, one at any rateis not unlikely to die as the result.   TheSecretary of State asked his colleagues to agreewith him that the decision of the Punjaub Govern-ment and the Government of India is justified,namely, that no further concessions should begiven than those already granted in regard to special diet on medical grounds.The Cabinet confirmed the viewof the Secretary of State forIndia.

This is estimated to absorb about 300 men or one-quarter of the total number in question.(b) by a reduction (as regards thefuture) of the amount of jobcontracts and the substitutiontherefor of time work.   this change will enable the remaining900 men to be absorbed.Method (a) is known to have thesupport of the Trade Unions con-cerned but they should at once be consulted about method (b) before this change takes effect.It is also proposed that the admiralty should be empowered to renew the offer made in 1927 and 1928 to Establishedmen in redundant trades, to take their discharge on reduction withpensions and/or gratuities underthe Superannuation A.cts .The Admiralty are also examining, inconsultation with the men&apos;s repre-sentatlves, the question of theprovision of alternative work inthe Dockyards and of diverting work&quot;(as, for example, Destroyer construc-tion) which would otherwise becarried out by private firms .
In addition, the Committee recommended the Cabinetto approve a suggestion of the Minister of labour that the Admiralty should endeavour to give aslong notice as practicable to the local LabourlEx changes in regard to any discharges that mayhave to be made:    also that no undertaking couldor should be given that every individual now employed would be retained, - a point which wouldbe met if the public announcement of this policycontained a statement to the effect that it ishoped to be able to secure the absorption of alarge amount of labour which would otherwise bedisplaced.The Cabinet took note of theCommittee&apos;s recommendations with great satisfaction, and approved them.

BAST AFRICA.Policy in.(previous reference:Cabinet 13(29). Con-clusion 7 &amp;Appendix IV.)29.     The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (paper c.P.-202 (29)) covering the Report of Sir SamuelWilson on his recent visit to East Africa, as wellas a Strictly Confidential Note on certain aspectsof his visit.   In his Memorandum the Secretary ofState suggested that publication of the report should take place simultaneously here and in EastAfrica about the beginning of September.   LordPassfield also undertook to submit definite pro-posals for consideration at an early Meeting ofthe Cabinet.In a second Memorandum (Paper C.P.-228 (29))the Secretary of state expressed himself as favour-able to the granting of an unofficial majority onthe Kenya Legislative Council.   If Sir SamuelWilson&apos;s scheme is adopted he proposed that an instruction should be issued to the Governor toensure that the members nominated to representgeneral, including native, interests, should not represent an accretion to the settler element inthe Council but should be drawn from such classesas lawyers, missionaries,, business men, retiredofficials, etc., and that there should be nodistinction of race.    It would be quite open to theGovernor to nominate one or more Indians for thispurpose if suitable individuals could be found.As Sir Samuel Wilson&apos;s scheme is non-political in character, Lord Passfield suggested that it was unnecessary to submit the matter to a Joint Commit-tee of both Houses, as has been urged in certain quarters.   Facilities should be given for debate,but, subject to that, steps might be taken at once
IBS&quot;bo put it into effect.   He also urged that anyprotest from the Government of India should not beallowed to prevail if the Cabinet agreed with him that Sir Samuel Wilson&apos;s scheme is, on its own merits, both practicable and desirable.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State forthe Colonies and the Secretaryof State for India should take an early opportunity of discussingSir Samuel Wilson&apos;s report with the Committee that had beenformed by certain persons interested in this subject (LordLugard, the Archbishop of canterbury, and others), moreparticularly from the point ofview of what- procedure would be best to follow in regard tothe report,  e.g., by a joint select Committee of both Housesor otherwise;(b) That in the meanwhile the decisionof the Cabinet should be postponed.
