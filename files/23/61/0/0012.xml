MOST SECRET.217CABINET.STATEMENT BY PRIME MINISTER AT MEET IN G 0?CABINET HELD ON SEPTEMBER 12th, 1929,(Cabinet 33  (29).REDUCTION and limitation OfARMAMENTS.The PrimeMinister&apos;sConversationswith theAmericanAmbassador. &apos;THE PRIME MINISTER made a full statement to the Cabinet of the conversations with GeneralDawes on the question of reduction and limitationof naval armaments.THE PRIME MINISTER began by reminding hiscolleagues of the far-reaching responsibilities whichrested upon the British Navy.     He had requested the Admiralty to state the lowest naval strength which in their judgment would enable the Navy todischarge its responsibilities.     These responsibilitieswere two-fold:   a war responsibility, and a peaceresponsibility.       The war responsibility consisted notin preparations for war so much as in watching the preparations of others, and in building up to safetyin relation to those others.       for example, indealing with Japan we had always to bear in mind thepoint of view of Australia and New Zealand, for ifthis were ignored or neglected it might result indestroying the conception of a unified British fleet and in setting back the whole cause of naval dis-armament.     By far the greater part of our responsibilitywas for the maintenance of communication, of policingthe seas, -and in various ways much of our tradedepended upon this.THE PRIME MINISTER then dealt with thediscussions with President Hoover which had taken1.
place in regard to each of the categories of ships.First-class battleships had been dealt with at theWashington Conference, and at the Five power conference which it was proposed to summon shortly an attemptwould be made to lengthen by five years the life ofthese battleships in the hope later of scrapping thementirely.      It had been agreed to effect parity asregards destroyers and this was to be done on a tonfor ton basis.       This would involve America scrappinga number of destroyers.       This was important in viewof the fact that Japan had considerable superiority of this class of ship and that recent destroyersbuilt by Japan were not easily distinguishable fromcruisers.   Here there was a possibility of substantial reduction if our standard was accepted as the basis.President Hoover had agreed that at the FivePower Conference he would join with us in pressing forthe complete abolition of submarines.    It was very doubtful whether we should succeed in this attempt butif we failed, we should propose equal tonnage whichwould have the effect of compelling the United States toscrap some of their submarines.     An attempt would alsobe made to get Japan, France and Italy to accept aratio.        The recent submarines built by Japan were of such a nature as to mark a big departure in this type of craft.The conversations had turned in the main onthe question of cruisers.   American requirements andconditions differed from ours.     We had insisted thatthe number of our cruiser fleet was not a reflection
of the military mind but was the minimum required forour necessities and obligations.     President Hooverhad replied, in effect, that whilst accepting ourreasoning, the result did not suit his standpoint because he did not wish to build more.     He wanted our require-ments scaled down so as to make building by Americaunnecessary.     To that we had replied that our objectiondid not lie against building to any extent by theUnited States but only to the indirect consequences ofsuch building on other naval powers whom we could not leave out of the picture.     So far as the United states were concerned, we did not object to their exceeding the British minimum of 8&quot; cruisers, but if later Japandemanded a ratio of cruisers related to the figuresof the United States (e.g. 5 to 3.5), the result wouldbe that Japan might possess an 8&quot; cruiser fleet in the pacific which exceeded our total cruiser fleet on allseas of the world.       Such a situation would immediatelyarouse the hostility of Australia and New Zealand,would meet with opposition from the British Admiralty,and would excite public opinion at home.     It would beimpossible to carry out an agreement on these lines.At the Geneva Conference, the Prime Ministercontinued, our Admiralty wanted seventy cruisers.At a recent conversation (on Tuesday, June 25th, at.0.p.m. ) with General Dawes and Mr. Gibson, agreement had been reached on a basis of sixty cruisers.     that had been rejected by Washington, and the conversationshad to begin all over again.     At Geneva Mr. Gibson
had promised to find a yardstick with the object ofgiving us a surplus in tonnage.     We had agreed not onvalues but on the ingredients of the yardstick, andGeneral Dawes had been repeatedly asked to produce ayardstick compounded of tonnage, age and guns;    but ithas not been forthcoming.    After the failure of the initial conversations with General Dawes and Mr. Gibsonhe (the Prime Minister) had discussed the whole situation with Sir Charles Madden, who had agreed thatif the European situation was ao improved as to givereasonable security for ten or twelve years, with a chance of further improvement, he was willing to comedown to a strength of fifty cruisers and on that basis the recent conversations had proceeded, that is to say15 - 8rt cruisers and 35 6&quot; cruisers.    We had an awkwardclass of ships known as the &quot;Hawkins&quot; class.     Therewere four of these and to ease matters we had offered to scrap them prematurely and thus to give us twouniform categories.     We had proposed the standard year as against the American proposal of a long shipbuildingholiday.       To the latter there were strong businessobjections and it would involve discharges from the dockyards and serious dislocation of the labour market.In this connection the Prime Minister said that he hadbeen surprised to discover the lack of system in the giving out of contracts and the distribution ofemployment.    He hoped that as a result of his presentstudy of the question the building programmes would besystematically arranged year by year and the programme
px-oteeted &quot;by internationsl agreement.   He had proposed1936 as the standard year with a review of the agreement in 1935 sife that if a mistake had he en made there could he revision upwards or downwards.     He doubted whetherthe number of ships could be brought below fiftybut it would be possible to reduce their size and costand war power.       They would be changed from &quot;soldiers&quot;into &quot;policemen&quot;.We had laid down 15 8&quot; cruisers as ourirreducible minimum.     These would amount to about146,000 tons:     there would be in addition 35 6&quot;cruisers of varying tonnage which added to the 146,000tons would make 339,000 tons.     This was a big dropfrom the global tonnage proposed at Geneva.     To this the Americans had replied that on parity they wouldrequire 23 8&quot; cruisers of the 10,000 ton class(against our 15) and ten of the Omaha class each of ,000 or 7,500.tons.       We had pointed out that seventenths of the American figure of 23 would enable japan to put on the Pacific Ocean more than we had on the pacific, Atlantic and the Mediterranean.     We could not agree to this.       Yesterday a message had been receivedfrom Washington stating that the Naval Board were willingto come down to 21 8&quot; cruisers, would keep the &quot;Omahas&quot;and would build 5 cruisers with 6&quot; guns, absorbing in all315,000 tons against our 339,000 tons.    This offer was accompanied by a personal message from President Hooverto the Prime Minister, taking note of the offer of theNaval Board and pointing out that the difference was now
reduced to whether three of the American cruisers wereto he of the 8&quot; and 10,000 ton type or some alternativesuch as 4 cruisers of 7,500 tons each, or 3 of 10,000tons carrying 6&quot; guns.       President Hoover was soconvinced that the difference now remaining could hecompromised that he expressed the wish that the PrimeMinister should visit Washington.THE PRIME MINISTER proceeding said he had taken the attitude that he would not go to Washington without an agreement beforehand.       In Geneva however last weekhe had &quot;become deeply sensible of the calamitous result to world peace if he now failed to go to Washington.     Hewas therefore going as much on internationsl as on navalgrounds.       There was agreement on everything except on how the United States were to use 30,000 tons;     therewas a clear understanding that, we could not agree to 81United States 8&quot; cruisers as that would mean that japan would be entitled on Its ratio to build more cruisers of that type than all we possessed of the same class inthe other seas.     To agree to that would mean-Australia breaking away, the eollapse of all agreement and an enormous damage to the peace of the world.President Hoover had suggested that he (the PrimeMinister ) should make the visit a demonstration of friendship but to that he had said that he wished to cometo discuss the small remaining difficulties face to face,and the definite announcement that the visit was to takeplace had, according to telegrams received that day from the British Ambassador at Washington, been received in America with great enthusiasm.
The Admiralty were now engaged in consideringmethods of economic stabilisation which would save usmoney and they were also looking into the finances of theprogramme.     We should have to scrap and build in sucha way as to secure 50 cruisers in 1936.      Including thefour of the &quot;Hawkins&quot; type and three others prematurelyscrapped, twenty two cruisers would have to be scrappedbetween now and 1936.THE FIRST LORD, in reply to the Prime Minister,said that over the whole period the saving should beanything between 6-1 millions and 10 millions.THE PR1MB MINISTER, continuing, said thatin any case it would be a considerable saving and thefigures were a maximum and could be reduced if circumstances permitted.     He did not foresee any further substantial reduction unless as the result of agreementwith the Five Powers.     He now proposed to summon aconference of the Five Powers.     President Hoover had suggested December, but in the view of our officials sometime in January was to be preferred.THE FIRST LORD said he had nothing to add tothe Prime Minister&apos;s statement as the ground had been covered, but he himself had been impressed by thesupport accorded to the Prime Minister by the Admiralty.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had found theBoard of Admiralty reasonable and helpful and thefigures he had put forward were the very best he could possibly hope to obtain.In reply to the Lord President of the council the Prime Minister said that he had repeatedly explained
to the United States that our objection was not to navalbuilding by them but to the indirect effect of theirbuilding upon our international position.In reply to the Secretary of State for Air, thePrime Minister said that fifty cruisers embraced thewhole unified fleet of the Empire,  of which all the partswere inter-dependent.       Fifteen cruisers is what we havenow and if we agree on that figure we shall lay down no more 8&quot; cruisers until about 1940.Reverting to the attitude of the Admiralty, thePrime Minister emphasised the fact that the Board had been consulted on every point and that the Board were satisfiedthat the British proposals provided security in thepresent state of the world.THE FIRST LORD and THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORDOMINION AFFAIRS AND THE COLONIES pointed out that thepresent figures involved a reduction of 150,000 tons,or 30$ on the Geneva figures.THE PRIME MINISTER said,  in reply to LordParmoor, that the 30,000 tons in dispute between us was capable of adjustment in one of two ways,  but not inthe,  way of an American increase beyond 18 8&quot; cruisers.THE SECRETARY OF SUITE FOR WAR pointed out thata break-down would not leave things as they are.     Therewould be a tendency, to go in the opposite direction.The whole question of disarmament hinged on a beginningbeing made however small. If the Prime Ministers planwere achieved, it would be, for the first time, a realbeginning, and for his part he wished him &quot;God Speed&quot;binthe States.
THE FIRST LORD asked, the Secretary of State forWar if his remarks were to &quot;be taken as authorising thePrime Minister to settle on a figure of El cruisers for theUnited States.     At present the Admiralty were behind thePrime Minister, but if the Americans were given 21 cruisers,the Admiralty would say that the Prime Minister had passed the point of safety.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR said he wouldrisk a little Admiralty opposition rather than a break-down.THE PRIME MINISTER said he had arranged latelast night that Sir Charles Madden, who was in Scotland,should have the proposals put to him, and a message had come to-day saying that Sir Charles Madden agreed with : i.;-the reply which the Prime Minister proposed to sent to washington.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION AFFAIRS ANDTHE COLONIES and the LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL bothexpressed the view that the whole-hearted support of theAdmiralty was indispensable.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in connection withthe 8&quot; cruisers, President Hoover had stressed theimportance of radius.       Radius meant tonnage not guns, andit was quite open to the United States to take their30,000 tons in units of 10,000 which w,ould give them theradius, provided they restricted their guns to 6&quot;.TEE PRIME MINISTER said, in conclusion, thatthis was the first real opportunity he had had of meetinghis colleagues, and making a fully rounded statement.
It was only very late on the previous evening that matters had reached the stage which he had now reported to hiscolleagues.THB SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DOMINION affairs and THE 60L0NIES expressed his gratification with thePrime Minister&apos;s statement.THE PRIME MINISTER reminded the Cabinet thatthere would be a meeting of the Cabinet on the 25thgeptember, and that while he would not be able to be inthe House on the Opening of Parliament, he thought thatarrangements for the opening weeks were well in hand.(Intld. )     J.
