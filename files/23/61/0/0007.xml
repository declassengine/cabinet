The financial effect of this change will&quot; beto raise the present Exchequer contribution from  12,000,000 to 15,500,000 per annum. As explained in the Memorandum, theother measures required to place the finance of the Fund on asatisfactory footing are being examined in accordance with the directions of the Cabinet.It was agreed that it should be made clear in the Bill that its provisions will not apply to Northern Ireland.The Minister of Health warned the Committee that the increasein the Exchequer contribution in the case of the UnemployedInsurance scheme must inevitably revive the question of therestoration of the Exchequer contribution in the case of the national health Insurance scheme to the position in force prior to the enactment of the Economy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1926.The Committee agreed In pursuance of Cabinet 27 (29), Conclusion 5 (a), toauthorise the introduction in the House of Commons ofthe Unemployment Insurance (No. 2) Bill, 1929, in theform of the draft annexed to H.A. 10 (29), subject tothe amendments mentioned above and to any drafting orother minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable, on the understanding that every effort will bemade to secure the passage of the Bill into law before the adjournment.The Housing Acts(Kevision of-Contributions) Bill.2.

In pursuance of Cabinet 27 (29), Conclusion 5 (a), toauthorise the introduction in the House of Commons ofthe Housing Acts (Revision of Contributions) 15iliin the form of the draft annexed to H.A. 11 (29,!,subject to the above amendment and to any otherdrafting or other minor alterations which may be loiiuiinecessary or desirable, on the understanding that everyeffort will be made to secure the passage of the Hi!!,i v::^riivj    into law before the adjournment.
3. With reference to Cabinet 26 (29), Conclusion 5, theCommittee had under consideration a Memorandum by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury (H.A. 12 (29)) covering theDevelopment (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Bill, the primary object of which is to obtain Parliamentary power to give financialassistance to railways (including tubes) and other public utilitycompanies trading for profit in order that they may take up schemesof development, reconstruction and re-equipment which would otherwise not be put in hand at present. The financial assistance is to take the form of either a State guarantee to loans raised forthese purposes, or a grant from the Exchequer towards the interest on loans raised for these purposes, such grants running for a period not exceeding 15 years. In addition, Part II of the Bill places theoperations of the Unemployment Grants Committee upon a statutoryfooting, and limits the operations of that Committee to LocalAuthorities and Public Utility Undertakings not operating on a profit making basis.The Committee accepted the following amendments to theBill-Clause 1 (1), line 17, for &quot;and &quot; read &quot;or.&quot;Clause 2 (2), line 22, and clause 4 (2), line 29, for &quot; immediatefuture&quot; read &quot;near future.&quot;Clause 2 (3), line 26, after &quot; aforesaid &quot; insert &quot;lawfully.&quot;Clause  5  (2),  lines  4 and  5,    Omit  &quot; or the Minister ofLabour.&quot;Clause 6 (2), line 14, foi &quot; five&quot; read &quot; three.&quot;and also requested Parliamentary Counsel to consider (1) the substitution in clause 3 for the expression &quot;powerlighting or water &quot; or some such expression as&quot; electricity, gas or water,&quot; and(2) The wording of clause 4 (3) so as to ensure that a LocalAuthority which devotes the profits of an undertaking tothe relief of rates is not excluded from the benefits of theBill.The suggestion was made that under the definition of theexpression &quot; public utility undertaking &quot; in clause 3, the steamshipservices of railway companies would be included, but that ordinaryshipping would be excluded, and it was pointed out that the coast-wise shipping interests, which were already apprehensive of theeffects upon them of the Governments policy in regard to assistingrailway development, would certainly claim to be accorded equaltreatment with railway shipping services.In this connexion reference was made to the safeguards in clause 1 (1) and clause 2 (1) of the Bill, and it was generally agreedthat if it was decided that any railway ancillary services should be excluded, it would be preferable to rely on exclusion by administra-tive action rather than by definition in the Bill.The Committee agreed In pursuance of Cabinet 27 (29), Conclusion 5 (a), toauthorise the introduction in the House of Commons of theDevelopment (Loan Guarantees and Grants) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A. 12 (29), subject to the amendments indicated above and to any other drafting orminor alterations which may be found necessary or desirable, with a view to the passage of the Bill into law before the adjournment.4.

Isle of Man (Customs) Bill, 1929, which is the usual annual Bilfconfirming the Customs Resolutions of the Manx Legislature.The Committee agreed In pursuance of Cabinet 27 (29), Conclusion 5 (a), toauthorise the introduction in the House of Commons of th&amp;Isle of Man (Customs) Bill, 1929, in the form of the draft annexed to H.A. 13 (29), subject to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable,on the understanding that every effort will be made tosecure the passage of the Bill into law before the adjournment.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 5, 1929.
