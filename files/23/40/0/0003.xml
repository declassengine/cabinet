The &quot;western front,:The german withdrawal.1. THE Director of Military Operations stated that the germans were offering considerable resistance as far south as St. Quentin,and the present indications were that they would make a stand onthe Hindenburg line in this sector. South of St., Quentin theposition was more obscnre. Information had now been received that the demolition of villages by the Germans had begun on theI()th March, while the actual burning of houses and blowing up ofcross-roads took place on the 16th March. Of the civil populationall women between 17 and 35 had been taken to Maubeuge.Mesopotamia. 9  The. Directory of Military Operations reported that GeneralMaude was in touch&apos;with the Turks on the River Diala, 100 milesby river North of Baghdad and within 40 miles of Khanikin, fromwhich place the Russians, on their side, were believed to be 50 milesdistant, but this was conjecture as information from there was coming in very slowly. He gave particulars of Turkish strengthsand dispositions in this part of Mesopotamia..3. The Director of Military Operations reported that the GrandDuke Nicholas had left his headquarters in the Caucasus to take upthe Chief Command, though this did not necessarily signify that the command would be confirmed. Meanwhile, General Yudenitch hadtaken over the Command in the Caucasus.Submarines.4. The First Sea Lord reported two engagements with enemy submarines, including a detailed account of an engagement betweenthe Decoy-ship Q. 19 and an enemy submarine on the 12th March,in which Q. 19 was sunk, and probably the submarine also. he further gave the mercantile losses for the previous twenty-four hours,confirming the sinking, 25 miles east of The Start, of the &quot; Rotorua.&quot;Permission to sendWomen andChildren to Canada.5. The First Sea Lord reported that the &quot; Olympic &quot; was shortlyleaving for Canada to bring over Canadian troops. As she was going almost empty it would be possible, if the existing Board ofTrade Regulations (War Cabinet 100, Minute 14) were waived, totake a large number of Canadian women and children, many ofwhom were destitute, back to their homes.In view of the fact that the &quot;Olympic&quot; is armed, very wellprovided with boats, and will be escorted through the submarinezone, the Imperial War Cabinet decided that : In this case permission for   the conveyance of women andchildren to Canada should be given.Possibility ofSecuring peace in 1917.6. On the initiative of General Smnts, a full discussion took placeon the question of the possibility of exploiting such moderate degreeof military success as was likely to be achieved this summer inorder to secure a reasonable peace, even if that meant some modifica-tion of the maximum demands which we had publicly defined. Itwas argued, on the ono hand, that the submarine campaign and thepossibility of deflection among our Allies might render the situationvery uncertain alter this year, while Germany would fight withdesperate resolution against any policy which could be represented to her people as some of our public statements had been asa policy of the destruction of the German nation. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that Germany had staked everything on a supreme effort this year, she would have few reserves left for nextyear, and that her allies were already markedly on the&apos; downgrade ;whereas the resources of the Entente Powers, even leaving America
Detailed  ^ 7. In the course of the discussion the question of the relativeConsideration of       importance of the various desiderata in the Terms of Peace, and ofeace  erms. desirability of fixing upon a list of irreducible minima, was raised. The possibility of referring certain less vitally essentialmatters to a European Conference was also considered, though it was realised that the conclusions of such a Conference would have in factto be based on the actual military situation at the end of the War.A proposal that the consideration of these and kindred questions affecting the Terms of Peace should, in the first instance, be worked out by a Committee of the Imperial War Cabinet, was negatived.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should prepare, for a subsequent Meeting, a full exposition of the . maindesiderata in the Terms of Peace, and of their relative importance.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 24,1917.oout of account, had not reached their fullest development. It was extremely improbable, moreover, that any moderate measure ofsuccess on our part this year would bring Germany into a frame of mind in which she would consider for a moment such Terms ofPeace as would be regarded by us as of the most reasonablecharacter. The only motive that would perhaps compel her to givereasonable terms was sheer famine, but in that case we could onlygain by continuing till the pinch of famine became even more acute.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Their enquiries should be based on the assumptions that -(a.) The British Empire, in conjunction with our Allies,should put forth the whole of its military strength in 1917, with the object of bringing the enemy to terms in that year. r(b.) The British Empire should also /make suchpreparations as would enable it to put forth thewhole of its strength throughout 1918, if the desired results could not be achieved in 1917.
