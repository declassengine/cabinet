With reference to War Cabinet, 100, Minute 17, the ImperialThe Czar. War Cabinet decided that In&quot; the interests of his personal safety, it was of the first importance that the Tsar should leave Russia at theearliest possible date. On a review of the political considerations involved, and more particularly of thedesirability of avoiding the risk of his being exposed tohostile intrigue in the event of residence in neutral countries, they reached the conclusion that the best plan would be to invite the Tsar, together with the Empressand their family, to take up his residence in this country,although it should be distinctly understood that theyshould not ieave this country during-, the war except withthe consent of the British Government.
The Imperial War Cabinet accordingly authorised The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to send a telegram in this sense to the British Ambassador at Petrogradsuperseding the telegram (No. 534) sent on the previous day in accordance with the decision of the War Cabinet(War Cabinet, 100, Minute 17).Foreign Affairs 6.
