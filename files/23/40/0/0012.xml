Shipping: j. THE Secretary stated that the Shipping Controller hadProposals ot asked him to press that the whole of the  War Cabinet should&apos;Con^oUer ^e Present m  tne afternoon at the meeting between the PrimeMinister and Sir Joseph Maclay&apos;s Shipping Committee, as he hadimportant proposals to bring forward.It was agreed that the decision on these matters should be leftto the Prime Minister and Lord Curzon.The Western3* ron t.Comparison ofBritish andGerman Capturesof Hostile Guns.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig had held a conference with GeneralJNiiveile, and h-id reached complete agreement in regard to futureplans of operations.He stated that information, was now coming to hand withreference to the German casualties sustained in the recent fighting,and it was clear that they exceeded those incurred by the enemy in any previous battle of the same duration.The British casualties during these operations now totalled60,000, of which 3.000 had. occurred during the last twenty-four hours. The British offensive had started on the 9th April, andthe total of 60,000 included all casualties up to the present fromthat date, as compared with .112,000 during the correspondingperiod of the Somme Battle. The French offensive had commencedon. the 10th April, and their casualties totalled 82,000.The German claim to have captured 650 prisoners in thecourse of their recent counter-attack was probably correct.The German divisions in reserve and not yet engaged had, atthe outset of the battle, numbered 49. These had now beenreduced to 15 divisions, 10 of which were opposed to the Britishand 5 to the French front. The British Army still had 12 divisions in reserve which had not yet been employed, and the french had 29.The Prime Minister communicated the following figures, whichhad been furnished to him by the War Office : .British captures of German guns since the beginning of the war.. 409German captures of British guns since the beginning of the war..      84The Director of Military Operations stated that since April1915 only 4 British guns had been- lost on the Western Front; he considered 84 to be an outside estimate of the German captures.General Maurice undertook to check these figures for the PrimeMinister.     , -Mesopotamia. 3. The  Director of Military Operations stated that the onlybar to the exploitation of General Maude&apos;s successive victories inMesopotamia, to the extent of the complete crushing of the Turkishpower in these regions, was the regrettable inability of theRussians to take the offensive, and instanced the fact thatGeneral Maude had now sticcessfully repulsed the advance ofthe 13th Turkish Corps. Plad the Russians been in a position to engage and hold this corps, in all probability General Maude wouldhave been able to have annihilated the 18th Corp?.The Balkans. 4. The Director of Military Operations reported that the Britishoffensive in the Balkans had begun, and that two divisions hadbeen launched to the attack, one of which had reached and held itsobjective, while the other had been unsuccessful. These operationscomprised the first incident in General sarrail&apos;s offensive in that region, the French attacks having still to be launched.
Heavy Loss ofMerchant Ships.5. The Imperial War Cabinet observed with concern the very heavy losses from mines and submarined on the previous day,aggregating nearly 40,000 gross tons of British and nearly 9,000gross tons of Allied and Neutral Shipping.Convoying ofMerchant vessels.6. With reference to War Cabinet 124, Minute 8, the First sea lord stated that, as the convoy system required an elaborateorganisation and a large number of destroyers, the Admiralty hadnot yet been able to adopt it. The main difficulty was that therewere no destroyers available at the present time. If had even been necessary temporarily to reduce the destroyers with the GrandFleet to a figure far below the safety limit, in order to afford some protection to trade. He stated, however, that the present intentionof the Admiralty was to introduce a system whereby groups ofmerchant ships would be convoyed by a cruiser across the Atlantic,if the necessary cruisers could be provided, and as they entered thesubmarine danger zone (whether outward or homeward, bound),they would be escorted by destroyers when the required numberbecame available.Destroyers fromthe United States.7. The First Sea Lord stated that the United States were as yetonly sending six destroyers to European waters. He estimated thatthe maximum, number which they could provide would be thirty-six.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Lord Robert Cecil should send a telegram to Mr. Balfour,impressing upon him as a matter of the utmost urgencythe importance of inducing President Wilson to exercise his personal authority in order to secure the desjjatch ofall available destroyers.Construction of destroyers.8. The First Sea Lord stated that destroyers were being built as rapidly as possible, but the output, for reasons which he explained to the Cabinet, did not exceed six a month, and there were considerable losses from mines, belligerent action, and collision.British Sea Power:Demand for reduction ofOverseasCommitments.9. The First Sea Lord drew the attention of the Imperial WarCabinet to what he regarded as a fundamental error in &quot;making ademand on our maritime resources which could not be met withthe present strength of the Navy. We were still proceeding on theassumption that we had complete command of the sea, whereas infact we had not, owing to the submarine menace. The provisionof escorts for ships carrying coolies and labourers being brought from China and elsewhere, the escorting of hospital ships rendered necessary by recent German action, and, above all, the provision ofescorts for the purposes of our various overseas Expeditions, werethrowing an intolerable strain on the Admiralty and were dissipatingour naval forces in a manner which entirely precluded our being-ins ufiicient strength anywhere to ensure reasonable safety for ouroversea communications. Admiral Jellicoe strongly urged the paramount and immediate necessity of reducing our. commitments in distant seas, and more particularly in the Balkans.Prisoners of War:Stoppage ofParcels.124, Minute 12, thea reply had now been10. With reference to War CabinetSecretary of State for War reported, thatreceived from our Representative with the Dutch Government tothe effect that the German Government did not intend to stop the transmission of parcels to prisoners of war in Germany, but that
the inspection of such parcels was now more strictly conducted thanformerly, owing to their discovery that the French had smuggledinstruments of sabotage through these parcels.Lord Derby said that he would circulate a paper in the courseof a day or two embodying his proposals,Bombardment of dunkirk.Loss of a FrenchDestroyer.Star Shell.II. The First Sea Lord reported a ten-minutes&apos; bombardmentof Dunkirk the previous night. He further reported the sinking ofa French destroyer.12. The First Sea Lord stated that the Admiralty had nowsucceeded in reproducing the German star shell, which wasimmeasurably superior to anything of the kind in our service. he hoped that the Army would also benefit from this fact, which was due to the recovery of an unexploded German star shell atRamsgate, and to our copying it.Seaplane Attackon GermanDestroyers.13. The First Sea Lord gave details of a recent attack by-seaplanes on German destroyers, one of which was believed to havebeen sunk.Torpedoing ofTransport&quot; Ballarat.&quot;14. The First Sea Lord reported the torpedoing of the transport&quot;Ballarat&quot; near the Scilly Islands, with some 1,600 australian troops on board. All the troops had been saved, and, when lastheard of, the transport was still afloat.Seaplanes againstSubmarines.15. The First Sea Lord reported several actions with enemy submarines, including one in which a British seaplane had been engaged. Admiral Jellicoe stated that the provision of two-enginedseaplanes, some of which were now available, had enabled theAdmiralty to extend the use of these aircraft.imperial preference andEmigration.16. The Imperial War Cabinet considered Mr. Massey&apos;resolution on Imperial Preference and Emigration as amended by Mr. Long&apos;s Drafting Committee (Imperial War Cabinet 11,Minute 10). The amended resolution was in the following terms : The time has arrived when all possible encouragement shouldbe given to the development of Imperial resources, andespecially to making the Empire independent of othercountries in respect of food supplies, raw materials, and essential industries. With these objects in view this conference expresses itself in favour of &quot; (1.) A system by which each part of the Empire,having due regard to the interests of our Allies,will give specially favourable treatment and facilities to the produce and manufactures ofother parts of the Empire.&quot; (2). Arrangements by which intending emigrants fromthe United Kingdom may be induced to settle in countries under the British Flag.&quot;General Smuts pointed out that the instructions with whichhe had come to the present Conference had not included the settle-ment of a definite Imperial Tariff system on this occasion, and he considered that the wording of the resolution went further than
really was intended. All that was required, in his opinion, was torecognise the principle, namely, that in any future arrangement which included tariffs, Preference should he granted, and not to lay down a policy. South Africa certainly had no objection to theprinciple of Preference, inasmuch as she had already applied itherself. He suggested that it might be possible to draft the resolu-tion in a form which more clearly expressed the situation.The Prime Minister suggested that a new draft resolutionmight be drawn up, emphasising, first of all, the complete freedomof each Government in the Empire to adopt any economic systemit chose ; secondly, that where there are customs duties thoseduties should be more favourable to the produce and manufacturesof other countries in the Empire; and, thirdly, that the principleof Preference should be carried out in any arrangements for theimprovement of communications and transportation, or in any other way in which it could be usefully applied.It was pointed out that a draft on these lines had been beforethe Committee, but had been objected to by Mr. Henderson on theground that it recalled too vividly past controversies.The discussion was interrupted in order that a draft resolutionshould be drawn up on the lines suggested by the Prime Minister,and to enable Mr. Henderson to be present.On Mr. Iienderson&apos;s arrival the discussion was resumed on thedraft resolution so drawn up. Mr. Henderson stated that if theresolution were adopted in this form he would be obliged to recordhis dissent, as he could not countenance the Government holding out the hope of an extension of a wider range of duties, which the amended resolution did by implication.It was also pointed out that the amended resolution, in so faras it stated the situation in more definite terms, might not onlyevoke more direct controversy in the United Kingdom, but alsocreate anxiety among our Allies, more particularly in the UnitedStates.Mr. Massey also drew attention to the possibility of an intervaloccurring immediately on the conclusion of the war, during whichthe principle of Preference might not yet be in operation; but itwas pointed out in reply to this that the provisions of the Parisresolutions, as wrell as the general situation that was likely tocontinue for some time after the immediate conclusion of hostilities,would preclude such a possibility.Lord Robert Cecil suggested that General Smuts&apos; objectionwould really be met if for the words &quot; a system by which,&quot; at thebeginning of sub-head (i) of the resolution, were substituted &quot; theprinciple that.&quot; This would make it clear that what was contern-plated was not the establishment of a rigid system, but theapplication by the different Governments, in their own fashion, ofa common principle.In view of the desirability of securing a unanimous decision,General Smuts stated that, though he still preferred the moreexplicit draft, he would not stand on his objection, more particularly if Lord Robert Cecil&apos;s suggested amendment were adopted.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that The resolution as framed by the Colonial Secretary,^ Com-mittee should be amended so that sub-head (i) should read &quot; The principle that each part of the Empire,having due regard to the interests of our Allies, shall,give specially favourable treatment and facilities to-the produce and manufactures of other parts of theEmpire.&quot;&apos; [1142-12]C
Report of lord milner&apos;sCommittee on the paris Resolutions.17. The Imperial War Cabinet considered the Report of lord milner&apos;s Committee on Terms of Peace (Economic and Non-Terri-torial Desiderata).AVith reference to Conclusion .1, dealing with the Paris reso-resolutions. the Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out that no reference was made to the period of continued prohibition of enemy-trade for a period after the war, which was important to preventour slipping back into the old situation, during the interval whichmight precede our making our own fiscal arrangements. He also considered that this might be taken as a going back on the policypreviously agreed upon. It was, however, pointed out that therewas no intention of making the Report of the Committee public.Indemnities.18. The Imperial War Cabinet also discussed Conclusion 4,with reference to indemnities, and the suggestion was made that insufficient stress had perhaps been laid on the idea of indemnityin cash. It was pointed out that a cash indemnity would certainly be required for Belgium, and that such a form of indemnity, though perhaps not most useful from the point of view of the Allies, wouldbe very effective in crippling Germany. It was pointed out, how-ever, that the amount of pecuniary indemnity payable by germany was relatively small, inasmuch as the overwhelming bulk of hercapital was fixed in the shape of industrial plant and other meansof production, including some 3,000,000 tons of shipping still inGerman ports.The suggestion was also made that some of &quot;the german colonies, which might otherwise be given back, could be held asa pledge for the payment of an indemnity; but it was pointedout that the Report of Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee on TerritorialDesiderata was not likely to favour the idea of the restoration ofany of the German colonies.Limitation ofArmaments, andLeague of Nations.19. With reference to Conclusion 6 of Lord Milner&apos;s Com-mittee, the Prime Minister expressed the view that the Committeehad rather thrown cold water on the idea of a League of Nations,and had not dealt at all with the question of disarmament orlimitation of armaments, or of the sanctions by which the conclu-sions of a League of Nations, or the provisions of any agreement forthe limitation of armaments, should be enforced. He thought thatthere would be great disappointment if it were thought that at theend of the war nothing could be done in these directions.With regard to the limitation of armaments, Lord Robert Cecilpointed out that he had submitted a Memorandum in which thiswas advocated, but confessed that he had been driven out of hisposition by the criticisms contained in an examination of that memorandum by Sir Eyre Crowe.In the discussion which ensued it was pointed out that one ofthe first difficulties in the way was that of the standard to beestablished. The existence of our own dominating sea-power,coupled with the sea-power of America, was undoubtedly the bestguarantee for peace ; but it was probably one of the very first things which the members of an international body would agree should be cut down.Then, again, there was the difficulty of the manner in which any limitation could be prescribed. Napoleon&apos;s attempt to limit the prussian army to a definite numerical strength had been directly responsible for the creation of the Prussian military system.Further, it was impossible to draw the line as to whatconstituted armaments. In the present war Germany had beenable for two years and more to hold her own against the rest of the
world, in armaments, owing to her effective industrial organisation.That organisation had not been purely planned for war ; its adap-tation to military purposes had been a matter of improvisation inGermany as well as in Allied countries. But the fact remainedthat it was an essential part of Germany&apos;s military strength.Lastly, there was the difficulty that the Powers who were most likely to use their armaments in order to forward their ambitionswere the ones who would be least willing to fall in whole-heartedlyand honestly with any scheme of limitation of armaments thatmight be agreed upon.With regard to the question of a League of Nations, lord robert Cecil pointed out that there were really two main alterna-tives, namely, an International Court of Arbitration or asystem of. International Conference and Consultation. He did notbelieve that matters affecting the vital interests of the BritishEmpire could possibly be submitted to the decisions of an Inter-national Tribunal. On the other hand, he did believe that a greatdeal could be effected if the habit of conference and consultationcould once be firmly established. He thought one of the chiefcauses of international conflict lay in the fact that treaty termsattempted to settle for all time matters that were inherently subjectto variation and development. Under a system of international conferences the situation could be periodically reviewed. To begin with, at any rate, the.most hopeful plan probably was to say that noone should declare war till a Conference of all the Powers had been summoned, the summoning and decision of such a Conferencetaking place within a reasonable time.In the discussion which ensued it was pointed out that aperiodical Conference to readjust the map of Europe might possiblycreate causes of friction as well as allay them.There was the further difficulty that, under any procedure which could be suggested for a League of Nations, or for a Confer-ence of Nations, called together to deal with such problems as thoseof nationality, a united Italy could never have come into being, orthe subject races&apos; of the Ottoman Empire delivered from Turkishoppression.Lord Milner said that he did not believe that any attempt toestablish an International Court would be successful or be a goodthing in itself; but he did believe that a great advance could bemade if the nations who entered into the next Treaty of Peacebound themselves not to go to war without submitting their case toa Conference. Failure to do so should be a cause of war for allthe Powers who were party to the Treaty. The Conference, how-ever, could not be a Court binding the nations who took part in itto enforce its decisions Such a Conference, in his opinion, would,in all probability, have prevented the outbreak of the present war.Sir Robert Borden expressed the view that the real basis of future peace must be the public opinion of the world.&apos; The present war had demonstrated the futility of - treaties and conventions whennations were determined to violate them. He laid particular stress on the last sentence in Conclusion 6 of Lord Milner&apos;s Committee that which referred to discussion with our Allies and with theUnited States. He considered that the United States and theBritish Empire in agreement could do more than anything else tomaintain the peace of the world.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that-The mimrtes of Lord Milner&apos;s Committe, as &quot;well as lord Robert OeciPs and&apos; Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;s memoranda, andother papers bearing on the subject, should be circulated, andthe discussion resumed at their next- meeting.(Initialled)        D. LI. G.&apos;2, Whitehall-Gardens, S.W.,April 26, 1917.
