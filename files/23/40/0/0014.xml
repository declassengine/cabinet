Future sessions of imperial cabinet.1. THE Prime Minister wished to say a word about the greatexperiment of setting up a real Imperial War Cabinet which had just been concluded. From the point of view of the british members, the experiment had been an unqualified success. Thepresence of the Dominion representatives had proved not merely anencouragement but a real help to the British members, and had enabled them together to come to very important conclusions. the experiment had worked even better than he had anticipated ; theImperial War Cabinet had, in fact, been a real Cabinet, which had discussed things intimately and with the fullest knowledge of allthe material facts.In the view of the British members, it would be a great mistakeand a great misfortune if the experiment were not repeated andincorporated in the machinery of the British Empire. To effect this, they considered that Sessions of the Imperial Cabinet, as distinct from the British Cabinet, should be convened annually, andthat as an institution the Imperial Cabinet should have an AnnualSession, though that did not preclude the summoning of a special session if questions of urgency arose in the interval. While thewar was in progress the main business of such a Session would be to review the position of the war ; apart from that, it would naturallyreview questions of foreign policy, Imperial defence, and othermatters of common, concern. It was to him inconceivable that inthe future the Dominions should be neither fully informed norconsulted on questions which might lead to war.As regards the constitution of the future Imperial Cabinets,he wished to point out that in the present case the dominion representatives sat together with the members of the small british war Cabinet, which was also an experiment It was not certain whether that experiment would last. If there were to be aresurrection of the old British Cabinet system it would be obviouslyimpossible to graft an Imperial Cabinet on to a Cabinet of twentyor more members. The Imperial Cabinet would have to be con-stituted differently, and the only British representatives would bethe Prime Minister and the representatives of those departments which were directly concerned with Imperial affairs, such as theForeign Office, the Colonial Office, the India Office, and, perhaps,the War Office and Admiralty. It would, in fact, be a delegation of the British Cabinet meeting the Prime Ministers of theDominions. The Dominion representatives should be the PrimeMinisters. If, however, there were a special reason which pre-vented a Prime Minister from attending, he should have the exceptional right of nominating a deputy ; but it should be clearly understood that the deputy should be one who would attend withthe same authority as the Prime Minister whom he represented.It was also clear to him that it was an essential part of any con-stitution of this kind that there should be a representative of indian addition to the Secretary of State.He wished, on behalf of the British Cabinet and on behalf ofthe people of the United Kingdom, to thank the representativesof the Dominions and of India for the great assistance they hadrendered imder the trying conditions of the present struggle.Their presence had been a real source of strength.Sir Robert Borden, in thanking the Prime Minister for hisreferences to the help rendered by the Dominion representatives,wished to say that the Session had been a help and education to all of them. For twenty years he had endeavoured to realise what wasmeant by the task of governing the British Empire, and on many occasions both in Canada and in the United States ho had given public expression to his conception of the magnitude of that task and its complexity as well. He had, however,obtained a clearer comprehension since he had taken an actualpart in the deliberations of the British Cabinet. rHe consideredthe step of. summoning  an Imperial  War  Cabinet  had  been
a very remarkable one, which had met the national consciousnee.of the Overseas Dominions in a way in which it, had never beeimet before. Speaking for Canada, he wished to lay stress on thtremendous power with which the sense of nationhood had developeithere in the last three years, and he was confident that it would be most unfortunate if the step in advance now taken were notrepeated. The Prime Mini sterV. view of the constitution of futureImperial Cabinets corresponded very much with what had been in hisown mind. He agreed that the Dominion representatives shouldbe the Prime Ministers, if possible, or deputies invested for thetime being with equal authority; otherwise it could not be aCabinet in any real sense. It also seemed to him entirely reasonable and, indeed, necessary that the Imperial Cabinet should be quitedistinct from the British Cabinet, and should not include british ministers whose portfolios did not pertain to matters of common concern. The Imperial Cabinet should clearly consist of membersqualified to discuss such matters, and able to implement thedecisions agreed upon in their respective Parliaments. He suggestedthat it might be advantageous for the Dominion representatives tohave other Ministers accompanying them, such as, for instance,their Ministers of Finance or Defence not as members of theImperial Cabinet, but available to be consulted or called in on matters of. which they had special knowledge. He consideredthat the step taken had been a very remarkable advance, andone which would be looked upon as such in future years if it became a convention of our Constitution, a Constitution founded on-usage.   He heartily welcomed it.Mr. Massey considered that the experiment had been an unqualified success from the point of view of the Dominions, andhe welcomed the idea of an Imperial Cabinet as a permanent insti-tution. He would like to suggest, however, that during the present war if any Prime Minister, or Minister authorised by him, should visit England, the courtesy of being allowed to attend meetings ofthe War Cabinet should be extended to him, in order to avoid any-thing in the nature of an interregnum at this time. He wished also,,incidentally, to refer to a suggestion he had made at the war conference with regard to the Special Conference which was toconsider the constitutional position in the Empire after the war,that representation in that case should be extended to representativesof the Oppositions as well as to Ministers, with the object of gettingawTay from party. With regard to the proposal before them, he agreed that it was an important advance. The Dominions had been willing to share the burden of Empire, but had had no voice. Thatwould not occur again, and they were now in a position to go back and say to their people that the Empire was more closely unitedthan when the Overseas Representatives had arrived in GreatBritain for these meetings. Much still remained to be done,and every step would have to be very carefully thought out.Meanwhile, on behalf of New Zealand, he appreciated to the full the step that had been taken.General Smuts, in thanking the &quot;Prime Minister for the warmthof his reference to the help rendered by the Dominions, said thatthey would go back to their own countries, where they weredealing with their own problems and developing on their own lines,with their minds seized with the point of view of the centre ofthe Empire, and the effect of that would be felt among them in thefuture-With regard to the actual proposal before them, it seemed tohim tentatively to be the best, solution. The whole question wouldrequire a great deal of consideration after the war. There were difficulties due to the great distances and the urgency of localproblems which had to be faced in considering the suggestion of anAnnual Session. On the whole, he thought the proposal representedall that could be done at present, and that much would have to be
left to future development. In this sense he expressed tentativeagreement, though realising that the whole matter would require agreat deal more consideration.Sir Edward Morris considered that the suggestion would meet with, the approval of the whole Empire, and was the only way of satisfying a real want. There had been many people who thoughtthat something in the nature of an Imperial Council or parliament should be created, but the more that question was discussed themore the great difficulties in the wray would be appreciated. Mean-while what they had done in the way of common discussion of problems of Defence and Foreign Relations was getting very near-what would satisfy the Dominions. He wished to endorse Mr.Massey&apos;s suggestion that representatives of the Dominions whovisited England during the war might be privileged to attend the meetings of the War Cabinet.Sir S. Sinha expressed his hearty concurrence in the suggestionthat India shoidd be represented in the future. The manner and method - of that representation would require discussion at theproper time. Meanwhile, he understood that there would be arepresentative of India as distinct from the Secretary of State. TheConference, as he realised, was one of Governments, and, as such,the Government of India would be represented. Constituted as india was at present, the nature of the representation would obviously have to be left to the Government of India. But heforesaw that great changes wOuld soon take place in the Govern-ment of India, and that the people of India would have a largervoice. He looked forward to the time wdien the Government ofIndia would have an Indian Prime Minister, but till that day hewas quite content that India should be represented in such a manner as the Government of India thought best.The Maharaja of Bikaner heartily endorsed what his colleaguehad said about the feelings of India, and especially appreciated theproposal that India should have a representative apart from theSecretary of State. He was not prepared to make a definiteproposal as to the character of that representation. Iudia would appreciate and greatly recognise the step that had been taken.Lord Ourzon wished to make it clear that the members of theBritish Cabinet, in contemplating the representation of India,certainly had in view that the representative should normally be an indian, and not a European-born member of the Government service.He realised, of course, the difficulty of finding the representative ofIndia, but he thought that the annual meetings would give anopportunity for the different communities in India to be represented in different years.Mr. Chamberlain agreed that the representative would, in all probability, be an Indian in every case ; but he did not wish to lay down an absolute rule to that effect, as there might be a special session where the representative most qualified happened to be a european-born member of the Government service.Sir Robert Borden wished that it should be made clear inany public announcement that might be made with regard to thefuture Imperial Cabinets that the proposal in no sense supersededor interfered with the proposed special Imperial Conference toconsider constitutional readjustment.The Imperial 2. Lord Milner thought that it was worth considering whetherConference. the precedent of the present occasion should not be followed, and&apos; an Imperial. Conference meet contemporaneously with the imperial cabinet every year.   The present Imperial War Conference outsidethe Cabinet had proved very useful, and if the Ministers Avho werecoining to Imperial Cabinets in future were bringing advisers andolleagues who were not to be members of the Imperial Cabinet, it
would be a pity not to take advantage of their presence for commonconsultation at a conference.The Imperial War Cabinet concurred in this view.Lord Milner further proposed that the Governments of theEmpire might, in the interval before the next Conference, considerwhether the Conference in future might not include representativesof the Oppositions. This would undoubtedly make the conference a somewhat larger body. He had, during the previous summer,attended a series of discussions held by the Parliamentary delegates of the Empire Parliamentary Association, at which British and dominion Members of Parliament of all parties had been present,and these discussions had been most serious and useful. He thought this proposal would also get over some very real difficulties withregard to India.Lord Robert Cecil considered that this was a very importantsuggestion, and hoped it would not be allowed to drop without full consideration.Mr. Chamberlain concurred in this view, and hoped that theGovernments represented would consider it before the nextConference.Mr. Long thought the proposal deserved the most carefulconsideration, but pointed out that it was a great step, involving thecomplete reconstitution of the Conference. His experience at the speakers Conference was that agreement could never have beenreached unless all groups in the House of Commons had been repre-sented. This would mean a great enlargement of the Conference,and would raise new problems, such as those of order and secrecy,which were at present left to the goodwill and discretion of a smalland responsible body. There was also the difficulty of havingDepartmental Ministers and permanent officials cross-examined bymembers of the Opposition. The point had been raised at the war conference, but he doubted if there had been a majority, in favourof the suggestion. He considered that it was a matter for discussion at the next Conference rather than at the War Conference.Lord Curzon thought that the proposal went rather far, andthat things were still in too embryonic a stage to deal with it. it involved little less than a revolution in the Constitution of theEmpire. He would deprecate the Imperial War Cabinet passingany resolution to the effect that this suggestion should be com-municated to the Governments of the Dominions and to India.The Prime Minister referred to his own experience, at theShipping Conference of 1907, where the Australian Opposition was represented, and where Mr. Hughes, as representative of theOpposition,, really ran the Conference.Sir Robert Borden considered that the proposal really meant that the Conference would become one representative of Parlia-ments, and not of Governments. It would, in fact, be a Com-mittee of all the Parliaments. If that was so, it was not to beexpected that its discussions or decisions would be of quite the samecharacter as those of the present Conference, and certain mattersnow dealt with by the Conference would then be dealt with in theImperial Cabinet. But the proposal would have the great advantage of bringing together men of all parties from all partsof the Empire in contact with each other. He considered theproposal was entitled to attentive consideration, and ought&apos; to come before the next Conference, as it could hardly be taken up by theCabinet,Lord Milner entirely agreed that the matter could not be settledoff-hand, and he had no idea of attempting to &apos;: jump &quot; the Cabinetinto a decision. The chief object of his proposal was that the bestminds of the Empire, irrespective of party, should be brought tobear upon Imperial questions. Party activities, if confined to localaffairs, would be far less mischievous, perhaps even beneficial. he saw no reason why a Leader of Opposition, if he were the better
man, should not be more influential at a Conference than the leader of the Majority. ^S?&apos;-,;Mr. Plazen expressed the&apos;fear that the Oppositions might use the Conference for party purposes.Mr. Massey reminded the Imperial War Cabinet that this wasnot an entirely new proposal. He remembered having been invitedon a preAdous occasion, when he was Leader of the Opposition, tocome to a Conference with the Prime Minister, though he had notbeen able at the time to accept the invitation.Staff 3. Sir Robert Borden wished to raise the question of the great&quot;Appointments for     importance to Canada of having a sufficient proportion of officersCanadian Officers.     who had received Staff training.   Opportunities for this had, in hisopinion, not been sufficiently provided.   He did not wish to blameanyone in particular, but desired to draw attention to the matterand to emphasise it.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said his attention had only recently been drawm to the matter, but he fully agreed thatan adequate proportion of Canadian Officers should receive Stafftraining.The Prime Minister agreed that the matter was one of greatimportance.Greece. 4. The Prime Minister informed the Imperial War Cabinetthat he and Lord Robert Cecil were going to Paris the following day to attempt to arrive at a clear understanding with the FrenchGovernment on the subject of Greece.Lord Robert Cecil, explaining the general situation in Greece,pointed out that the British Government had no ulterior object inview beyond the effective j)rosecution of the war. He was not quite so sure what the object of successive French governments had been. There certainly seemed to be a section in France whichaimed at utilising the war in order to secure for France some special political or financial position in Greece It did appear as ifthere had been a real unwillingness to restore peace and harmonyin Greek affairs, and whenever there seemed to be an opportunity of getting things back on to a better plane it was somehow prevented.Matters had consequently gone from bad to worse : we had startedwith an overwhelming majority of the Greek people on our side,but now it was extremely doubtful what the real sentiments of thepopulation of Royalist Greece were. The country was divided, itsprosperity destroyed, and there was considerable doubt whether theKing might not now, if a favourable opportunity offered, use such forces as he had against us.There were only two practical proposals, in his opinion, to dealwith the situation. The first was the one favoured by the French :that, having gone so far, we should go further and aim at thedethronement of King Constantino, and put in his place the presentCrown Prince, with M. Venizeios or some Venizelist as PrimeMinister. The difficulty was whether the King would fall in withthis proposal. If he resisted, it might be necessary to divert aconsiderable force to overcome him, and the country might fall intoa state of anarchy and brigandage, which would necessitate an army of occupation for some time. Personally, for these reasons, he hadgrave doubts as to the French plan being feasible. The other plan was to give the King one more chance, on the understanding thathe was to put in office a Ministry friendly to the Entente, underM. Zaimis, and dismiss from Greece the present pro-Germanadvisers, such as MM. Gounaris and Streit and General Dousmanis,making it plain to him at the same time that any further intrigueon his part would compel the Allies to insist on his abdication.Such a policy could not be carried out effectively if it were left to
four representatives with divergent policies. Tt would be essential in that case to unify the political control, and that, as he had originally suggested, could best be done if the political control was placed under a special British envoy.There were, however, certain difficulties. In the first place,there was the strong feeling against King Constantine in France,.which would make the French Government object to any policywhich thej&apos; believed meant letting the King off lightly. Eventhough he believed himself that under his plan the King would be under much more effective supervision, this would prove a formidable-able objection. But there was also the difficulty created by theSalonica situation. Our naval and military advisers were quite clear that our force could not be maintained at Salonica, for shipping reasons. The reduction or withdrawal of our force froman expedition to which the French had always attached such a great value would be looked upon very unfavourably by them, and unless we could give them some satisfaction on the other side of the Greekquestion it might create an estrangement and react on the generalprosecution of the war. He felt that it was objectionable to do anything which might be construed as harsh or unfair to a smallPower, but he felt the immense importance of not doing anything to weaken the alliance. He admitted that the alliance might beeven more injured if anything which the French did brought them into acute conflict with the Italians. Tentatively, however, hesuggested that he might modify his proposal as to the second lineof policy by offering to the French the complete political control at athens. But this would have to be subject to a definite under-taking on the part of the French that they would embark on noextreme or wild policy with regard to Greece. It would take somemonths to remove the Salonica force, and it would not do to leavethe French in a position to create a military entanglement fromwhich we should be compelled to help them out, and so be pre-vented from carrying out the withdrawal. He thought that by putting the whole responsibility on the French, with a clear understanding as to the kind of policy to be pursued, it mightbe possible to get a more moderate and successful policy from them than under present conditions. The most serious difficulty heforesaw was that Italy would probably refuse to give her assent tothe proposal.The Prime Minister pointed out that there were certain other considerations which should be in the minds of the Imperial WarCabinet. In the first place, there was the fact that bothGeneral Sarrail and M. Venizelos were very anxious that RoyalistGreece should not be made independent of the blockade by securingthe whole of the Thessalian harvest, which would feed them for over seven months. M. Venizelos urged that Thessaly wasVenizelist, and that we had prevented him from bringing abouta rising there. Secondly, Italy was now, as a result of a privatebargain with France over Asia Minor, willing to assent to theFrench occupation of Thessaly. This did not mean an occupation by the Venizelists, but by French troops to safeguard the crops and prevent their being utilised by the Royalist Government to free themselves from Allied control. French opinion would not tolerate any Government leaving the Thessalian harvest in thehands of King Constantine, who, by his action in the matter ofthe cession to the Bulgarians of Fort Rupel and the- surrender oftwo divisions with their guns to the Germans, and by the constantcommunication between the Greek and German General Staffs, had clearly shown his treacherous attitude towards the Allies. It wasno use treating the French as wholly unreasonable in their attitude,which, after all, was shared by public opinion in this country as well.For these reasons he did not think that it was any use urging the proposal of unified control under a British representative.   The
smatter should be left.to the French, and it should be made clear tothem that, if trouble resulted, it would be their trouble. He was by no means sure, however, that&quot; there would be such serious trouble,the apprehensions with regard to which were, he thought, based onan exaggerated belief in Greek courage. If General Sarrail oncesecured the Thessalian harvest, the blockade should be madeabsolutely effective.Lord Milner expressed his entire agreement with the practicalconclusion arrived at by Lord Robert Cecil and the Prime Minister,that our withdrawal from Salonica should be coupled with handing over undivided political control to the French., He regarded it asimpossible that we should withdraw our forces, and at the sametime claim a greater political authority. On the other hand, he felt that it was necessary to let the members of the Imperial WarCabinet understand that there was a very different view of the factswith regard to the conduct of King Constantine than that whichhad been presented by the Prime Minister. Personally he was ofopinion that the King could over and over again have been brought in on our side by better management, and the real marvel was thathe was not more hostile. All our representatives in Greece took amore favourable view of his conduct than that which the PrimeMinister had taken, and at Rome Sir F. Elliot had vigorouslydenied that the King was pro-German. But however that mightbe, even if he had been badly treated, and we were turning against him after he had fulfilled every promise, the supreme consideration which had to be kept in view was the maintenance of the Alliance.He considered the French policy a bad one, and one whose object was loot; but if he had to go to Paris he could only take the sameline as that which the Prime Minister and Lord Robert Cecil wereadvocating.Sir Robert borden raised the question whether the american ambassador in Paris might hot be of assistance in dealing with theFrench ; but it was suggested that, on grounds both of Americanpolicy and of the American Ambassadors own personality, it wasnot likely that much assistance would be afforded from that quarter.In answer to a further question from Sir Robert Borden, theChief.of the Imperial General Staff stated that there were only ,000 to 3,000 Greek troops left in Thessaly, and that there oughtto be enough troops in the 650,000 men of General Sarrails army to occupy it without great difficulty.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,May 3, 1917.Note.  Lord Curzon, who was not present in the concluding stage of the meeting, desired to place on record that he could nothave assented to the proposal to place the tindivided political.control at Athens in the hands of the French, and that he hoped it would not be adopted at the Paris Conference.o
