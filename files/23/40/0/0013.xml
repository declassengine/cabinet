The Western Front. 1. THE Director of Military. Operations stated that he had nothing to add to the report made to the War Cabinet by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff that morning. In reply to a question by the Prime Minister, he said that in their latest attacks theFrench had secured the western half of their objectives, but thatthey had not yet captured the whole of the heights south ofMoronvilliers, to the possession of which they attached considerable importance.Mesopotamia. 2.  The Director of Military Operations  reported  that  the13th Turkish Army Corps had been entrenching for some days in astrong position on both banks of the Shatt-el-Adhaim. On the night of the 29th-30th General Maude had transferred the bulk ofhis troops to the left bank, and had attacked part of the enemy&apos;position there at dawn. The attack came as a surprise, and theenemy&apos;s first two lines, as well as a village held by them, were captured by our troops. As the result of a strong counter-attack the village passed temporarily into the enemy&apos;s hands, but wasspeedily regained by us.   Fighting was still in progress.3. The Imperial War Cabinet further considered the Report ofLord Milner&apos;s Committee. With regard to the possibility of a league of Peace, Lord Milner again expressed the view that themost that could be done would be for the Powers concerned in theTreaty of Peace to bind themselves not to go to war without previous conference, and all to go to war against any Power thatviolated this agreement.Lord Robert Cecil read to the Imperial War Cabinet asuggested clause in the Terms of Peace by which it was agreedthat, in case of any difference or controversy, a Conference shouldbe forthwith summoned, and no action taken until that conference had considered the matter, or for three months after the meeting ofthe Conference. Each of the high contracting Powers should binditself to enforce this agreement by cutting off all financial and commercial intercourse from an offending Power.General Smuts suggested that the precise nature of the sanction to be imposed would have to be worked out later. It would besufficient if the Imperial War Cabinet expressed itself in general terms in favour of the principle of a sanction,The Imperial War Cabinet concurred in this view.Disarmament. 4. Lord Robert Cecil briefly explained to the Imperial WarCabinet the difficulties in the way of any agreement, either betweenthe Powers collectively or between individual Powers, with regardto disarmament. These difficulties, as set forth in Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;sMemorandum, had convinced him that disarmament was not ahopeful line of progressThe Prime Minister was not convinced that Sir Eyre Crowe&apos;sarguments quite exhausted the subject: In his opinion, thewar had been largely due to the existence of a great, highlyprofessionalised army exciting public opinion, and eager to test its strength. Pie thought it might be possible to have anagreement in favour of setting up, in place of this provocativesystem based on the spirit of offensive, a militia system essentiallynon-provocative, and based on the idea of defence.Against this it was argtied that it was extremely difficult toget rid of the professional element altogether, and that theconditions of different countries differed so widely that it would inpractice be impossible to find a system on which everyone couldbe agreed.   Moreover, the greatest existing guarantee of peace League of Peace.
Report ofLord Curzon&apos;sCommittee.5. The Imperial War Cabinet considered the Report of lord curzon&apos;s Committee on Territorial Desiderata in the Terms ofPeace.Lord Curzon explained to the Imperial War Cabinet that theConclusions of the Committee had been unanimous after A^eryminute and careful discussion. Those in the first and mostimportant category were based on very definite principles, shared by all his colleagues on the Committee, as to the importance, ofsecuring the future safe-ty of the British Empire by removing themenace, which the German colonial system and the German ambitionfor expansion towards the Suez Canai and the Persian Gulf, created tothe sea communications of the Empire, and to its peaceful deyelop-ment. He washed to differentiate very sharply between theterritorial question, as it affected Germany&apos;s colonial possessions,and the question of other annexations in Europe or elsewhere.These German colonies were not in any sense a part of Germanyproper; they were inhabited by native populations who felt no desire to revert to German rule ; they were held by Germany as partof a policy pursued by her for aggressive purposes, which, in themain, were directed against the existence of the British Empire.This entitled us to look at them from the point of view of thesecurity of the Empire.   On this subject, the Representatives of the[1142-13] &apos; B 2the British Navy was undoubtedly a highly professionalisedinstitution, and it would be impossible to ask for a general reductionof military efficiency on land without raising the question of naval disarmament. It was, indeed, suggested by General Smuts that ifthe European Powers by agreement debarred themselves fromspending money on their land defence they would have much more to spend on big navies.Mr. Henderson considered that Lord Milner&apos;s Committee, in framing paragraph 6 of their Report, while they had excludedcomplete disarmament as a counsel of perfection, were quite prepared to consider any reasonable means for reducing armaments and preventing the recurrence of war. Personally, he held very strong views on the subject of disarmament., but was convincedthat it was necessary first of all to see what result could beachieved in the direction of a League of Nations. The policy withregard to disarmament would have to depend on the nature of theinternational relations set up after the conclusion of peace.Mr. Chamberlain confessed to feeling that any attempt to lay down restrictions on armaments was bound to give rise toopportunities for fraud. Public opinion in this country would insist that any British Government should be bound, both in theletter and in the spirit, by the restrictions. In a country such as germany, public opinion would be entirely in favour of therestrictions being tacitly broken or evaded. He considered,however, that the suggestion contained in Lord Milner&apos;s Report, ofcommunication with America, might be followed up, and that we might endeavour to see whether Americans, who had given a greatdeal of time to discussing these subjects, could formulate anyworkable scheme.Sir Robert Borden said he was certainly quite willing that thequestion of limitation of armaments should be included in thedetails for discussion with the United States, which had beensuggested in the last sentence of paragraph 6 of the Committee&apos;sReport. He adhered to his opinion that really the public opinionof the world was the only sure guarantee of peace.The Imperial War Cabinet were of the opinion that thequestion of the limitation of armaments should also bediscussed with the United States in connection with any discussion of this question of a League of Peace.
Dominions and India held the very strongest views. Personally, themore he had gone into the matter at the meetings of the Committee,the more had he been impressed by the weight of the broadconsiderations of Imperial security, which made it desirable to retainboth German East Africa, Palestine, and Mesopotamia. WestAfrica the Committee had definitely put on a, lower scale ofimportance, as territory which, in the last resort, might conceivably be given back to Germany.The Prime Minister expressed the view that the Report, whileundoubtedly embodying what we ought to aim at in the case of complete victory, was not an adequate instruction to british delegates if they had to face a Conference under conditions which left Germany still in possession of a great deal of Allied territory.It had not quite faced the difficulty which would arise if france or Russia asked us to surrender some of our conquests in order to release their territory. We had to consider the position of BxitishDelegates at the Peace Conference. Russia would come after having suffered more than seven million casualties, and France withnearly two million dead ; could we, under such conditions, claim that they should get nothing and we should have practicallyeverything ? The question might arise even within a few weeks.The telegrams from Russia showed that the party of non-annexationseemed to be getting the upper hand, and it would be very difficultif our only response was a demand for all the territories mentionedin the Report.Lord Curzon pointed out that the Committee had definitelycontemplated the possible restoration of certain territory, such asthe Cameroons and Togoland, which might, in certain contingencies,enable France to secure what she desired most, namely, Alsace-Lorraine. The idea of non-annexation raised very great difficultieswhen the concrete cases were considered. He had always been astrong opponent of an extension of India&apos;s responsibilities, but thecourse of the war had compelled us to occupy Mesopotamia. was it possible to hand that coun try back to Turkish rule ? In anycase, he wished to make it clear that the Report did not embodyBritish demands to be laid on the table of a Peace Conference,but a brief for the guidance of our Delegates which would enablethem to judge what points they should concentrate upon inthe discussions, and what concessions should be most vigorouslycontested.Mr. Chamberlain wished to emphasise the conviction whichhad been impressed upon the Committee that the development of submarine warfare, as well as the future developments of wireless telegraphy and aviation, would make it a very serious danger1 toleave any overseas possessions in Germany&apos;s hands. He pointedout that the Committee did contemplate that the question of the satisfaction of the European claims of our Allies should be correlatedwith the satisfaction of our claims. It was clear that Francecould not take Alsace-Lorraine and then claim equal shares with usin Africa, On the other hand, our claims also to a certain extentwere contingent on our Allies getting what they wanted in Europe.It was not quite correct to say that we had everything and our allies nothing. The French, for instance, had practically the wholeof tbe Cameroons and the greater part of Togoland, while theRussians had Armenia. Neither of them were likely to give thesehack, except, perhaps, for an equivalent elsewhere.General Smuts said that if it were a question of no annexationexcept by the wishes of the inhabitants, he was quite prepared tosubmit the question of the future government of East Africa to the vote of the 8,000,000 natives, which he had no doubt would beunanimously in favour of British rule. The whole question of thedifficulties that might arise at a Peace Conference had been in the minds of the Committee, and the last clause of the Report hadbeen put in with the specific object, as a saving clause in view
of the possibility that the attainment of our objects mighthave to be modified, in accordance with the actual military situationand the claims of our Allies. He was not in favour of weakeningthe Report any further.Sir Robert Borden considered that it would be necessary tomeet the point of view of our Allies. The Committee had carriedout a very exhaustive and able survey of - the field, but their conclusions did undoubtedly involve a very large addition to theBritish Empire. This question was intimately connected withthe questions considered by Lord Milner&apos;s Committee, and it wouldbe necessary to keep in mind the relation between the largeannexations we considered essential for our security and theproposals for permanent peace and a reduction of armaments whichwe might wish to bring forward.Mr. Long said that we had already gone to the limit ofconcession in what we had yielded to the French in West Africa.He did not consider that it was possible to suggest greater con-cessions than were contemplated in the Report. If our victorywere not complete, and we were therefore unable to exact our ownterms, was it. at all likely that Germany would regard the offer ofa portion of some Colony, or an, island or two in the Pacific, asworthy of consideration ? She would refuse any offer of the kind,and demand the whole. He felt very strongly that German South-East and South-West Africa were of vital importance to theEmpire and if we failed to keep what we had won it would beregarded as a defeat for us in those parts of the world,Mr. Massey wished to lay stress on the fact that the report had only been adopted after the most earnest consideration andwith a full sense of responsibility. It was based on considerations of the future security of the British Empire and on the idea of preventing occasions of future war as much as possible. He quiteagreed that the precise extent to which the objects indicated couldbe attained wrould depend on our position at the end of the War.All he asked for was that our Delegates should make the bestbargain possible on the lines of the Committee&apos;s Report.Lord Robert Cecil pointed out that he did not regard theReport as going further than making out in each specific instancethe case that there was for the retention of particular territory.But it was all subject to the final clause, and he himself had neverthought it probable that we should be able to secure the whole ofthe terms mentioned. It was also worth pointing out that we wTerenot putting forward a claim for anything in Europe.The Prime Minister said that he quite accepted the detailedarguments adduced lin the Report in favour of the retention of east Africa or of other territories. All he pleaded for was that therecommendations of the Report should not be regarded asinstructions from which our Delegates could not depart. He also suggested that it was desirable to make it clear that our Delegateswould have to take into consideration the claims of our Allies aswell as British interests.After some discussion, the Imperial War Cabinet agreedupon the following Conclusion, drafted by Lord Curzon andMr. Chamberlain : The Imperial War Cabinet, in accepting the Report of theCommittee as an indication of the objects to be sought by the British Representatives at the Peace Conferenceand of their relative importance, rather than as definite instructions from which they are not intended in any circumstances to depart, notes that the demands of theBritish Empire will require to ;. be correlated at theConference with those of our Allies.Mr; Henderson regretted that he felt compelled to dissent from*this Conclusion.   The Conclusion, though qualifying the Report in
the interests of our Allies, still contemplated the desirability ofcertain annexations if they could be secured. Speaking not as representing himself, but the Party which had sent him to theImperial War Cabinet, be was bound to vote against any annexationof territory.The Prime Minister read to the Imperial War Cabinet a DraftConclusion which he had prepared to cover both the aspects of theTerms of Peace dealt with by Lord Milner&apos;s Committee and thosedealt with by Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee.After some discussion, more particularly with reference toallusions in the original draft to previous declarations by theBritish Government, the Allies, and President Wilson, the followingConclusion was agreed upon : The Imperial War Cabinet considers that the policy of theEmpire should have the following ends in view : (a.) The re-establishment of liberty and public right inEurope and on the high seas, the settlement ofthe political boundaries of Europe in accordancewith the wishes of its peoples, and the liberation of the oppressed nationalities of the turkish empire from, the Turkish yoke.(6.) The security and integrity of the British Empireand of the nations of which it is composed.(c.) The framing of measures for the preservation oflasting peace in concert with our Allies.It was decided that this Conclusion should not be nade public for the present, but might be published on some later occasion when a statement of British policy was required.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W.;May 2, 1917.
