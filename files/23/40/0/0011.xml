The western front.1. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that, asthe result of the fighting on the previous day, the British forces had succeeded at first in occupying all their objectives ; that the enemy had then counter-attacked with several reserve divisions and hadtemporarily recovered some of these positions, which, however, wereeventually regained and secured by our troops. The number of enemy prisoners was estimated at 1,800. During the recent operations the enemy had been compelled to employ 31 of hisreserve divisions, 13 on the British and 18 on the French front,leaving 16 divisions in reserve that had not as yet been engaged.Russia:The Baltic Fleet.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff communicated the contents of a telegram from Russia to the effect that the conditionof the Russian Fleet in the Baltic continued to be most unsatisfactory,and that it could not be relied upon to prevent a hostile landing.The telegram also embodied a request that the British admiralty would arrange for a naval demonstration next week, when the dangerous period would commence, owing to the breaking of the ice.Coal for Italy. 3  The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that he hadreceived a telegram from General cadorna pressing for the earlysupply of more coal, in default of which there was a seriouspossibility of the railways and the output of munitions beingparalysed.Mesopotamia. 4. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff read a telegramfrom General Maude describing the severe fighting which had resulted in the successful capture of Samarra. General Maudereported that the 13th Turkish Corps on his right was advancingalong the right bank of the Shatt-el-Adhaim, and that he proposedto engage it at once.5. The First Sea Lord stated that our seaplanes had sightedand attacked an enemy submarine off Harwich on the previous day.The submarine when last seen had a heavy list.The First Sea Lord also reported an engagement between thesloop &quot; Q.-22 &quot; and an enemy submarine, as the result of whichthe sloop had been damaged and the submarine had sunk bottomupwards.Submarines:Harwich.Palestine. 6. The First Sea Lord stated that three ships had renderedassistance during the recent military operations against Gaza. TheFrench coast-defence ship &quot;Requin&quot; had been unsuccessfully attacked by an enemy submarine, which had been driven off bypatrols. He further stated that the landing of stores on the openbeach was proceeding.German Output. 7. The First Sea Lord reported that the Admiralty had received.reliable information to the effect that the average monthly output ofGerman submarines since September 1916 amounted to 13, of which10 were mine-laying vessels and 3 oceanic submarines.Naval Losses.8. The First Sea Lord reported the loss of one of our mine-sweeping trawlers.
Imperial Preference 10. The following resolution was submitted by Mr. Massey forand Emigration.       discussion by the Imperial War Cabinet :-&quot; That the time has arrived when all possible encouragementshould be given to the development of Imperial resources,and (consistent with the resolutions of the Paris Conference)especially to making- the Empire independent of othercountries for the food supplies of its population and rawmaterial for its manufactures. With these objects in view this Conference expresses itself in favour of: &quot;(1.) A system by which each country of the Empirewill give preference through its Customs to thegoods produced or manufactured in any other british country ; and&quot; (2.) An arrangement by which, in the case of intendingemigrants from the United Kingdom, inducementsmay be offered to such emigrants to settle in countries under the British Flag.&quot;Mr. Massey pointed out that the question of imperial preference had been considered on many occasions, more par-- ticularly at previous Imperial Conferences, where it had beentwice agreed to without opposition, so far as the dominions were concerned. The difficulty had been due to the views of the electorate of the United Kingdom. But in that respect a very important change in public opinion had taken place, a striking proof of which was afforded by the recent report of Lord Balfour ofBurleigh&apos;s sub-committee. The War had undoubtedly made peoplerealise the dangerous extent to which the United Kingdom hadbeen dependent on foreign countries. This dependence was un-necessary, as the Empire could produce all it required, so long as itProduction, Trans-portation, Control,and Utilisation ofFood Supplies andother natural resources of theEmpire.9. Sir Robert Borden brought before the Imperial War Cabinetthe following resolution : &quot; Having regard to the experience obtained in the present war,this Conference records its opinion that the safety of theEmpire and the necessary development of its component parts require prompt and attentive consideration, as well asconcerted action with regard to the following matters : -&quot; (1.) The production of an adequate food supply andarrangements for its transportation. when and where required, under any conditions that may reasonably be anticipated.&quot; (2.) The control of natural resources available withinthe Empire, especially those that are of anessential character for necessary national purposes,whether in peace or in war.&quot; (3.) The economical utilisation of such natural resources through processes of manufacturecarried on within the Empire.&quot; The Conference commends to the consideration of theGovernments summoned thereto the enactment of such legislation as may assist this purpose.&quot;Sir Robert Borden stated that the Dominion members were all agreed on the resolution, and, as there was general agreement among the members of the Imperial War Cabinet present, thePrime Minister expressed the opinion that a discussion was hardlyrequired.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed upon the resolution.
retained control of the sea. The Dominions already had adoptedPreference as far as they were concerned, and New Zealand was prepared to go further if necessary. He did not think that it wasfair or possible to go back to the condition of trade with enemy countries as it existed before the War. Moreover, owing to the greatadditional burden of taxation which the War would leave behind,there were certain to be considerable increases in Customs Duties,and these two factors would facilitate the establishment of Preference.He did not consider, in view of the productive capacities of theEmpire, that any measure of Preference in this country would add to the cost of living.With regard to the second part of his resolution, Mr. Masseypointed out that there was plenty of room in the Dominions foremigration. The population in the United Kingdom was 370 to the square mile, whereas in New Zealand it -was 10, in Canada 2, andin Australia l^-. The South African War had been followed by avery large wave of emigration, and that experience and his ownconversations with soldiers convinced him that there would be alarge emigration after the War, which it was very desirable to guideinto British channels. In the Dominions they would welcome notonly farmers, who were the most useful type of settlers, but immi-grants of every suitable class. He pointed out that between the period1876-1913, of a total net emigration from the United Kingdom of5,149,000, over 2,770,000 (i.e., 53 per cent, of the total) had gone tothe United States and had been lost to the British Empire. It wasimpossible for us to expect that other countries should be content tosee the British Empire possessing vast areas which it was not properly occupying. Emigration could not be forced to stay withinthe Empire; what was necessary was to give inducements, and he urged that the Governments of the Empire should join together toarrange a scheme of financial assistance.Sir Robert Borden stated that the whole fiscal system ofCanada had been designed for national and Imperial purposes,and it was largely owing to its fiscal system that Canada was now a portion of the British Empire. He considered Preference a valuable and fundamental principle. He also realised, however, thatit was not only an Imperial, but also a domestic question. In sofar as it was the latter, he had always avoided interfering with it.The Dominions would be resentful of interference in their own internal affairs, and were not disposed to interfere in controversieswhich the United Kingdom had to settle for itself. No one inCanada would desire a Preference that was felt to be oppressive orunjust by the population of these islands. Any such feeling wouldinjure the Imperial aspect of Preference. He considered that theEmpire could produce all the food it required. As regards Canadamore particularly, whose chief exports were wheat, cheese, andbacon, a Preference which did not deal with the question of food supplies would be illusory and unsatisfactory. One of the difficultieswhich had confronted Canada in the past, and raised the greatestmeasure of outcry from her farmers, had been the increased cost of transportation across the Atlantic, and he suggested that it mightbe possible for the United Kingdom and the Dominions to get together in some great enterprise which would restrict the costof transportation within the Rmpire. Transportation was quite as important to all the Dominions as Customs Preference.With regard to the second part of Mr. Massey&apos;s resolution heentirely agreed, though he considered that emigration to the UnitedStates, both from the United Kingdom a.nd from Canada, had notJbeen wholly a loss in so far as it had affected the United States&apos;feeling towards the British Esnpire. He was prepared to supportany Imperial scheme of emigration.The Prime Minister, speaking not in his official capacity, but as one who had taken a leading part in discussions on this question,began by declaring that his general attitude had been altered by
things which had happened since the Wai\ The War hadundoubtedly revealed certain fundamental facts which it wasnecessary to take cognisance of in our Imperial and domesticarrangements. There were industries essential to defence which wehad been compelled to build up at great cost in the middle of theWar, and which might not be able to hold their own unassisted atthe end of the War. [t would be great folly, in view of theexpenditure we should still have to incur upon the Army and Navy,if we neglected to maintain industries essential to the efficiency ofthose Forces.Again, there was the Imperial point of view. The value ofcohesion and co-operation between the nations of the British Com-commonwealth had been revealed in an extraordinary way; it had beenthe great surprise of the War to our enemies and largely to ourselves, and had made us the most important factor in the War.Consequently, from the selfish point of view, of the United Kingdomalone, the development of the Empire would: be an essential point inBritish policy. The figures Mr. Massey had quoted showed that if more trouble had been taken over the development of the Empire inthe past, the Dominions might possibly have had double their presentpopulation and proportionately increased the strength of the british contribution to the present War. These were fundamental facts which were bound to produce an essential change in the policy ofthe United Kingdom with regard to the Dominions, and vice versa.With regard to the methods to be adopted, he wished to pointout that the war had revealed, more particularly in the case ofRussia, the peril which might arise from dear food. That issue wasone which had somehow or other obsessed the minds of the working-classes in the United Kingdom, ever since the Corn Laws, and thememories of the present war would revive that dread. He concurred in Sir Robert Bordehs statesmanlike view, that it would not dofor the prosperity of Canada to be based on the want of the work-men of England. He wished the working-classes to regard theEmpire as something that meant not only glory, but also materialadvantage.He was all for Preference, and would personally assent to any resolution laying down the principle, but he asked Mr. Massey toleave out the three words &quot; through its Customs,&quot; which specified aparticular method. He was inclined to consider that Sir RobertBordehs method of subsidised transit through the Empire wouldgive a more substantial Preference. He was all for the old Romanmethod of binding an Empire together by its roads in our case by shipping. Another argument in favour of this particular methodwas that the principal wheat- and meat-producing countries besides the Empire were not our present enemies, but our Allies, Russia andthe United States, and a declaration in favour of a CustomsPreference might look as if we were attempting to do them aninjury. It was quite true that improved shipping would also taketrade away from them, but that was a matter which could bejustified on grounds of Imperial defence, and was a recognisedmethod of development employed by the United States, Russia, andFrance.He did not rule out the remission of dues on the Suez Canal,or the possibility of subsidy on the actual goods sent over, buttrusted that for the moment the precise method should be left open for future discussion. The United Kingdom had got to consider thequestion of its own industries after the War. This was not a matterof Free Trade or Protection, but of stern Imperial necessity for defence. Subject to this, he would personally agree to theresolution.Lord Robert Cecil agreed with the resolution as amended bythe Prime Minister, but suggested  that, as it would have to bepublished in some form or another, and as there was a real feeling(more particularlv in the United States) that we might make use of[1142-iij      &apos; 1 C
our victory to injure American trade, it might be desirable to put insome phrase such as &quot; Having due regard to the legitimate interestsof our Allies.&quot;Mr. Massey said that he was prepared to accept thissuggestion, and in that case to omit the reference in his resolution to the Paris resolutions.Mr. Austen Chamberlain stated that India would certainlyendeavour to conform to any general system of Preference adoptedthroughout the Empire, though the particular -methods wouldhave to be matters of special consideration. While India would undoubtedly welcome low rates of shipping freight, he wished topoint out that she had not the revenue which would provide largesubsidies. She had also important markets in foreign countrieswhich she could not afford to lose without securing fully equivalentmarkets elsewhere.Lord Milner wished to make it clear that Preference on CustomsDuties was not excluded by the resolution as amended. He did notabsolutely accept Sir &quot;Robert Borden&apos;s contention that Preference on .foodstuffs would be the only one of value to the Dominions, for it certainly did not apply to all parts of the Empire, and he doubted ifit applied wholly even as regards Canada. He regretted that the path of Preference had been made difficult by the assumption thatit was necessary to put on duties which were not required in themselves in order to grant Preference. All he had ever contendedfor was that, whatever duties should be imposed in any part of theEmpire for its own interests, the rest of the Empire should betreated differently in respect of those duties from foreign countries.He placed the principle of Preference as something much higherthan either tariffs or shipping, it was an absolutely vital matter :Artieulus stantis aut eadentis imperil. He could imagine a policyof Preference without tariffs or without shipping subsidies, but hecould not, in his conception of the Empire, imagine a policy that had tariffs and gave no Preference on these tariffs.The Prime Minister quite accepted that view; the onlystipulation he wished to make was that it should be made clear,when the resolution was published, that we had not actuallycommitted ourselves to taxes on food.The Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed his agreementwith Lord Milner. He was quite content with the amendedresolution, as long as it did not preclude any of the methods bywhich Preference could be granted. He was continually being pressed in this matter, not only by the Dominions, but by people inthis country of very&apos; varying political views. It would createprofound dissatisfaction if it became known that the utilisation of tariff Preference was to be excluded from the Cabinet schemeof Imperial Preference. With regard to Canada, he felt sure that sir Robert Borden would agree with him that the exports of canada would in the near future or at no distant date include a great volumeof manufactures. All he wished was to make sure that the doorremained open.Mr. Henderson entirely agreed with the views expressed by thePrime Minister and Sir Robert Borden. His own personal viewsdiffered from those of some of the members of the Cabinet, but hewas prepared to go to the extent suggested by the Prime Minister,and considered that the value of the resolution as amended was thatit would secure agreement between those who differed as to theparticular methods of carrying it out.Mr. Chamberlain wished to register the fact that he was stillan utterly impenitent adherent to the policy of food duties, whichhe . believed-to be the right one for the country. He consideredthat the question of food supplies was now being taken by thecountry far more seriously than before the war.: Mr. Massey wished to make it clear that he had brought forward this matter not on behalf of New Zealand only, but in the
general interest of the Empire, and that, he certainly would nothave brought it up if be thought that it. could possibly put theworking classes of the United Kingdom in a worse position.The Imperial War Cabinet accepted the resolution in principle,subject to settlement of its precise wording.The Secretary of State for the Colonies was requested to convene a small Sub-Committee, consisting of- Lord Milner,Sir Robert Borden,Mr. Massey,Mr. Henderson,Lord Robert Cecil,Mr. Austen Chamberlain,to settle upon the wording and bring the matter up beforethe next Meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet.The British Empire 11. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a request by action&quot;3618&apos; 0rgani&quot; tne British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation to receive a deputation0l&quot;   &quot;&apos; to explain to the Imperial War Cabinet the objects and methods ofthe organisation.The Secretary was instructed to inform the secretary ofthe British Empire Producers&apos; Organisation that theirmemorial was being circulated to the Imperial WarCabinet, but that it was impossible to receive thedeputation.(Initialled) D.
