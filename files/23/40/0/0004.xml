The Western Front.1. THE Director of Military Operations reported that noconsiderable movements or actions could be expected for the presentin the neighbourhood of the Hindenbifrg Line, as our advancedtroops had got nearly as far forwards as could be expected, and theroads and communications generally would have to be placed in athoroughly efficient state before any large bodies of infantry andguns could be brought up.Mesopotamia. 2. The Director of  Military Operations explained that theimmediate object of the present operations on the Tigris was to pin.down the Turks, and to intercept the retreat of the enemy forcesretiring belore the Russian advance towards Khanikin. Theultimate object of our operations was to establish the Russian forcesfirmly on the Tigris, after which the main purpose of our force inMesopotamia would be limited to holding the line of the Euphrates,for which a much smaller force should suffice.Having regard to the probable reduction of force and to thesupplies which it is hoped to obtain in Mesopotamia, the imperial war Cabinet look to some reduction in shipping for the maintenanceof this expedition.Naval Losses.The Destroyer,&quot; Laforey.&quot;Other Destroyerlosses since thebeginning of theYear.8. The First Sea Lord reported that the sinking of the destroyer&quot;Laforey&quot; (War Cabinet 104, Minute 7) was due to her striking a mine.Since the beginning of the present year several destroyers hadbeen sunk, viz : By minesBy torpedoes...       ...Damaged by mines ...Damaged by torpedoes4223Since the 1st January, 1917, sixteen new destroyers had beenreceived from the builders. The First Lord added that the outputof destroyers and their repairs were continually interrupted bystrikes.Elospital Ship 4. With reference to War Cabinet 100, Minute 6, the FirstAsturias.&quot; Sea Lord stated that the naval Commander-in-Chief had reportedthat no submarine mines had been located in the neighbourhood ofthe spot where the hospital ship &quot; Asturias&quot; had been damaged.Included in the news intercepted on the previous day from the wireless station of the German Government was an official announcement that the hospitnl ship &quot;Asturias,&quot; of 12,002 tons,had been sunk by a German U-boat.This incident at once brought into the sphere of practical politics the decision of His Majesty&apos;s Government to take reprisals,which decision had been communicated to the German Governmentfollowing on a decision of the War Cabinet on the 31st January,1917 (War Cabinet 50, Minute a).After a full and general discussion of the whole question of reprisals, the Imperial&apos;War Cabinet, while recognising the objectionto such a competition of outrage as has been initiated by theenemy, endorsed the decision taken prospectively to meet thisemergency of the War Cabinet on the 8th February, 1917 (WarCabinet 57, Minute 10), that the Admiralty and Director ofPrisoners of War should arrange for the embarkation in eachhospital ship of a sufficient number of German officers and men as would ensure that they could not be recaptured and all embarkedin one of the enemy submarines.
They further decided that Hospital ships should sail without lights and withoutdistinguishing marks, and that they should be armed andescorted as far as practicable.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed, however, that- Before action is taken or any public announcement made inregard to reprisals, full particulars of the sinking of the&quot; Asturias &quot; should be communicated to the public.Enquiry into theHospital Accom-modation inFrance.5. With a view to reducing to a minimum the numbers ofwounded men exposed to this new and serious danger, the imperial war Cabinet remitted to the War Office, if necessary in consultationwith the Admiralty, a full examination of the question of reducingthe number of hospital ships by developing the hospital and con- -convalescent accommodation in France.Consideration ofPeace Terms.(5. On the initiative of Sir J. Ward and General Smuts, afurther discussion took place on the necessity for arriving at some definite conclusion with regard to the relative importance of our main desiderata in the future Terms of Peace. It was pointed outthat, in the absence of definitely thought-out conclusions on thispoint, there was a danger that the British representatives at a peace Conference, who would be in a minority among Powersprimarily interested in the settlement of affairs in Central Europe,would be unable to defend successfully the vital interests of theBritish Empire, which are primarily concerned not so . much withparticular settlement of European frontiers as with the effectivemaintenance of the intercommunication between the different partsof the Empire itself.It was further pointed out that the British Government had given definite pledges that the Dominions should be consulted withregard to the Terms of Peace, and that those! Terms would have tobe defended in the Overseas Parliaments. Questions had alreadybeen asked in the Canadian Parliament as to whether promisesmade to Russia with regard to the Dardanelles had been made with canada&apos;s consent. It was necessary to be quite clear that we were fighting first and foremost for the security of the British Empire.On the other hand, it was pointed out that Germany&apos;s efficiencyas an aggressive Power in the future must depend very largely uponthe nature of the European settlement, and that the two problems,were intimately connected. It was also necessary to remember theextent of the efforts and sacrifices made by our Allies, which wouldhave to be taken into account in the Terms of Peace.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Further documents bearing on this question, including Paperspreviously prepared by the Secretary of State for . ForeignAffairs, by the Admiralty, and by the General, Staff, shouldbe circulated, and that, as soon as the Dominion Members,of the Imperial War Cabinet were ready, there should bea further discussion, when the matter might, if found desirable, he relegated to detailed consideration by aCommittee of the Imperial War Cabinet.[1142 4]B 2
Shipping. 7. The Imperial War Cabinet considered the recommendation contained in the Interim Report of the First Lord&apos;s shipping resources Committee, that a Cabinet instruction should be givento the Wheat Commission to obtain from the United States andfrom Canada all the wheat that is available there, without regardto any considerations arising out of the position of the Americanexchange.The Shipping Controller, however, explained that, in fact,action in this direction had already been taken, and that shipping on a large scale had been diverted from Australian and Easternwaters to the United States and Canada.The Supplementingof Wheat by theUse of CoarserGrain.8. There was a discussion on the extent to which the shortageof wheat could be made up by an extended use, either in the composition of bread or otherwise, of barley, maize, and oats, and figures were given showing the very large reserve of oats availablein an emergency if the feeding of horses with oats were stopped,though it was realised that this could not be done at the presenttime without seriously interfering with agricultural operations.Sir Robert Borden pointed out, in this connection, that a greatdeal could be done in inducing the public to consume more ofcertain articles by a skilful campaign of propaganda, and that inthis way a very large and otherwise unmarketable surplus of canadian apples had been satisfactorily disposed of in Canada in1915.The Imperial War Cabinet decided To commend to the consideration of the Food Controller theimportance of a campaign of propaganda for impressing onthe public the desirability of a greater consumption ofcertain alternative forms of food such as oats.The Sinking of the&quot; Eotorua.&quot;9. The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was drawn tothe. fact that the &quot; llotoruu,&quot; bringing a large and valuable cargo of meat and other foodstuffs from New Zealand, had been torpedoedan hour after leaving Plymouth, and a question was put whether further precautions might not have been taken, or whether the vessel might not have been unloaded at Plymouth.The First Sea Lord pointed out that every precaution was already being taken, consistently with the forces at the disposal ofthe Admiralty, and that as a matter of fact the Channel was,generally speaking, one of the safest zones.The Shipping Controller stated that the facilities for unloadingthese large cargoes of frozen meat were not available at Plymouth,and that the vessel would in any case require to go to London to beloaded up for her out-ward voyage.The Release ofAdmiralty Colliers.10. The question was raised as to whether the Admiralty couldrelease any of its colliers by substituting barges, hulks, or lighters,in their place.The First Sea Lord and the Shipping Controller stated thatthis proposal had been carefully examined, and that the results ofthis scrutiny were under consideration, but that no very largefurther economies could be anticipated beyond those alreadycarried out..........
Timber and 11. The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was drawnLumbermen. to the latest information received from the Director of timber supplies, which pointed out that in order to meet our total requirements by timber cut in England and France it would benecessary to secure an additional 70,000 lumbermen. Of these atleast 20,000 to 30,000 would have to be skilled men.. Sir Robert Borden and Sir James Meston undertook to telegraph to Canada and India, with a -view to securing the largest possible number of additional lumbermen beyond those already applied for.It was also pointed out that a considerable number of australian, New Zealand, and Canadian lumbermen were serving in the Forces in France, and the Imperial War Cabinet commendedto the attention of the War Office the desirability of releasing thesemen from Active Service.The Eelease ofCoasting Shipping.12. The possibdity of securing the release on a large scale of american coasting ships, and a still further release of shipsengaged in the coasting trade of the Dominions by the substitution of neutral vessels which were at present laid up owing to the unwillingness of their owners and crews to cross the GermanBlockade Zone, was discussed.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that Enquiry should be made by each of the Dominions with aview to ascertaining the extent to which there was stillroom for the substitution of British by neutral shipping in their coastal trades.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,March 27, 1917.(Initialled)D.

APPENDIX I.G.T.-290. -Sinking of Hospital Ship &quot; Asturias &quot; by a German Submarine.THE Secretary of the Admiralty presents his compliments to Colonel Hankey,and begs to state that amongst the news which has been intercepted to-day from the wireless Stations of the German Government is contained an official announcement,that the Hospital Ship &quot; Asturias,&quot; of 12,002 tons, has been sunk by a German &quot; U &quot;boat. This vessel was struck at 11*55 p.m. on the 20th March when six miles southof Start Point, arid was finally grounded at the entrance to Salcombe. Until thereceipt of the German message referred to above it was uncertain whether she hadbeen mined or torpedoed. The vessel carried navigational lights, illuminated red cross and green band required as a Hospital Ship, this green band being approximately50 feet above the water: . There was loss of life.The Secretajy of the Admiralty requests that this matter may receive the early consideration of the War Cabinet.Admiralty, S.W.,March 26, 1917.o
