The Director of Military Operations reported a successful operation by General Maude against the Turks, in the course ofwhich, making use of interior lines, he had driven the enemy backa distance of 4 miles with heavy losses. General Maude had furtherreported that the action was still in progress, and that good results were anticipated.At the request of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, theImperial War Cabinet instructed : The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to telegraph on their behalf a message to be given to the Russian President ofthe Council urging the importance of a Russian effortagainst Turkey.Submarines.3. The First Sea Lord  reported the probable sinking of anenemy  submarine  off Zeebrugge, and  made  his usual statementof mercantile losses.    He gave the following figures for the averagedaily gross  tonnage lost  during January, February, March, and-April respectively : 	British.	Allied.	Neutral.

The Secretary of State for War reported that informationStoppage of Parcels,   emanating from the French Consul-General at Rotterdam had beenreceived to the effect that prisoners of war in Germany were nolonger receiving their parcels.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that: The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should telegraph toascertain whether the Dutch Government (who are incharge of British interests in Germany) have received any information on the subject.* The^full total of prisoners was believed to exceed 13,000.
The Secretary of State for War undertook to make enquiriesin the Prisoners of War Department, and to report theresult to the Imperial War Cabinet.Spain:Possible Co-opera-tion.5. With reference to War Cabinet 91, Minute 10, the imperial war Cabinet had under consideration certain Personal and Secrettelegrams from the British Representative at Madrid, indicating thepossibility that Spain might join the Allies, and asking for instructions as to whether the Allies do or do not desire that Spainshould abandon her neutrality. In this connection they had beforethem memoranda by the General Staff and the Admiralty WarStaff (Paper G.T.-1S1); by the Minister of Munitions (paper g.T.-164); by the Shipping&apos;Controller (Paper G.T.-151); and bythe Foreign Office (Paper G.T.-198).The disadvantages of Spanish co-operation are that they would undoubtedly lead to a drain on the Allies in one form or another,; that we should lose the considerable protection of Spanish territorial waters, which is particularly valuable in the Mediterranean, andthat Spain would probably require compensation in Morocco.As against this, the advantages of Spanish co-operation wouldbe very considerable, including the probable effect on the south american States; the use of German merchant ships in Spanishports; the use of Spanish merchant ships, many of which have been laid up ; an assurance that we should obtain our essential suppliesof Spanish ore ; the denial of the use of Spanish ports as bases for enemy submarines ; the internment of the large number of activeGerman agents in Spain ; the provision of great reserves of labourand man-power, although the Spanish army would at first be of only slight value, owing to its inadequate equipment; and, finally, thegreat moral effect, particularly in Scandinavia, of the adherence tothe cause of the Allies of the only remaining Great Power.On a review of these considerations the Imperial War cabinet authorised the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (1.) To inform the British Ambassador in Madrid that theBritish Government would welcome the co-operation of spain, which should be encouraged as far as possible;and, further, to ask the British Ambassador to takeadvantage of every opportunity that might occur of&apos; impressing on the Spanish Government, if they contem-plate joining the Allies, to take precaution againstdamage being caused to German ships in their ports.(2.) To inform the French Government that we have instructedour Ambassador to encourage Spanish intervention.Greece.Til 42-10 i6. The discussion on the situation in Greece (Imperial WarCabinet 9, Minute 7) was continued.The Director of Military Operations read to the Imperial WarCabinet a Paper prepared by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff(G.T.-430), expressing his strong conviction that the remnants ofthe Greek troops and reservists now in Thessaly could not be anyserious menace to the communications of the Salonica Force, andthat a military occupation of Larissa would therefore be a quiteunnecessary diversion of military strength in itself, and would,probably lead up to further incidents, involving a campaign for thecomplete subjugation of Greece, the consequence of which would beto deprive the Sal mica Force of any usefulness which it nowpossessed.The Imperial War Cabinet also bad before them a memorandum;by the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-433) laying stress on the difficultiing position that would be created by an enlargement of the&quot; Foreign OfficeB 2sphere of operations to Greece, and a series of
memoranda (G.T.-419, G-.T.-420, and G.T.-421) illustrating thedifficulties which had arisen owing to the divergence between Frenchand British policy in the treatment of Greek affairs.In the course of the discussion, Lord Robert Cecil urged thatthe unsatisfactory situation in Greece ought to be cleared up at aConference with the Allies as soon as possible. He suggested thatthe French Government should be definitely made aware of the unfavourable results of their methods hitherto, and of the suspicionsto which they gave rise, and informed that if any active steps wereto be taken in order to set Greek affairs in order, this could only bedone if the whole conduct of diplomatic affairs in Greece wereentrusted to the British Government, whose motives were notsuspected, and that in that case the British Government would replace the present British Minister in Athens by a Special Repre-sentative of the highest public position.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that: A strongly worded telegram should be sent by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, on behalf of the Imperial WarCabinet, to the French Government, urging that the advance against the Bulgarians on the Salonica Frontshould be carried out without delay.The Imperial War Cabinet also instructed Lord Robert Cecil to telegraph to the French Government that no steps shouldbe taken as regards Greece until the Italian Governmenthad been consulted.Enlistment ofUnited states citizens In theCanadian Expedi-tionary Force.7. The discussion on this subject was resumed (War Cabinet116, Minute 19 (iv)).The Imperial War Cabinet considered a Memorandum from the judge-Advocate-General, expressing the opinion that Americansenlisting under the terms suggested by the Canadian Governmentwould be subject to Military Law until discharged, but would havethe right to claim discharge at any time.The Secretary of State,for War pointed out that this was an unsatisfactory position, and that difficulties enough had already been,created by the anomaly arising out of the difference between theAustralian and the Imperial Army Acts. It was, however, suggestedthat, as the men of the Canadian Forces in France were governed bythe conditions of the Canadian Army Act, just as the Australianswere governed by the conditions of the Australian Army Act, any difficulties might be overcome by such Canadian legislation as mightbe found necessary The Imperial War Cabinet referred the matter for furtherconsideration by Sir Robert Borden, the Secretary of Statefor War and the Attorney-General, whowere to report their decisions to the Imperial War Cabinet.The Imperial War Cabinet also decided that: If the legal difficulties could be satisfactorily overcome, sir robert Borden should instruct Sir J. Pope to visitWashington on behalf of the Canadian Government and as certain whether the Government of the United states would regard the proposed enlistment of Americans in theCanadian army with favour.Sir Robert Burden undertook at the same time to let the ForeignOffice know when Sir J. PopVs mission was decided on, inorder that the latter might be able to inform the british ambassador at Washington accordingly.
Proposed AmericanUnit in the UnitedKingdom.8. The Secretary of State for War informed the Imperial WarCabinet that there was a movement among Americans resident inthis country to raise a battalion for service on the continent.Imperial War 9. The Imperial War Cabinet decided, in order to find time for cabinet Agenda.       ^ne meetings of the sub-committees appointed to consider the termsof peace (Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 14), To suspend its sittings till Thursday, 19th April, on which dayit was proposed to discuss Sir Robert Borden&apos;s Resolutionfor the Imperial Conference with regard to the utilisation of the natural resources of the Empire, and Mr. Massey&apos;resolution with regard to Imperial preference.With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 9, Minute 14, theImperial War Cabinet decided that Representatives of the Foreign Office and Colonial Office shouldalso sit on Lord Milner&apos;s sub-committee.(Initialled) D.
