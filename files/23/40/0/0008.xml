The western front.1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported a successful advance by the French to the south of St. Quentin. a document had been captured indicating that the last Britishadvance had been considerably more rapid than the enemy had anticipated, and that the villages taken on the 2nd April were tohave been held till the 18th. The railway construction across theevacuated ground had been carried out very successfully, and had reached a point 2 miles beyond Bapaume.Two additional Germau Divisions had been located in Belgium,bringing the total up to 148 as against 119 last summer.Russia:Concentration ofGerman Transportsin the Baltic.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported a con-centration of troops, Rhine boats, and other craft, in the GermanBaltic ports. According to the latest information from the first sea Lord, the Russian Baltic Fleet was in a most inefficient condition as a result of the Revolution, and had practically no officers left.Unless the minefield were reinforced the moment the ice melted,there was nothing to prevent the Germans landing either behindRiga or on the coast of Finland.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that The First Sea Lord and the Chief of the Imperial General staff should draft a telegram, to be sent from the Prime Ministerto the head of the Prussian Government, impressing upon him the importance of laying mines at the earliest possible moment, in order to provide against the danger of aGerman landing: behind the Russian lines.The United Statesof America:Telegram to president Wilson.3. The Imperial War Cabinet authorised the Prime Minister,&apos;3&quot;as soon as official information is received of acceptance by congress of the resolution in favour of war with Germany, to send a telegram to President Wilson, on behalf of the whole Empire assembled inthe Imperial War Cabinet, cordially welcoming the co-operation ofthe United States, and laying special stress on the fact that we tooregarded the war as one not against the German people, but againstthe system of Prussian autocracy.Distribution of president Wilson&apos;sSpeech to theGerman Army.4. The Secretary of State for War stated that the War office had already taken in hand arrangements for distributing a trans-lation of President Wilsoifs speech over the German lines by aircraft.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs undertook to reply inthis sense to Washington telegram No. 870.o. The Prime Minister informed the Imperial War Cabinet ofthe decision taken by the War Cabinet on the previous day (WarCabinet, 113, Minute 13), that a Representative of the BritishGovernment of the highest status, accompanied by Naval, Military,and Financial experts, should proceed as soon as possible to theUnited States.The Prime Minister of Canada undertook to warn his colleagues in Canada that some Canadian Minister might be requiredto meet the British Representative at Washington, but the precise selection was to be left until after the arrival &quot;of theBritish Representative, when he had formed an idea of thenature of the Canadian advice most needed.* Inconsequence of the decision at the War Cabinet on the following day that the King should beasked to send a message, this decision was not carried out.Yisit of british representative.
There was also some discussion as to the selection of theprincipal Military expert to accompany the British Representative,and as to the actual arrangements for the journey.Enemy Shipping inSouth AmericanPorts.6. The Imperial War Cabinet discussed a proposal by theShipping Controller that the United States should be asked to bring pressure on the South American Republics in order to requisitionimmediately and put into commission, or at the disposal of theAllies, all the enemy ships in their ports, some 300 in number, witha total tonnage of over 800,000 tons. Any possible fear of Germanreprisals after the war could be met by a joint guarantee of theAllies. *In view of recent communications frmi His Majesty&apos;s represen-tatives in South American States deprecating the United Statesintervention in the matter, there was a general opinion that immediate action as suggested would be of doubtful expediency.Sir R. Borden, from his general knowledge of the situation andhis experience of the sentiments of a South American Minister whohad visited Canada after attending the Pan-American Congress,conni-med the view that the interference of the United States wouldprobably be resented in South America.Attention was drawn to the fact that the seizure of these ships would be construed by the enemy as an act of war, so that the issuereally was one, as in the case of Portugal, of putting pressure on them to join the Allies.   It was decided that The question should be discussed with the United StatesGovernment at Washington by the British Representativereferred to above.Mine-laying.7. The First Sea Lord made his usual statement of mercantilelosses. He further reported the return of two mine-laying sub-marines from the Heligoland Bight. A third had not yet returned.About 2,000 mines had also been laid in the Bight during the lastweek by surface craft.8. In order to illustrate the difficulty of destroying submarinesthe First Sea Lord read the reports, sent in by both sides, of a recentencounter in which British destroyers had attacked a Britishsubmarine by mistake. The submarine, which returned safely,reported receiving several hits and being violently shaken by the depth-charges which were dropped immediately over her. the destroyers, on the other hand, reported the sinking of the submarineas a certainty.9. The First Sea Lord reported that the first British rigidairship, equipped with engines taken from a German - Zeppelin, had made a successful flight on the previous day. She was only useful for training purposes.New Zealand. 10. The Prime Minister of New Zealand drew attention to thevery large number of insulated ships, engaged in the New Zealandmeat trade, which had been withdrawn. The total, including fivewhich had just been transferred to the River Plate trade by theShipping Controller, was seventeen. This involved not only veryserious temporary loss to New Zealand&apos;s largest industry, but might involve its permanent dislocation. The feeling in New Zealand onthe matter was very strong, and, though it would make no difference to their efforts, they might consider that this was a sorry requitalfor all New Zealand&apos;s sacrifices in the common cause.Submarines:Difficulty of destroying.British BigidAirship.
It was pointed out that it was a matter of sheer necessity to save transport wherever possible. The voyage from the Argentinetook twenty days as against forty-two days from New Zealand, sothat the same ships could carry twice the amount of meat for thiscountry and for the Army. Lancashire, had had to suffer in the same way. Its facilities for sending goods to its most important market &apos;-the East had been cut down to one ship a week, which involvedon an average a closing down of two days a week throughoutLancashire.On the other hand, it was suggested that, if America&apos;s entry into the war brought about a really substantial addition to our total tonnage, our position might to some extent be reconsidered.Mr. Massey fully appreciated the difficulties of the situation,but expresssed the hope that the matter should be reviewed at thefirst possible opportunity.ProposedFormation of a jewish Corps for service inEgypt and palestine.11. The Imperial War Cabinet had under consideration aletter to the Prime Minister, dated the 24th January, 1917, fromM. Jabotiusky (Paper G.T.-353), advocating the formation of a jewish regiment for service in Palestine and Egypt.Sir R Borden mentioned that there had been a movement inthe same direction in Canada, but that the proposal had beendeprecated by the Jews there, who preferred to fight as Canadians.The Secretary of State for War reported that, similarly, pro-posals to form special Jewish units at an earlier stage of the war had not met with a favourable reception on the part of the jewish community, and his information, did not support the view that anyvery large number of Jewish recruits could be obtained.It was, however, pointed out that the objection had originallycome from English Jews, and that the question was of raising aSpecial Unit among the large number&apos; of alien, more particularlyRussian, Jews now in the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for War undertook to investigate thewhole matter and to present a scheme to the Imperial WarCabinet at an early date.The Air Services. 12. In view of the discussion, both in the  press and in theHouse of Commons, of the increased number of casualties in theRoyal Flying Corps, General Sir David Henderson read tothe Imperial War Cabinet a memorandum (Appendix) giving afull statement, both as to the general causes of casualties in the, field and their comparison with those of the enemy and our owncasualties of the preceding year, as well as a detailed analysis of theproportion of casualties in the different types of machines. he pointed out that the strength of the Royal Flying Corps was doublewhat it had been a year before, that we used our machines to avery much greater extent than the Germans for carrying outartillery observation, even under the most difficult and dangerousconditions, and that the recent German retirement had involved an enormous amount of dangerous long-distance reconnaissance. the casulties had, in consequence, been considerable, though by nomeans in an excessive degree as compared with those of thepreceding year; but they had been far more than compensated forby the saving of loss of life in the rest of the Army, resulting fromthe free use we made of our airmen. In his opinion, this continuousquestioning in the House of Commons and criticism in the press ofparticular types of aeroplanes had a very bad effect on the nerves of young officers, who could not help being- influenced by what theyread, and he considered that the probability of accidents was inconsequence greatly increased.
After considerable discussion, the Imperial War Cabinet agreedthat The question should, in the first instance, be debated at a secret session of Parliament, where full information should begiven, and a further offer made to the House of commons that the members of the Air Board and other experts wouldbe willing to meet Members of Parliament at a privateinterview and answer any questions put to them.In view of the fact that a Secret Session could not take place for some weeks, and that the campaign against the Air Services was bound to do considerable harm in the interval,Sir R. Borden and General Smuts undertook to make reassuringstatements in their forthcoming speeches on Wednesday next, the 11th April, 1917.(Initialled) D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.,April 5, 1917.
APPENDIX.Casualties in the Field.THE increased number of casualties in the Held lately are due to several causes.In the first place, the retirement, of the Germans over a large section of the frontnecessitated a great amount of lon^-distance reconnaissance and of photography. Thisis always dangerous work, and was especially dangerous in this case because of thespecial efforts made by the Germans to stop it. I understand, however, that theinformation supplied by the Royal Flying Corps, as to the German movements and theGerman preparations in front of our army, has been absolutely complete. This couldbe ascertained by reference to Sir Douglas Haig.Probably, in view of this retirement, the Germans had concentrated a very largeproportion of their available forces in front of the British. There has not been nearly so much fighting in the Trench part of the line, and this may also be due to the factthat the French Air Service has hardly been pulling its weight of late. I was informed that General Headquarters that the information obtained by the French Air Service, withregard to their front, was very incomplete, so much so that a considerable portion ofthe German line in. front of the French had to be photographed by the British FlyingCorps.There is no doubt that the Germans have produced, within the last few months, aconsiderable number of fast single-seater Scouts, of which the best is the Albatross.The aeroplanes which we have on our front which are equal to, or better than, theAlbatross Scout, are two French types the Spad and the Nienport and the EnglishSopwith triplane ; of these we have 7 squadrons in all. Next to them, and still ableto hold their own, are the small Sopwiths and the Martinsyde, 4 squadrons. Our first-class two-seater machines capable of being used for offensive fighting, are the DeHavilland 4, and the Bristol Fighter; there are at the moment 1 squadron of each.The F.E. 2d., with the Rolls-Royce, is a two-seater fighter, which will not be outclassedfor some time ; of these there are 2 squadrons. The machines principally used forreconnaissance are Sopwith 1^- strutters ; of these there are 3 squadrons. * A squadron of S.E. 5 single-seater fighters, which are believed to be superior to any Germanmachine, is due to leave England this week.The delay in producing larger .numbers of these fighting machines is due almostentirely to the delays in engine production. We are only now beginning to getBritish-made engines equal to those which the Germans have, had for the lasteighteen months, with the exception of the Rolls-Royce engine, of which the supply has always been limited. The high-powered British engines, however, have now reached the production stage, and the quantities delivered are expected to increaseweek by week, which will enable us to provide for the Expeditionary Force first-classfighting machines in good quantities.In addition to long reconnaissance, a very large amount of Artillery observationwork is always going on, much more in our Army than in either the French or theGerman. This certainly adds to our casualty list without inflicting on the enemyproportionate losses in the air. It does, however, enable our Artillery to inflict muchmore serious losses on the German forces on the ground, and this must be taken intoaccount in considering whether we get sufficient value for the casualties we suffer.With regard to the losses inflicted on the Germans, the announcements which aremade in the official communiques do not show their full extent; so much of thefighting takes place on the German side of the line that very often there is no information whatever about the actions of our aeroplanes which are reported missing,but it is known that frequently in these unseen fights serious losses are inflicted on theGermans. The German casualties which are reported in our official communiques areonly those which are seen and vouched for by our Flying Corps in the course of their .work, but from time to time rights have been witnessed from the ground in which bothGerman and British aeroplanes fell, in German, territory. But, considering eventhe published accounts of fighting in the air, the losses on each side are notdisproportionate, considering the different employment that is made of the air forces ;that is to say, that the German aeroplanes are merely employed in trying to bringdownour aeroplanes, whereas ours are mainly employed in doing work required by the Army.It was noticeable last year that up to the beginning of June there was no markedsuperiority in the air..pn either side, and that the losses on each side appeared to beabout equal.   After that date, in the continuous good weather, our superiority became
more and more marked, but our losses did not dimmish to any great extent, for thereason that our superiority on the battlefield was only maintained by continuousfighting at a distance behind the German lines.If we would consent to adopt the same policy as the Germans, there is no doubtthat our casualties in the air could be diminished. Hitherto, when the German hasfound himself inferior, he has given up reconnaissance entirely, and has confinedhimself to defensive fighting on his own ground ; but if we were now to follow thesetactics, the effect on the Army generally would be most serious ; we would be able toshow an admirable balance-sheet of casualties in the air, but the Germans would haveinformation of our movements, and we would have none of their movements ; theywould have observation for their guns, and our gunners would be blind. Such a policy at this period would be disastrous.   The casualties must be faced.Types of Aeroplanes on which Casualties have occurred during March 1917, andpercentages of Casualties to Total Number of each Type employed.5 squadrons Sopwith (single-seater and 2-seater) ..          ..          - -          273,     ,,   &apos;    De Havilland2           ..          .. --3      ,,        Nieuport (single-seater and 2-seater) ..          ..          - -          ji1      ,,        Morane        ..          ..            - - -&apos;         - -          - -          ^1      ,,        Martinsyde   ..          .. v                        &apos;1               Armstrong-Whitwortn            .. . -          - -          * *           &quot;2      ,,        P.E. 2d        ..          . .           - - - -          - -          -:          2.1      ,,        De Havillandi ...]      ,,        Bristol Fighter (not in action).Average percentage          .. . -          1 *Month.
