The Air Service. 1. THE Secretary of State -for War informed the imperial war Cabinet that His Majesty the King had done the Royal FlyingCorps the honour of becoming its Colonel-in-Chief.With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 8, Minute 12, thePrime Minister, on behalf of the Imperial War Cabinet, thankedSir Robert Bordeii and General Smuts for the clear and Usefulstatements male by them in their speeches at Edinburgh on the1 Lth April.The Director of Military Operations read the following com-munication from Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig with reference tothe Air Service : -&quot; In reply to your telegram of the 10th instant, yourstatement that aircraft operations last week were necessarily. preliminary and yesterday&apos;s results largely attributable theretowas correct. Also that results achieved prove correctness of principles on which Air Service has worked and superiority ofour airmen. I regret that same cannot be said of our equip-meut. Difficulties to be overcome were increased by number of out-of-date machines, and new type machines came too late forpilots to become accustomed to them. I have no doubt great efforts were made at home, and have no desire to complain, butwish to avoid giving any false impression.&quot; &quot;;The Western 2. The Director of Military Operations reported that furtherFront. positions bad been occupied north of the Vimy Ridge, and that heavy counter-attacks by the enemy had been repulsed.French Military 3. T,ne Director of Military Operations reported that the ChiefPolicy1: &apos;&quot; of the Imperial General Staff had received information of a conference which had taken place at French General Headquarters about ten days ago between the French Government, General Nivelle, and the commanders of the different French Armies, in which the FrenchGovernment had expressed doubts about General Nivelle&apos;s plan, andhad urged its abandonment. In the end General Nivelle&apos;s view hadprevailed, but it was undoubtedly an unsatisfactory feature that his policy was questioned, and that he felt himself to some extent onhis trial.The Prime Minister informed the Imperial War Cabinet thatthe question had been raised in the course of his interview withM. Ribot on the previous day, when M. Ribot had asked for theopinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of the British GeneralStaff with regard to General Nivelle, on which point the PrimeMinister had assured M. Ribot that both the Government and theGeneral Staff had every confidence in General Nivelle. The PrimeMinister further explained that his information was that thedifficulty was not between the Government and the Army, butbetween two military schools of thought, of which the one headed byGeneral Pdtain, who had considerable influence with the president and M. Painleve&quot;, was in favour of a defensive policy.Russia 4. With reference to War Cabinet 116, Minute 7, the Directorof Military Operations read the following telegram sent by Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig to General Alexeieff: -&quot; On behalf of all officers and men of the British Armies inFrance I desire to offer you our warmest congratulations on your appointment to the Supreme Command of the armies of Russia With a lively recollection of all that our Russiancomrades-in-arms have already done, we look with confidence
Mesopotamia. 5. The Director of Military Operations reported an enquiryfrom General Alexeieff as to whether General Maude could help with provisions for the Russian Army in the Persian-Turkishtheatre of operations, and explained that, though there was a certainamount of supplies available in the Baghdad area, there was nomeans of transporting it to the Russians. He expressed the viewthat our previous hopes as to the extent of Russian support likelyto be received in this area would have to be considerably modified.6. The Director of Military Operations stated that he hadreceived a telegram from General Milne reporting a further post-ponement of the offensive on the Salonica Front by General Sarrail,from the 5th April to the 25th April. The reason given by general sarrail was the necessity for getting up more ammunition. Thedelay was serious, in view of the fact that 1,700 cases of malariahad already occurred.The Secretary of State for War informed the Imperial WarCabinet that, in the opinion of the Medical Authorities, we wouldhave to reckon with the possibility of having 100,000 men down with malaria at Salonica this summer.Salonica.France and the 7. The Prime Minister reported a conversation which he hadGreek Situation. had with M Ribot aDout the Greek situation, which suggested tohim that General. Sarraif&apos;s delay was more probably connected withhis desire to occupy Larissa. M. Ribot had urged the desirabilityof this step, suggesting that it could be done.with two or threebattalions. The Prime Minister had pointed out to M. Ribot thatthis modification of the policy agreed upon at the Rome conference could not be decided upon without previous consultation with theItalian Government, and M. Ribot had suggested that he would,invite Baron Sonnino. to Paris.M. Ribot had further added that French public opinion wasvery disturbed about the whole question of Greece. There was anintense feeling against the King of Greece, and; in his opinion,something drastic would have to be done when the FrenchChamber met on the 24th May, as otherwise no French Government[1142-9] . B 2for further triumphs by the glorious Russian Army under yourable leadership. We beg you to convey to all ranks of theforces under your Command the assurance of the firmdetermination of the British Forces under my Command to do all that is in our power to assist our Russian comrades to over-throw our common enemy. I would ask you and all ranks inyour Army tu accept the success we have lately won as a proof of our ability to defeat the picked troops of the German Army,as well as ah earnest of our intention to persist in the struggletill the aims of the Allies have been attained, and the territories of Russia and of our other Allies have been freed from theinvader.&quot;The Director of Military Operations also read a telegram fromGeneral Hanbury-Williams, describing a serious state of affairs bothin the Army and in the Munition Works, very little work being done in either case. There? were, however, some signs that theArmy might become irritated with the attitude of the workmen,and insist on the re-establishment of order. Other information from the Naval Attache and the British Ambassador was somewhatmore reassuring.The Prime Minister mentioned that the French Governmentwere sending M. Thomas to Russia.
Corfu.would be able to survive the storm of indignation that would beraised against it.A discussion followed, in which it was pointed out that therewas in this country also a feeling that M. Venizelos had not received sufficient support, and that the King of Greece was beingsupported by Royal influence here. On the other hand, stress was laid on the fact that the real difficulty was the distrust felt in Italy,and also in this country, of French ambitions in Greece; and it wasalso urged that the action advocated by the French would involvea fresh military entanglement, and divert troops, who ought to beused against the Germans and Bulgars, to chasing Greek irregulars.The Imperial War Cabinet decided To postpone the discussion of the subject to its next Meeting.The Secretary was instructed to circulate Memoranda recentlyprepared by the  Foreign Office with regard to Frenchpolicy in Greece.8. The Prime Minister further stated that M. Ribot had expressed his anxiety that the British Government should send asmall garrison to join the French and Italian garrison at Corfu, inorder to counteract Italian political activities in the island. Asuggestion was made that a Military Convalescent Depdt might beestablished at Corfu, but the matter was left over for furtherconsideration.Archangel.9. The First Sea Lord read a telegram from the Naval TransportOfficer at Archangel, describing the situation as very unsatisfactory.This confirmed and justified the decision of the War Cabinet on theprevious day (War Cabinet 117, Minutes 15 and 22).Submarines.10. The First Sea Lord described an action in the Mediterraneanbetween the destroyer &quot; Racoon &quot; and an enemy submarine, inwhich the submarine appeared to have been destroyed. He gave the usual list of mercantile casualties.The Sinking of 11. The Secretary of State for War reported that he fearedHospital Ships.        a nUmber of nurses had been lost in the hospital ship &quot; Salta,&quot; whichhad struck a mine off Havre.The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was drawn to thefact that very little had been said in the press about the Germancampaign against hospital ships.The Imperial War Cabinet instructed .the Secretary to draw the attention of the Information Department of theForeign Office to the importance of full and repeatedstatements in the press of this country and of the UnitedStates of America on this subject, more particularly inconnection with reprisals that would have to be taken.The question of reprisals.12. Having regard to the public announcement that reprisalswould he taken, and to the impossibility of protecting ourhospital ships in - any other way, the Imperial War cabinet were agreed that reprisals in some form or another would now have to be taken. &apos; In view- of the conclusions of theCommittee which had been enquiring into the question, thatthe only practicable form of reprisals, and the one that had provedmost effective in the past, was the aerial bombardment of an openGerman town, the Imperial War Cabinet, though most reluctant to embark upon a policy which might involve the killing of women
The Protection of 13. Mr. Massey informed the Imperial War Cabinet that heShipping in the        had received a cable from   New Zealand  enquiring  as  to  theannel. measures of special protection- which had been afforded to the&quot; Rotorua,&quot; which had been recently sunk off Plymouth.The First Sea Lord explained that there were not enoughdestroyers to make it possible to give more protection to individualships than the general protection afforded by the Channel patrols.The Shipping Controller added that it would not have beenpossible to land the cargo of the &quot;Rotorua&quot; at Plymouth, asneither the port nor the railway facilities are such as to admit ofthe suggestion being adopted.Terms of Peace. 14. On the suggestion of the Prime Minister, the Imperial WarCabinet decided .To set up two Sub-Committees to consider the question of thefuture terms of peace, and report to the Imperial WarCabinet.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that One of these Sub-Committees should deal with the question ofthe territorial desiderata in the Terms o&apos;f Peace, and shouldbe composed as follows : Lord Curzon (Chairman),Sir R. Borden (or another Canadian Minister),General Smuts,Mr. Massey (or Sir J. Ward),Sir E. Morris,Mr. Austen Chamberlain,Sir S. Sinha,Mr. Long,Lord R. Cecil (or Lord Hardinge),Captain L. S. AmeryJ as Secretary.and children, were agreed that there was no other alternative. Itwas explained that the tombir Inent which would shortly takeplace would bs definitely anhoUhoed as a r-eprisal for the sinking ofthe hospital ship &quot;Asturias.&quot; The Imperial War Cabinet decidedthat This measure of reprisal should ha followed by a carefullyprepared statement of justification by the Admiralty,explaining that no further reprisals would be taken assoon as the Germans ceased their attacks upon our hospital ships. -In view of the importance of giving the Germans no excuse for continuing the sinking of hospital ships, the Imperial WarCabinet decided that  The Indian military guard on hospital ships conveying indian troops should be removed, and that the necessary action should be taken by the India Office and the Admiralty.
The other Sub-Commifctee should deal with economic andother non-territorial desiderata in the Terms of Peace, andshould be composed as follows : Lord Milner (Chairman),Mr. Henderson,Sir R.
