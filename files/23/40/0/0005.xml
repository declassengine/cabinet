Egypt: Actionnear Gaza.1. THE Secretary of State for War reported that the troops had advanced about 15 miles from Rafa to a point 5 &quot;miles west ofGaza, and had there been heavily attacked on the 26t-h and 27thMarch by some 20,000 Turks. The Turks had been repulsed witha loss of 0,000 to 7,000 killed and wounded, in addition to 900prisoners, including the General and Staff of the 53rd TurkishDivision, Austrian and German Officers, and two Austrian4*2 howitzers.The Chief of tbe Imperial General Staff explained that a rapidpursuit of the defeated. Turks would be difficult, as the water-supply of the Force was still derived from the Suez Canal, but thatthe Force would be in the region of a good local water-supply whenonce they crossed the line Gaza to Beersheba.The Imperial War Cabinet authorised -The Secretary of State for War tc send their congratulations to General Sir Archibald Murray.&quot;Western Front:The german withdrawal.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Stafr reported that therewere also signs of an impending withdrawal of the German line inthe region of the St, Mihiel salient.Rumoured German peace Overtures.3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a telegram(No. 817) dated the 28th March, 1917, from the British represen-tative at Washington, reporting a strong rumour which had reachedthe American State Department that the German Chancellor will,on the 29th March, outline further proposals for peace in tbeGerman Reichstag, and urging the desirability of His Majesty sGovernment being ready to issue a statement commenting on theseproposals the moment they app&quot;&apos; d. in order to counteract theirpossible effect in America.The United States:Effect of submarine campaign.4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs also read atelegram (No. 818) from the British representative at Washington,reporting the bad effect produced in the United States by theGerman announcements with regard to the success of theirsubmarine Avarfare, which had not been officially contradicted, but had been in fact supported by a recent speech made by LordBeresford, and asking for a reassuring statement.The Imperial War Cabinet considered that the Germanfigures were not so exaggerated that a direct contradiction of them was desirable, and also realised that there were unsatisfactoryfeatures in the present situation, more particularly connected withthe delays due to incessant strikes in shipbuilding yards, whichthreaten seriously to jeopardise the whole position. On the otherhand, they were of opinion that the losses were not, so far, inexcess of the high estimates given by the Admiralty, which hadbeen the basis of the general policy of the War Cabinet withregard to the restriction of imports ; moreover, there were con-siderable reserves of shipping locked up in overseas expeditions,which might be released in the event of a very great emergency.In view of the great importance of the decision to be.taken bythe United States of America on the 2nd April, the Imperial WarCabinet decided that  It was desirable to go to the furthest possible limits inreassuring public minds in the United States of America,and they authorised the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to arrange for a statement.to be published in theUnited States on the aixthority of the First Lord as the
spokesman of the Imperial War Cabinet in the followingsense : &quot;The German statements are, as usual, exaggerated-gerated, but no one suggests that the submarine warfare is not causing very serious damage, both to neutrals and belligerents. The losses, however, donot exceed the estimates on which we have based our policy, and, after the most careful consideration, it isabundantly clear that the German hopes of starvingus out are quite illusory. So far, neutrals have suffered more from German methods than ourselves.&quot;The Imperial War Cabinet further decided that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should take steps toprevent the publication of this telegram in this country.The Imperial War Cabinet also invited Lord Curzon to show the above telegram (No. 818) from washington to Lord Beresford.Timber andLumbermen.5. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 4, Minute 11, afurther discussion took place with regard to the urgency of securingmore lumbermen, in order to save the shipping employed in bringingtimber from overseas to England and France.The attention of the Secretary. of State for War was againinvited to the numbers of Canadian, New Zealand, and Australianlumbermen who were engaged in the fighting line in France. TheSecretary of State for War informed the Imperial War Cabinet thatsome of these were being withdrawn from the trenches in order toorganise the natives who were being brought to France to cuttimber, and promised to do his utmost to secure all that could possibly be spared.The Imperial War Cabinet were very strongly of opinion thatthe only satisfactory method of getting forward rapidly with thesubstitution of home-grown French and English timber for importedtimber was to stop all importation at once. In deference, however,to a request of the Secretary of State for War, who wished to consult further with the Director of Timber Supplies, a decision onthis point was postponed.Lumbermen fromthe- United States.6. The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was also called to the possibility of securing a large number of lumbermen fromthe United States, but the Imperial War Cabinet decided that This matter could not be proceeded with until after 2nd April.Firing at Lowestoft., 7. The First Sea Lord reported that some firing had takenplace off Lowestoft in the early hours of 29th March, and that afew fragments of shells had fallen in the town, but that further particulars were not yet available.The First Sea Lord also gave his usual statement as to shipping&apos;  losses in the last twenty-four hours.Hospital Ships. 8. With reference to Imperial War Cabinet 4, Minute 4, theFirst Sea Lord suggested that appropriate steps should be taken to notify the German Government that those hospital ships whichwere being armed and deprived of their distinctive marks werebeing removed from the list of ships previously communicated to[1142-5] B2
Germany as being under the protection of the Geneva Convention.He pointed out that, failing such an announcement, there was a risk that the Germans would attack our hospital ships all over theworld, and not only in the declared zone. The seriousness of srichaction lav in the fact that it would be quite impossible to provideescorts for all these hospital ships.A discussion took place as to how far the policy of removing the distinguishing marks of hospital ships, and arming them, was really consistent with the policy of reprisals. In view of this, andof the statement by the First&quot; Sea Lord that, since the sinking ofthe &quot; Asturias,&quot; the hospital ship &quot; St. Andrew,&quot; with 314 woundedon board, had been allowed to pass by an enemy submarine whichhad undoubtedly sighted her, the Imperial War Cabinet decided To hold in suspense their previous decision, and to postponeaction in respect of reprisals, the arming of hospital ships, the painting out of distinctive marks, and theremoval of lights.Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee, reinforced by Sir J. Ward,Mr. Eazen, and the First Sea Lord, was invited to reconsider the whole question in the light of this factor and of the discussion.newThe shipping situation:Co-operation of theDominions andIndia.9 The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that-The extent to which the Dominions and India could co-operate in regard to mercantile shipping should, in the firstinstance, be discussed in detail by their representativeswith the Shipping Controller, at his Office, on Saturday morning, the 31st March, at 10 a.m., the conclusions reached being subsequently reported by the ShippingController to the Imperial War Cabinet.The Supply ofCereals within theEmpire, and theFood. Supply of theUnited kingdom during the War.10. The President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheriessummarised the views set out by him in a memorandum onthe Supply of Cereals within the Empire (Paper G.T.-252).Mr. Prothero emphasised the great importance, during and afterthe War, of increasing the supply of maize, especially from SouthAfrica, because of its value as human food and for animalconsumption. There were also great areas in the Sudan whichmight grow wheat and cotton, but these depended on irrigationschemes which were held up by the War. The Gezira Plain alone,when irrigated, would furnish 3,000,000 acres.The Imperial War Cabinet proceeded to discuss the food position of the United Kingdom in the immediate future. It waspointed ox.it that the normal wheat consumption of this country was 35 million quarters, of which we grow between 7 and 8 millionquarters, or roughly one-fifth. We grow million quarters of barley, and 21 million quarters of oats, equivalent in food value,after allowing for the smaller quarter and the greater proportion ofhusk, to 12 million quarters of wheat. In extreme circumstances it would be possible to divert the bulk of the barley and oats tohuman food, leaving animals with little or no fodder except hay.The country was thus secure against actual starvation, even if nofood supplies whatever could be imported, but would be reduced todrastic rationing, in which there would be a large percentage of barley and oats in bread.The Shipping Controller explained that, while he agreed thatit was desirable to have, as a minimum, a thirteen weeks&apos; supply ofwheat in the country as demanded by the Food Controller, it wasnot possible for the ports, either; in America &quot;or at home, to handle
indefinite quantities  of  wheat.    He hoped  there would  be  asubstantial increase in the imports of wheat in May, after theopening of the St. Lawrence route, but reminded the Imperial WarCabinet that ships had recently been diverted to take coal to Italy.The Imperial War Cabinet took note (a.) That the ultimate aim should be to build up gradually astore of six months&apos; supply of wheat in this country.(h.) That steps would be taken as soon as possible, as a most urgent war measure, to accumulate a reserve supply forthirteen weeks.(c.) That, in Canada and the United States, there was aconsiderable wheat surplus available for export, andthat these countries offered the shortest sea voyage.(d.) That the Secretary of State for War and the Minister ofMunitions were in consultation with a view to therelease of as many ships as possible from the transportof munitions from North America in the next fewweeks, and their diversion for carrying grain.(e.) That the President of the Board of Agriculture andFisheries was making arrangements with stock-breeders,oil-crushers, and millers to discourage the specialfattening of cattle, and that Agricultural Shows (otherthan business Shows) were being stopped.Danger ofDependence onForeign Supplies.11. The Imperial War Cabinet were informed that largequantities of wheat and maize previously contracted for in argentina, and for which the ships had already been sent, hadsuddenly become unavailable, owing to a decision of the argentine government, acting probably under German influence, to prohibitall exportation. The importance of not being dependent on foreigncountries for essential supplies was taken note of by the imperial war Cabinet.(InitiaUed)      D. LI.
