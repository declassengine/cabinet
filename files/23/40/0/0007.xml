The United Statesof America.The Western Front.The Hedjaz.Eoumania.Aerial Warfare.Submarines.2. The Director of Military Operations reported that the recentmilitary operations between Cambrai and Arras had been completelysuccessful.3. The Director of Military Operations reported that a numberof additional Arab tribes had joined Faisal, the son of the King ofthe Hedjaz, which should greatly increase the effectiveness of theoperations for the interruption of the Hedjaz Railway.4. The Director of Military Operations reported that news hadbeen received from the Military Attache in Roumania to the effectthat, as the result of further investigation, it had been shown thatthe supply situation was better than had been estimated, maizebeing the principal article in which a serioxts shortage existed.5. Attention was drawn to the recent heavy casualties in theRoyal Flying Corps, and the anxiety on this subject in Parliament.It was decided that A special discussion on this subject should take place at thenext meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet.Pending this discussion, and in view of the very heavy aerialfighting now in progress on the Western Front, which necessitated the concentration of every available machine, including those whichcould be spared by the Royal Naval Air Service, the Imperial WarCabinet decided that  &quot;The question of attacking from the air open German towns asan act of retaliation for their sinking hospital ships should be heldover until the Admiralty had ascertained definitely whether the&quot;Gloucester Castle&quot; (see Minute 7 below) had been mined ortorpedoed.6. The First Sea Lord reported injuries to a &quot; Q &quot; ship in theMediterranean in an action with an enemy submarine, and an actionbetween an armed transport and an enemy submarine. He made his usual statement of mercantile casualties..1. THE Prime Minister read to the Imperial War Cabinet atelegraphic summary of President Wilson&apos;s statement to Congress.He suggested that a Special Mission should be sent to washington to explain in detail the needs of the Allies. He also read a preliminary draft, prepared by the Secretary, as a basis for a communication to the Government of the United States of America,suggesting in order the various directions in which they could wagemost effective war on Germany, and dwelling more especially onthe importance of shipping.The Imperial War Cabinet agreed that The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should, in the same afternoon, sound the United States Ambassador in london as to the desirability of sending a Special Mission to washington, and should, in addition, explain to him theviews of the War Cabinet as to the most effective form which the co-operation of the United States of Americacould .take, laying special stress on the importance of putting into service the enemy ships in their ports, and of stimulating shipbuilding to the utmost possible extent,
The Hospital Ship&quot; GloucesterCastle &quot;:Eeprisals.7. With reference to War Cabinet 110, Minute 6, the first sea Lord reported that no definite information had yet beenreceived, as to whether the hospital ship &quot;Gloucester Castle&quot; hadbeen mined or torpedoed. He stated that be had now received full particulars of the accusations made by the Germans of the misuseof hospital ships, some of which, it might be considered difficult, on technical grounds, to refute entirely. The Imperial War cabinet decided that The whole question of reprisals should be reconsidered in thelight of the latest information at an early date.Technical breaches of The hague convention.8. The Secretary of State for India raised the question of the armed guards which the Indian Marine have always kept on theirhospital ships for the purpose of maintaining order.The First Sea Lord also mentioned that certain other technicalbreaches of the regulations with regard to hospital ships had been discovered, which may have provided the foundation for the untruecharges made by the Germans on our use of hospital ships.The Imperial War Cabinet decided that This question should also be held over and considered- inconnection with the question of reprisals.The Financial 9. The Chancellor of the Exchequer presented to the ImperialSituation. War Cabinet a general survey of the Financial Situation, which willbe reproduced in a separate document.He pointed out that, as regards the raising of money in theUnited Kingdom, he foresaw no difficulty during the War, though he realised that if the War continued for considerably more than ayear longer, and the total indebtedness were raised from the present figure of 4,000,000,0007, to such a possible figure as 8,000,000,OOOL,there might be great difficulty in meeting the situation after theWar. . Moreover, in that event, the capacity of our Allies to repaytheir indebtedness to us might be so impaired as to throw practicallythe whole burden on our shoulders.On the other hand, as regards purchases outside the UnitedKingdom and the exchange situation, he had to admit that theposition would in a short time have become very difficult indeed,and that it would have been impossible to maintain the goldstandard very much longer. The Government had, in fact, been advised by the Exchange Committee in the previous November thatthe gold standard could not be maintained any longer. In spite ofthis the Government had gone steadily ahead, prepared to resort to whatever expedients might become necessary before finallyabandoning the gold standard ; and their boldness had now been justified by the intervention of the United States of America, whichwould ease the whole exchange situation.A general discussion followed, in which special stress Was laid on the desirability of inducing the Americans to take over directlythe burden of financing the Allies, which had hitherto devolvedupon us, so that after the war we should not be the only largecreditor of our present Allies, ,In view of the suspicion which tended to be aroused that wewere making a profit out of the war, the opinion was, in fact,expressed that it might be desirable, where feasible, to liquidatepart of the debt owed us by our Allies for other tangible assets.Attention was also drawn to the fact that the present restric-tions on imports and the reduction of shipping would exercise aprejudicial effect upon sitbsequent Budgets.
The FinancialEfforts of theDominions andIndia.10. The Imperial War Cabinet took note that a very largeexpenditure incurred by the Dominions in providing for the equip-ment and maintenance of their own contingents was not includedin Mr. Bonar Law&apos;s statement, so that the total effort of the BritishEmpire was considerably in excess of the large totals given in that statement. The Chancellor of the Exchequer mentioned that thewhole of the advances made to Canada in connection with war expenditure had been met by loans raised by the Canadian Govern-ment or the Canadian banks.Sir Robert Borden added that Canada was spending for war purposes 500,000,000 dollars a year above her ordinary expenditure,which was a very great effort. He observed that Canada had notbeen in a position to pay the same proportion out of taxation as hadbeen done by the United Kingdom, whose effort in this directionhad been most impressive.Mr. Massey added that, in regard to the proportion of population and resources, New Zealand had also made effortscomparable with those of Canada.Sir J. Meston gave some details as to the special expenditureof India in connection with the war, and the drastic reductionmade by India in her ordinary expenditure.The Control of metal Production.11. Arising out of a statement by the Minister of Munitions,there was a short dibcussiom as to the desirability of altering thepre-war practice by which many of the raw materials produced inthe British Empire were sent abroad for manufacture, or for some stage in the manufacture.It was decided that-This question, though one the principle of which must be finally decided by the Imperial War Cabinet, should, inthe first instance, be discussed at the Imperial war conference.(Initialled)      D. LI. G.2, Whitehall Gardens, S. W.,April 3, 1917.o
[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty^ Government.]SIR J. MESTON said the first point with regard to India to which he wished.tocall the attention of the Cabinet was the relative smallness of its revenue, which wasabout 85,000,OOOZ. to 90,000,0001. a year. Out of that the military net expenditure was now 26,O00,000Z. This amount excluded altogether certain smaller sums formarine expenditure and sums which were necessary for the services of loans raised for war operations. Altogether, during the year ending the 31st March, 1917, theIndian Government had remitted to England 71,500,000L Out of that&apos; amount38,500,OOOZ. was war expenditure, which they themselves had advanced to the HomeGovernment. The balance of 33,000,OOOZ. was remitted in response to trade demands,and it might be taken that the great bulk of that was trade which was essential for theconduct of the Imperial machinery, such as wheat, jute, minerals, and other suppliesof national importance. -As regards actual investments, they had up to the end of the last financial yearput altogether 46,500,000Z. into English war securities; some of that was simplyrenewals, but 35,000,0001. was entirely new money.The actual expenditure up to the end of last year in respect of the ExpeditionaryForce which left India to assist in the war was 11,500,000/!. net. It was a great deal more in fact, but as the British G-overnment undertook to pay for the Territorialregiments which were sent to India their net expenditure was ll,5O0,O0OZ., and they proposed to spend this year another 4,000,000Z., which would make 15,000,000Z. for thepayment of forces operating outside India. Apart from that there was at least 6,000,000Z.to 8,000,000Z. additional outlay on account of the extra cost of maintaining&apos;peace on theNorth-West Frontier and in Persia. The expenditure of this amount helped tomaintain peace and order in an otherwise troublesome area and relieved responsibilities in other directions.   AH this was borne by the Government of India.Printed for the Committee of Imperial Defence.   May 1917.SECRET.SIR J.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty s Government.]Printed for the Imperial War Cabinet.   April 1917.SECRET.MR. BONAB LAWS STATEMENT ON FINANCE AT THE SEVENTHMEETING OE THEv IMPERIAL WAR CABINET HELD AT10, DOWNING STREET, S.W., ON THE 3rd APRIL, 1917.MR. BONAR LAW said he would try to put the outstanding features of our financial position as clearly as he could in a very brief statement. There were twoproblems which we had always to face, one was the raising of money at home, whichhad hitherto proved simple, and the other, which was more difficult, was the necessityof making purchases abroad. Dealing first with the home situation, he said that lastyear the total amount of our votes of credit was 2,010,000,000?., which representedapproximately the amount spent on the war. Since the outbreak of war our expendi-ture had been 4,317,000,000?. This amount had been raised by home loans to theextent of 1,761,000,0007,. That did not include Consols converted, but was new money which had been raised by these loans. In addition to this, he thought it was worthmentioning, for the sake of the public interest which it naturally created, that74,000,0007. had been subscribed in War Saving Certificates, and as these were only for 15s. 6dr each it showed the enormous interest which had been taken by the general public in these loans. The balance had been raised by loans. abroad, mainly inAmerica, to the extent of 419,000,0007. Then there were Exchequer Bonds which amounted to 500,000,0007., and in regard to these he would like to point out that theywere not merely a floating debt because the first fell due in 1919 and the majority didnot fall due till 1921, so that our real floating debt was small and was represented byabout 400,000,0007. in Treasury Bills. ,We had advanced to the Allies and the Dominions about 970,000,0007. Of this amount a very small part had been given to the Dominions. The total amountadvanced to the Dominions was 141,000,0007. One satisfactory feature in thisparticular was that there had been no increase in the amounts we had advanced to theDominions. When we came to the Allies the position was very different. All ourearlier European wars had been carried on by our subsidising other nations, but that had never been carried on to the same extent or anything like it as in the present war. At this moment we practically paid for everything bought by our Allies outsideAllied countries. We supplied them with wheat, maize, metals, almost everything,and the result was that the total amount of our advances to the Allies was, as he had previously said, 828,000,000?., and it had been growing. In the first year our advance to France had only been 20,000,000?. ; last year it was 171,000,0007. To Russia inthe first year our advance was 174,000,0007.; last year it was 226,000,0007. To italy the&quot; amount in the first year was 49,000,000?. ; last year it was 107,000,0007.Mr. Bonar Law said that as regards our ability to carry on the war at home he did notthink there was any doubt. The Central Powers found no difficulty in raising money for their own production. We ourselves were in the same position. All payments bythe Government were made by drawing Bills on the Bank of England. These draftsfound their way into the joint stock banks and swelled their balances; they thencame back to the Government either in the form of loans from their j&amp;ustomers or indirect advances from the banks themselves.As regards the loans, Mr. Bonar Law said he would like to point out how closelyour home finance was mixed up with the necessity of keeping up the exchange. Thenecessity of keeping up the exchange had meant an enormous burden not only upon us now, but upon posterity in the years to follow, in regard to the rate which we hadto fix. Were it not for the necessity of keeping up the exchange, money at homewould be unusually cheap. Our first loan was 3^ per cent., and the second loan was4J per cent. He.said he thought it was safe to say that the rate but for the necessityof keeping up the exchange would not be more than 3-1- per cent, to 4 per cent,; that[495]
meant that for the sake of keeping up the exchange we were paying in interest(including conversions) something like 8O,00O,0O0Z. annually more than it would otherwise be necessary for us to pay.   This was really one of the troubles that everyChancellor of the Exchequer bad to face.   On the one hand there were many people who wish cheap money and who paid no attention to the exchange at all.   On theother hand there were those who, he thought, were inclined to keep the ratei unnecessarily high with the idea of adding to our security.   Mr. Bonar Law said thatin his judgment it was necessary to keep up the exchange, and it was therefore necessary to have the rate of money at home high enough to make certain that thereshould be no temptation to send money that was here now, abroad.   He said that wehad kept the exchange for a long time with America at 2 per cent, below par.   Thatwas done by our making purchases whenever necessary in order to keep it at that figure, and there was no doubt that if we allowed the rate of money at home to getlow the exchange would break down and we should have to depart from the goldstandard.   Mr. Bonar Law said that there was no difficulty about financing at home,but   he   thought  it wrould be interesting to  the Cabinet to   consider not  onlywhat  the position was now, but wmat the burden was going to be when  thewar was over, and to consider also our ability to pay from this point of view.It  seemed  to him  that  so  long  as  our Budget provided, in addition to theordinary expenses of the  country, leaving the war  out  of account, a surplus which was sufficient to pay off the debt with a sinking fund in a reasonable numberof years, the position was not a bad one.   In this connection, of the total amountraised for the war, l,137,00O,O0OZ.&apos;had been raised by taxation; that is to say, nearly one-quarter of the total amount expended.   He said he need not point out that therewas no belligerent country which had shown financial strength at all comparable tothis.   Mr. Bonar Law said that looking at it from the point of view which he had indicated our ability to cover by revenue the burden of the debt, the position now wasnot unsatisfactory.   The amount of the National Debt at present was 3,900,000,OOQZ.The financial year ended on the 31st of last month, so that he had the figures up todate.   Of that, 969,O00,O00Z. represented advances to the Allies and Dominions.   Hesaid that if we won the war he thought it safe to assume that we should recoveralmost the whole of that, a great part of it, at all events:   Taking that basis theposition last year was as follows : Our total expenditure including the sinking*fund for this debt, and including also the addition of charges for Pensions and other items which have increased since the war, our total expenditure was 368,000,000Z.   our total revenue was 573,OOO,000Z.   Of that 573,000,OOOZ., 140,000,000Z. was represented by excess profits, which of course could not continue after the war; this reduced therevenue to 433,.000,000Z., leaving a balance in our favour of 65,000,000Z., after payingsinking fund, sufficient- to discharge the debt in about thirty-seven years.   If, howrever,we looked at the position at the end. of the present financial year, it was not sosatisfactory.   By that time the National Debt would amount to 5,750,000,OOOZ.  Takingthe present taxes, and deducting again the advances to the  Allies and to theDominions on the present basis of taxation, instead of having a surplus we shouldhave a deficit of 37,000,000Z, ; that is to say, we should be 37,000,000Z. short ofthe   amount  necessary to  provide for the  sinking fund.    Mr. Bonar Law saidthat. he did not wish to be pessimistic at all, he took rather an optimistic view,and there was  this to comfort us in this  connection, that at the time of the battle of &quot;Waterloo the National Debt was 80O,00O,000Z., while the income of thecountry was estimated at 250,000,OOOZ.   The income to-day was at least ten timesgreater than it was at the time of the Battle of Waterloo.   Although there was alarge margin, it must be evident that, if the war lasted for two more years -if our national Debt increased to 8,000,000,000Z. the probability of our recovering fromthe Allies the moneys advanced would be diminished.Mr. Bonar Law said that he rather expected to take up a good deal of time in discussing the question of payments abroad, but he was glad to think that the telegram which the Prime Minister had read from President Wilson had made it unnecessary for him to go into this question in so much detail as he would otherwise have done. He thought it would be interesting if he told the Cabinet what was theamount of our expenditure in America and. Canada last year. This amounted to3,031,000,000, dollars and was raised by loans, of which Canada provided theBritish Government with 275,000,000 dollars. He was sure the Cabinet would beglad to know that since the war we had not had to advance a penny to Canada. Ouradvances to her, which were about 60,000,OOOZ., were met partly by the canadian government and partly by the Canadian hanks, which brought the amount up to
exactly the same as we had advanced to Canada.   Apart from loans, the only othermethod of paying debts abroad when the balance of trade was against us was by gold and by securities.   The amount of gold which we had sent abroad last year was826,000,000 dollars, and the amount of securities sold was 420,000,000 dollars.   Thatwas the position last year.   The position now, apart from the change which had b&apos;een&apos;!created by America entering the war, was a very serious oue.  Mr. Bonar Law said hethought the Cabinet would perhaps realise how precarious it was before if he told them of an incident that happened at that table towards the end of last November.His own experience, and he thought that of most of his colleagues, bore out what wasthe universal experience, that men with money, and especially the banking class,were the most timid of all human creatures.   Take, for instance, our last loan raised at home; that loan was simply prodigious, and an almost incredible success, producing1,000,000,0001., and what he thought was of no less consequence was the number of people in one way or another who participated, which was not much short of S,000,000.At the time that loan was about to be issued the bankers sent a resolution urging thatthe rate of interest should be 6 per cent, and one of their number, and perhaps thebest known of them, lectured him for something like half an hour on the certainty ofits being a complete failure unless it was 6 per cent.   The results of that loan show how unnecessarily timid they were.    Mr. Bonar Law added that the ExchangeCommittee had- come to the Cabinet of the late Government in November last andadvised there was no alternative but to go off the gold standard owing to the actionof  the  Federal  Reserve Board.   The politicians, who, he  thought,   were .moreaccustomed to living from hand to mouth, were not to be induced to take such a step,and declined to  do it.    But for the  assistance of the American Government,Mr. Bonar Law remarked, he had no doubt whatever that our going off the goldstandard was only a question of time.   There had been ever since this war broke. out great difference of opinion in the  Cabinet  as  to  the  possibility of  our being stopped for want of money.   He was one of those who always believedthat if our credit was good as a whole in some Avay or other methods wouldbe found by which the necessary business abroad would be financed.   But though he believed that, there was no doubt that to give up the gold standard at the outset wrould produce such a shock to all our Allies as to make a position whichwould be very dangerous.   An indication of this might be found in the positionnow in regard to Russia and Italy.   The Russian Exchange was something like76 per cent, below par, and the Italian Exchange was 40 per cent., and in both cases it was having a very disastrous political and social effect on both these countries.   Atthat moment our position in America was as follows : We had American securitiesunrealised of 490,000,000 dollars, we had an overdraft of 358,000,000 dollars, leaving a balance of 132,000,000 dollars; we had gold in America to the extent of 87,000,000dollars, making a total of 219,000,000 dollars now actually available in New York,but our expenditure was at the rate of 75,000,000 dollars a week, so that would onlylast three weeks.   We had on the way assets which represent 244,000,000 dollars,which would have carried us on for another three or perhaps four weeks; beyond that, the only assets visible were gold in the Bank of England and the Joint StockBanks to the extent of  114,000,000Z. sterling.    Russia and France had about107,000,0001. and 130,000,0002. of gold respectively, but neither of them could be. induced to part with it unless some actual necessity arises.   In both these countriesFinance Ministers told us that the shortage of gold was accountable for the loss ofthe exchange.   Mr. Bonar Law said that he did not think we could count on receivingany serious support in the way of gold from either of these*two countries.As regards our other AllieSj the number of American securities which were nowsaleable on the New York market which were in our hands was very small, and this in spite of the fact that we were now requisitioning all securities. The Cabinet would therefore see that on the face of it our position was a very black one indeed. TheBritish Government had been deliberately going ahead with the knowledge that danger in this direction was in front of them which we might be unable to face. We had feltthat the use of our gold and all our other resources would carry us on as long as possible.He might say that, though we had at present nothing like the number of assets weformerly had, there were many others which, in case of necessity, we could make available. In, this connection they had sent out to America, about a month ago, theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury, Sir S. H. Lever, to try to discover expedients tolengthen the time to which we could carry on these financial obligations. One ofthese expedients, in which Sir Robert Borden would be particularly interested, and&quot;which was on a &quot;very large scale, was to change the debentures of the Canadian
Pacific Railway which were now sterling securities into dollar securities which wouldbe negotiable in New York, and from this source we hoped to get a very large sum,something like 30 or 40 millions sterling. In addition to that, apart from our homeassets, railways and things of that kind, for which there was no market in the UnitedStates, we possessed a large number of South American securities which were notdealt with on the American market, but for which, given time, he thought a marketcould be created. At the same time he observed that he had said enough to show thatour financial position was a source of great anxiety not only to him but, he thought,to the whole Government, and nothing that day had pleased him more than the news from America and the relief which we might expect to receive from that country. Inthe meantime we should not run into the rocks which seemed to be in front of us,and he thought we might hope that, as America got more and more involved in thewar, she would put all her resources into the scale, and, if so, we should have no danger of running the risk of being unable to pay for our commitments abroad.printed at the foreign office by c. r. harrison.-20/4/1917.
