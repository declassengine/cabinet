Egypt.Mesopotamia.The PortugueseTroops.The MilitarySituation:The Need for more men.&apos;Canada&apos;s Effort,1. THE Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported thatj afterthe battle, the Turks had fallen back to their prepared position east of Gaza, and that steps were being taken to deal with them there.2. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff reported that,according to present indications, it appeared probable that, owingto the slow progress of the Russian force, the Turks retiring onKhanikin would make their escape.3. The Secretary of State for War reported that an excessiveproportion of Portuguese were already in hospital and largely frompreventable causes. He stated that the necessity for asking thePortuguese Government to allow Labour Battalions to take priority of transport from Portugal over regular troops had. to a certain extent, been overcome owing to the men travelling as civiliansthrough Spain. They were being organised after crossing theFrench frontier.4. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them a general review of the situation in all the theatres of war, prepared by theGeneral Staff (Paper G.T.-229). In summarising this report, theChief of the Imperial General Staff pointed out that the germans had made an immense effort to put every man into the firing linefor this year, and that it was essential to meet that effort, to prevent it from attaining any success, and, if possible, to defeat it. this involved the requirement of at least 500,000 men more by July. Itwas true that the Allies had 13,000,000 men in the field as corn-pared with 8,000,000 on the part of the enemy, but of these5,000,000 were Russians, 2.000,000 Italians, in addition to whichthere were Roumanians, Belgians, Portuguese, and other troops of comparatively small fighting value. Applications had been madeto each of the Dominions, and there had been a generous response,but the need for men was still very great. He had hoped that itmight have been possible to send the fifth Canadian Division toFrance.5. Sir Robert Borden laid before the Imperial War Cabinetfigures (Appendix I) showing the total effort made by Canada upto date in the war. A total of 446,330 men had been raised for various purposes directly connected with the war, of whom 327,312had been sent from Canada to the Expeditionary Force or to theForces of the Allies. In addition to this, there were 305,000 menworking in the production of munitions. The total population ofCanada at present was about 71- millions, of whom over 2 millionswere of French origin. More than .600,000 were of enemy origin.The population of British origin was less than 4 millions. There hadbeen enlisted in the Canadian Forces some 9,000 persons, whose-next-of-kin resided in the United States, but a majority of these were probably Canadian by birth. With a frontier of 3,500 miles,and a large population of enemy origin in the United States, it wasnecessary to keep some minimum of troops in Canada. This hadbeen fixed at 50,000 men, and 50,000 more were now being called out for Home Defence in order to release those at present in trainingin Canada. Recruiting was actively proceeding for the CanadianExpeditionary Force. Sir Robert Borden also mentioned that over12,000,000^ had been raised in Canada by voluntary contributions to patriotic funds.Fifth canadian division.6. Sir G. Perley pointed out that the difficulty about sending the fifth Canadian Division into the field was that, till it was known
what the casualties would be in the other Canadian Divisions in thenext few months, it was impossible to say whether the reinforce-ments at present in sight could keep five Divisions up to strength.The Canadian Government were quite willing that the fifthDivision should goto France, on the understanding that one of theCanadian Divisions at a time should be a resting Division. Thematter was also complicated by the urgent demand for lumbermento be taken out of the present strength of the fifth Division. Itwas agreed that : The   question   of  lumbermen  should   be  further  discussed between the Secretary of State for War and Sir G. Perley.Eeeruiting in the 7. Sir Robert Borden informed the Imperial War Cabinet ofUnited States. the steps he had taken, before coming over to England, to sound theAmerican authorities with regard to the possibility of recruitingCanadians and other British subjects in the United States. the response had been not unfavourable at the time, and he consideredthat with the development of events it ought to be possible largely to increase the armed forces of Canada from this source.The Secretary of State for War informed the Imperial WarCabinet that the War Office had likewise informally made arrange-ments for recruiting in the United States as soon as the latter weredefinitely at war with Germany.8. The Prime Minister of New Zealand gave figures as to the effort made by New Zealand (Appendix II). A total of 70,000had sailed from New Zealand, 10,000 were in camp, and severalthousands more were going into camp shortly. There had alsobeen a considerable number of New Zealanders who had entered the British or Australian Forces. He considered that New Zealandcould recruit up to a limit of 100,00.0 men, though the strain on a population of under 1,200,000 was already being felt. In rep^yto a cable from New Zealand enquiring whether the tieed forreinforcements or supplies was more urgent, he was telegraphingthat, though supplies were urgent, the need for soldierscame first.New Zealand&apos;sEffort.South Africa&apos;s 9- General Smuts informed the  Imperial War  Cabinet thatEffort. South Africa had put into the field between 50,000 and 60,000 men for the suppression of the rebellion and for the campaign inGerman South-West Africa. It had also put 30,000 men into thefield in East Africa, in addition tu the brigade now in France. he believed that practically the whole of the men who had been engaged in East Africa would be prepared to serve in France oranywhere else as soon as they had got over the effects of the east african climate, and these would be veteran troops, many of them- with an experience dating back to the South African War. Hehad no doubt that the force at present in France would be kept upto strength, and could be increased by additional units.10. In answer to questions by the Secretary of State for War,General Smuts expressed the opinion that the 19,000 native and coloured gunners and drivers asked for from South Africa, inaddition to 8,000 for ammunition column purposes, would be forthcoming without great difficulty, and that, if the recruitingwere spread over a considerable period, possibly 30,000 might besecured.. He considered that these troops would do excellently forunskilled work in the firing line, as they were both strong andpersonally brave.    On the other hand, his  experience, was thatNatives and coloured Com-combatant troops from South Africa.
natives could not be trained for all-round combatant work asinfantry in less than nine to twelve months. He considered thenative troops in East, Africa a useful force, a considerable part ofwhich might be released for service elsewhere once the east african Campaign was really over.Sierra LeoneLabour Supply.11. General Smuts informed the Imperial War Cabinet thatthe Governor of Sierra Leone had suggested to him the possibilityof raising 10,000 carriers and 10,000 krooboys for dock labour inthat colony. It appeared, however, that this had been a verysanguine estimate.Newfoundland^Effort.India&apos;s Effort.12. Sir Edward Morris informed the Imperial War Cabinetthat Newfoundland had provided approximately four battalions for france, and that there was a portion of another battalion in Canadaawaiting transportation. A further 2,000 had joined the royal navy, and Newfoundland, with Canada, was . maintaining a jointpatrol against submarines on the Canadian, Newfoundland, andLabrador Coasts. He hoped also to be able to supply a considerablenumber of foresters.13. The Imperial War Cabinet had before them paperssummarising the total efibrt contributed to the war by India (PapersG.T.-152, G.T.-184, G.T.-197).The Secretary of State for India mentioned that India had sent to various theatres of war some 350,000 combatants, and atotal force of 574,000 including auxiliary services. The indian army had also grown from 250,000 to 430,000. Very generousassistance, both in money and men, had also been furnished by the princes of India.The Maharaja of Bikaner mentioned in this connection thatin the first week of the war he had offered to raise 20,000 men, butthe offer had been declined, and the men had since enlisted in othercapacities.The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was also drawn tothe genuine and deep-seated loyalty of the Indian troops, as shownin their letters from the front, and it was agreed that, in view ofthe very different conditions prevailing in India from those of theDominions, and of the difference of race, India&apos;s response had been a remarkable one.Labour from India.Further Recruitingin India.14. The Secretary of State for India mentioned that India was ready to send 50,000 men in labour battalions, but that the indian government had been informed by the War Office that only 20,000were to be actually raised for the present.The Secretary of State for War pointed out that the limitationwas entirely due to shipping considerations.15. The Imperial War Cabinet further considered a telegramNo. 3457, dated the 28th March, 1917 (Appendix III), which theSecretary of Slate for India had sent to the Indian Government,urging the latter to raise another 100,000 men, to be ready at anyrate by the spring of 1918, and, with this object, in view, to tapfresh, sources of recruiting aud to improve its recruiting methods.There was a general discussion as to the possibility of findingfresh sources of recruiting in India and as- to recruiting methods.Sir S. Sinha expressed the opinion that the young Bengal students and professional men who were anxious to enlist in order to &quot; make good &quot; in the eyes of India would make very serviceable troops.
Sir J. Meston considered that, while anything savouring either of an attempt at indirect compulsion or of our being in desperatestraits would have a bad effect, a great deal more might be done byintelligent recruiting and by enlisting the help of influentialunofficial classes.The Question of 16. The attention of the Imperial War Cabinet was drawn to indian Officers.        the great difficulty of securing suitable officers for so large anincrease in the Indian Army.The Maharaja of Bikaner pointed out that the class of men now in the Indian Army fit for promotion was very limited, andthat competent Indian officers could not easily be improvised. IfLord Curzons proposals for the training of Indian cadets, whichhad been made in 1901, had been carried out, there would by now have been a large supply of trained Indian officers.The Secretary of State for India informed the Imperial WarCabinet that the question of giving commissions to Indian officers was being discussed with the Government of India, and that he hoped before long to be able to lay definite proposals before theWar Cabinet.(Initialled)      D.

The most important consideration is what fighting man-power can you produce and train to be fit to putinto the field in early spring of 1918 in addition to numbers to which you are already committed. This fresh effort would be primarily directed to the relief of Britishtroops now serving in India, Mesopotamia, or Egypt.But you may be&apos; able to spare or raise units not suitable for use against Turks.In that case it might be possible to employ them in France.Do you think you could, for instance, raise 100,000 men for these objects?I realise that to do so you will have to resort largely to enlistment of classes that havehitherto not been considered the best for providing fighting men. In particular, I wish you to consider whether experiment of Bengali double company might not be.largely extended. Consider also particularly the possibility of obtaining more Jatsand Mahrattas, but please pass in review all possible resources of India. Presentrecruiting methods seem capable of considerable improvement, and recruitingorganisations would have to be largely expanded. I suggest introduction of some new blood in your recruiting agencies and much more use than has been made up todate of the authority of ruling Princes and Chiefs in their States, and of our own civil authorities and local magnates in British India. The unofficial classes should also,I think, be called upon to assist. Perhaps some suitable developments of advertisementagency might also be made use of. You will understand that the necessity forexerting the maximum strength of the Empire is so great that every means that canbe devised should be employed, and all possible sources of recruitment thoroughly-examined afresh. I realise that it may not be possible to make such a large additionto the Army under the conditions on which the Indian soldier now serves. I suggestthat you consider whether temporary enlistment for the term of the war might not meet the case ; also that as present pay may not be considered sufficiently attractiveby classes who have not hitherto provided many fighting men, some form of temporarypay or bonus may be necessary. Please report fully by telegraph what you thinkcould he done. I will then ascertain whether arms and equipment will be available.I assume that you will be able to draw many officers from Territorials now in India,as you will be able to give them nearly a years training.o
