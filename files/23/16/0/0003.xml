Foreign Office, October 8th, 1917.



Private and Secret.



 At my request, the Ambassadors of France, America, and Japan, with the Charge d&apos;Affaires of Italy and Russia, met me at the Foreign Office on the 6th instant.

 I then read out to them Sir Arthur Hardinge&apos;s private telegram conveying the German suggestion that there should be a discussion between Germany and Britain on the subject of peace. I Pointed out that, so far as I was aware, this was the first proposal on this subject made through a regular diplomatic channel, and, though it was extremely doubtful whether it was more than a diplomatic move intended rather to divide the Allies than to end the war, His Majesty&apos;s Government did not think it could be either ignored or met with a blank refusal. Such a policy would discourage the Peace Party in Germany, and stimulate the Pacifists in Entente countries. On the other hand, the answer given to Germany must be of a kind which would put an end to the idea that the Allies could be dealt with separately. It seemed to His Majesty&apos;s Government that by far the best way of meeting the tactics of diplomatists like Herr Von Kuhlmann was the method of absolute frankness and collective action, and this method we proposed to adopt.

   



 

	


I thereupon read to the Foreign Representativesthe answer I proposed to send to Dir Arthur Hardingein Liadrid, couched in the following terms;-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government would be prepared toreceive any comtunication that the German Government may desire to make to them relating to peace, end to discuss it with their Alliesc&quot;I supplied a copy of this telegram to each of theForeign Representatives, v.ho were, I gathered, incomplete agreement with the views I had expressed,and with the course which His majesty*s government proposed to take,M* Cambon added that, In his opinion, it would beimpossible to continue the war with vigour, or even to continue it at all, if the powers oiice. reached the stage of discussing terms round a table,   it followedthat3 before this &apos;stage of &quot;round-table discussion&quot; wasreached, we must be fully assured that the main objects of the Allied efforts had already been secured.As far as I could judge this view commended itselfto the other Allied Representatives who were present.
