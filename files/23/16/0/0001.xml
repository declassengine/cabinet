NOTE BY LORD MILNER



It seems to me that there is urgent need of a fresh stock-taking of the whole war situation.

War Policy is after all the chief business of the War Cabinet. Many and very difficult domestic questions, all no doubt arising out of the war, have latterly taken much of our time and threaten still further to absorb it. Ireland, the Labour Unrest, Food, Liquor, the increasing difficulty of distributing our diminishing stock of Man-Power - all of them complicated and aggravated by an uncertain Parliamentary situation - make increasing demands upon us. And yet, greater and more urgent than any of them, or all of them put together, is the necessity of reviewing our war policy as a whole, and making new plans to meet a wholly new situation.

Three or four months ago we had a War Policy. As a result of the Conferences at Chantilly, Rome, Petrograd, a fairly definite and quite hopeful plan of cooperation between the Allies had been evolved. It held out good prospects of success in the main theatres of war, and an almost certain prospect of success in a subsidiary but still important theatre, i.e. the trilateral attack upon Turkey in Armenia, Mesopotamia, Palestine. The defection of Russia has completely destroyed these prospects. On the other hand, the entrance of America into the war has introduced a new factor, of great ultimate promise but small immediate value. What are we going to do to fill up the time before the weight of America can be thrown into the scale? How do we hope to get the greatest benefit from her assistance in the long run?

A propos of America, it seems generally to be assumed that American aid is to take mainly the old form - the raising of a large Army to add another million or two to the millions on


the Western Front. But it is surely worth considering whether that is the best form of force for America to apply, even if it is the best place to apply it. Might not an overwhelming effort in the air be at once the quickest and the most effective contribution which America could make to the termination of the war?

  It may be said that the whole position is so full of uncertainties that no plan is possible. I admit that any plan we may make to-day is liable to be completely upset by developments at present incalculable. Nevertheless it cannot be right to go on without any plan at all. How do we now stand about Palestine, about the Balkan campaign, about the continuance of the offensive on the Western Front? I don&apos;t know that we have made up our minds about any of them. I feel as if we were just drifting, and as if there was some danger that, in view of the preoccupation of a number of grave but nevertheless minor domestic questions, we might continue to drift.

  I take the Balkan situation as an illustration. We have come to some very important decisions about it lately - to withdraw our troops from Salonica, to get rid of Constantine, to try and get rid of Sarrail. But these are all piecemeal decisions. Are we not bound to look at the situation as a whole? After all the Allies have still more than half a million men in the Balkans. Our decision to withdraw, or greatly diminish, our own force there may be quite right. But, obviously, by itself, it is not a policy. We cannot simply withdraw without considering the effects of our withdrawal upon our Allies, and not only its military but its political effects. Rightly handled, withdrawal might be turned to some account diplomatically. It would be good business indeed to set free our 200,000 men, if in doing so we could detach Bulgaria from the Central Powers. But simply to withdraw our own troops, even if we were sure of being able to do it, and  


to leave our Allies in the lurch, either to surrender - as the Serbians would have to do - or to scuttle away as best they could in various directions, the French into Thessaly, the Italians to Valona, leaving the Bulgarians masters of the situation and still our enemies, would be a debacle of the first magnitude. Yet it is impossible to say that these things may not happen, indeed, are not likely to happen, unless we think the thing out and have some more comprehensive and coherent policy than that of simply seeking to reduce our own commitments and leaving all the others to get out of the mess as best they can.

 I don&apos;t think that if we go on, living from hand to mouth in the matter, and dealing with the five or six different aspects of the case one by one, as they happen to crop up, we can possibly hope for good results. What seems to me to be urgently necessary is that four or five people, having the time and the necessary qualifications, should concentrate their minds upon the military and political situation in the Balkans as a whole, and put before the War Cabinet a scheme, which taking account of all the elements of the case, should aim at getting the best value out of them for the general conduct of the war, or, if it be decided that there is nothing for it but to "cut our losses," at doing so in the least ruinous way. Such a review must include the military, the naval, and the political aspects of the case, not separately but in combination with one another. It must not start from a dominating idee fixe, but examine impartially the several possible alternatives, and their respective consequences. It is an extremely complicated and many-sided problem, but no good can come from refusing to face it.

 I am not arguing for any particular line of action. All I suggest is that we should have a definite line, that we     


should know along what read we intend to travel. The decision must rest with the Cabinet, but the Cabinet cannot decide till the subject is thoroughly thrashed out and all the possible courses put before it in a comprehensive review.

 I have only one more suggestion to make on this subject. We are all so busy and preoccupied, and our military and naval advisers, who must necessarily take part in the preparation of the case, are also so full of work, that it would be of great value to have any fresh, able and well-equipped mind, entirely free from prepossessions, brought in to help them. We happen to have such a mind available, and quite unburdened at the present moment, in General Smuts. He appears to me to possess just the combination of mental gifts, which would make his opinion on a mixed question of strategy and politics, such as this is, of special value. And he would approach it entirely without prejudice of any kind.

 If this method of procedure were adopted with regard to the Balkan situation, and proved, as I believe it would prove, helpful in enabling us to come to a clear decision about it, the same method might be applied, successively, to other points of War Policy. I merely instance the Balkan position as one, though it seems to me the most urgent and most immediately perilous, of the problems, with which we are confronted.
