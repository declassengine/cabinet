  Monsieur de Skrzynski went to Geneva yesterday to see Doctor Parodi. He said there were many points in speeches of Mr. Lloyd George and President Wilson on which His Majesty&apos;s Government and Austro-Hungarian Government were in agreement. Besides these a certain number of questions were touched on in such a manner as readily to lend themselves to a discussion with a good chance of success. The British Government must not consider comments of certain Vienna newspapers on Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s speech as representing Count Czernin&apos;s views or those of majority of population. A portion of Austro-Hungarian Press as well as almost the whole of German Press is in the hands of manufacturers of munitions who cry out as soon as they see a glimmer of Peace on the horizon. M. de Skrynski went on to say Count Czernin had had to struggle like a Titan at Berlin in order that his "No annexations" formula (? Should be, omitted) adopted. The day on which Kuehlmann had made his declaration in this respect Count Hertling had hesitated to leave his house not knowing whether he would be hissed in the streets of Berlin.

  One part of Germany is absolutely mad with its warlike ideas and annexationist aims but there is a very   


very strong pacifist movement and its influence will certainly make itself felt.In order to obtain adherence of Germany to hisformula Count Czernin had had to consent to send someAustro-Hungarian regiments to the Western front so asto show solidarity of Austro-German alliance.   Thismilitary assistance amounted to two or three regimentswhich are already in or about to go to Belgium.Mons. de Skrynski considers it desirable that Ententei&quot;ress in its comments should not exaggerate importanceof this military assistance which had been exacted byGermany as a sort of ransom.,   Austro-Hungarian Govern-ment think as far as Turkey is concerned a formulamighit be found which whilst giving large measure of autonomy to (?Syria)^ Palestine^Mesopotamia and Arabiamight be considered by Turks as not implying any lossof territory.Finally M. de Skrynski said that Count Czerninwould be ready to come to Switzerland to meet Mr.Lloyd George if latter agreed to an interview.
