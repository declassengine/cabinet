spanish morocco .Report by chiefs ofStaff.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(3 7) , Con-clusion 6.)2. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence ^C.P.-90 (37))covering a Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C .0 .S .-565) , who had re-examined thequestion of Spanish Morocco in relation to the Civilffar in Spain and the possible consequences thatmight arise thereafter, in accordance with theConclusion mentioned in the margin.    In their Reportthe Chiefs of Staff briefly stated their reasons for considering that British policy should continue tobe based, on the principle that for strategic reasons the African coast of the Straits of Gibraltar shouldnot come under the control of any major Power.Control by Prance, Germany or Italy they regardedas a potential threat to British interests.mhe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Report of the Chiefs of Staff was on thelines he had anticipated.The Cabinet took note of the Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeesubmitted in CP.-90 (37) .
32.3,THE IMPERIALCONFERENCE.United kingdom delegation &quot;to .(previous reference&apos;Cabinet 38(36), Con-clusion 8.)3. mhe Prime Minister read to his colleaguesa list of representatives he proposed for theUnited Kingdom Government at the forthcoming imperial Conference.The question was raised as to whether theSecretary of State for the Colonies ought not tobe included either as representing the colonial empire or at least in the list of United. kingdom representatives .(The subject was adjourned for ashort time, during which other business was taken up, in orderthat the precedents might beobtained.)-When the question was resumed, the Prime minister pointed out that in 1921 the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies had. been a member, but at that-time there was no Secretary of State for DominionAffairs.    In 1926 the same Minister was Secretaryof State both for the Colonies and for DominionAffairs, and was a member.    In 1930 the Secretaryof State for the Colonies was a member only for economic questions.   At the Ottawa Conference,which was purely economic, the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies was a member of the United kingdom delegation, as well as the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs.It was pointed out that on the present occasionit was propose^ that the Secretary of State for theColonies should be a full member of the United,^ing^om Delegation not only for economic questionsbut. also for questions of Defence and Foreign PolicyPractically tlv only question on which he would, notbe included under the Prime Minister&apos;s proposal was the Constitutional issue.    The only reason why it had. not been suggested to make him a full member
was that the irreducible minimum of United kingdom representatives was already almost doable the repre-sentation of/ any Dominion, and it would be somewhat invidious to add to the number.    Tt was also pointed out thatseparate representation of the Colonies by theSecretary of State could not be made without theagreement of the Dominions, and rather a difficult position would, arise owing to the fact that ^fert^aewkRhodesia and Burma were only represented &quot;by observers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer reminded theCabinet that at Ottawa a representation for theColonies had. been secured, with the result thatpreferential arrangements had been made between certain Colonies and. Dominions.    If these were addedto the preferences already given to the mother country and. the preferences between the Unitedand ColoniesKingdom and the Doirinions/, a regular network of preferences had come into existence.   He agreedthat it could, not be contended that the colonial empire could be treated as a unit, but the Colonieswere very important in the network of preferencesto which he had referred, and which gave theDominions themselves an interest in the Colonies .Prom this point of view it could, be said that theColonies had. an interest in everything which affectedthese preferences, which might be interpreted as including such matters as Foreign Policy or Defence.He would, therefore like to see the Secretary ofState for the Colonies not only a member for certain specific purposes, but an observer for all purposes .The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that if the Colonial Secretary was not a full member he woul^ have to drop out for certain purposes .The result would be that the Imperial Conferencedid not represent the whole Empire.
The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs pointed out that it woul- &quot;he easier to include theSecretary of State for the Colonies as a member ofthe United Kingdom Delegation than as a repr--sent a-tive of the Colonial Empire.The Cabinet agreed  &quot;&quot;o adjourn the subject until their next regular weekly Meeting, andthat in the meantime the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs should look into the question and make aproposal.
PALESTINE. 4. -&quot;he Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byImmigration the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-81Labour S chedule.(37)) relating to the policy and procedure for the(Previous regulation of immigration into Palestine.    The nextReference-Cabinet 10 Labour Schedule was due to be issued in April for(3 7), Con-clusion 7.) the period April to September, 193 7, but in their-11 (57&apos; circumstances described, in his Memorandum theSecretary of State recommended that he should beauthorised to instruct the High Commissioner -(l) That while the preliminary work forthe determination of a Labour Schedulefor the six months April to Septemberof this year should, proceed in thenormal way, no Schedule should beissued pending the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government which would betaken in the light of the re com-mendations of the Royal Commission;(S) That immigration under categoriesother than &quot;C&quot; (immigrants withdefinite prospects of employment,entering under the Labour Schedule,and their dependants) should, continue in the normal way.If the Cabinet approved, this course the Secretaryof State proposed, to arrange at an appropriate timefor a Question and Answer in Parliament, as it would.be necessary that some public statement should bemade on the subject.The question was raised, as to whether thecourse proposed was liable to create difficulties with the Mandates Commission.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he thought the position had been safeguardedat the last Meeting of the Council, and that everything possible had been done in this direction.mhe Cabinet agreed  (a) ^o authorise the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to instruct theHigh Commissioner -(i) That while the preliminary workfor the determination of a LabourSchedule for the six months April
to September of this year should proceed in the normal way, noSchedule should be issued pendingthe decision of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment which would, be takenin the light of the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission:(ii) That immigration under categoriesother than &quot;C&quot; (immigrants withdefinite prospects of employment,entering under the Labour Schedule,and their dependants) shouldcontinue in the normal way.(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should arrange, at an appropriate time,- for a question and Answer in Parliament announcingthis decision.-7-
PALESTINE.5 -The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by defence Orders the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-86in Council,(37)) suggesting that, in the light of experience1931 and1936(previous reference:Cabinet 10(37), Con-clusion 7 .)of their operation in practice, the Palestine(Defence) Order in Council, 1931, as amended, by thePalestine Martial Law (Defence) Order in Council,193 5, should be replaced by an entirely fresh Orderon simpler and more effective lines.   The Secretaryof State asked for general approval for the submission of a new Order to the King in Council on the linesof the draft attached, to his Memorandum.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gave the Cabinet particulars of some observations on thedraft Order in Council which he had received fromthe Secretary of State for War.With regard, toRegulation 6 (2)     the Secretary of State for war had. pointed out that the specified subjectsappropriate for regulation differed, from thosespecified, in the 1936 Order by omitting certain specified, subjects appropriate for regulation andinserting others.   He had pointed out. that when general and wide powers were assumed it was are recognised principle that only those powers should then be specified the inclusion of which might beopen to doubt .   The more detailed, the specificationthe greater the risk that deliberate exclusion ofother powers might be imputed.    It was suggested,therefore, that sub-paragraphs (c) and. (e) shouldbe omitted.       The Secretary of State for theColonies explained that the reason for the inclusionof ( c) and. (e) was that the general words in thenew Palestine Order in Council were taken from theEmergency Powers Defence Bill now being prepared bySir Claud. Schuster&apos;s Committee.   All the -service departments had agreed in this Bill.
With regard to Regulation 5 (2)(b)(ij the Secretaryof State for  7ar had suggested that an expressioncovering &quot;the pulling down, destruction or removalof any building, structure or property&quot; should beadded .The question was raised as to whether this wouldgive the Military Authorities power to take actionto that effect not only in military interests or forpunitive reasons, but in other eases also.    importance was attached to powers existing which would enablethe action taken in the case of the outbreak at Jaffato be repeated.    It was pointed, out that in Regula-tion 5 (2)(f) provision was made for payment ofcompensation and remuneration to persons affectedby the Regulations .   This would enable action to betaken on a very wide basis:    for example, for precau-tionary purposes.hadThe Secretary of State for War/pointed out thatRegulation 5 (2)(g)(iii) did not, as it stood,  cover the point raised by the G-.0.C. Palestine, which wasthat Military Courts should be in a position to try-persons who could be proved, after rebellion had.broken out, to have fomented it.    The draft made themamenable to Military Courts only if a Defence Regula-tion was in force prohibiting their offence at thetime of its commission, and not if their offence waspunishable only under the ordinary Criminal Law .In the case of a sudden widespread revolt therewoul^ presumably be little, if any, interval betweenthe issue of Defence Regulations and the setting upof Military Courts .   Whether the principle of retro-spective jurisdiction, having been admitted, shouldbe extended, was perhaps a question o^ policy.In this connection the Secretary of State for War
drew attention to the power given under Section I(2) of the Restoration of Order in Ireland Act,.1920, and suggested that the point could he met bythe insertion in the last line after &quot;law&quot; of thewords &quot;before or&quot;.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat on this point his legal advisers felt, thatoffences against the Regulations being covered,whether committed, before or after, was quite enoughand that to hand over to the Military Courts either(l) the trial of a case where, for example, a Jewsteals another Jew&apos;s bicycle, or (2) a seditiontrial for words spoken or written before the delega-tion of powers to the General Officer Commanding,was wrong.    The Irish precedent was no parallel,for in that case either no Civil Courts were in factfunctioning or they were boycotted.   The War Officeproposal, his advisers suggested,  carried theprinciple of retrospection too far and would raiseimmense criticisms both among lawyers and. constitu-tionalists here;    and, as Palestine is a mandated territory, it woul^ be quite impossible to defendit at Geneva.    They felt that by including offences against the Regulations committed before the settingup of Military Courts they had given the War Officeall the powers they really needed.The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatthe effect of the Regulations now under considerationwoul^ be that a man could not be tried by a MilitaryCourt who from the first had. been fomenting the trouble.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said thathis legal advisers&apos; reply to this was that a man couldbe tried for any offence committed after the
publication of the Regulations, and that any action he had taken before the Regulations were announcedcould, be brought up in evidence and would be takeninto account in pronouncing sentence.The general view of the Cabinet was in favourof maintaining the Regulation in its present form.The Secretary of State for .Var had further suggested that Regulation 7 was too indefinite andmight with advantage contain an indication of theintention of the High Commissioner to delegate somepowers at least.The Secretary of State for the Colonies &quot;saidthat his advisers maintained, that the proper place to express an intention was not in a Statute but ina Despatch from His Majesty&apos;s Government to the HighCommissioner.   The War Office point had been includedin the Despatch, an^ he understood that this part ofthe Despatch ha^ already been agreed.The Secretary of State for War agreed.The Lord President of the Council asked if theDespateh would be brought before the Cabinet or theCommittee, of Imperial Defence.The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthis would be done, if desired.The Secretary of State for the Colonies explainedthat Part III of the draft Order in Council aroseentirely owing to a Judgment given in the PalestineCourt of Appeal.The Secretary of State for tfar pointed out thatGeneral Dill did not like the omission of the term&quot;Martial Law&quot; from the heading of the Order in Council .He himself, however, was prepared to accept the viewof the Secretary of State for the Colonies that
there were some advantages in omitting the term,as it enabled martial law to exist as a possibilitykept for the moment in the background.The Cabinet agreed  ^o approve the draft Order inCouncil attached, as an appendix to C .P .-86 (37)  for submission to the King in Council --12-
NIGERIA .ImperialPreferencein.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(26), Con-clusion 1.)6.    The Cabinet had. before them the following documents on the question whether or not imperial preference should be introduced in Nigeria now thatshe is free from the Treaty obligations whichpreviously precluded it:-A Note by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (CP.-83 (37))  covering a Memorandum, prepared in consultationwith the Board of Trade, summing upthe arguments for and against theproposal.    The Secretary of Statehimself was in favour of Nigeriaintroducing Imperial Preference, forby so doing she would be following the example set by all other colonial dependencies and. would be establishingher own claim, to preference in otherEmp i r e co unt ri e sA Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (C.P.-89 (37))traversing the arguments contained inthe above Memorandum and. stronglyurging his colleagues, in view of thepractical disadvantages and even dangersinherent in the scheme from the standpointof foreign policy, not to apply thes cheme .The Secretary of State for the colonies said he had circulated his memorandum (C.Po83 (37))before seeing the memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs.     After learning of theobjections to the introduction of Imperial Preferencein Nigeria at the present time when we were considering the negotiation of a treaty with theUnited States of America, he suggested that theCabinet, without rejecting the principle ofImperial Preference for Nigeria, should continue for another year on the present system of quotas and thatthe question should be reopened 12 months&apos; hencein the light of a further year&apos;s experience.     he pointed out that South Africa and Southern Rhodesiastood to gain from a preference to tobacco of Empire
origin at the expense of the United States, hut addedthat the latter were not entitled to much considerationfrom us since they applied preference themselves notonly to all their possessions hut to countries likeCuba and the Philippine Islands where they wereespecially interested.The President of the Board of Trade supported the Poreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum on the whole.     he pointed out that we had adopted quotas because other methods had failed.      The effect of the quota had beenexcellent and there had been no protest from Nigeria.These quotas had saved Nigeria for  the Lancashire tradeSo far as the United States were concerned, he himselfduring his recent visit had made quite clear that wewere not going to accept dictatorship on our policy toother parts of the Empire and the justice of this view had not been contested.     At the same time, he agreed with the Colonial Secretary that we should not raise thepreference issue   at a time when we were negotiating atreaty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that inordinary circumstances he would have supported preferencbut the moment appeared to him inopportune for a changeof that kind.     He agreed that our commercial policy towards the Empire must not be dictated and he was very glad that the President of the Board of Trade had made this very clear0     At the same time, in relation to theproposed commercial treaty, he saw some glimmerings ofhope of bringing the United States of America to amore reasonable frame of mind in matters of vastimportance, such as their attitude in the event ofhostilities and co-operation in the Par East,     It was important that nothing in the nature of preference to a
colony should be allowed to cut across such important considerations.      Consequently, he accepted the proposal of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.The Prime Minister also agreed.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs agreed in the over-riding importance of foreign relations,     He warned the Gabinet, however, that whenthe Ottawa Agreements came up for further consideration,South Africa and Rhodesia would probably raise this issue,,     He hoped therefore that we should be careful inmaking a treaty with the United States of America notto commit ourselves to the United States too deeply onthe question of tobaccosThe Cabinet agreed:(a) That from the point of view of foreignpolicy and having regard, moreparticularly, to the negotiations for acommercial treaty with the United Statesof America, the moment was inopportunefor raising the question of imperial preference for Nigerias(b) To approve the proposal made at themeeting by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies that the question ofImperial Preference for Nigeria shouldbe postponed for a year, during which further experience would be obtainedwith the quota system now in operation^
7.    The Cabinet had before then a Note by theFirst Commissioner of Works (CP.-87 (37)) asfChairman of the Cabinet Committee on Recruiting forthe Army,  covering the Final Report of the Sub-Committee on Government and Local Authority Employ-ment for ex-Regulars.   This Report examined theproblems of Government employment for ex-Regulars,of the pay, pension and seniority of ex-Regulars inthe Civil Service, and. of Local Authority employment for ex-Regulars .   A summary of the Conclusions andRecommendations of the Sub-Committee will be found,as an Appendix to these Minutes.After the First Commissioner of Works had made a statement to the Cabinet on the proposalcontained in the Report, a short discussion tookplace.The Minister of Health, referring to thestatement in paragraph 14 of the Report that thelocal authorities are doing little to make the defence services popular as a career by reserving employment for ex-regulars, said that he had discussed thematter with representatives of the associations and was arranging for them to take th&amp; matter up withthe local authorities.     He hoped for good resultsbut he thought it important that the matter shouldnot be raised in Debate in the House of Commons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, referring to the support given in paragraph 20 of the Reportto the National Association^ proposal for anincreased grant to them with a view to obtaining abetter type of &quot;job-finder&quot;, said that he did not anticipate any very substantial results in this
direction.     He thought it would be better to go direct to large employers such as the Port of London Authority,the London Passenger Transport Board or the railways.The Secretary of State for War said that healready had received a good deal of assistance fromlarge employers but when they were approached, theywere apt to say that the Government ought to be ableto absorb their ex-soldiers into Government offices.He regretted to say that the present Report would notrender the Army Council any considerable assistance inthis respectoThe Home Secretary drew attention to thefollowing passage in paragraph 16 of the Report onthe subject of police employment -&quot;We are glad to report that the War Officecan see their way clear to give an assurance that reservists employed as policewill not be eligible for extension of reserve service and that they will also beable materially to increase the number of reservists employed as &quot;police who will notbe called up before 5 months from the out-break of hostilities,1,1The wording of this passage, he pointed out, must beincorrect.     It gave the impression that the War Officeintended to call up some of the reservists employed aspolice before 5 months although the number was to bereduced.      The War Office, however, had made it quite clear at the Committee that no reservists serving in thepolice would be called up before 3 months from theoutbreak of hostilities.The Secretary of State for War said that theWar Office had no intention of going back on thatundertaking.The Home Secretary also referred to difficultie.that had been brought to his attention by theCommissioner of the Metropolitan Police in raising the
age limit for entry into the police in the case of ex-Servicemen from 25 or 26 to 27, even though men might enter the Police Force on the understanding thatat the age of 55 they would have to retire on somethingless than the maximum pension.     The Commissioneranticipated that when they reached the retiring age,they would raise every kind of objection to retirementat a lower pension than that accorded to men of the sameage who had served longer, urging that their militaryservice should count.It was arranged that the First commissioner of Works should discuss the matter with the HomeSecretary who would put him in touch with theCommissioner of the Metropolitan Police.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To adopt the report of the Sub-Committee on Government and LocalAuthority Employment for ex-Regularsappointed by the Committee on recruiting for the Army (CP. 87 (37)),subject to comments made in thecourse of the Cabinet discussion as recorded above;(b) That the First Commissioner of works should discuss further the cjuestion ofpolice service with the Home Secretary,who should place him in touch with theCommissioner of the MetropolitanPolice.
BINT RESTRIC-TTON .(previous reference:Cabinet 65(32), Con-clusion 9*)13.8. The Cabinet had before them the followingdo cumentsA Memorandum by the Minister of Health(CP.-84 (37))  pointing out that thepresent Rent Restriction Acts would,expire on June 24, 1938, in Englandand Wales unless some action was takenin the meantime.   After briefly recall-ing the history of this legislation the Minister proposed that a strongDepartmental Comm.ittee should be setup to examine the whole question of rent Restriction in the light of present-day housing conditions, withthe following suggested. Terms ofReference:-&quot;To inquire into and report uponthe present working of the rent restriction Acts ah&apos; to advisewhat steps should, be taken tocontinue or amend those Acts&quot;:A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. ( C .P .-88 (37))  adducingarguments in favour of an announcement that the Government had. decided tocontinue for a period the Acts in theirpresent form.The Minister of Health, in supporting his proposal for a Committee, said that this was inaccordance with good precedents.     He hoped that theSecretary of State for Scotland would allow scotland to be included in the scope of the Inquiry and he didnot think he need have any apprehension as to thecontinuance of Rent Restriction in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland saidthat the extension of the Committee&apos;s reference toinclude a country like Scotland, where only oneresult was possible, might perhaps be open to criticism,, but provided the Cabinet realised the distinctive position of Scotland, he would not oppose the proposal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the idea of a Committee.     He thought that control
ought not necessarily to he maintained in England&quot;because decontrol was inapplicable to Scotland.     Ifwe could not get decontrol everywhere, we ought toob tain it wherever it was possible.     scotland would, no doubt, establish before the Committee itscase against decontrol.The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that it would be advantageous if the proposed committee contained at least one member who wasfamiliar with rural conditions and he would beprepared to suggest a name.The Minister of Health agreed.The Lord Chancellor thought that theGovernments position would be helped by a recommendation from a Committee.The Lord Privy Seal suggested an alteration in the terms of reference to read as follows:-&quot;To inquire into and report upon the present working of the Rent Restriction Acts and toadvise what steps should be taken to continueterminate or amend those Acts.&quot;The President of the Board of Education   saidthat the addition of the word &quot;terminate&quot; might be dangerous from the political point of view.The Minister of Health undertook to consider what had been said and the Lord Privy Seal said he would accept the decision of the Minister of Health.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of theMinister of Health for the appointmentof a strong Departmental Committeeto examine the whole question of rent Restriction in the light of present day housing conditions:(b) That the Departmental Committee should consider Scotland as well as Englandand Wales:
(c) That the Committee should include one member familiar with rural conditionswhose name should be suggested by theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries I(d) That the Minister of Health should consider the proposed addition to theterms of reference suggested by the lord privy Seal and quoted above
9.      The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe First Commissioner of yVorks (C.P.-78 (37))pointing out. that $Jos. 1-7 Cromwell Gardens, SouthKensington, in the possession of his Department,were now vacant and, for various reasons, no longer required for Government purposes .   He and some ofhis colleagues had been approached by partiesinterested in the scheme for the provision of aNational Theatre with a view to purchasing the siteby private negotiation, but although he had. everysympathy with the desire to establish a national theatre, he recommended, that the Cabinet should.authorise him to advertise the site in question for sale by tender.The general trend, of the discussion v/asin favour of the course proposed by the first commissioner of Works.     There was general agreement that if a subsidy was ever to be given towardsthe establishment of a National Theatre, it shouldbe a direct subsidy subject to appropriateconditions.     Some members hf the Cabinet were inclined to favour a subsidy but the comment wasmade that this was not a time for suggesting a subsidy of this kind.No decision was asked for er taken on theprinciple of a National Theatre.The Cabinet agreed to authorise theFirst Commissioner of Works to dealwith the matter on the usual businesslines and to advertise the site inquestion for sale by tender.
10,    The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Home Secretary (H.A.-14 (37))covering the dra-^t Ministers of the Crown Bill.The principal objects of the Bill, which was basedon the recommendations of a Cabinet Committee, wereto fix new salaries for certain Ministers, includina salary of  10,000 for the Prime Minister and first Lord of the Treasury;    to provide that thetotal salary payable to every Cabinet Minister is brought up to  ^,000 a year;    to provide for thepayment of a salary to the Leader of the Oppositionan^ of pensions  to persons who have been PrimeMinister;    and to amend, and. simplify the lawregarding the number of Secretaries of State andUnder Secretaries of State who may sit in the Houseof Commons.    The Committee of Home Affairs, attheir Meeting on March 8th (H.A.C. 5th Conclusions(37), Minute 3)^ had agreed as follows:-&quot;(i) To reserve for the Cabinet thequestions of principle raisedby Clause 4 fl) and (2):(ii) Subject to (i) and. to the amend-ments noted in the record of thediscussion, and subject also toany drafting or minor alterations that may be found, necessary or desirable, to recommend, the Cabinetto authorise the introduction forth-with in the House of Commons of theMinisters of the Crown Bill in theform of the draft annexed, to H.A.-14(37) .&quot;The discussion -&apos;as almost entirely con-fined to Clause 4 (i), which in the draft beforethe Cabinet read as follows&quot;There shall be paid to the person whois Prime Minister and First. L$rd of theTreasury an annual salary of  .10,000.&quot;
The question at issue was as to whether theOffice of Prime Minister should be linked with that off first Lord of the Treasury.    Against this proposal itwas urged that although the vast majority of past PrimeMinisters had admittedly also held the Office of FirstLord of the Treasury the exception of the late lord salisbury, who had been Foreign Minister but not FirstLord of the Treasury, was a notable one.      Some futurePrime Minister,  it was pointed out, might wish to holdsome Office other than that of First Lord of theTreasury,  and,  as in Lord Salisbury&apos;s case,  it mightbe convenient for him to all^yt the latter appointment to some colleague of such distinction that he wishedhim to hold a more dignified position than that of   aMiniste   without Portfolio.      The Present position gave the Prime Minister greater freedom,  and while it was admitted that the Bill itself involved some change itwas urged that this change should be made as small aspossible.      It was further suggested that the linkingud of the Office of Prime Minister with that of FirstLord of the Treasury would certainly be subject to criticism in Parliament.In favour of linking the two positions theCabinet were reminded that with the sole exception ofthe late Lord Salisbury the Prime Ministers had for avery long period been First Lords of the Treasury.It was a pity to disturb an almost unbroken tradition.There was nothing in this provision to prevent a Peerbeing Prime Minister since there were ample precedentsof    Peers who had been both Prime Minister and FirstLord of the Treasury.     Neither was there anything to
prevent a Prime Minister holding some other Office aswell as that of First Lord of the Treasury.      For this there were precedents in the cases of Lprd Rosebery andMr. Ramsay MacDonald, both of whom had been Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs as well as First Lord of theTreasury,  (and Mr, Asquith, who had been Secretary ofState for War in 1914).      There were some difficulties,inthough not insuperable ones,/providing for the salary of the Prime Minister who is not also First Lord of theTreasury.      It was undesirable to provide for an Officecf Prime Minister with a special oath. For example,in that event,/unless some special provision were made to the contrarytit was conceivable that the Prime Minister might kisshands on accepting Office., and though unable to form aGovernment might draw his salary and even a pension.It was therefore desirable to link up the Prime minister with seme specific Office,  and the only convenient one was that of First Lord of the Treas\iry9The Home Secretary said that if the present proposal were adopted when the Bill was presented itwould be necessary to say that      Clause 4 carried intoeffect what virtually had become constitutional practice, and that it was almost without exception for the Prime Minister        to be First Lord of theTreasury.      It could be pointed out that all sorts of results had followed.      For example, the Front Benchoccupied by the Government in the House of Commonswas known as the Treasury Bench,  and the Whips were known as the Treasury Whips.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To adjourn the subject for a week.(b) That in the interval the HomeSecretary should consult on thesubject of Clause 4 some of themore experienced members- of theHouse of Commons.

A P P E N D I X.SUB-COMMITTEE ON GOVERNMBNT AND LOCAL AUTHORITY&quot;EMPLOYMENT FOR hX-REGULARS.&quot;Su angary of Conclusions and Recommendations.(i)    On a long-term view,  i.e.  looking beyond thenext few years? we are unable to find any means of increasing to any considerable extent the annual number of posts in theCivil Service, for which ex-regulars areeligible, above the present figure of about,000 industrial and non-industrial postsopen to ex-service men as a whole.      Antici-pated developments in the Post Office, do,however,  offer a permanent prospect of somefew hundred additional posts annually in thecourse of the next few years.      By then ex-hostilities men will have ceased to be eligible for the posts in question,  and thenet result will be a considerable increase inthe intake of ex-regulars.(ii)    On a short-term view we forecast a temporaryposition in the Government service which couldbe made distinctly more favourable to theemployment of ex-service   men (i.e.  ex-regularsand ex-hostilities men taken together).    Thisarises mainly from the increased work created by the Defence Requirements programme.      Itshould be possible during the       next twoyears to absorb up to 10,000 ex-service men ayear, provided always that there is no obstacle,  owing to local opposition or other causes, to the free movement of the ex-regularswhom it is hoped to employ to the part of thecountry in which the Government employment is available.(iii)   We have found it necessary to abandon our previous proposal of a quota, under which an increasing proportion of Governmentvacancies would be reserved for newly dis-charged ex-regulars.      We endorse, however,  our recommendation that the desirability of&apos;pro-viding enroloyment for ex-regulars within areasonable period of their discharge should be impressed upon all the Government Departmentsconcerned.(iv)   We recommend that, as aiexception to our recommendation at (iii), tradesmen,  and men with technical qualifications, should, where practicable, be earmarked before the ex-piration of their Colour service, for appoint-ment immediately upon their discharge to technical positions in the Government Service.
(v)   We do not recommend any change in the con-ditions of pay, pension and seniority underwhich ex-regular Civil Servants are employed.(vi)   We are not satisfied with the existingopportunities for ex-regulars of obtainingLocal Authority emoloyment, but we have nofurther recommendations to make on this general aspect of the situation.(vii)    In the limited number of cases, however,  inwhich the strength of fire-brigades will beincreased under the recent Air raids precautions scheme we recommend that LocalAuthorities be asked to give an effectivepreference to ex-regulars.(viii)   The two principal difficulties in the way of arranging for an increased intake of ex-regulars into the Police are, firstly, thefact that in a war involving air attacksChief Constables would be unable to dispense with reservist policemen, and secondly, thefact that the age limit is often too low topermit of the recruitment of ex-regulars.The first difficulty has been met by an assurancegiven by the War Office that a materialincrease can be made in the number of suchreservists who will not be called up for atleast three months.      The second difficulty is under examination $y the Home Office andthe Scottish Office.      We wish to emphasise the importance of a satisfactory settlementof this matter.We now have reason to anticipate that provinc-ial Police forces will shortly absorb anadditional intake of from 300 to 500 ex-regulars a year,  and the Metropolitan Policean additional 250 a year.(ix)   We are glad to note that the Board of Educationare doing all in their power to press theclaim of ex-regular physical training in-structore to employment in secondary schools,both public and grant-aided, and to employmentunder the new national scheme for physical training and recreation.(x)   We are of opinion that it may be desirableeventually, when there are insufficient dis-abled men in industrial life to maintain theKing&apos;s Roll in its present form tq start anew form of Roll, under which firms would undertake to enroloy a minimum percentage of ex-regulars.      There are valid objections,however,  to making any change in the King&apos;sRoll at the present time.(Signed on behalf of the Sub-Committee)G.C. TRYON.Chairman.
