THE SITUATION IN SPAIN.

Mr EDEN handed, round a draft Despatch prepared as the result of the Meeting on the previous day .(Appendix.)

(Ministers read the Despatch.)

It was pointed out that the effect of the Despatch was to throw future procedure on to the Non-Intervention Committee, rather than the plan that had been discussed on the previous day of summoning a meeting of principals in London.

Mr EDEN said he had considered the matter further with his advisers in the Foreign Office. The general view was that it was rather dangerous to summon principals to London unless success could be assured. A failure might leave thigs worse than they were. He had spoken to the French Ambassador, who took the view that the German and Italian Despatches should be treated at their face value. In any event, the Non-Intervention Committee was meeting on Tuesday.

Ministers were reminded that the Non-intervention Committee was a dilatory one and the proposal might lead to nothing being done.

It was pointed out, however, that tne draft Despatch did propose to communicate to the Non-Intervention Committee the exchanges of views that had taken place,  "with the replies....... to their present  communication", and that the Committee was to be asked to fix a date. Moreover, the draft Despatch suggested, that the replies "would warrant the immediate adoption by each Government within their own territories of tne prohibitory measures required  ....... even in advance of the establisnmentof a complete system of control of Spain".

Mr EDEN said that the Spanish Government had stated that they could only work the Non-Intervention Committee&apos;s scheme if it were to cover volunteers. They thougnt that in that form it would be more
acceptable to both, sides in the Spanisn conflict. The scheme was one for placing Officers of certain Powers in the Spanish ports and for closing the frontier.

SIR THOMAS INSKIP pointed out that that scneme did not involve an exercise of force, but merely the placing of people who would observe and report.

Mr EDEN then raised the question of whether we should announce our intention to stop the enlistment of volunteers in England.

SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said it would add to the value of the Despatch from a public point of view.

There was general agreement that this should be done.

SIR JOHN SIMON suggested that if the Despatcn was to be published it might be possible to give a clearer picture for public opinion. He suggested that this might be achieved by altering the order of ideas somewhat.   The Despatch mignt begin by stating that replies had been received from the various Governments to the British communication of Christmas Eve. It would continue to state that all the replies agreed in accentuating the volunteer difficulty. No-one refused to deal with the question, but it was necessary that the prohibition should operate all round. Next we might indicate our own agreement in this view, concluding by asking them immediately to stop the departure of volunteers for Spain, stating that we were taking immediate action with this object.

SIR SAMUEL HOARE thought the Despatch might begin by noting the general desire to make non-intervention effective, then go on, as Sir John Simon had suggested, to emphasise the volunteer difficulty.

Mr EDEN agreed that some re-arrangement would be desirable.

THE PRIME MINISTER said it was impossible for a Committee of this size to re-draft, and suggested tnat this should be left to the Foreign Secretary.
THE FOREIGN SIR SAMUEL HCARE a.sked whether legislationENLISTMENT ACT.would he required to stop volunteers for Spain.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the Attorney-General and Sir William Malkin both took the view that legislation was unnecessary.SIR JOHN SIMON said that the view of the Lav/Officers and Sir William Malkin was that the ForeignEnlistment Act rendered illegal enlistment in theforces either of the Spanish Government or of the insurgents.     All depended an the interpretation ofcertain phrases.     He himself had felt some doubts,but was assured that these high authorities were confident on the matter.S.IR THOMAS INSKIP said he also had felt some doubts,     He was in favour of acting, however, on theopinion of the Law Officers.     An announcement that theForeign Enlistment Act would be enforced would besufficient to stop people from volunteering,MR. EDEN suggested that a little later theAct might, with advantage, he invoked to get homevolunteers already serving in the military forces in spain.LORD STANHOPE pointed out that the Despatchcontained nothing about the fact that Germany   andItaly had always been in favour of stopping recruiting.MR. EDEN said the difficulty was to refer tothe matter without appearing to blame ourselves.SIR JOHN SIMON thought the point might be met by words to the following effect:-&quot;not only from the tenor of the repliesnow under consideration, but it is clearthat some of the Powers would have beenprepared to do so at an earlier stage.&quot;
The Conclusions of the Meeting may be summed up as follows:-(a) To approve the general lines of thedraft Despatch attached in theAppendix,(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should re-arrange the orderof ideas in the Despatch on the lines suggested in the course of thediscussion.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should alter the Despatchso as to announce the intention ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government to stopforthwith the departure of volunteers to Spain from this country.(d) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, should issue a notice tothe effect that military service inthe forces of either of the contendingparties in Spain was inconsistent withthe Foreign Enlistment Act whichwould be enforced.2, Whitehall Gardens. S.W.1,9th January, 1937.
(R)AjPPgNglX.FOREIGN OFFICE,^ January,  1937.Telegram. In addressing their communication of paris Telegram No.    December 24th last on the subject of the inflowHome &quot;       No.    of foreign volunteers into Spain direct to the berlin       &quot;       No.    Governments of Germany, Portugal,  Italy and theLisbon       &quot;       No.    Soviet Union His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedMoscow       &quot;       No.    Kingdom were impressed by the gravity of thesituation which had developed and were convincedthat it was,  in the general interest,  imperativePOLITICAL. that immediate decisions should be taken by thePowers mainly concerned to concert remedial measures.2.  In taking this step His Majesty1s Governmenthad no wish or intention to interfere with theactivities of the Committee on Non-interventionestablished in   London.    On the contrary it was from a desire to facilitate and expedite the task of that Committee that they addressed themselvesto the four Powers direct in the hope that by taking a lead on the particular issues raised theGovernments mainly concerned might assist theother Governments represented on the Committeeto arrive at soeedier conclusions.    From thetenor of the replies now received His Majesty&apos;sGovernment are haopy to note that there is inprinciple general agreement among the Powersmainly concerned that immediate measures shouldbe taken to stop the inflow of foreign volunteersinto Spain provided that these measures aresimultaneously taken by all participating
Governmentsjr  that the whole problem of dealing withindirect forms of intervention in Spain   is alsoactively pursued forthwith,  and that there is established   an efficient and effective system ofcontrol.3.    As regards the establishment of a system ofcontrol,  the Governments are aware that theNon-intervention Committee has elaborated a detailed scheme for supervision at the Spanish ports and onthe land frontiers of Spain,  and that this schemeis at present being considered by the two parties in 3-oain.    It appears to His Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat this scheme could without difficulty beextended to cover the arrival in Spain both by land and by sea of volunteers and military personnel aswell as of war material.    Such an extension might,indeed, render the scheme more acceptable to thetwo parties in Spain than it may be in its presentlimited form.4.    His Majesty&apos;s Government recognise that thisscheme, which provides for supervision, can only bemade into a satisfactory guarantee of the genuineapplication of the agreement provided that all the participating Governments are willing loyally andwholeheartedly to carry out their undertakings.They are encouraged by the reception which their previous communication has met with to believethat these conditions will in fact prevail?  andthat consequently the Non-intervention Committee&apos;present scheme,  suitably     adapted, may be sufficient for the purposes envisaged.    Nevertheless they note that the Governments,  in their replies, refer invarious terms to the establishment of a system tf
rigid control over supplies to Spain.    They   wouldbe glad to learn whether the Governments have in mindany particular methods or forms of control other thanthat described above.    They are ready to consider withthe utmost urgency any suggestions which may be putforward to this end.    They would also be glad toconsider any detailed proposals for the control ofother forms of indirect intervention and would beready for an early discussion by the Committee of anysuch proposals submitted to it.5,    In the meanwhile His Majesty&apos;s Government are themselves of opinion that the general desire expressedin the replies received fr^m the other governments for the exclusion of foreign volunteers and military personnel from Spain would warrant the immediateadoption by each Government within their ownterritories of the prohibitory measures required forthat purpose,  even in advance of the establishmentof a complete system of control for Spain.6.    They are for their part prepared te take suchaction on learning that the other Governments aresimilarly disposed.7.    It is in the hope of receiving a favourable response to this suggestion that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment propose to communicate to the LondonCommittee on Non-intervention the exchanges of views which have taken place since their communication ofDecember 24th last with the replies of the    ..-and other Governments to their present communication,with the request that,  in the event of these repliesexpressing agreement to this suggestion, the Committeeshould then fix a date on which the prohibitory
measures referred, to above should be simultaneouslyout into operation. FrenchItalian8.    Please communicate immediately with GermanPortugueseSovietGovernment in the above sense and asl-c for a   very early reply.
