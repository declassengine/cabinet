SPA IN.The Positionof BritishMining Com-panies inInsurgentTerritory.(previous reference:Cabinet 11(37), Con-clusion 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the preliminary negotiations on thesubject of the requisitioning, of the output of theRio Tinto mines by General Franco had, on the whole,not been unsatisfactory.   General Franco&apos;s repre-sentatives had explained the necessity which theywere under of resorting to requisitions for their war requirements, but had given assurances that they would interfere as little as possible v/ith the business ofthe Mining Companies and that the United kingdom should receive all the minerals it requires, providedpyrites are not sold to France (in vie1&quot; of theprohibition imposed, on such exports) .   They had. alsooffered the representative of the Rio Tinto Company 10,000 a month towards the sterling requirements ofthe Company, and they appeared to desire to retain their old  customers and. not to let German or Italianinfluence become too strong.The Company, however, were not by any meanssatisfied, with the offer of  10,000 a month, whichwas wholly insufficient for the working of the mines;but they appeared to be ready to consult with HisMajesty&apos;s representatives and the Government Depart-ments concerned, on the next phase of the negotiations-They had. also agreed, to accept an offer of the GermanGovernment to consider the conclusion of a new contractcovering the supply of pyrites for the future, whichwould take into account both the existing contracts and the Company&apos;s complaints in regard, to the past,such as the recent, requisitioning pf cargoes of copper.Sir Auckland Geddes, however, had conveyed a warning to the Foreign Office that the position of his company was becoming increasingly difficult owing to this
question of sterling supply, and that it was impossiblefor them to continue indefinitely, as at present, tokeep the Rio Tinto mines running by providing sterlingrequirements from the profits of their Rhodesian mines.This was a problem which Sir Auckland Geddes statedhe might have to bring before His Majesty&apos;s government at an early date.-3-
SPAIN. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsProposal to       informed the Cabinet that a short time ago both theattach aBritish Agent War Office General Staff and the Air Staff had expressed to theInsurgent concern at the fact that, owing to the absence ofGovernment .U military observers with General Franco&apos;s armies, they(previous were without information upon the most recent develop-Reference:Cabinet 11       ments on land and air fighting as demonstrated in the(3 7), Con-clusion 1.)     present campaign.   A proposal had now been put forward.F.R.\&quot;b(yj)b that visits should be paid to those armies by british officers, and it was felt that General Franco was more likely to welcome thi? suggestion if permanent  contact with a civilian agent had been established .   On theother hand. General Franco, who was not enthusiasticabout the appointment of military observers, had letit be known that on his side he would welcome a proposalfor the appointment of an Agent in London.     TheSecretary of State thought it would be useful toappoint an Agent to the Insurgent Government on an informal basis .    This would not mean that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment  consider that the present situation justifiestheir recognising General Franco&apos;s administration asthe Government of Spain.    It d.i-* mean, however, thatthey recognised that they were bound to take cognizanceof the fact that large, areas were now under its effec-tive control;    that their responsibility for theprotection of&quot; British interests extended throughout thewhole of Spain, and. that in carrying out this dutythey were boun^ to take account of these developments.in fact, in order properly to protect British interestsit was necessary to deal with both sides.   The appoint-ment could be defended in Parliament on the ground of^ commercial interest.    If this suggestion was approvedby the Cabinet he proposed to select as our Agent atSalamanca Sir Robert. Hodgson, who retired, from service under the Foreign Office a year ago, who had acted as
Official Agent on the British Commercial Mission toRussia in 1921 and had served in that capacity, and.later as Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires at Moscow until 1937 .Sir Robert could speak Spanish, and on the ground ofwide experience and personal qualifications was inevery way suited to the appointment.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that Questions were being addressed to him in Parlia-ment about the position of the Board of Trade repre-sentative with the Insurgent Government.    No obection had been raised, and the representative had been most useful.    Our commercial situation in the portions of Spain under General-Franco&apos;s control would be worseif we had no representative there.   As we had runningcontracts in that part of Spain he was anxious tomaintain contact .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat Sir Robert Hodgson would be an Agent appointed for this purpose.Some discussion took place as to whetherGeneral Franco&apos;s desire for an Agent in London shouldbe acceded to.The Minister for- Co-ordination of Defenceimpressed, on the Cabinet the importance of theappointment of military observers.   The Germans andthe Italians were trying out. their apparatus in Spain,and. it. was a great pity that we were not receivingmore information as to the performance of their aircraft, tanks, anti-aircraft artillery, and so forth.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat&apos; he had in mind that if Sir Robert Hodgson got on good terms with General Franco&apos;s Government it mightfacilitate the appointment of military observers .

He begged his colleagues not to allow a wordescape them about this proposal.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposal of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs that he should endeavourto secure the appointment of an agent at Salamanca:(b) That in making the proposal heshould not mention General Franco&apos;swish to appoint an Agent in London,though, if General Franco should insist on this in return for theappointment of an Agent of theUnited Kingdom Government, heshould be authorised to considerthe proposal favourably:( c) That the Board1 of Trade representa-tive, who has had. access to theInsurgent Government in Spain,should continue as at present:(d) To note that if the proposal for aBritish Agent was accepted, byGeneral Franco, it might facilitate the appointment of military observers(e) That the utmost secrecy should be observed about these decisions.
THE IMPERIAL 4. The Secretary of State for DominionCONFERENCE.  Affairs informed the Cabinet that, as requested at united kingdom delegation to-the Meeting referred to in the margin, he had lookedfurther into the question of the exact status of the(previous reference:     Secretary of State for the Colonies at the imperial cabinet 11(37), Con-     Conference.   He found that there had been someclus ion .3 .)confusion at the last Meeting as to what had. beendone in previous years, and. that the precedents were clearly in favour of the Secretary of State for theColonies being a full member of the Delegation as representing the Colonies, Protectorates and ftopond1The Cabinet agreed  That the United Kingdom Delegation at theImperial Conference should be as followsDELEGATES.The Prime Minister.The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies(as representing the ColoniesProtectorates and  te^a&amp;&amp;tt&amp;&amp;&amp;B&apos;)/*.   . 7 -M:N Lv^ER.&apos;   IN ADDITION.(1) For Foreign Affairs and Defence:-^he Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,The President of the Board of Trade.(2) For Constitutional Questions:-The Attorney-General.(3) For Economic Questions,:-The President of the Board of Trade.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries .Other Ministers (for example, theMinisters at the head of the defence services for Defence Questions, andthe Secretary of State for Air forAir Questions) to be invited, to attendas occasion requires.
THE ARMY AND 5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by air FORCE(ANNUAL ) BILL, the Secretary of State for War (C.P.-93 (37))covering the Army and Air Force (Annual) Bill,(previous reference:        with a prefatory Memorandum explaining the reasonsCabinet 17(3 6), Con-        for the more important amendments of the Army Actelusion 8.)and the Air Force Act.   The Bill made certain changes&apos;        in those Acts  consequential on the changes in status of Burma and Aden, removed, certain anachronisms, and made a number of minor editorial amendments .   As theBill must receive the Royal Assent by the end ofApril the Secretary of State proposed, to circulateit before the House adjourned for Easter .The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for war should circulate the Army and AirForce (Annual) Bill to parliament before the Easter Adjournment.
UNDESTRABLEEMPLOYEES  INGOVERNMENTESTABLISHMENTS(previous reference:Cabinet 75(36), Con-elusion 8.)6 . The First Lord of the Admiralty informed hiscolleagues that the position arising out of his announcement in the House of Commons on the dismissalfrom the Dockyards of employees who had. been actively-engaged in dangerously subversive propaganda had notbeen entirely satisfactory.    Consequently the PrimeMinister and himself had. seen Mr Bevin, and he himself had seen Mr Bevin subsequently on two occasions.   Mr Bevin had been friendly disposed, and.he appeared  just as anxious to get rid of Communistagitators as the Government themselves .   The repre-sentatives of labour were generally sympatheticprovided, their difficulties were not made too greatby precipitate action.   He was proposing on the morrow to meet the Joint Industrial Council, who, hethought, had. not previously been received by a First-Lord of the Admiralty.   He proposed, to make clearthat there was absolutely no hostility to organised labour:    that there was no desire to alter thegeneral position:    while making clear tha.t theGovernment must retain the right- to dismiss persons engaged in subversive propaganda without givingreasons, he would intimate that when possible a hintwould be given in advance to the Trades Unions of a desire to get ri^. of particular men.    In this connec-tion he mentioned that on one occasion such a hinthad. been given to a Trades Union, who had. themselvestaken action and had. actually succeeded in getting the man concerned, to leave the country.   He did not contemplate making a formal statement, but merely-having a friendly talk with the Joint IndustrialCouncil.   He was not asking that, the Cabinet decisionreferred, to in the margin should be altered, but thatthe Ministers at the head, of the Defence Departments
should, he given some latitude as to the method bywhich they applied it.The Prime Minister said that he was in full agreement with the First Lord&apos;s proposal, and. he was convinced that a good deal could be done in thedirection indicated, more particularly as the trades union were embarrassed at the seditious activitiesof certain elements .The Cabinet agreed.  To approve the proposal of the FirstLord of the Admiralty that in applying the decision taken at the Cabinet onthe 15th December, 193 5 (Cabinet 75(36), Conclusion 8)%the Ministers atthe head of the Defence services should be given latitude to securethe co-operation and good offices of the Trades Unions  concerned, tosuch extent as they might deemadvisable in each particular case.

State for the Colonies informed his colleagues thatthe Malta       Civil Servants had endeavoured to approach(previous reference: the Opposition Labour Party with a view to their takingCabinet S(37), Con-       up their case, but that they had met with a rebuff,elusion 1,)
COAL POLICY.Third Reportof CabinetCommittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(37), Con-clusion 4.)^.2.0/37) 6.8,   The Cabinet had before them the Third Reportof the Committee on the Organisation of the CoalMining Industry (CP.-94 (37)),  covering a draftEill.   The main problem referred for examination bythe Committee h^d been the unification of coal miningroyalties, but they had. also advised on the questionsof compulsory amalgamations and the extension for afurther five years (until the end of 1942) of theprovisions of Part I of the Act of 1920, togetherwith certain modifications designed to safeguardconsumers.   The Committee recommended, that theprinciples embodied in the Eill should be approvedby the Cabinet, and that the Bill should be intro-duced at the earliest opportunity, subject to approvalof the final drafting of the Glauses by the presentCommittee, after consideration of any points whichmight emerge from technical discussions between the mines Department anrt the interests concerned.A summary of the Conclusions and Recommendationsof the Committee will be found reproduced as an appendix to these Minutes .(At the request of the President of theBoard of Trade, the Secretary for Mineswas present during the discussion onthis item.)In the course of a statement on the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee, the President of the Board ofTrade reported, that there was one reservation whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (who was unable to be present at the Cabinet that day) wished to make.The sums due to the individual royalty owners were,as the Bill is drafted, to be paid in cash (Clause 3and. Clause 16 (l)).    This was what had. been intendeda year ago, but the position had been altered by thedecision to borrow four hundred millions for defence in the next five years, and. we could, no longer safely
undertake to borrow seventy-five millions of cash forroyalties .   The Chancellor of the Exchequer thoughtthat payment must, in fairness, he made on a cashbasis.    The tribunal&apos;s Award, would be on a cash basis,and we ought reasonably to provide that if we paid in stock, the claimant should receive as much stock as,according to the price of gilt-edged, stock at thetime he was paid, would produce the sum due to him.In any case, the manner of payment should be reserved,for the present.In the course of the discussion various questions were raised, e.g.:-(l) That the opposition to the Bill wouldcentre largely round, the proposals for compulsory amalgamations, and that thisopposition might be met by substitutingan Affirmative Resolution by both houses of Parliament in respect of draft schemesinstead of the arrangement set forth in clause 33 of the Bill, under which, before an Order for compulsory amalgamation wasmade, a. draft should be laid before bothHouses of Parliament for 28 days, duringwhich either House could, resolve that theOrder be not ma.de.It was suggested that the Governmentshoulr1 not  close its mind to a conces-sion on this point if it was requiredto facilitate the passage of the Bill-This proposal met with considerables upport .(2) That a definition of the term &quot;area&quot;,used in the Report, should be given,showing whether it was intended toapply to a whole colliery districtor only to two or three collieries.It was explained, however, that the term &quot;area&quot; had been used advisedly inorder not to define the position tooclosely .(3) That as opposition in the past had. comenot only from coal-owners but also from coal users, it would be desirable, onthe analogy of some of the AgriculturalOommissiofis that had. been set up, e .g .,for Sugar, to provide specifically in the Bill(e.g. in Clause 2)  for the Coal MinesCommission to be charged not only withthe interests, efficiency and. betterorganisation of the coal-mining industry,
but also with the interests of us ers .Considerable discussion took placeon this point.   For the decision see conclusion (c).(4) The politica.1 point as to whether the strong objections that har] been raised to the previous Bill had been metsufficiently by the present Bill.On this matter assurances weregiven by the President of the Boardof Trade, the Secretary for mines and the Minister of Labour .^he Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the mhird. Reportof the Cabinet Committee on the Organi-sation of the Coal-Mining Industry,together- with the Coal Bill in C.?.-94(&quot;7), subject to the reservation by theChancellor of the Exchequer quoted, bythe President of the Board of Trade andrecorded above:(b) ^hat. the Bill should be introduced atthe earliest opportunity, subject to approval of the final drafting of the clauses by the Cabinet Committee onthe Organisation of the Coal-MiningIndustry (instead, of by the Committeeof Home Affairs):(c) That the Cabinet Committee, besidestaking into consideration any points which may emerge from technical dis-cussions between the Mines department and the interests concerned, should give consideration to the various issues mentioned in the discussion atthe Cabinet, including the important question referred to in (3) above:(d) That the Secretary of State for Scotlandand. the Lord Advocate should be addedto the Cabinet Committee on the Organisa-tion of the Coal-Mining Industry.(^he Secretary for Mines then withdrew .)
HE EXPORT.REDITSUARANTEEEPARTMENT.roposedendingegisla-;ion.previous reference:Cabinet 39(36), Gon-clusion 12.)69.     The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident of the Board ?f Trade (CP.-92 (37))covering a Memorandum by the Secretary of theDepartment of Overseas Trade on proposals for legislation to amend the Overseas Trade Acts (1920-1934)in respect of the powers administered by the export credits Guarantee Department.     In his Note thePresident of the Board of Trade sought authority forthe preparation of a Bill  )r submission to theCommittee of Home Affairs with the following objects:-(i)   The increase in the limit of guarantees which may at any time be outstanding,from  26 millions to  50 millions:(ii)   The abolition of the time limits onthe Departments activities imposed bySection 1 of the Overseas Trade Act, 1934:(iii)   Authority to charge on the consolidate fund, if and so far as not otherwise provided, any amounts required to implement the Departments guarantees:(iv)    Certain minor amendments of the existing acts.In the course of the discussion two suggestions were made.The first suggestion was that the time had come when reconsideration should be given to the ex-tension ofthe operations of the Export Credits Guarantee Departmentto war material.     The Cabinet were informed that substantial orders were being lost owing to the difficultyof some countries in making immediate payments.     these orders were going to foreign countries and some ofour old customers might be lost permanently,     Although,as pointed out by the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence, the greater part of the orders which had come before him could not at present be fulfilledwithout jeopardy to the completion of our own defence
requirements within the dates contemplated ,   it wassuggested that there were some orders, for example,Naval orders in particular, which could he accepted without involving serious delay and which would heforthcoming if Export Credits could he given.The Cabinet were reminded that there was still a rather widespread feeling against the extensionof Export Credits in the manner proposed, on the groundthat it was a subsidy to export industry which fosteredarmaments,In this connection,  the Home Secretary saidthat he was making progress with the formidable task of preparing a White Paper on the Report of theRoyal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and trading in Arms, and he thought it would be possiblefor him to include a passage which would help to clear up the situation on the point that had just been raised.The second suggestion was that from an Inter-national   and political point of view, it was desirableto find some means by which credits could be given to governments, even apart from war material,which couldnot pay immediately for their insistent needs.      Forexample, Yugo-Slavia,it was stated,had asked forassistance of this kind, but the Government had no powers to give it, with the result that the Yugo-SlavGovernment was liable to place itself under obligationby accepting assistance from Germany,The Cabinet agreed:(a)    To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to prepare a Bill for submission to the Committee of HomeAffairs with the following objects:-(i)    The increase in the limit of guarantees which may at any time be outstanding, from  86 millions to  50 millions:
(ii)   The abolition of the time limits on the Departmentsactivities imposed by Section 1of the Overseas Trade Act, 1934:(iii)   Authority to charge on the consolidated Fund, if and sofar as not otherwise provided,any amounts required to implement the Departmentsguarantees:(iv)    Certain minor amendments of theexisting Acts:(b)    That the questions raised during thediscussion as to the possibleextension of Export Credits to various forms of war material and for affordingCredits in particular cases to foreign government for political reasons shouldbe reserved for possible consideration at some future date.
10*   The Cabinet resumed their consideration ofthe questions of principle raised in Clause 4 (l)and (2) of the Ministers of the Crown Bill, whichhad been adjourne-1 at the Meeting referred to inthe margin in order that the Home Secretary mightconsult some of the more experienced. Members of theHouse of Commons on the subject, ana again had.before them a Memorandum by the Home Secretary(H.A.-14 (37))  covering the draft Bill, togetherwith the following conclusions of the Committee ofHome Affairs therr-on (H.A.C . 5th Conclusions (37),minute e 3) : -&quot;(i) To reserve for the Cabinet the questionsof principle raised by Clause 4 (l) and(2):(ii) Subject, to (i) and to the amendmentsnoted in the record of the discussion,and subject also to any drafting orminor alterations that may be foundnecessary or desirable, to recommend the Cabinet, to authorise the intro-duction forthwith in the House ofCommons of the Ministers of the CrownBill in the form of the draft annexed to H.A .-14 (37) .&quot;The Home Secretary reported that, as requested at the last meeting of the Cabinet, hehad consulted some of the more experienced membersof the House of Commons on the question as towhether the Bill should tie up the position of PrimeMinister and First Lord of the Treasury, as contemplated in Clause 4 (l).      The Leader of theOpposition Labour Party had expressed himself infavour of linking the two posts and his attitude had shown that he had weighed the various considerations involved.     The Leader of the LiberalOpposition Party had also sent a message that heentirely agreed in linking the two posts.     He had hoped to see the late Sir Austen Chamberlain, but
the latter sudden death had rendered this impossible.The Minister of Health said that, in thecircumstances, he would not press his contrary view anyfurther.The Home Secretary asked the approval of theCabinet to another-change.in. the Bill -designed,to secure that the House of Lords should have a suitableminimum number of Cabinet Ministers.     He reminded theCabinet that, under the present law, not more than six of the Secretaries of State could sit in the House ofCommons.     This, in practice, resulted in there alwaysbeing two persons who were Secretaries of State in theHouse of Lords.      He proposed, in the Bill, to fix thepresent number of Secretaries of State as a maximum,unless, of course, Parliament hereafter should authorisesome addition to their number.     At the same time, he proposed to secure that the House of Lords should havea minimum quota,not of Secretaries of State,but of theMinisters mentioned in Part I of the First Scheduleto the Bill.      The Home Secretary pointed out a certainabsurdity in suggesting that if the First Lord of theAdmiralty were a member of the House of Lords, he was notcounted for the purpose of this distribution but, if theSecretary of State for War was a member, he was socounted.The Cabinet approved the Home Secretary&apos;proposal agreeing that, since the Bill was placing allCabinet Ministers on an equality, it would no longer be appropriate to make special provision for Secretaries ofState as such in the House of Lords.The Lord Privy Seal, as Leader of the House ofLords, thankedthe Home Secretary for the care he had takento provide adequately for the representation of theCabinet in the House of Lords.

APPENDIX.COMMITTEE  ON  THE   ORGANISATION  OF  THE   COAL  MININGINDUSTRY.THIRD REPORT.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.50. Our conclusions and recommendations may be summarised as follows(references to paragraphs of Report) : General.(i) A copy of the draft Bill, dated the 9th March, 1937, is attached to thisReport. Subject to their approval of the various detailed reeommen-dations set out hereunder, we recommend that the Cabinet should giveauthority that, if the figure of price decided upon by the arbitration tribunal proves acceptable to the Government (or. alternatively, ifan acceptable figure can be agreed with the royalty owners), the Billshall be introduced forthwith.The Policy of a Combined Bill.(ii) The policy which we recommend has three inter-connected parts the unification of royalties, the promotion of amalgamations, bycompulsion if necessary, and the continuation of Part I of the Act of1930, with the necessary modifications in regard to the Committees of investigation. We therefore recommend the introduction and thepassage into law during the present Session of a single &quot; coal policy &quot;Bill, dealing with all three subjects, in the form of the appended draft(paragraphs 45-47).(iii) We wish to emphasise the importance of proceeding with the Bill withthe utmost despatch. The uncertainty as to the future of money ratesmeans that delay might prejudice the solvency of the Royaltiesscheme. Moreover, the amendment of Part I of the Coal Mines Act,1930, cannot be long postponed (paragraphs 47-48).Unification of Royalties.(iv) We recommend the acquisition on an appointed day by a statutory CoalMines Commission of the ownership of all coal deposits, known andunknown, in the United Kingdom, and of all underground rightsnecessary to work that coal and bring it to the surface (paragraph 24).(v) The purchase price of the whole property is to be expressed as a globalsum, which is to be specified in the Bill. The global sum will be paidin cash in compensation to the present owners of the coal, accordingto the proportion which the value of each property bears to the valueof the whole. A reasonable period will be allowed for the presentation of claims to compensation, and no claim will be admitted after theperiod has expired (paragraph 25).(vi) The cash to provide the compensation will be raised by a loan charged onthe property and revenues of the Commission, and backed by theguarantee of the Treasury (paragraph 26).(vii) The average net annual value of the property as a whole has already beenagreed by the Treasury and the royalty owners to be  4,430,000, andit has been agreed, in addition, to entrust a Tribunal with the duty of fixing the number of years&apos; purchase by which this figure is to bemultiplied, in order to arrive at the global value of the property.  This[14817 a]
2will be determined once for all. It has further been agreed that when this global sum has been ascertained the Government shall have the option within six weeks of giving notice that in view of the figurearrived at, they do not propose to proceed with the purchase (para-graphs 28-31)/(viii) The Commission will be free from Government interference in matters of day-to-day administration, but we recommend that the principle of ministerial Control should be maintained by means of a power of theBoard of Trade to issue &quot; general directions &quot; to the Commission on matters involving the national interest (paragraphs 34-35).(ix) We recommend that any surplus revenue which may accrue to the Coni-mission be applied for the benefit of the industry, namely, for tin;levelling down of anomalies of rent, first within districts, then betweendistricts as a whole, and finally for the general reduction in rent overthe whole country (the latter will require Parliamentary approval atthe time, but is not likely to arise for decades) (paragraph 36).(x) The general function of the Commission will be to grant mineral leaseson proper commercial terms. Rights under existing leases are to be preserved. Companies owning the freehold of their coal are to begiven leases on fair terms (paragraphs 37-39).(xi) We recommend the approval of the proposals regarding acquisition of surface rights, support, and associated minerals (paragraphs 40-42).(xii) We consider that no compensation should be paid to mineral agents(paragraphs 43-44).Compulsory Amalgamations (Part II of the Coal Mines Act, 1930).(xiii) There can be no question, in our view, of abandoning the policy of promoting amlgamations, and although we would greatly prefer themto be on a voluntary basis, we cannot recommend dispensing with the element of compulsion (paragraph 21).(xiv) We recommend linking amalgamations with royalties so as to form a comprehensive reorganisation policy, and for this purpose we suggest the merging of the Coal Mines Reorganisation Commission with theCoal Mines Commission set up to administer Royalties, and the inter-relation of their functions (paragraph 18).(xv) We propose a form of compulsory machinery less drastic than that in theBill of 1936, and, we hope, likely to be more acceptable to Parliament,in that it (a) retains as far as possible the original machinery ofPart II of the Act of 1930, including the Railway and Canal Corn-mission; and (b) gives effect to the concessions promised last May.The new machinery makes Parliament the ultimate authority for theapplication of compulsion to specified areas, but leaves to the railway and Canal Commission powers of confirming, modifying or rejectingeach actual scheme (paragraph 19).Production, supply and Selling Schemes (Part I of the Act of 1930).(xvi) Part I of the Coal Mines Act, 1930, under which all these schemesoperate, is due to expire on the 31st December, 1937. We recommendthat it be continued in force until the 31st December, 1942(paragraph 13).(xvii) Our Report also contains a proposal for a modification of Part I,intended to improve the machinery for dealing with complaints byconsumers regarding the operation of the selling schemes. these amendments were the subject of an agreement between the Secretaryfor Mines and the Public Utility Undertakings last summer, as aresult of which the opposition of the latter to the extension of Part Iof the 1930 Act and to the Selling Schemes ceased (paragraph 16).
