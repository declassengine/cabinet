rppg situation$ SPAIN.JV19 Non-interventionConiCiittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 7(37), Con-elusion 1.)2.      (The Right Hon. The Earl of Plymouth,Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, as Chairman of theInternational Non-intervention Committee,was present foi this item. )At the request of the Lord Privy Seal, actingtemporarily for the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statereported that on Monday the representatives of allthe Powers on the Chairman&apos;s Sub-Committee exceptPortugal had come to the following agreement:-(i) To take the measures necessary togive effect to the ban on volunteersby midnight on February 20th.(ii) To inform the Committee forthwithwhat measures had actually been taken.(iii) To adopt by&quot; the same date the schemeof supervision before them with thene c e s s ary modificat ions.(iv) To begin operating the supervisionscheme from midnight March 6th.Portugal had agreed to ban volunteers but had reservedher position as regards supervision.    On the previous day the full Non-intervention Committee had givengeneral assent to the above agreement and the repre-sentatives had undertaken to ask their respective governments to inform the Committee as soon aspossible what measures were being taken to implementit, and by whom.    The main difficulty outstandingarose out of the position of Portugal.    The portuguese government had rejected the scheme of land super-vision and the Committee was now considering anelaboration of a proposal made direct to the BritishGovernment, namely, that British agents should beattached to the Embassy in Portugal for purposes ofobservation, or, as an alternative, some sort of sea supervision with the necessary adaptations; or,as a second alternative, a combination of both schemes.
Unfortunately the Portuguese Ambassador had notyet received instructions, though these were expected at any moment.    This delay was causing theFrench Government great anxiety.    Their gesture in accepting land supervision had as yet resulted in no assurance whatsoever that Portugal would co-operate.Unless the situation was immediately cleared up itwould be very difficult for the French Government totake action to stop volunteers.    It seemed, therefore,to be very important to carry Portugal with the restof the Committee and to secure them as willing co-operators.    It ;was still possible, however, thatPortugal would refuse to co-operate.    In this casea very serious situation would arise.    The French and russians would press for action, possibly of a drasticcharacter, independently of Portugal, but the germans and the Italians might not agree.    This would leadonce again to disagreement, which would hold up theproposals.In the course of a short discussion the hope was expressed that the Portuguese proposal that Britishagents should be attached to the Embassy to watch the position would be adopted in preference to naval action, which would be extremely difficult to carryout.It was pointed out that it would be unnecessaryfor us to give any guarantee in respect of Portuguesesupervision of the scheme.    The only responsibilitywe should   have to take would be to watch thesituation as best we could.    There would be loopholesin any scheme, but probably less under this schemethan under one which depended on maritime action.
The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that the difficulty v/as that theFrench and other nations v/ould want to &quot;be satisfiedthat we were given all necessary facilities.    In replyto a question as to what would happen if agreement had not been reached as regards Portugal before theend of the week, he said the danger was that theFrench might not give effect to the scheme.    In that event the whole scheme might be delayed, as all theacceptances had been on the condition that every country represented on the Committee agreed to carry it out.    It had to be remembered also that the banon volunteers was made dependent on supervision being applied within a reasonable time.(The Earl of Plymouth withdrew.)
3.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord President of the Council (CP. -63 (37))inviting discussion of the terms of the followingresolution passed unanimously by the coronation committee on the question of the price to be charged for seats in Government stands on the Coronationroute:-&quot;That, after careful consideration ofall possible methods of discrimina-tion in matter of price between classesan, individuals, the Coronation Committeehas satisfied itself that no satisfactory scheme of discrimination is possible.The Committee believes that a charge of15/- a seat would not exclude any ofthose whose attendance is desired in arepresentative capacity.The Committee therefore advises that a charge be made of 15/- per seat andthat the remaining cost be borne bythe Exchequer&quot;.The Chancellor of&apos; the Exchequer informed hiscolleagues that he would have preferred that cost price should be charged for all uncovered seats.If some of the interests concerned had said that theycould not afford to pay for them he would have repliedthat they could meet the situation by applying forfewer seats   although as a matter of fact some ofthe interests concerned seemed to be able to find agood deal of money for Congresses and so lorth.The Inter-Departmental Committee had suggested thereshould be 25,000 seats in the Mall which should becharged only 10/- a head and should be allotted tothose who could not afford more&apos;,   while 60,000 people who could, afford to pay more were to make good theloss on the cheaper seats.    It hao. been pointed out,however, that this plan would create a good deal ofdissension, and the Committee had not recommendedit.       He himself had thought, however, that it
night have been possible to meet the situation bycharging 10/- for 25,000 seats and cost price for60,000 seats, the loss on the cheaper seats being made good by the Exchequer.    After hearing, however, theobjections of the Secretary of State for India andthe Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, as wellas those urged by the Deputation which had waited onthe Prime Minister on the previous day on the subject,he had realised that i,t ywas ga-t-hor -ha-M; that-;-pco-pire-pay more for the-i-r-seats--- - though an answer could berIiad^-on--th-is-p oi**t-al aa^if-nace s s ary.The argument now was that the Coronation had tobe conducted with proper ceremony and dignity: thatin Westminster Abbey seats which cost a good deal ofmoney were provided for a number of people who reallyhad to be present:    that the same argument could wellbe applied to the processional route, which ought tobe not only well lined but lined by the right sort of people.    If these could not afford the price of theirseats there was a case for making it good out ofpublic funds.    He himself was now prepared to accept this argument and to make good the difference, asproposed in the Lord President&apos;s Memorandum.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That a charge be made of 15./- per seatand that the remaining cost be borneby the Exchequer:(b) That the Lord President of the council should announce this decision by answer to a Question in the House of Commons.
9 9 9&amp; o t)MEW CONSTRUCTION 4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bvHOGRAMMB, 1S37.the First Lord of the Admiralty (CP.-61 (37))proposed(Previous stating- that the/ New Construction Programme for 1937Reference:Cabinet 48 was as follows:-(36), Con-elusion 11. ) 3 Capital Ships.2 Aircraft Carriers.FK.S/t8) io. 7 Cruisers (5 of 8,000 tons, 2 of5.000 - 6,000 tons).16 Destroyers (i.e.,2 Flotillas, two vesselsbeing fitted a-s Leaders).7 Submarines.2 Escort Vessels (previously known as&quot;Sloops&quot;).4 Minesweepers (previously known as &quot;SloopMine sweeper s&quot;).3 Patrol Vessels (previously known as&quot;Coastal Sloops&quot;).Miscellaneous Vessels:1 Destroyer Depot Ship.1 Submarine Depot Ship.1 Large Surveying Ship.1 Small Surveying Ship.2 Large River Gunboats.2 Loop Minelayers.10 Motor Torpedo Boats.16 Boom Defence Vessels.2 Tugs.In his Memorandum the First Lord said that this&quot;Programme was based on Defence Requirements CommitteePaper No.37, and Defence Policy and requirements committee Paper No.88 (Revise), and followed naturallyfrom the policy of re-establishing a strong&apos; Navy as quickly as appeared to be practicable, withoutresorting to emergency measures in relation to labour,or to undue diversion of shipbuilding and otherconnected industrial activities from their normal channels.    A Table attached to the Memorandum showed the financial effect of the above proposals.The First Lord of the Admiralty made a statement in elaboration of his Memorandum, in the course ofwhich he mentioned that in order to meet the wishes of the Chancellor of the Exchequer he was arrangingto postpone the laying down of some of the ships
until later in the year;    and that he was advised, sofar as labour was concerned, that the carrying outof this programme would not interfere with the Armyand Air Force Programmes.In reply to a question he said that the Japanese had not yet agreed to adopt the 14-inch gun.    At thepresent moment we were bound by no Agreement, but ^ ^^^ ^^negotiations were proceeding satisfactorily for the-/jLi f/&apos;/L- .4part-i-Pom-Japan.    In any event the intention at theurill &quot;^-^^-^putset -was to adhere to 35,000 tons and 14-inch gunsTa^as^.        yfor the British Capital Ships irrespective of theJapanese attitude.    He also explained that DestroyerLeaders were included in the provision for Flotillas,and that arrangements had been made for the provisionof the necessary steel for constructing the programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attention to paragraph 15 of the Statement relating to defence expenditure (Cmd.  5374), issued on the previous day,,where it was mentioned that the average cost of theNew Construction Programmes for the years 1931 to 1934was less than  12,000,000, whereas the cost of the1936 Programme would be nearly  50,000,000.    TheProgramme now before the Cabinet would bring this figure to  62,000,000.    He had agreed this programme with the First Lord of the Admiralty.    In asking theFirst Lord to postpone the date of laying down certainships he had not been actuated primarily by thedesirability of saving money, but by the consideration that it was undesirable to place all the Naval.ordersat the same time.    So far as labour was concernedit had to be remembered that there was a class oflabour, represented, for example, by draughtsmen,who moved about from one branch of engineering
23irindustry to another, who would he drawn to the ship-yards by large simultaneous orders, to the detriment of the other Services.    He had been anxious, therefore to avoid placing too many orders at once lest stimula-tion of these particular orders should be at theexpense of others of equal importance.    He had alsobeen anxious lest, by placing all the orders forwarships at once, we should exclude the building ofmerchant ships, on which, in the long; run, the futureof the industry would depend.The President of the Board of Trade was also very anxious to maintain steady replacement of merchant ships in three classes, namely:-(l) TANKERS, where there was a serious shortage and some of the big oil companies could not obtain all thetonnage they required:(2) PASSENGER VESSELS,  of which we were likely to require more, especially inview of the extensive American subsLdi-sation of shipping:(3) TRAMPS, which were important in timeof war.Prom this point of view he urged that the admiralty should spread out their orders for shipping.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that theAdmiralty had always taken into account civilian needs and that he had practically agreed with the Chancellorof the Exchequer as to the dates for laying down thenew pro gramme.The President of the Board of Trade drew attentionto the shortage of scrap for steel construction.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat, according to his information, notwithstandingthis shortage the Admiralty were selling scrap at 7:10:0 a ton, abroad.The First Lord undertook to look into the questionof the sale of scrap.
The Minister of Labour said that he had beeninvestigating- the question of labour f02 shipbuilding and engineering in some detail and had a Report onthe subject almost ready for circulation.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Programme submittedby the First Lord of the admiralty in CP.-61 (37) and summarised above:(b) To take note that the ships would belaid down at dates which would beagreed, so far as they had not been already agreed, between the FirstLord of the Admiralty and theChancellor of the Exchequer.-10-
jgg CALEDONIAN 5.  The Cabinet had before them the followingPOWER ORDER,,937. documents on the question of the Governments attitudeproduction of        towards the Caledonian Power Order, 1937, relatingCalcium Carbide.to a scheme of the British Oxygen Company to erectworks for the production of calcium carbide and otherF.R.lo(yj)o. rriatsr.^als ax, corpach, in the West Highlands:-A Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (CP.-55(37)), setting forth the consider-ations which compelled him to theconclusion that, from the defencepoint of view, the scheme ought on merits to be supported, notwithstand-ing that a previous Bill had been rejected by the House of commons and that the Highlands were notscheduled as a Special Area.    he realised, however, that on wider-political grounds his colleaguesmight take a different view:a Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP.-60 (37))strongl;/ urging the claims of the highlands for the establishment ofa hew industry and asking that theGovernment should give the fullestsupport to the Second Reading ofthe Bill:A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP.-62 (37)) adducingarguments to show that from thepoint of vie-1-&quot;&apos; oi unemployment,labour supply, and other factors,as well as the particular needs ofthe Soui!i Wales Special Area, the scales were heavily weighted infavour of that district.&quot;Considerable discussion took place on thissubject, in the course of which general agreement was expressed that the Cabinet would have to announce their- attitude when the matter came before theCommittee of the House of Commons about the second week in March.    It became clear, however, that furtherinformation was necessary before a, decision could bereached.    For example, there was uncertainty as tothe correctness of the British Oxygen Company&apos;estimates of the relative cost of electrical power under the Highland scheme or in South Wales respect-ively, and as to the views of the Electricity
Commissloners on this point.    It was suggested alsothat the production of calcium carbide was important not only from the Defence point of view but also because it was entering more and more into all kinds of chemicalmanufacture.    The key question, however, on which theCabinet desired further information was as to whethera factory, whether in Scotland, South Wales or else-where, was necessary from the point of view of Defence.In this connection it was stated that the output ofexisting factories in Canada (150,000 tons per annum in the aggregate) was more than sufficient for our needs, which, as formulated in a Memorandum by theBoard of Trade in June, 1935, were only 5,000 tons ayear as compared with an earlier estimate of 20,000tons.    It was also pointed out that in the Great war there had been one factory in this country producing5,000 tons a year, and a second factory had been builtnear Derby with a capacity of 10,000 tons a year, which only came into production in the autumn of 1919.    Weappeared, therefore, to have managed in the War without much home manufacture.The provision of a factory was recognised to be amatter of insurance rather than one on which a precisedecision could be given.    It depended largely on whether our communications with Canada could be kept open intime of war.    It was pointed out, however, that if our communications could not be kept open we shouldvirtually have lost the war.The Cabinet agreed  That the minister for Co-ordination ofDefence, in consultation with suchMinisteis as he might desire on thevarious aspects of the question,should make a report to the Cabinetmore particularly on the question of whether the provision of a calcium carbide factory was necessary fromthe point of view of Imperial Defence.-12-
THE SPECIALAREAS.Report ofCabiiaetCommitteeon theReports ofthe Ccmmis-sioners.(previous reference:Cabinet 67(36), Con-elusion 14.)   attention to the considerations contained in AppendixF.R.9^7)//jz..H, regarding Government action in aid of the SpecialAreas in ways other than under the Special areas Act,the Cabinet Committee made recommendations concerningthe Third Report of the Commissioner for England andWales, which might require legislation, and suggestedthat they should be authorised, if their recommendations were accepted in principle by the Cabinet, to arrangefor the preparation of a draft Bill for submission tothe Committee&quot;of Home Affairs and for the approval ofthe Cabinet on February 24th, if possible.The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave theCabinet a full summary of the proposals of theCabinet Committee.A discussion followed, in the course of whichit was pointed out that apart from the proposalsrequiring legislation, dealt with in the Report of theCabinet Committee, there would be a number of detains to settle before the subject was debated in the Houseof Commons.     These, however, could be settled in due course and there was general agreement that for themoment the most important issue was the preparationof the Bill.In discussing the proposal under which theGovernment would provide 25 per cent, of the capital6.      The Cabinet had before them the Report (CP.-57(37)) of the Cabinet Committee on the Reports of theCommissioners for the Special Areas (Cmd.5303 andCmd. 5245).    The Cabinet Committee had also had under examination the Report of an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee and two Memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer, which they attached as Appendices I, and III respectively.    After drawing particular
for the formation of public utility companies operatingoutside1 the Special Areas for the purpose of acquiringsites and buildings, etc., it was pointed out that the75 per cent, to be subscribed privately could not be forthcoming unless it took precedence for purposes of dividend over the Governments 25 per cent.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he hadnot appreciated this point, but he agreed that it could hardly be avoided.It was urged that when introducing the schemesomething should be said to indicate that further assistance to the coal districts was being considered.      Onesuggestion was   for the provision of hydrogenation plantin South Wales, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of Trade (who had only just received a report on the subject based on the latest information) pointed out that the present prospects werenot encouraging and it would be a mistake to encouragefalse hopes by mentioning the matter.The President of the Board of Trade said hecould place the facts before any Minister who wanted torefer to it in the Debate.An alternative means of helping the coal industryin South Wales, it was pointed out, would be theestablishment of a new electrical generating plant, butthe investigations on this point were still incomplete.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said he was receiving repeated questions about hydrogenationfrom the point of view of National Defence and would likethe views of the Cabinet as to what answer he should give.He was asked to avoid giving any definite replypending the Debate on the Special Areas.
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve in principle the recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee on the Reportsof the Commissioners for the SpecialAreas as set forth in CP. 57 (37):(b) That the Cabinet Committee should arrange for the - preparation of a draftBill for submission to the Committee ofHome Affairs with a view to its consideration by the Cabinet onWednesday, the 24th February.
THE UNEMPLOY- 7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by$JUT FUND. thQ minister, of Labour (CP.-59 (37)) covering theFinancialCondition Annual Report of the Unemployment Insurance Statutory0 &apos; __ Committee on the financial condition of the Unemploy-Annual Reportof Unemploy-     ment Fund on December 31, 1936.    In respect of itsment insurance statutory General Account the Fund was more than reasonablyCommittee.sufficient to dischaige its liabilities, and there(Previous was a non-recurrent surplus of  17,250,000 availableReferenceiCabinet 8 for disposal.    By a majority the Committee recommended(36), Con-elusion 10.)    certain changes required to make the Fund, in respectPR.i o ^32)/&quot;S   of its General Account, not more than reasonablysufficient;    and estimated that the proposed changes would increase the expenditure of the Fund by approxi-mately  2,250,000 a year or  17,250,000 in the eight-year period 1937-1944.    The Statutory Comriiittee also reported formally on the financial condition of theAgricultural Account of the Unemployment Fund.Subject to the Chancellor of the exchequers concur-rence, the Minister 01 Labour proposed to adopt theMajority Report of the Committee and to take thenecessary action for giving effect to it by an affirmative Resolution of both Houses.In the course of a short discussion theChancellor of the Exchequer drew the attention of theCabinet to the fact that, after hearing certaineconomists, the Committee had assumed that there wouldbe eight years&apos; slump in employment beginning in 1938and that the surplus only arose after making provisionfor these eight bad yearse     The actual amountaccumulated was over  50,000.000.     He recalled thatthe Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons,^ in discussing Defence Expenditure, had recalled thatthe Government, of which he had been a member, had had
to &quot;borrow  100,000   for the Unemployment Fund.      Thepresent Government had not ^nly funded the debt on this item but had also accumulated  50,000,000.After a short further discussion the cabinet agreed:(a)(c)To authorise the Minister of Labour toadopt the Majority Report of theUnemployment Insurance Statutory Committeeon the Financial Condition of theUnemployment Pond on the 31st December, 1936*attached to CP. 59 (37):That the actual date of publication^shouldbe settled by the Minister of Labour inconsultation with the Minister of health and the Secretary of State for Scotland:That the Minister of LabourXshould takethe necessary action for giving effect tothe Report by an affirmative resolution of both Houses.
^jiJlSTSRS1 8.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bySALARIES.the Home Secretary (CP.-48 (37)) covering the DraftDraft Bill.Clauses of a Bill designed to carry out the recom-(Previous mendations contained in the Reports of the cabinet reference:Cabinet 6 Committee on Ministers   Salaries (CoP.-20 (37) and(37), Con-elusion 7.) CP.-29 (37)).    In his Memorandum the Home secretary^ft-H C^J^io/drew attention to Clause 4 (2), proposing a method ofidentifying &apos;&apos;Cabinet Ministers&quot;; and Clause 5, inrespect of emoluments attaching to the office of prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury.The Home Secretary drew the attention of theCabinet to some of the more important Glauses in theBill.In dealing with Clause 5, he drew attentionto the desirability of tying up the two offices of prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury, and suggested a re-draft of the Clause which he hopedwould virtually produce this result.      Historicallyand traditionally, he pointed out that there was muchto be said for this course.     A Prime Minister who wasalso First Lord of the Treasury would always be in a particularly strong position in the case of a difference between a Government Department and theTreasury.Another point of view was that the mass ofthe general public knew or cared very little about theoffice of First Lord of the Treasury, but were veryinterested in the position of the Prime Minister.     as this was a Bill to increase the remuneration ofMinisters, it would be better not to complicate it bya constitutional issue which would certainly be debated in the House of Commons, but to state in the simplestterms that the salary of the Prime Minister was to be 10,000 a j^ear and that if he held some other officehe would not receive any additional remuneration.h- 18 - i
This view was eventually accepted.In connection with Clause 2 (a) of the Bill,it was agreed that the salary of the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury should he raised to  3,000and that this should he effected by including thisoffice in Part II of the ScheduleThe provision in Clause 2 (b) -of the Billfor a salary of  1,000 to each of the Lords commissioners of the Treasury was approved.The arrangement in Clause 3 (2) making provision as to the numbers of Parliamentary Under-Secretaries in the House of Lords and the House ofCommons respectively was approved.The Home Secretary pointed out that it mightbe necessary to insert words to make clear that Under-Secretaries of the Treasury were not qualified to sit inthe House of Lords.Some doubts were expressed on this point andthe Home Secretary undertook to consider the point.In regard to Clause 4 (2), it was pointed outthat this Clause, dealing with the pension of the PrimeMinister, was unintentionally drawn in such a way as to exclude Mr. Lloyd George from a pension.There was general agreement that the Billshould be amended in this respectsSome discussion took place as to whether thisClause o\?ght to include, as a condition, that the PrimeMinister, in order to qualify for a pension, must have servedfor some particular term of months or years, whether as prime Minister or holder of some important office.      Itwas pointed out that, without some such provision, itwould be technically possible for a Prime Minister toaccept the.task of forming a Government even though hehad no prospect of a Parliamentary majority and to hold
office for a short time pending the assembly ofParliament and thus qualify for a pension v/ith hardlyany service at all.      The general view was, however,that in British politics such a situation was not likely to he created deliberately and that there was much to be said for assuming that anyone who had reached the position of Prime Minister should be awarded a pension, even though his tenure of office wasshort.
