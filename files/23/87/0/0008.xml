dismissal ofmsloyal Civil(servants.previous reference:Cabinet 75(36), Con-concluslon 8. )MALTA. 1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-44 (37))informing his colleagues   in view of the recentDebate in Parliament on the dismissal of certainworkmen employed in the Royal Dockyards   of theaction proposed to be taken for the dismissal of twopp. li [yj)j.   Maltese Civil Servants who had been indulging indisloyal activities and intrigue with the Italiansagainst the interests of the State.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, elaborat-ing his Memorandum, communicated a number of detailsof the evidence against the Civil Servants implicated.He offered, if desired, to put this information at thedisposal of the Lord Chancellor and the Home secretary of they would care to examine it on behalf of theCabinet.The Home Secretary thought this unnecessary.The Secretary of State for the Colonies added thatthe persons implicated had already been suspended.    Oneof them was in comfortable circumstances, and the otherwas to be given some compensation for his services.The. subject was discussed mainly in its bearing,from the political point of view, on the Parliamentarydiscussions on the dismissal of Dockyard employeesat home.    It was pointed out that the procedure adoptedin the case of the Malta Civil Servants had been similarto that which the Parliamentary Opposition Parties had said ought to have been adopted at home:   the chargeshad been communicated to the. persons implicated, who hadbeen allowed to give their reply.    This     had consistedonly of a denial.    This was exactly what would have happened if the same course had been followed at home,
and appeared to justify the procedure that had beenadopted in the case of the Dockyard employees.The Cabinet considered whether, in view of theinter-connection between the two subjects, it wouldbe advisable not to proceed with the Malta charges.In favour of this course it was pointed out that therewas a difference between the two cases in so much asthe gravest danger in the case of the Dockyardemployees was that sabotage was involved, whereasthis did not arise in the case of the Maltese CivilServants.On the other hand the Cabinet were reminded thatthe criticisms in the case of the Dockyard employeeshad been directed partly against the fact that theywere Communists and poor men.    In the case of the maltese civil  Servants the persons concerned wereFascists and comparatively well-to-do.  It would besaid that the Government meted out a different treat-ment to the latter from what they had applied to theformer.One suggestion was that a new procedure ought tobe adopted in all similar cases in the future.    the example of India was recalled, where in correspondingcases in Bengal the evidence obtained from secretsources was usually submitted to an independent tribunal of two Judges, whose decision was taken asfinal.On the other hand, it was pointed out that theIndian precedent was not quite applicable, since thenumbers there were very large indeed, amounting tohundreds, whereas the instances at home and in Maltawere only isolated cases.   Moreover, in Malta the judges, who were Maltese, were less well suited thanin India for a tribunal of this kind.
The Cabinet were reminded that the case had gonever.y far.    The Governor of Malta, who had at his disposal the best of the Civil Servants and hisLegal Adviser, equivalent to the Committee of CivilServants who had examined the corresponding cases athome, had taken his decision, which was supported bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies.    It wouldbe a very extreme step to override the Governor.To reverse his decision would give a severe setbackto the political situation in Malta, where publicopinion was tending to veer away from Italy and tosupport strongly the British connection.In these circumstances the Cabinet felt that itwould be inadvisable to override the Governor1sdecision.    If the natter was raised in Parliamenthere it was felt that it would be better to speak ofthe anti-British rather than of pro-Italian activitiesof the Civil Servants concerned.The Cabinet agreed  That the action proposed by theSecretary of State for the Coloniesfor the dismissal of   two MalteseCivil Servants who had been indulgingin disloyal activities against theinterests of the State, should becarried out.
ROYAL NIGER?ANY.2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-37 (37))in which he sought authority for the introduction ofa short Bill to amend the Royal Niger Act, 1899, witha view to the abandonment of any claim for repaymentsto the Exchequer under Section 3 of the Act in connec-tion with the sum advanced for the purchase of theNiger Company1s rights.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies to prepare a Billto amend the Royal Niger Act, 1899,for consideration by the Committeeof Home Affairs. w^y^ar-v^i-ewTO*e--iftrS&apos;-introduction-.:-aa^the Hous-e^-of-Lord-s-.-

The Deputationhad asked to retire and consult those whom themrepresented.     Twenty minutes later two of them had returned to say that the Deputation unanimouslydecided to recommend the acceptance of the proposal and wanted to know how they should proceed.     He had replied that the first step appeared to be for a discussion between representatives of the royalty owners and the Government, as to (l) the Terms ofReference, and (S) the nature of the tribunal.     if agreement was reached it could then be referred tothe main body of the owners for confirmation.General satisfaction was expressed withthe result of this interview, which, it was agreed,would provide a good start.

He had this withhim and would communicate it to the Cabinet if desired,but as it was somewhat technical he thought they mightleave it to the Minister for Co-ordination of defence and himself.    A consequential amendment of theConclusions of the Committee of Imperial Defence was involved (Appendix III).In the course of the discussion it was suggestedi that Enclosure III to CP.-39 (37) might with advantage-be expanded.    For example, it might include at the outset some general remarks on the relative
importance of the different subjects considered bythe Royal Commission.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat the Committee of Imperial Defence had suggestedthat he should prepare a draft.    He had not had verymuch time for this, and it was only intended as thematerial for a Parliamentary speech.    He had at firstthought it might be possible to submit something quiteshort, which would form the subject of a parliamentary statement, but the matter was so involved that this had proved impossible.This led to some discussion as to the form inwhich the decisions of the Government would have tobe communicated to Parliament.    There was little doubtthat Parliamentary interest in the question -had waned, but there was a small group who were constantly pressing for information on the subject,and a statement in some form would have to be given.It was very doubtful whether the parliamentary opposition would be willing to move a Vote of Censureon the subject, though possibly it might be raised ona Supply Day.    In the circumstances it was suggestedthat it might be advisable to issue a White Paper.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle the recommanda-tions of the Committee of Imperial defence as set forth in the Draft Minutes of theCommittee attached as Enclosure II to cp.-39 (37), subject to the amendmentof the Conclusion attached in Appendix IIIto these Minutes:(b) That the best method of communicatingthe decision of the Government on theReport of the Royal Commission wouldbe&quot;by means of a Parliamentary WhitePape r:(c) That the Home Secretary, with the assist-ance as necessary of the Foreign Secretary,the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,the First Commissioner of Works, and anyother Ministers interested, should prepare the draft of a White Paper for considera-tion by the Cabinet.
l&amp;EtllAL COM-$tOMGATIONS.[Cable and wireless,limited.[(previous reference:Cabinet 30(29), Con-elusion 15. )6.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-42 (37)), circu-lating copies of a Report to the Governments of theEmpire on the affairs of Cable and Wireless, Limited,submitted by the Imperial Communications AdvisoryCommittee, together with a telegraphic summary(Annex A.) of the Committee&apos;s recommendations and adraft telegram (Annex B. ) which, if his colleagues agreed, he proposed should be despatched immediately .to the Governments in the Dominions and India, stating the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom on these recommendations.    The Report repre-sented a new effort to deal by agreement between theparties concerned with the situation of the Companycharged by the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conferenceof 1928 with the conduct of the main overseas telegraph services of the British Empire, and, with the concur-rence of the Postmaster-General, the Chancellor of theExchequer recommended that the scheme outlined thereinshould be approved in general principle, subject to a proposed modification of Recommendation 5.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that the telegrams attached as Annexes A and b to CP. 42 (37) required a few verbal alterations,which would have to be concerted between the Departmentsconcerned.The Postmaster-General said that his department were concerned in two points.     The first wasa loss of revenue of  100,000 Qn the Beam Wireless.While not contesting the recommendations of the Report,they did dispute the suggestion that the rental of 850,000 per annum plus 12 per cent, of the surplusprofits over Standard Revenue had been excessive.     Thesecond point was the suggested transfer to Cable and(The Postmaster-General entered at this point.)
Wireless Limited of the Anglo-Continental telegraph services.     The Company had not a good record in thematter   of lowering rates which the Post Office had always aimed at.      There was the risk that the Companymight make a loss on this Service leading to claims asto rates.     Prom the House of Commons point of view also,the Report would not be particularly popular and thiswould be a difficult point to defend.       The matter didnot affect either the Dominions or Defence,    and hethought it would be better to reserve it for further examination.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthis point could be met by the introduction of new words in the eighth   line of the draft telegram attached as annex B to CP. 42 (37) which would then read as follows:-&quot;Subject to further consideration of recommendation 4 and observations belowon Recommendation 5&quot;This was agreed to.In the course of the discussion, doubts were expressed as to whether even after the measures nowproposed had been taken, Cable and Wireless Limited wouldbe placed on a satisfactory footing.      The imperial communications Advisory Committee,in their FifthRecommendation, had advised the addition to the existingBoard of Cable and Wireless Limited of a further sevenDirectors, each of whom would be nominated by the company and approved by one of the Imperial Governments nowrepresented on the Advisory Committee.     As, however,reservations on this point had been made by therepresentatives of two of the Imperial Governmentsconcerned, and unanimity on this Recommendation appearedunlikely, it was proposed as an alternative,if theCompany would concur, to appoint three new United KingdomDirectors to the Board of the Company.)     Concern was
expressed as to whether three Directors would carrysufficient weight to ensure the best conduct of thebusiness of the Company.     It was pointed out that ifthe Company got into difficulties again, the Governmentof the United Kingdom would be subjected to criticismowing to the fact that it had three Directors on theBoard.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look into this point.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer in cp. 42 (37) on the Report of theImperial Communications AdvisoryCommittee to the Governments of theEmpire,(b) To approve the draft telegrams to dominion Governments and Indiasummarising the Recommendations inthe Report (Annexes A and B to cp. 42 (37)). subject to thefollowing:-(i)    line 8 of Annex B to be amended to read as follows -&quot;Subject to furtherconsideration of recommendation 4 andobservations below onRecommendation 5&quot;(ii)   Any draft alterations that maybe concerted between theMinisters concerned.(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should give further consideration tothe suggestion that three new UnitedKingdom Directors to the Board of theCompany should be appointed.(d) That the Committee of Imperial defence should, as soon as possible, considerthe questions relating to strategiccables, referred to in the thirdConclusion of the imperial communications Advisory committee report (paragraph 82 and page 47under the heading &quot;Strategic Cables1).(The Postmaster-General withdrew at this point.)
1isters&apos;abies.BUviousDeference:Linet 4 (37)lonclusion 17(a).)7.     In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet again had underconsideration the two Reports by the CabinetCommittee on Ministers&apos; Salaries (CP. 20 (37) and cp. 29 (37)-).The Home Secretary informed the Cabinetthat, in accordance with the decision referred to inthe margin, good progress had been made in the drafting of the Bill which should be available forconsideration next week.The Minister of Transport said that while he was personally unaffected, he was concerned as to   jthe future status of the Ministry of Transport in thelight of the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee.He recalled that when the Ministry of Transport hadbeen established in 1919, the Act had laid it down that the Minister was to receive a salary notexceeding  5,000.     The result of the Cabineti-Committee^ recommendation would be to amend this and lower the figure to  3,000.     To that extent theMinister of Transport would be degraded.      It was truethat in practice he and his immediate predecessorshad been paid on the same scale as the President ofthe Board of Education, the Minister of Agriculture    Iand Fisheries and the Minister of Labour.     Witnessesappearing before Parliamentary Select committees which had considered the subject had, however,recommended that the Ministry of Transport should beelevated together with the other three.     Under theCabinet Committee&apos;s proposal, whereas the Board ofEducation, the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries and the Ministry of Labour were in fact to be elevatedthe Ministry of Transport was by contrast left in aninferior position.     The result would be that unlessthe Post Office were considered as an administrativerather than a business office, the Ministry of- 12 -
Transport would be the only large administrative Department to appear in the lower category, and that on an up-to-datereview of the position.The Ministry of Transport was in charge of all communications in this country,  except by air, and had res-responsibilities in connection with harbours, docks and wharves.These duties were of great importance, both in peace and war,and touched all the citizens of the country.      Its functions were necessarily largely of a restrictive character,  involvingimportant political considerations.      He urged, therefore,that the recommendations of the Cabinet Committee should be amended to rectify the position.      He thought that the lowering of the comparative status of the Ministry would have a badpolitical effect on an occasion when the importance of thevarious Ministers was being redefined.The Home Secretary said that he had independentlycome to rather a similar point of view though on more general grounds.      He felt that from a political point of view it wasnot a very good move to say that some Ministers were first class but that another was at a lower level.It was suggested also that the distinction of statusbetween Ministers ran counter to the Prime Minister&apos;s remarksin the House of Commons on 3rd November, 1936, on the incong-ruity of having members of the Cabinet sitting at the same table,in theory all equal but with great variations in salary.The Cabinet were informed that the test taken by theCommittee had been as to whether the Minister of a department was always a member of the Cabinet.      In cases where theMinister of Transport was not a member of the Cabinet, his Be-partment would be the only one outside the Cabinet thatcarried the larger salary.It was pointed out that the First Commissioner ofWorks and the Postmaster-G-ehBral would be on the same plane asthe Minister of Transport and it was suggested that it might bebetter to put all three on the lower footing or to raise the mall to the higher salary.
It was remarked, however, that politicallythe Office of Works and the Post Office were not quitein the same position as the Ministry of Transport who,in every Session of Parliament, had to take somerestrictive action which was subjected to criticism.Prom a Parliamentary point of view, therefore, theMinistry of Transport was perhaps the more important.Another consideration which should weigh   with theCommittee was that new Departments usually went through a probationary period before rising to the higher states.This had applied to the Ministries of Agriculture,Labour and even Scotland where the Secretary of state had only quite recently been promoted to the highersalary.On merits, however, it was agreed that theMinistry of Transport was entitled to rank with the ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries, Education andLabour.Among other suggestions made in the course ofthe discussion there were the following -(l)    That, owing to his responsibilities as chief whip, the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury should have his salary raised,although it was pointed out that this wouldinvolve looking into the position of theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury.(S)   That the position under which three of the lords Commissioners of the Treasury were paid and two were unpaid provided an anomaly and *ought to be re-examined since their responsibilities were similar.(3)   That the salaries of the Financial Secretaryto the Admiralty and the Civil Lord of theAdmiralty, whose duties were similar, oughtto be equalised so long as both offices were retained.The Cabinet took note of these points forconsideration when the Bill was available.
The Cabinet then discussed briefly thequestion as to whether these measures ought to beput In operation as soon as passed by the House ofCommons or whether they should be reserved to come intooperation after the next General Election.The view was strongly pressed that it wouldprobably be more convenient for all political partiesif the Bill were passed and put into operationimmediately so that the subject was completely disposedof before the next General Election.     It was suggested,however, that the Prime Minister should discuss thematter with the Leader of the Opposition and such ofthe more experienced Members of Parliament as he might think fit.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That the status of the Minister and ministry of Transport should beraised to that of the Ministers andMinistries of Education, Agricultureand Fisheries and Labours(b) That the other anomalies referred toin the summary of the discussionrecorded above should be considered when the Bill was before theCabinet.(c) That in the meanwhile the PrimeMinister should consult the leader of the Opposition and such otherMembers of Parliament as he thought desirable as to whether the Billshould become operative as soon asit became law or after the next general Election.
LOAN OPMILITARYSTORES FORTHE USE OFUNEMPLOYEDMARCHERS.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(36), Con-clusion 3.)8,   The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the question of the propriety ofacceding to requests made from time to time by LocalAuthorities for the loan of military stores for theuse of unemployed marchers:-A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor War (CP.-36 (37)) in which he asked,after consultation with the Secretary ofState for Air, the Minister of Health andthe Minister of Labour, for a definiteruling that the Service departments could follow:A Memorandum by the Minister of Health(CP.-35 (37)) giving reasons for hisfirm opinion that it would   be Impoliticto decide that all applications to theService Departments for the loan ofblankets should, as a matter of principle,be refused, and suggesting that eachapplication should be considered on its merits by consultation between theDepartments affected.After a short discussion the cabinet agreed:To approve the proposal of the Ministerof Health as set forth in CP. 35 (37)and summarised above subject to theunderstanding that the Ministry would always do its utmost to ease the position for the War Office.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the[HOLIDAY BILL.Minister of Labour (CP.-34 (37)) directing attention[(previous to the Annual Holiday Bill, introduced by a PrivateReference:Cabinet 73        Member and now awaiting Committee Stage.    The Minister(36), Con-elusion 14.)     felt that the discussions on the present Bill wouldRR not enable the problems raised by the Bill as draftedto be defined or examined in the way their importancerequired.    He therefore suggested an Inquiry by a departmental Committee and an approach to the NationalFederation of Employers1 Organisations and the TradeUnion Congress Beneral Council with a view to securing their co-operation.    The appointment of such a Committeewould not prevent the Bill from being proceeded within Standing Committee, but it would be an important element in its consideration by the House:    it wouldalso provide a reply to the request from the TradeUnion Congress General Council to the Prime minister that the Government should give facilities for the Billto be considered by a Standing Committee of the Houseof Commons.The proposal of the Minister of Labour in cp.   34 (47) summarised above was approved subject torepresentation on the proposed Departmental Committeeof the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.Jebruary, 1937.m
APPENDIX H.TPRIVATE MANUFACTURE OF AND TRADING IN ARMS.(C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1267-B and 1299-B.)The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To accept the conclusions of the Interdepartmental Committee on thefour recommendations of the Royal Commission^ Report referred to above,which are as follows : &quot; (i) Conclusion 1 (Chapter III).The Conclusion of the Royal Commission that limitation of armsby international agreement would remove or minimise the objections tothe private manufacture of and trade in arms is generally agreed with,subject to the substitution of the term &apos; the objections that are alleged to exist &apos; for the word &apos; objections,&apos; but it is pointed out that the timefor pursuing this policy and the question of pursuing it in isolation must depend on wider considerations and the general position as to disarmament.(ii) Conclusion 2 (Chapter IV).This conclusion on the impracticability of the establishment of auniversal system of State monopoly for the manufacture of arms is incomplete accord with the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government as hitherto pursued.(iii) Conclusion 3 (Chapter V).The view that the abolition of the private industry is undesirableis also in accord with the policy of His Majesty!s Government. Asystem of collaboration between the Government and Private industry of the country in the supply of arms and munitions is being pursuedactively in connection with the programmes for reconditioning the forces.(iv) Conclusion 4 (Chapter VI).The acceptance of appointments with armament firms by publicofficials forms part of a problem of wider application, viz., the accep-tance of appointments by officers of the Crown Services on thetermination of their Government Service. We are informed that theTreasury are proposing to make a report to the Prime Minister on thewhole question.&quot;The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed (1) That if the question of international control of the trade in arms,referred to in Conclusion 5 (Chapter VII) of the Royal Commission^Report, was raised in Parliament, the general line to be taken by ministers should be as follows : It should be stated that the proposal of the Royal Commissioncorresponded with the policy hitherto adopted by this country inregard to the international regulation and control of the manufactureof and trade in arms; that we were prepared to take the draft Articlessubmitted by the United States of America to the DisarmamentConference in 1934 as a basis of discussion; that reference should bemade to our difficulties in regard to these draft Articles, and that weshould adhere to our attitude as previously expressed : (2) that we should avoid taking any initiative in this matter at Geneva.Summary of Conclusions by the Committee of Imperial Defence.Extract from C.I.D. !2S7th Draft Minutes.Conclusion (a).Conclusion (b).[14507-2]
2; . Conclusion (c).    , -        tf,The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed 1To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Commission on conclusion 6 (Chapter VIII) of the Royal Commission^ Report, amended as follows : &apos;: The first part of this Conclusion involves the establishment in peace of an executive Minister and Ministry to take over from the three service departments the whole of their work of munitions supply. It is consideredthat the objects of this recommendation are now adequately attained by themachinery provided by the Principal Supply Officers Committee Organisationof the Committee of Imperial Defence, under the chairmanship of theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence, and there is no case on merits forthe radical change suggested in present circumstances.&quot; Nor is it considered that the second part of this recommendation,i.e., that Government manufacturing establishments should be fully equipped for the provision in some measure of armaments of all types, should beadopted. Government manufacture already extends to a wide range ofarmaments in addition to the construction of warships in dockyards, but its extension to armaments of all types is impracticable.&quot;Conclusion (d).The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed- To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Committee on Con-clusion 7 (Chapter IX) of the Royal Commission^ Report which is asfollows : &apos;1 The reply to be given to this recommendation depends in a large measure on the reply to Conclusion 6. The establishment of a central department controlling contracts, together with the measures already announced in the &apos; Statement relating to Defence&apos; (Cmd. 5107), mightdispose of the question of the restriction of profits of armament firms for thetime being, though it is not at all obvious that the centralisation proposedby the Royal Commission would be of the least efficacy in keeping profitsout of &apos; reasonable &apos; bounds.:&apos; If there is to be a central department it is suggested that for thepresent it would be sufficient for His Majesty&apos;s Government in reply to point to the assurances in the White Papers and to the arrangements already madefor controlling prices and co-ordination through the Treasury Inter-service committee and the Contracts Co-ordinating Committee.&quot;Conclusion (e).The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Committee on conclusion 8 (Chapter IX) of the Royal Commission^ Report which reads as follows : &quot;It is recognised that, as in the last War, a much wider measure ofcontrol over industry will be needed in war than in peace, and work has been proceeding for some time on the measures necessary.&quot;Conclusion (/).The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed :  To accept the Conclusion of the Interdepartmental Committee on conclusion 9 (Chapter X) of the Royal Commission^ Report which reads asfollows :  &quot; (i) We are unable to advise acceptance of the proposal that the licensing of arms exports should be governed by an outlookdifferent from, and more positive in character than, that which now prevails; for we believe this recommendation to be based ona misconception of the role of the Arms Export Trade in our system of National Defence.
(ii) It is difficult to see what useful purpose would be served by super-posing the authorisation (by licence) of their exports.(iii) It is already the general practice of His Majesty&apos;s Government to confine the grant of licences for war material to orders by foreign government (with certain strictly limited exceptions), and weconsider that His Majesty&apos;s Government should not requireimport authorisations stating that the goods will not bere-exported unless and until this is provided for in someinternational convention accepted by all other exporting countries.(iv) We recommend that the existing Open General Licences should bemaintained in respect of Smooth-bore shot-guns and ammunition for use therewith.Certain explosives used either in the manufacture of shot-gun cartridges, or for industrial purposes, and fire arms and ammunition covered by a United KingdomFire Arms Certificate, when exported by the holder of the certificate.Bayonets, swords and lances are of insignificant importance fromthe point of view of export, and these goods could without difficulty be made subject to specific licences.As regards civil aircraft, it is felt that the application ofthe Royal Commission^ recommendation would give rise to realhardship such as, in our view, His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldnot, by unilateral action, impose upon civil&quot; flying in this country.As regards military aircraft, we have reached the conclusion thatthe export of these could, without any serious disadvantages, be subjected to the requirement of specific export licences, subject to administrative details being worked out in consultation betweenthe Departments concerned, and we recommend that action shouldbe taken on these lines. Aircraft engines, however, should, weconsider, continue to be subject to Open General Licences.(v) No disadvantages are seen in an extension of the Foreign EnlistmentAct of 1870 to cover aircraft.&quot;Conclusion (g).The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed To accept the Conclusion of the Inter-Departmental Committee on conclusion 10 (Chapter XI) of the Royal Commission^ Report as amended by Mr. Chamberlain, and which is as follows : &quot; On purely Departmental grounds there would seem to be no sufficient reason for abandoning the sale of surplus and second-hand arms and munitions of war to foreign Governments by private agency under proper safeguards, but if for political reasons it is thought desirable to do so, it isnot considered necessary to hold out against that view, provided the rule is not absolute and can be waived in special cases.&quot;Conclusion (h).The Committee of Imperial Defence agreed That the Report of the Inter-Departmental Committee on the Report ofthe Royal Commission on the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms(C.I.D. Paper No. 1299-B) together with these Minutes be submitted to theCabinet by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.
A P P E N D I X    II.Amendment to CP.  39 (37), Enclosure III,proposed to the Cabinet by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs with the approvalof the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence.In the Great War it was found that we ourselves andall our Allies fell into this latter category.      Wecould not manufacture anything like the whole of our needs,but,  thanks to British sea-power, we were able to avertdisaster by purchasing armaments abroad.      Our inquiriesinto our defensive needs do not encourage the expectation that in a future war we can rely on being independent offoreign supplies.      We must therefore be on our guard against increasing the difficulties in making purchasesabroad in time of war which already exist owing tostricter interpretations of neutrality.There was a good deal in common between the proposalsubmitted to the League of Nations by the United Statesand the amendments put forward by this Government, though there were also one or two points of difference inwhich we still prefer our own solution.      While we arenot really convinced of the advisability of pressing forward with any isolated aspect of the disarmamentquestion, we consider that in any event the first thing to be discussed should be the Convention on BudgetaryPublicity.      We are prepared to adopt and apply thisConvention if aJLl the principal Powers in the world agree.If agreement can be reached on this aspect of the questionit would be possible to reconsider the wider aspect ofinternational co-ordination of the control of armsmanufacture and trade.      If, however, progress is notpossible on Budgetary Publicity,  it would serve no useful purpose to reopen the wider question.
