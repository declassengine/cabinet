THE SITUATIONIN SPAIN.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(3 6) , Con-clusion 3.)The Ministers^present met at short notice toconsider a Memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (CP.-6 (37)) in which he reviewed the problem of tne Spanisn civil war in its inter-national bearing, with particular reference to tnequestion of &quot;volunteers&quot;, and submitted proposalswhich ne desired should be made by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment for joint international action to preventfurther aggravation of the conflict.Mr EDEN regretted that he had had to ask forthis Meeting at very short notice in order to discussin a preliminary way the replies from the German andItalian Governments to our suggestions for stopping the sending of volunteers to Spain.    He recalled the events since- the Cabinet had last discussed thesubject.    On Christmas Eve, in view of the number of volunteers pouring into Spain we and the French sent a joint Note to the other Powers mainly concerned,proposing the cessation of the despatch of volunteers.Unfortunately the arrival of fresh bodies of volunte-rsin Spain had continued, so on his return to theForeign Office early in the New Year he had sent atelegram to Berlin and Rome  asking for anansv/er to his Christmas Eve note. Count Ciano&apos;attitude to Sir Eric Drummond had been satisfactory,but since then iniormation had been received that another 5,000 Italians had landed at Cadiz . information v,-hich had not yet become public.    This had happened almost immediately after the signature of theAnglo-Italian Agreement.    He had received no reply yet to his telegram suggesting that no large bodies of volunteers should be allowed to leave.    The situation was becoming very serious, because Germany and italy were both sending more and moie troops, and the
struggle in Spain was To9coining less an internal nationalstruggle than an international war between the Fascistand Bolshevist States.    His advisers felt that if this state of affairs continued, the moderate influences inGermany would be silenced and the Germans would under-take other adventures;    for example, in Czecho-Slovakia,perhaps.    It was also a great difficulty for france to have a Power under German influence on her southernfrontier.    He had come to the conclusion, therefore,that we ought to make one more effort.    Realising theobjections oi the Cabinet to an international blockade,he had put forward the proposals in CP.-6 (37).    Heapologised for the haste with which these proposals had had to be prepared.    At their request he had seen the Leaders of the Labour and Liberal Opposition Parties.Their attitude had been quite reasonable, and their object merely was to represent their anxiety as to theFrancissituation.Sip./ Acland had suggested that if the sending of volunteers to Spain was not checked here and now the Germans would go on to other adventures   ratheron the lines he himself had developed in his Memorandum.Later on he explained that he had not mentioned theproposals in CP.-6 (37) to the Opposition Leaders.The object of the Foreign Office proposals was to avoid a European war.    They thought that if we did not standup to the Dictator Powers now j.t would bring war nearer.In addition, we should lose the support of our friends in Europe if war came.    Though there had been some.vague inter-Departmental discussions    on the subject of possible action, he regretted that he had only beenable to send the plan contained in C.P.-6 (37) to theAdmiralty late that morning.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD suggested that the proposal in cp.-6(37) was not really standing up to the DictatorPowers.    All depended on whether they accepted it ornot.
SIR SAMUEL EDAB?: said that ha would not complainof the short notice when events were moving so quickly,but it would certainly have been easier if a proposalinvolving every kind of Naval issue had been discussedfirst either between the Ministerial Heads of theDepartments or their Staffs.    Some preliminary disc^s-sion, at any rate, would have been desirable.    As a first preliminary observation, we appeared t.; be gettingnear a situation where, as a nation, we were trying to stop General Franco from winning.    That was the desire of the Parliamentary Parties of the Left;   bat therewere others, including perhaps some members of theCabinet, who were very anxious that the Soviet sh ouldnot win in Spain.    It was very important to hold the scales fairly.    He recalled that at the last Meetingof the Cabinet before Christmas the feeling had been opposed to an international blockade.    He thought it possible that the feeling had been even stronger againsta blockade by British forces.    As a second preliminaryobservation he said that the Navy was always preparedto undertake any duty imposed upon it by the Cabinet,as had been shown during the past year, when they hadbeen working under great strain.    He wanted to make clear- that the Navy was always prepared to do its duty.But at the same time it was his duty to inform theCabinet as to what was involved in the decision theywere asked to take:    as to what were the prospects ofsuccess or otherwise;    and as to whether- it was notliable to embroil us with one 01 other of the european powers.There were special dangers inherent in a blockadethan theof the Spanish coast, which was even harder p.. blockade of Germany inthe War.    The Spanish coast was 1,600miles long.    On one side it was open to the Atlantic-3-
There were 16 large ports, but in addition there wereinnumerable small ports and inlets.    Spain lay on great highways of international traffic, and that madea blockade very difficult, since it would be necessaryto visit not only ships bound for Spanish ports butalso ships passing through the great Mediterraneantrade route through the Straits of Gibraltar, whichcould slip into Spanish ports.    The experience of theVvar had shown that a large number of ships were necessary to examine the masses of neutral ships.This would involve the mobilisation of the Home and mediterranean Fleets exclusively for this purpose.A blockade might continue for years.    It meant calling up the feval Reserve.    The whole of our two main Fleetsin the meanwhile would be locked up in this service.Another point was that in modern times blockade had changed.    In present conditions it was very difficultto examine shipping on the high seas.    Merchant ships had large holds, and war experience showed that in orderto check the contents it was necessary to take out thewhole cargo.    This involved taking the ship into portto examine it, unless it was possible to arrange forthe examination of the cargo in neutral ports beforethe ship was loaded.    He referred to the experience ofthe S.S.  TKURSTON, which had been held at Malta.  the cargo had actually been unloaded and examined.    Never-theless the examiners had failed to discover warmaterial in the cargo which had afterwards been landed at Barcelona.    If the Insurgents and the SpanishGovernment did not agree to co-operate we should notbe able to take the ships into Spanish ports, and theywould have to be exaiuined at Gibraltar or in French ports.    On the Atlantic coast of Spain the Naval Staffadvised that it would be impossible to examine shipson the high seas in winter.    It had been trieu in the
V.ar and special personnel had been brought from newfoundland for the purpose, but eventually thepractice had fallen into desuetude.    The plan wouldrequire the full co-operation of France on the landfrontier   and he observed that there was perhaps atendency to under-rate the numbers of volunteers sentto Spain by France.    It would be indispensable also toobtain the co-operation of the United States of America,Japan and Mexico.    Suppose we had secured the co-operationof these Powers and undertook the duty proposed in cp.-6 (37) and that - e were assured of co-operation on the French frontier, the question arose as to whether we could make the blockade a success.    As a matter of fact no blockade was ever quite watertight   not evenalter all the expeiience gained between 1914 and 1918.If in this case the scheme did not prove reasonablywatertight we should be in an unenviable posl tisn, for there would be leakages of all kinds into Spain.    Therewould then be grave danger of misunderstanding and risks of embroilment with other Powers.    He could developthese difficulties in much greater detail, but he had said sufficient to show why he had reached the conclusionthat it would be better to base ourselves on theexperience of the war and to begin the blockade at the ports of embarkation.    In the War we had undertaken the inspection of cargoes at ports in the United States andin Scandinavia, with the co-operation of the governments in each case.    He thought the best plan, therefore,would be to induce the non-inte:vention Powers to take all steps to stop the shipment of war material and theleaving of volunteers, and, in addition, in order togive confidence to other countries, to allow a Consular
inspection at the ports oi embarkation.    It Germany,Italy and Russia rere prepared to make non-interventioneffective, that would be the best way both to carryout the plan and to remove the suspicions of theirbOna-fides.      It would also avoid the tremendous burden which the plan in CP.-6 (37) would place on the Fleet&apos;in carrying out an enterprise of doubtful success which was liable to embroil us with other Powers.    Hesuggested, therefore, that he and the Foreign Secretary,or else their advisers, should work out an alternative plan on these lines.
SIR JOHN SIMON said that the First Lord&apos;scheme would not he so effective as regardsvolunteers as in respect of war material.SIR SAMUEL HOARE pointed out that it wouldgive publicity to any evasions.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that if the powers were determined to carry out intervention, machineryof this kind was redundant.      The moment this countryundertook the responsibility, it would be liable toput us into difficulties.LORD HALIFAX pointed out that the difficulty was that the groups of countries did not trust eachotherp e.g. Germany and Italy were apparently onlyprepared to stop their intervention if they were convinced that Russia had stopped it.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said he had the impressionfrom the German and Italian Notes that their object was, while appearing to accept, to impose suchdifficult conditions as to make realisation impossible,LORD HALIFAX said he had a differentimpression.SIR JOHN SIMON said they might have their&quot;tongues in their cheeks&quot;to the extent that they thought the conditions could not be fulfilled.    That difficulty,however, would be met if we could submit a plan whichwould ensure that the arrangement was being observed.One difficulty, however, was that one of the replieshad suggested that all the volunteers now in Spainshould be brought out.     Neither plan provided forthat.LORD HALIFAX pointed out that this was nota condition.       It was rather a statement of what
was necessary for an ideal plan.SIR JOHN SIMON asked whether the foreign secretary considered his plan had any prospect of&quot;being accepted?     Or was it merely a gesture?     Didhe think nations like Germany and Italy would welcome a plan under which the British Navy was allowed to stop their ships and examine them?MR. EDEN said it depended on what lay&quot;behind the answers of these Powers.     He had nevercontemplated the possibility of being able to carryout an effective blockade.     Everything depended onthe goodwill of all the Powers.     He only   .contemplated some kind of watch on non-intervention.Some time ago the French Government had agreed to close their frontier, but from Italy and germany the troops had arrived in great numbers on boardlarge ships and their arrival had been reported by our representatives.      The Non-intervention committee had drawn up a list of 19 principalatharbours in Spain and/most of these there were already British ships.     Admittedly, there were also many small harbours, but these had nodisembarkation facilities and could not be used ona large scale.     No doubt, if the other Fowors were acting in bad faith, they might evade a blockadebut, in that case, we should have to report it tothe Powers.LORD HALIFAX asked whether, apart fromthe First Lord&apos;s objections to the plan, it was amatter of convenience or of principle to leave outother nations from co-operation in the blockade.Why should we not suggest that all the Powers should
blockade, but, if they did not care to co-operate, wewere prepared to do it ourselves.SIR KINGSLSY WOOD and LORD STANHOPE bothsuggested that a British blockade was the worstcourse.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said he did not like t*undertake a blockade that might prove ineffective.MR. DUPE COOPER asked what were the objectives of the Foreign secretary proposals.They appeared to be four in number.The first objective was to shorten the warin Spain,     He was not sure that this plan would have that effect and, at the best, it would only shortenit by a few months and he did not think that this objective was worth the risks.     Many people in thiscountry did not want us to be too active in thematter.The second objective was to prevent theCivil War in Spain becoming a European war.     Hethought that the plan would rather increase the dangerof this, owing to the risk of incidents with Italy and russia.The third abjective was, if he understood itaright, that General Franco should not win the war.The plan proposed was one was of bringing this tahoutbut he doubted if it was a very good way and he thoughtthat if that was really our objective, there were moreiteffective means of bringing/about.     At any rate, this objective could not be mentioned in public.The fourth objective was to make a demonstration to satisfy public opinion in thiscountry.      If the plan was sent to the other Powers,we should certainly not get an answer for a month atleast.     Perhaps there was no harm in that.     But this last objective would hardly be achieved.- 9 -
He asked if it was true, as stated in. the evening papers, that Herr Hitler was pouring troops into Morocco and summoning the Reichstag.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that according to aNote, which he understood came from the GeneralStaff, the numbers of Germans in Spain had &quot;been greatly exaggerated.      There were apparently5,000 Germans and 15,000 French and 15,000 Italians.MR. EDEN   said that the Foreign Officeinformation was that the number of Germans was much larger.     In reply to a question, he said that theItalians were anxious that General Franco shouldwin.     The danger to Europe did not arise from what happened at sea.      If Germany and Italy were notchecked in their Spanish ambitions, we might arriveat a situation in which those two countries would,in effect, conquer Spain,     He understood that theCommintern had already stopped sending volunteers to Spain for the reason that they realised that theGermans and Italians could send more men than they.The personnel that had reached Spain from France,as indeed from this country in much smallernumbers, was very poor in quality.      If Madrid was captured &quot;by the Insurgents, there would he a greatdeal of complaint in this country,SIR KINGSLEY WOOD pointed out that many people in this country would he equally troubledif the Bolshevists achieved a victory.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that when hefirst began to read the Memorandum, he got theimpression that the object was to stop theDictators,     What he actually found however, as
mhe read on was a new proposal which would take a very-long time to put into action.     At the moment of putting forward that proposal, we should not be in a very strong position.      For the German Government (net very strongly) and the Italian Government (quite definitely)had stated from the outset that if intervention was tobe stopped, it was necessary to stop money,propaganda and volunteers.     They had repeated thisthree or four times.     Indeed, in their finalacceptance of Slst August, the Italian Government had made clear that it interpreted this indirect inter-ference&quot;in the sense that public subscriptions andenrolment- of volunteers for either party in conflictare not permissible in countries adhering to theagreement11    (Rome telegram No.566, 21st August),The withdrawal of the volunteers already in Spain hadnot been made a condition,     wasn&apos;t&apos;t it more likely that we should get the consent of the German andItalian Governments by adopting their proposal to stopsending volunteers rather than by putting forward-a new and elaborate scheme?SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought that in August,as now, the object of the German and Italian governments had been to make difficulties.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said that the scheme in cp. 6 (37) - which as a matter of fact was full ofholes- would be very difficult to get accepted and itwould, therefore, be better to get the German andItalian Governments to work on the basis of their ownplan.     He was not particularly optimistic about their plan, but it was better as a starting point thanplans before the Cabinet,
LORD HALIFAX said that the difficulty wasthat the Powers did not trust each other.SIR THOMAS INSKIP agreed, hut suggested thatheginning cn their plan of stopping the volunteers we might build up subsequently to some form of checkas suggested by the First Lord of the Admiralty.If the plan in CP. 6 (37) were put forward, it wouldinvolve much delay (Sir Kingsley Wood added &quot;and much resentment&quot;);    and meanwhile the volunteers would continue to pour into Spain.     Referring to the planitself, he pointed out the difficulty that there wasno one in existence who could give the shipsauthority for their action;      there was no internationalprize court procedure available;     and there was noarrangement for paying compensation.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought the object of theGerman and Italian Governments was to give general franco another month and see how he fared.LORD STANHOPE thought that the variousnations were much more inclined to come to agreementthan they had been in the past.     The situation was,to a certain extent, one *f stalemate anddisillusion.     Both sides probably would be glad tofind a way out.     He did not think the plan in cp. 6 (37) did provide a way out and it involved ourtaking the main burden of responsibility.     He did not like the role of this country of unpaid policeman forthe world.     Why should we not ask them for their proposals?THE PRIME MINISTER thought that the above waea good appreciation of the attitude of the other Powers.SIR SAMUEL HOARE thought it was necessary inany plan to begin at the ports of embarkation and then to get inspection added if we could.
ilR XINGoLEY &apos;70OD asked why we should not accept the offer of the other Governments to stop sendingvolunteers,  adding that the Non-intervention Committeewas not a very effective body ror working out a plan andinviting a Conference in London of the Principalsthemselves.SIR SAMUEL HOARE thought it was necessary toget a basis of agreement before a meeting was held.SIR JOHN SIMON suggested that it would be avery strong order to propose the plan in CP. 6 (37).Someone had to decide whether a man was a volunteeror not and whether a cargo was war material or not.In the event of actual war these matters were decided by a Prize Court.    Plow could you ask foreign governments to accept the position that the British Navy should become not only a policeman but.a judge?LORD HALIFAX suggested that we might ask the French and Italian Governments ts give their ideasas to how Non-Intervention was to be made effective.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said these governments might not be able to stop every single man, but ifthey decided on non-intervention they certainly   wouldnot allow large consignments of men to proceed to Spain.LORD HALIFAX suggested they should be askedto stop sending volunteers and that in the meanwhile the First Lord and the Foreign Secretary should consult as to the working out of a plan on the lines suggested by Sir Samuel hoare.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the difficultiesof a naval blockade were very great.MR. EDEN said he had already asked theGovernments concerned not to send any more volunteers and it was rather difficult to repeat that request.
He urged on his colleagues the dangers that would arise if the situation were allowed to drift.SIR THOMAS INSKIP thought that to take the notes at their face value would afford a better prospectof success than the olan in CP.  6 (37).SIR JOHN SIMON said there could be no questionof reaching a decision that day.    Would it not beoossible? however, to reply on some such lines asthe foilowing&quot;We agree that volunteers should be stoooed.It might have been better to secure the effective stopoing of volunteers earlier.Let us all do it now.    We will legislate atonce.    Will 7/ou?   If we were all    to take steps to stop our own volunteers and to publish any information as to breaches wecould consider whether any supervision by international agreement is necessary.Would they not legislate provisionally?&quot;MR. MORRISON said that earlier he had hadthree weeks experience of the Non-intervention Committee.The difficulty was that the members were notolenipotentcaries and every question had to be referred by them to their Governments.    He thought that someby Governments &quot;themselvesother method should be considered/e. g.  some system ofcontrol on the lines suggested by the First Lord.MR. EDEN answering questions as to the allegedGermans in Morocco said that the French ambassador had given him an alarming report on the previous evening.    He himself had called for reports from our own representatives in Morocco but these had notyet arrived.    S^ far they have not reported anythingvery alarming.SIR SAMUEL HOARE suggested that the first stepwas to find out at the Capitals what they intendedwhen they asked for effective control.
MR.  EDEN said that the Non-intervention Committeehad drawn up a scheme, though he could not recall thedetails.    The scheme defended on the co-operation of&quot;both parties in Suain and they had not .yet replieddefinitely.SIR THOMAS INSKIP painted out that volunteerswere not provided for in this scheme.MR. EDEN said that the German and italian governments had refused inspection in their own countries.MR. MORRISON suggested we should ask what wasmeant by effective control.SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that our repliesshould be to the effect that we all agreed on theprincioles.    Let us now get together and devise ascheme.MR.. MORRISON pointed out that we were the onlynation whtfse honesty had not been &quot;blown upon&quot; in thismatter.    Eor that reason we really were in a positionto ask what scheme of control would satisfy the other powers.    We were the only nation  fitted; to act as thehonesir broker.SIR THOMAS INSKIP said he would add &quot;Let usget together on the subject&quot;.MR. EDEN in reply to the Prime Minister saidhis only objection to this was that it would involve further delay.MR. MORRISON said he was very apprehensive ofour undertaking an ineffective blockade, especially owinguseto its reaction on our future /of this weapon.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD thought it possible that theGermans and Italians might be anxious to get out oftheir embarrassments.    If so a proposal for a meeting would test their bona fides.
MR. jiiDBN thought that  oossibly the Italian attitude was rrwre favourable than that of Germany,SIP. 3A?fJEL .T&apos;.OARS thought it very dangerous to nutup any scheme to an international body unless we felt thatit would be effective and we were prepared to see it through.THE PRIME MINISTER said he saw the Foreign Secretary&apos;difficulties but if he was worried at the stream of volunteers he could remember that there was nothing hecould do which would stop it immediately.    We should losens time by talcing the German and Italian documents attheir face value and trying to agree on some method fornaming non-intervention effective.    He thought, however,that the difficulties of a naval blockade were insuperable.MR. hDEN said he had been wondering whether it was worth while to get the principals together in a FivePower Conference.    Such a Conference would have to includeFrance, Germany,  Italy,  Portugal and Russia.SIR JOHN SIMON asked if it was not possible to formulate what was common through all the different renlies.None of the replies had said &quot;No&quot;.    They had all said theywere willing to stop sending volunteers if all othercountries do the same.    irfes it not possible to answer,even Publicly,  saying that we were prepared to take stepsourselves to stop volunteers and to join the other Powersto take stens to make it effective, adding that thematter would be better discussed between principals thanon the Committee of Non-intervention.MR. EDEN said there was much to be said for that course.    The difficulty was dates.    The Council of theLeague, for example, was meeting the week after next.He thought it would be necessary, therefore, to get themeeting next week.SIR SAMUEL HOARE said it was dangerous to get ameeting without knowing what was in the minds of thedifferent powers.
Mr EDEN said that they would merely reply that itshould be referred to the Non-intervention Committee.He would like to examine the whole matter in theForeign Office and possibly obtain the opinion of theforeign Ambassadors.SIR KINGSLEY WOOD said that there was much to bssaid for as early a reply as possible.Mr EDEN agreed.SIR JOHN SIMON thought that the great thing was toget an answer out.    People knew that the German andItalian replies had been received.    Parliament was meeting in ten days&apos; time.    Would it not be better, inthese circumstances, to send an answer at once-s--SIR THOMAS INSKIP suggested that we should say thatthewe had always known that/Germans and Italians werekeen on the stopping oi volunteers.    Now all were agreeaon this subject.Mr ED^N said that in the meanwhile he would liketo work out a scheme with the Admiralty.    He thoughtit would be possible to do all this by Saturday morning.Ministers agreed  (a) That those present, for whom it wouldbe possible, should meet again at noon on the following day, Saturday, January9th, at 10 Downing Street:(b) That in the meanwhile the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should consider the various proposals madeat the Meeting and prepare for theconsideration of his colleagues adraft Despatch to the Governmentsprincipally concerned in non-interventionaccepting the principle that no further-volunteers should be sent to spain and,   if he thought desirable, invitingthem to send responsible representatives-to a. Conference in London next week:
(c) That the Admiralty and Foreign office should work out a plan for renderingnon-intervention as effective aspossible in order that, in the eventof a Conference taking place, PisMajesty1s Government should havepractical proposals to put forward.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,January 8,  1937.
