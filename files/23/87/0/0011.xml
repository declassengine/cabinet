SITUATIONjtf SPAIN.jjie Non-InterventionComiittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(37), Con-conclusion 2. )F.R.IO(?7)i1.    Tne Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the Portuguese Governmenthad now agreed to a scheme under which the applicationto the Spanish-Portuguese frontier of the arrangementsconcerted by the Non-intervention Committee would be watched by British agents.    Consequently no scheme forPortugal involving the use of Naval forces would berequired.    The only remaining difficulty was that theRussian Soviet representative had objected to the somewhat stormy sector of the Spanish coast that hadbeen assigned to the Russian Navy.
..ZSSWIA.iiepresenta-don of at the coronation.Italian Ob-jectiohs.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(36), Con-clusion 8. )2. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,in reply to a question, said that the rule in regardto State invitations to representatives of foreign nations was to issue theiu to all countries represented at the Court of St.  james.    As Abyssinia was stillrepresented by a Minister, the invitation to the coronation had been issued in accordance with this rule.    This procedure had been followed in connectionwith the King&apos;s ijevee, and no difficulty had been madeby the Italian Ambassador.    There were numbers ofprecedents where the same procedure had been followed.The Italian Government had as yet made no representa-tions in connection with the invitation to the Corona-tion, but the Italian press had raised objections.He had sent a telegram on the previous day to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Rome explaining the situation,and he intended to see the Italian Ambassador in London.At the time of issuing the invitation to the AbyssinianMinister he had considered whether an explanation oughtto have been offered simultaneously at Rome.    Since,however, no objection had been made in the case of theLevee, such explanation had appeared unnecessary and liable even to stimulate controversy.
RESERVES OPPOOD and feeding-STUFFS.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 75(36), Con-elusion 7.)-  if (yf) Z.5. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-68(37)) submitting for their consideration the followinginterim recommendations of the Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on Reserves of food and Feeding-Stuffs:-&quot;(l) That the polio of food storage shouldbe approved in principle by the adoptionof Plan II (&quot;Minimum Plan for UnitedKingdom&apos; - see Appendix to Memorandum)at a capital cost not to exceed  25million.(2) That the President of the Board of trade should be asked to prepare a draft Billenabling the Government to proceed witha storage policy, the Bill to be insufficiently wide terms to cover allanticipated requirements.(3) That the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should be authorised to make anannouncement in the House of Commons atan early date to the effect that theGovernment have decided on a policy offood storage, and that legislation onthe subject will in due course be sub-mitted;    the terms of this announcement to be drafted in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the FirstLord of the Admiralty, the President ofthe Board oi Trade, the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries. &quot;In the course of a discussion the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said he regarded the policy of foodreserves with some suspicion and misgiving.    The objectof the proposals now before the Cabinet was not toprovide for the contingency of an interruption of our food supplies but to tide over the difficulties ot atemporary dislocation.    He wondered how far the navy and Royal Air Force could ensure us against that.This was not an attempt at a final plan, but only a method of insurance, and a first step.    It was, ofcourse, desirable to be as safe as possible, but thiswas very expensive and involved the risk of gravelosses.    To spend some  25,000,000 on food stocks itself
involved grave risks, and it was liable to put upthe price of foodstuffs unless very skilfully handled.The turnover of these large stocks also involved risks to the Government.    The financing would give him sometrouble.    The market was aware that much paper wouldbe coming forward in connection with the Tithearrangement, and that more paper might be coming forward in connection with mineral royalties.    If itwas realised that food storage was also in the offingthis would increase the difficulties.    However, theCommittee had gone carefully into these matters, andhe did not necessarily wish to veto the proposal.it if the Cabinet accepted/, however, he would ask forthe following conditions:-(l) That every effort should be made tocarry out the various transactions  storage, turnover, avoidance ofwaste, and so forth   through thetrade, using trade experts to theutmost:(2) The limit of expenditure should be 20,000,000 rather than  25,000,000:possibly, for example, the expenditureof nearly  9,000,000 on whale&quot; oil and oil seeds might be curtailed:(3) The expenditure should be spread overas long a period as possible, and not too much should be spent in any oneyear:(4) Mot more than  5,000,000 should be spent in the current year.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, after explaining that the balanced schemes submitted bySir Ernest Gowers had happened to cost  25,000,000,said that he was willing to accept the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer&apos;s conditions.    He doubted, however,whether the Government could defend in Parliament adecision not to store food.    He did not dissent fromthe view of the Chancellor of the Exchequer end someof his colleagues that the importance of food storagewas sometimes over-rated, but theie was no doubt that
public opinion was a good deal concerned.The Home Secretary pointed out that the question would be a difficult one to handle in Parliament.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had rightlydrawn attention to the importance of secrecy, but everydetail that appeared in the Bill would be closelyscrutinised, and the Financial Resolution would be particularly hard to draw without an undesirabledisclosure of details.The President of the Board of Trade said that aBill was unavoidable if the policy was to be carriedout.A suggestion was discussed as to whether perhaps the expenditure on food stocks night not be divided between the three Service Departments, so as to avoidlegislation, but the Cabinet were informed that noDepartment was authorised to lay down stocks of food.The Secretary of State for Air laid great emphasis on the importance of making all purchases through thetrade.    The Government Departments had close contacts with the best representatives of the trade, and at thetime of the General Strike (when he had been Presidentof the Board of Trade) the trade held the market forthe Government in spite of opportunities to sell largequantities at heavy profit and   upset the market.He pointed out that if the Government did not work closely with the trade the latter night reduce their stocks par! passu with the building up of government stocks.The President of the Board of Trade and theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence said that ithad always been contemplated that co-operation withthe trade was an essential feature in the plan.As the discussion continued it became clear that before taking a final decision the Cabinet would wish
to have before them the text of the Bill, some ideaof the Parliamentary procedure and further details asto how the scheme would be operated, in order toprovide safeguards against exploitation.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence asked that he might have approval for the discussion of thescheme with responsible people.The Prime Minister said this could be agreed to.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointedout that the proposals before the Cabinet contained no provision ior stocks of feeding-stuffs for livestock.This was serious, because a large percentage of ourfats came from the Baltic, and 90 per cent, of these supplies might be cut off in time of war.    He believedthat if an announcement was made in favour of foodstorage without some simultaneous proposal for increasing the fertility of the soil the policy wouldbe very unpopular.    He asked for authority to appoint a Committee.Without taking any decision on the principle ofbuilding up a food reserve, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, with a view to consideration ofthe Parliamentary aspects of the pro-posal for a reserve of foodstuffs,thePresident of the Board of Trade should prepare and circulate a Bill:(b) That the draftsman of the Bill shouldbe asked to consider particularly the safeguards to be inserted in the Billto provide against the reduction ofthe normal stocks held by tradersSari passu with the creation of theoveinment stocks:(c) That the minister foi Co-ordination ofDefence and the President of the Boardof Trade should have authority to permitdiscussion of details with responsiblepersons outside- the Government:(d) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should be authorised to setup an Inter-Departmental Committee,composed of repiesentatives of -The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries,The Scottish Office,The Treasury, -
to make definite proposals for increasing the productivity of ourown soil with a view to ensuringincreased food production in timeof war.

The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-66 (37)) circu-lating a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines onthe proposal for financial assistance for the CoalConsultativeExport Trade put to him by the Joint Standing^Com-mittee for the Coal Industry.    In present circumstances the Secretary for Mines was unable to recommend its adoption, and the President of the Board of Tradesuggested that a decision should be taken not toadopt the proposal, with the reservation that theChancellor of the Exchequer and himself might raisethe natter again should the Joint consultative committee, whom they were prepared to meet, showreasons which made it desirable to do so.The President of the Board of Trade gave theCabinet figures to show that quite recently therehad been a sensational rise in the prices realised forexport coal.    This confirmed the viev; he had expressedin his Memo rand um CP.-66 (37).The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of trade should be authorised to reject theproposal of the Joint Standing Consult-ative Coiumittee for the Coal industry for financial assistance for thecoal export trade.

He had to warn the Cabinet, however, that if legislation were passed enabling foreign subjects to sue the Crownhere for the torts of its servants, it would beimpossible to withhold the same right from Britishsubjects.    There would then be an immense number of claims by anyone who had a grievance against theExecutive, and a very serious situation would arise.Claims could not be confined to shipping, and theywould extend over a vast range of subjects.    In view,however, of the Opinion of the Law Officers set forth in paragraph (14) of the Memorandum-attached to

At the end of(Previous the Report the Committee summarised their conclusionsReference:Cabinet 62 and recommendations as follows:-(36), Con-elusion 14.; (i) We recommend the acceptance of the.   v  , general conclusions and recommenda-HK. &quot;3^(3^ j 1 b. tions of the McGowan Report,  of whichthe essential features are:-(a) a substantial reduction in thepresent number of electricitydistribution undertakings bythe retention of the larger andmore efficient of the existingundertakings, whether localauthority or company, and the absorption by such undertakings of the smaller or less efficientundertakings;(b) legislation conferring definite and adequate compulsory powers isessential;    any attempt to carry through a scheme of reorganisationon a voluntary basis is bound to fail;(c) the schemes of reorganisation should provide for the possibility of ultimate public ownership of allundertakings, including those notat present subject to purchase bythe local authorities,(ii) If our conclusions are approved inprinciple, we recommend the issue atan early date of a statement of Govern-ment policy, in the form of a white paper.(iii) We recommend that authority be givenfor the preparation of a Bill basedon the recommendations of the McGowanReport.    The Bill should be passed into law during the 1937-38 Session.(iv) We agree with the McGowan Committeethat the general reorganisation of theelectricity distribution industry on a regional basis under public control could not at the present time bejustified.
In the course of the discussion doubts were expressed as to whether the procedure proposed by theCabinet Committee was the one best suited to meet thesituation.      The whole subject was very controversial and it was suggested that instead of issuing a white paper, it might be better to prepare a draft Bill and,without publishing it, to discuss it with the interestsprincipally concerned before the Government were committed to the proposals of the McGowan Report.Experience had shown that the opposition of critics,particularly in the case of Local Authorities, couldoften be mitigated by this procedure and localised.After discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) That the Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to make an announcementof policy in which agreement should be expressed in principle with theReport of the McGowan Committee,subject to certain modifications of detail, viz. those recommended by theCabinet Committee and  quoted above.      He should intimate that theGovernment propose to legislate at alater date and that in the meanwhile the; matter would be discussed withthe interests concerned:(b) That the Minister of Transport should draw up the proposed announcement inconsultation ?/ith the Lord Privy Seal,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinisters principally concerned:(Note:    The Secretary of State forScotland asked that he might beincluded among the latter.)(c) That the Minister of Transport shouldbe authorised to prepare a Bill basedon the recommendations of the McGowanReport for use in consultation withthe parties interested but not for present publication.

In accordance with the Conclusion, mentionedin the margin the Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(CP.-58 (37)) covering the following documents:-A Most Secret Report by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee (CO.S.-551)on the Preparedness for War of GreatBritain in relation to certain other powers by May, 1937.      The conclusions as summarised by the Sub-Committeeare attached as Appendix I to these minutes:r.fi.U-LC*7)lO.A Most Secret Memorandum by the air raid Precautions Department of theHome Office  (CCS.-540) on thePosition of Air Raid Precautionsby the Spring of 1937.      The conclu-sions reached by the Air Raid Precau-tions Department are attached as appendix II to these Minutes.Comment was directed mainly to the very largeadvantage in long-range bombers which Germany would have over this country in May, 1937 (C.o.S.551, Appendix III),and considerable discussion took place on this point.The Secretary of State for Air asked theCabinet not to draw the conclusion from this report thatthe Air Force Programme was not being carried out.    Theobject of the Programme in the first period was tocreate an establishment in first-line strength which wasthe utmost that could be accomplished, leaving the reserves to be completed in 1938 and 1939.      The Reportassumed that the decisions of the Cabinet and theSub-Committee on Defence Policy and Requirements wouldin practice be reversed by transferring.back half thefirst-line strength to Reserve, a decision which he didnot believe any Government would, in fact, adopt.      TheReport before the Cabinet did not, of course, take intoaccount the increased output that would begin to berealised In the course of the present year.      It alsooverlooked the fact that operating from French territory,short-range bombers could be quite effective againstimportant German objectives.     It also made no referenceto the effect of fighters, and the new experiments orto the difficulties hitherto emphasised by the Air Staffof efficiently training and operating new formations.
The First Lord of the Admiralty drew attentionto the view expressed &quot;by the Chiefs of Staff on page 6,paragraph 20, of their Memorandum to the effect that froma purely military point of view,  the value of Russianintervention was doubtful, especially if it was likelyto be accompanied by Japanese hostility:    also that unlessPoland in particular was an ally, the development of anything approaching Russia&apos;s full strength againstGermany was a matter of great difficulty.The Secretary of State for War referring topage 18, paragraph 23, reported that according to later information the Germans were going ahead rather faster than was indicated in this Report and that corps and army troops were now equipped and ready and that therearmouredwas evidence of further    /    Divisions in course of preparation.The Secretary of State for Air said that theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the morrow would be considering a paper about the Italian aircraft industry which showed that the reserves and industrial positionof Italy for aircraft production were not good.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsconsidered that the value of the Report was well worth the work involved in its preparation.The Cabinet took note of the Report by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee CCS. 551 attached to cp. 58 (37).

The Memorandum stated that itF/?./o/37)s.would be necessary for the Minister to announce theattitude of the Government towards the Bill, and inview of the strong agitation in its favour conducted by various humanitarian Societies   which in hisopinion was largely based on nisconception   he brought the facts to the notice of the Cabinet.    Inspite of the likelihood that the Second Reading wouldbe carried, he considered that the Government shouldnot support the Bill and that he should be authorisedto take this line in the Debate.    There was an amend-ment on the paper to remit the Bill to a SelectCommittee:, and, seeing that the last inquiry tookplace twelve years ago, he would propose to advocatesuch a course if the trend of the Debate rendered itdesirable.The Chanc0llor of the Exchequer expressed?some apprehension as to the desirability of opposesthe Bill.     Whatever the merits, sentiment on thissubject was so strong that it would not listen toreason.      Was there not something to be said for an inquiry?.   The Minister of Agriculture and fisheries said that^he had discussed the Bill with the promoters and^-had reached some kind of agreement,although it remained a bad Bill.

They would not go in State, but woulddrive there in a motor car and would be in morningdress.      The Service would be in the nature of aThanksgiving Service for the Coronation,  although he believed it would not be so described.     As it wasEmpire Day there would also be an Empire element.A Dominion Prime Minister would probably be asced to read one of the Lessonso      He had been asked toascertain whether the Cabinet would attend.      Asauthorities at St. PaulTs Cathedral were anxious toget on with their arrangements an early answer was required.     He asked the views of the Lord Presidentof the Council.The Lord President of the Council said thathe had only just heard of the proposal.The Cabinet agreed:To postpone consideration of theproposal until their next regular weekly meeting.

The Prime Minister asked his colleagues, inSgagements.*__ future to notify the /T-rc anuyg^cf any non-political speaking engagementswhich they might make,  as incenvenience was likely to arise owing to the fact   uf    two Ministers &quot;being present in some locality, one fulfilling a politicaland the other a nan-political engagement.

APPENDIX     I.THE PREPAREDNESS FOR WAR OF GREAT BRITAIN INRMgTIUFTg CERTaiNTjTHHIR POTvmsHBTl&amp;iy,1 1357.5? SECRET. ---SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS REACHED BY THE(i) Great Britain, France and Belgiurii would &quot;be much stronger at sea than Germany and Italy, and wouldbe able to exercise considerable economic pressure.Neither Germany nor Italy is likely to be in a strongfinancial or economic position, and the allied pressure would probably reduce them both to a very weak condi-tion in the course of a long war.    It is thereforeunlikely that Germany or Italy, either singlyo r inconjunction, would embark on war unless they believedthat they could achieve victory quickly.(ii) The German Army will not have either the numbers,equipment or training to justify a belief that she could overrun France quickly.    Even with the co-operation of Italy on the Franco-Italian frontiershe would not be justified in anticipating a rapiddecisive success on land.(iii) There is at present no definite evidence of a prepon-deranee in German military circles of the view thatsuccess can be gained solely by the exercise of airpower.    Nevertheless, if internal difficulties shouldforce her leaders to consider war as the only alterna-tive to loss of prestige, they night decide to gambleupon the effect of air&quot;attack.    The scale of her attack in 1937 would be considerably lower than that of which she may be capable in 1939, but, on the other hand,she is probably aware of our heavy deficiencies in modern bomber- aircraft and the backward state of our air defence measures of all kinds.(iv) The intervention of the U.S.S.R.., while Poland and czechoslovakia remained neutral, would confer littleimmediate benefit on the Allies&apos; cause.    If Germanyand Italy believed themselves justified in countingupon a quick decisive success against France or GreatBritain the fear of Soviet intervention would not therefore necessarily deter them from war.(v) Although Italy might consider that alliance in warwith Germany against Great Britain would give her greatopportunities in the Mediterranean, particularLy ifJapan too were on her side, she would realise thatthe retention of any conquests she night make would depend on the ultimate result of the war. She wouldnot, therefore., be likely to go to war on prospects of ephemeral success, but would be governed by herjudgment as to the ultimate results.
APPENDIX      II.MOST SECRET -THE POSITION OF AIR RAID PRECAUTIONS BYTHE&quot; SPkllMG- OF 1957.-21Conclusions reached by the Air RaidPrecautions Department of the HomeOffice.The degree of preparedness in Air Raid PrecautionsServices in the Spring of 1937 must depend, verylargely in the first instance, on the availability ofinstructors in anti-gas measures and the reaction ofthe public in providing volunteer personnel for thevarious services required.    The general public, however,know very little about air raid precautions, and the conflicting reports often read in the press as to whatis really being done must tend to confuse their mindsand militate against their co-operation with localauthorities.    As stated previously in this report, amore general appeal to the mass of the people would tend to improve matters in this respect.In other directions, it can be stated that by the spring of 1937, limited precautions could be put intoeffect throughout the country, and, if they achievelittle else, they should be the means of allayinggeneral panic, but no guarantee can be given that the life of the community and the business of governmentwill not be disorganised.    There is a great deal of ground to be covered and much to be achieved before any real degree of preparedness can be attained, andthis latter could not possibly be guaranteed withinthe next six months.Despite the dangers of fire, a more reassuringpicture could   be painted if the use of gas as a weaponof war came to be eliminated.    The least of risks towhich the civilian population would be exposed ifproperly protected, it becomes nevertheless the mostcostly and most difficult to legislate for in a shortspace of time.    This is due, as stated previously,to problems of training, and to unavoidable delay inthe provision of equipment.There is one final point to which reference mustbe made.    Apart from certain equipment which will besupplied beforehand, the basis of the majority of air raid Precautions is that of organisation.    Materialpreparations can only be made where there is a threat of an emergency, and although the degree of considera-tion varies almost everywhere, there&quot;are probably fewlocal authorities in the United Kingdom who have notsensibly progressed in working out their plans.
