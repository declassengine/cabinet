THE SITUATIONIN SPAIN.(previous reference:Cabinet 51.(The Right Hon. The Earl of Plymouth,Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState, Foreign Office, as Chairmanof the International Non-intervention committee, was present for this item.)(37), Con-clusion 7,)At the request of the Lord Privy Seal, who wasacting temporarily for the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState, Foreign Office, said that the principal powers concerned, with the exception of Portugal, had replied to the questionnaire that we had put to them.    no official final reply had yet been received fromPortugal, but it was clear that the Government ofthat country was not prepared to permit the presenceof foreign officials on her land frontiers.      In that event the only possibility of providing the assurances that some Powers required was by extending the Navalsupervision to Portuguese ports.    That would involve an addition of 400 miles to the Naval patrols.The natter might come to a head that afternoon as theFrench were very anxious to have it cleared up, andhe therefore wanted to know whether he could agree toexamine the proposed extension.    He had discussed thenatter with the Portuguese Ambassador, who had seemedto think that it might be easier for his Governmentto accept under duress an international scheme whichthey could not prevent, than to agree to the proposals affecting the land frontier.    It was also possiblethat Portugal, who had not joined the InternationalNon-intervention Committee willingly, might withdraw from membership.Some doubts were raised as to the feasibility of operating the proposed extension of the-Naval patrolsin the face of a hostile and unwilling Portugal.
Difficulties, for example, would arise in the case ofthe numerous ships which only called at Lisbon for ashort time with passengers and cargoes for distantcountries-The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State admitted that difficulties would be encountered.    All he wantedthat morning was permission to examine the new pro-posals.The First Lord of the Admiralty, though willing toexamine the new proposals or any others, warned hiscolleagues that at first sight the matter appearedto present considerable difficulties.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that if Portugal was in fact not allowing inter-national volunteers to enter Spain from her territory,it seemed a great pity to hold up the application ofthe general plan until the new scheme was worked out.The Secretary of State for Air urged that someother nation should be asked to propose this schemefor the patrol oi the Portuguese coast.The Parliamentary Undei-Secretary of State,Foreign Office, said that he would do his best toarrange this.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Foreign Office, to agreeto take part in a technical examina-tion of the proposal to extend theNavai Patrol Scheme to Portugal.
jFGHANISTAN. 2. The Secretary of State for India informed thexport Credits Cabinet that the very first question the Prime minister or.of Afghanistan haa put was as to whether the Governmentprevious were willing to guarantee credits for his country.Reference:Cabinet 5 He had been well pleased on being told that an Export(3ff), Con-elusion 9.) Credit would be given, but he had been disappointedER. I*tel)ljf. when he heard the amount.    The Secretary of Staterecalled that when they last discussed the natterthe Cabinet, as mentioned in the Conclusion, had been told that  100,000 was suggested by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs as sufficient.    He himself would prefer his original proposal for  250,000, buthe understood that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had only agreed to  150,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed this.The Cabinet agreed  That the Export Credit to Afghanistan,to be provided for by an entry in the diplomatic and Consular ServicesVote,should be for  150,000 instead of 100,000.
rrHS IRISHj^ES STATE.Relationswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(37), Con-elusion 1.)FTR3. In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs(CP.-52 (37)) covering copies of a telegramcontaining the United Kingdom Government&apos;s tentativeviews on the recent Irish Free State ConstitutionalLegislation, as sent to the United Kingdom Represent-atives in the Dominions for communication to therespective Prime Ministers, in terms approved by theIrish Situation Committee.The Cabinet took note of the telegramcontained in CP.-52 (37).
IBS coronation oath.Third Reportof CabinetCommittee.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(36), Con-elusion 8. )4.   The Cabinet had before theru the following documents relating to the Coronation Oath:-The Third Report of the CabinetConmittee (0.^.-51 (37)) makingreconmendations as to the formof the Oath and of the AccessionDeclaration, and as to the moment at which the latter should be made:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState tor Scotland (C.P.-54 (37))suggesting an amendment to that part of the Oath which dealt withProtestantism, in order to include a reference to Scotland and NorthernIreland.At the request of the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs gave a summary of the three sections of the third report of the Cabinet Committee (CP.-51 (37)).Tributes were paid to the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs on his success in securing theagreement of the Governments of Canada, Australia,New Zealand and South Africa, with the acquiescenceof the Irish Free State Government, to the firstsection of the Coronation Oath.The main discussion arose on the second sectionof the Cabinet Committee^ Report, dealing with thethird section of the Oath, to which was directed theMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP.-54 (37)) referred te at the head of this conclusion.The Cabinet were informed that the matter hadbeen examined by the Cabinet Committee on the previous evening and that the Committee had reached agreement on a variant of this part of the Oath in thefollowing terms :-
&quot;Will you to the utmost of yourpower maintain the Laws of God andthe true profession of the Gospel?Will you to the utmost of your powermaintain in the United Kingdom the protestant Reformed Religion estab-lished by lav;?   And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlementof the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline, and government thereof, as by law estab-lished in England?   And will youpreserve unto the Bishops and&apos; Clergyof England and to the Churches therecommitted to their charge, all such rights and privileges, as by law door shall appertain to them, or anyof them?&quot;The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs recalled that, shortly before the deliberations onthis point had been entered upon, the Prime Minister&apos;private Secretary had, with the Prime Minister&apos;authority, addressed a letter, the terms of which hadbeen appioved by the Archbishop of Canterbury, tothe principal Protestant Societies telling them, inreply to enquiries, that no alteration was contemplated in this part of the Oath.    The Cabinet committee considered that if the Oath was to be amended it wouldbe necessary to explain the matter to the recipientsof the earlier letter, and had invited the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs to submit a draft tothe Prime Minister and other members of the Committee.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, afterreading the new Oath, explained that in effect the changes divided the first sentence of the 1911 Oathinto two and added the words &quot;in the United Kingdom&quot;.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that itwas. difficult for him to agree to the new draftwithout further examination, as the Lord Advocate(though admittedly he had discussed the matter on general lines with the Lord President of the Councilon the previous day) had not been present at the
meeting of the Cabinet Committee and had not had anopportunity to study the actual draft.    The Scottishdifficulty would he met by omitting the words in line 4 &quot;established by law&quot;.    The point was that theChurch of Scotland was able to alter points of doctrinewithout Parliamentary approval.    It was true thatthese words had been contained in the Oath in 1911,but in 1921 an Act had been passed which made possiblethe amalgamation of the Established Church and theFree Church, on the understanding that both were freeChurches.    The effect of this on the position had tobe very carefully considered, and his Legal Adviserswere uneasy.It was pointed out that the Act of 1921 had enabled the Free Church to join the EstablishedChurch and yet to remain free Churches;   but theChurch of Scotland ^as an Established Church, and itwas the law that had allowed it to remain free indoctrine.The Home Secretary said that in 1911 everyone had accepted the Oath.    The Dominions were then the guestsof this country and were not disposed to criticise thearrangements.    Now they were partners and had responsi-bility, and the Governments found it necessary toexamine, in their application to their own countries,the phrases in these Oaths.    Consequently it had been necessary to insert some phrase to show that this applied to the United Kingdom.    If it were made toapply only in England, difficulties arose with northern Ireland, and now difficulties were raised in connection writh Scotland.    There seemed bound tobe a disadvantage somewhere.   His vie1&quot;&apos; was that thesection under consideration did not refer to theChurch of Scotland or to the Church of England, butto wider matters.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence alsofelt convinced that the sentence under consideration had nothing to do with the Churches of the twocountries.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs thendeveloped in detail the third section of the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee, where it was recommended thatthe Accession Declaration should not be placed betweenthe recognition of th? King by the whole Empire andthe Oath, the first part of which equally concerns the whole Empire, but that it should be taken immedi-ately after the Oath, to the last part of which, dealingwith the maintenance of the Protestant Reformed Religion,it is related.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve Section I of the third report of the Cabinet Committee(CP.-51 (37)) recommending thatthe first section of the coronation oath should be as follows:-&quot;Will you solemnly promise andswear to govern the peoples ofGreat Britain, Ireland, Canada,Australia, New Zealand and theUnion of South Africa, of yourpossessions and the other terri-tories to any of them belongingor pertaining, and of your Empireof India, accoraing to theirrespective Laws and Customs?&quot;(b) That as regards Section II of the third report of the Cabinet Committee, theMinister for Co-ordination of defence should discuss with the Secretary ofState for Scotland and the lord advocate the re-draft circulated tothe Cabinet that morning and quoted above, and that he should report theresult of this conference to the PrimeMinister, who should have discretionand authority to decide the matter onbehali of the Cabinet:(c) That in the event of a decision to alter this part of the coronation oath of 1911, which appears probable,the Prime Minister should send a letterof explanation to the recipients of
his previous letter stating that itwas not proposed to alter this partof the Oath:    and that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, inconsultation with members of the coronation Oath Committee, should draft the terms of the letter forthe Prime Minister1s approval:(d) As regards Section III of the CabinetCommittee&apos;s Report, to approve therecommendation that the AccessionDeclaration should not, as in thepast, be placed between the recog-nition of the King by the whole Empireand the Coronation Oath, but that itshould be taken immediately after the oath, to the last part of which, dealingwith the maintenance of the ProtestantReformed Religion, it is related:(e) To approve also the omission, as recommended by the Coronation OathCommittee, of the words &quot;of my Realm&quot;.
5.     The Minister for Go-Ordination of Defencerecalled that when this matter had last been discussed by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin, they had had before them the report of aSub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial defence on the Location of Government Departments in Time ofWar.      The Cabinet had referred the report to aCabinet Committee of which he had been Chairman.As a result of the deliberations of the CabinetCommittee, the Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence had produced a new plan forlocation of Government Departments in time of war.After observing that secrecy was of the utmost importance in whatever plan was adopted,  theMinister gave the Cabinet a summary of the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee, details of which are setforth in the official minutes.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencethen recalled that a recommendation for abandoning the new Government building in Whitehall had beensuggested     by the Sub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence as a sequel to its originalrecommendations that had been before the Cabinet atthe meeting referred to in the margin.     The matter had been considered by the Cabinet Committee which,on balance, had come to the conclusion to advise theCabinet to proceed with the new building.     he understood, however, that the Minister of Labourwanted some temporary postponement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the original plan of the Committee of ImperialDefence Sub-Committee had contemplated a policy ofpermanent decentralisation, under which portions of anumber of Departments would be located outside
London and that on the outbreak of war these buildingsshould be evacuated by the less important parts of thestaff which occupied them in peace to make room for themore important staffs engaged in the war effort whichwere to move into them from Whitehall,      The CabinetCommittee had felt that, besides involving a double move in a war emergency, this was putting the administration under a permanent handicap with the object of obtainingsome rather doubtful additional security.      They had beenconvinced that such permanent decentralisation mustinterfere with efficiency.     They had, therefore,decided that plans must be drawn up for decentralisationto take effect whenever the Government of the day had decided that this was necessary to meet the exigencies of an emergency.     The new plans were based on that principle.      This placed a different complexion on the controversy over&apos;the new building.     As the government might decide to evacuate it in a war emergency, the argument that it would be situated in the &quot;bull&apos;s eye&quot; ofthe enemy1s target no longer had the same force.The Minister of Labour asked that the new building should not be proceeded with -until after the talks he was arranging with representatives of thebuilding trade.     In this connection, he read thefollowing view   of an Inter-departmental Committeewhich had been considering the question:-&quot;(l)    The skilled labour requirements for thisbuilding during the period referred toare small but not negligible, since thegeneral shortage is likely to be acute.(2)    If an approach has to be made to thebuilding industry with a view to obtainingsome voluntary priority for government building, it will be important that theGovernment should themselves be speciallycareful not to use any skilled labour on buildings which are not urgently required.The question therefore as regards the newWhitehall building was whether the case for itwas sufficiently strong to counter-balance theobjections indicated in (1) and (2), and on this the Committee were not in a position to express aview.&quot;
The First Commissioner of Works developedstrong reasons for a very early decision arising out ofthe pressure upon his Department from GovernmentDepartments for more and &quot;better accommodation.     He madea strong plea for urgency.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recognised the urgency from the point of view of His Majesty!s Officeof Works hut appealed that the Minister of Labour shouldbe given the time he required for his discussions withthe building industry.The Minister of Transport expressed the hopethat detailed plans were not finally approved.     Everynew building created additional traffic and the need forparking space.     It was usual to insist that garageaccommodation under-ground should be provided inconnection with any very large new building.     his department was in contact with the Office of Works onthis subject but so far had not reached agreement.The First Commissioner of Works said that theOffice of Works were providing parking accommodation in side roads for visitors to the new Government office,but did not think it right to provide it for employees.The Gabinet agreed:(a) To approve generally the very secretplans for the location of GovernmentDepartments in time of war, as submittedby the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence,and authorised the Minister tohave these plans worked out in detail.(b) To approve the proposal of the CabinetCommittee that the new government building on the Whitehall site shouldbe proceeded with, subject to a suspension of this decision until afterthe forthcoming approach to the buildingindustry by the Minister of Labour whowas asked to report the results of his consultations to the Cabinet.
yiL AVIATION.s.j. ofijevious5ference:isbinet 457), Con-conclusion 5. )6.   In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for Air on thesubject of Civil Aviation in the United Kingdom: -CP.-25 (37) covering the Report ofthe Committee set up under theChairmanship of Sir Henry Mayburyand calling particular attention tocertain Conclusions and Recommenda-tions contained therein:C.P.-49 (37) dealing in the main with he C ommit t e e1 s rec onime nd at ion srelating to the licensing of airlines, the provision of radiofacilities and a comprehensive air traffic control bv the Government,at an anticipated capital cost ofabout  320,000 and a total annual cost of about  240,000.      TheSecretary of State had discussed theproposals of the Committee with theChancellor of the Exchequer, whoagreed with him that the recommend-ations in the Report rhich involvedGovernment action ought to be adopted.The Gabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for Air as set forth in CP. 49 (37) including the followingmore important recommendations -(I)    the adoption of the recommendations in the report v/hich involveGovernment action;(ii)    the adoption of the licensingproposalsj(iii)    that the meteorological .service, radio equipment and facilities should be providedby the Air Ministry;(iv)   That the Air.Ministry should assumewhatever degree of control overactual flying is necessarycovering both Civil and Serviceflying.(b) That effect should be given inParliament to the above decision bythe inclusion of an appropriate passage in the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandumaccompanying the Air Ministry1sEstimates in addition to an explanationin the speech of the parliamentary under Secretary.

THE NATIONAL-ISaTION OPMINES ANDMINERALS BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 6(57), Gon-clusion 12. )8.   The Cabinet had under consideration the nationalisation of Mines and Minerals Bill, intro-duced by a Private Member and down for Second reading in the House of Commons on Friday, February 12th.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary, Mines Department,should be authorised to oppose theBill.

The Cabinet had under consideration the parliament Act (1911) Amendment Bill, introduced bya Private Member and down for Second Reading in theHouse of Commons on Friday, February 19th.This Bill was reserved until the nextweekly meeting of the Cabinet,
THE PEACEBILL&apos;(previous reference:Cabinet 56(36), Con-clusion 2. )12*    The Cabinet had under consideration the PeaceBill, introduced by a Private Member and down for second Reading in the House of Commons on Friday,February 19th.This Bill was reserved for consideration atFR^fyy^-  the next regular weekly meeting of the Cabinet,
13.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, asthe Cabinet must long have realised, it was notpossible to finance the whole of our Defence Require-ments Programmes from revenue.    We were now gettingvery close to the time when the Annual Estimates hadto be presented to Parliament, and in doing so hekthought it would be necessary to say how much out ofthe gross Estimates was to be found from borrowed money.    Incidentally, that compelled him to considerrather earlier than usual the general lines of his budget, though that was not the point that he wishedto bring before the Cabinet.    Before he could borrowhe must have legislative authority.    This could bedone, if necessary, by means of a Bill every year;but that would be an embarrassment and would occupya great deal of Parliamentary time.    He proposed,therefore, a Bill enabling the Government to borrowto such amount as appeared reasonable and covering the whole period of the borrowings.    That did notnecessarily mean that either the amount or the periodhad to be finally determined now, but, in accordancewith constitutional usage, it would be appropriate to give the House some figures, which could only be altered by Parliament itself.    The Bill would require a Financial Resolution, and, after consultation withthe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury, it hadbeen arranged that this should be taken on February17th and the Bill a week later.     This was a departure from the ordinary practice, so he had to give inadvance the terms of the Financial Resolution.    he proposed to lay the Resolution on the Table of theHouse on the following afternoon.    He would have preferred to do it that same afternoon, but there were still one or two points remaining for settlement withthe Governor of the Bank of England, who had only just returned from abroad.     on-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, inaddition, he proposed to make a statement to the Houseof Commons in advance of the White Paper, and heread a draft of that statement to his colleagues.After reading the draft statement he made some further observations.   He suggested that the total sum(which he named) would come as a surprise to the public,and perhaps as a shock to financial circles.    This,he thought, would do no harm.    It was time that thecountry realised that they could not get armamentswithout paying.    It might also be a good thing for europe to see how determined we were to re-conditionour armaments.    As to the borrowings in the next financial year, he mentioned the sum which it wouldprobably be necessary to provide, although this didnot necessarily mean that we should borrow the wholeof it or, alternatively, that we should not borrowmore.    He therefore had in mind to announce onFebruary 24th, either in the White Paper or in thecourse of his statement, the gross amount to be met by appropriations-in-aid.The Minister of Transport recalled that theGovernment had made a great deal of their policy of cheap money, which had been obtained largely byinducing the investor in War Loans to agree to a lower rate of interest. No mention was made of this in theChancellor&apos;s statement, and he suggested that politicar-ly it might be wise to say something on the subject.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook toconsider the point.The Home Secretary pointed, out that if the &amp;%a%e-introduce the Factories Bill, the House of commons would at once be emptied.*3ae** were madeJhn&amp;evQ 4 o1 clock, when he was due to
The Chancellor of the Exchequer-  undertook toarrange to^aiee^the^s^a^rient a little later, say at p. in.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Chancellor of the Exchequer,as set forth above.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,February 10, 1937.
