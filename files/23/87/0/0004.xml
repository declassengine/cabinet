SPAIN.The BalearicIslands.Report by chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(36), Con-clusion 4.)1.In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them a Report bythe Chief8 of Staff Sub-Committee (CP.-10 (37)) inwhieh they reaffirmed their previously recorded opinionthat neither an Italian occupation of Majorca nor anarrangement between the Italian Government and theSpanish Government, under which, in time of emergency,the Italians could make use of the facilities of this island in particular, or of the. Balearic Islandsgenerally, would vitally affect British strategicalinterests.In the absence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs there was no discussion either on this Reportor on the situation in Spain.The Cabinet took note of the Reportby the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(CP.-10 (37)).
IRAQ.The Assyrians.(previous reference:Cabinet 69(36), Con-elusion 6.)Pf?. 2.2-^7) 3.2. The Prime Minister said that he had received aletter written by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs before he left for Geneva, reporting that though the Foreign Office, Colonial Office and WarOffice had all worked at this subject as requested bythe Cabinet at the Meeting referred to in the margin,they had so far been unable to find any solution ofthe problem of the Assyrians.    It might be that no solution could be found, but before coming to such adecision, the results of which might have very serious consequences in the Far East, he was most anxious to explore every possibility.    He did not feel that thesubject could usefully be pursued much farther by thethree Departments alone, and asked for a small CabinetCommittee.    The Secretary of State represented thenatter as urgent because the Assyrian Committee atGeneva, which had been handling this matter inter-nationally and through whose help we had received aconsiderable subscription from the League itself,was now growing restive and showing sipns of wishing to terminate its own existence.The Cabinet agreed  That the question of the positionof the Assyrians in Iraq should beconsidered as soon as possible by aCabinet Committee composed as follows:-The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (represented, if stillabsent, by the parliamentary under-Secretary),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for War,The First Lord of the Admiralty.The Prime Minister asked the Committee to meetas soon as possible.
THE IRISH FREESTATE.Relationswith.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(37), Con-elusion 8. )PR. 33. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Dondni^n Affairs (C.P.-14(37)) giving a full summary of the main pointsdiscussed in two long conversations he had recently had with the President of the Irish Free State.A second Memorandum (CP.-15 (37)) containing theviews and recommendations of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs on the present position had been circulated the    same morning, and members of the Cabinet had not had an opportunity to study it.After a discussion which, in the circumstancesmentioned above, was necessarily of a preliminary character, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Irish Situation Committeeshould meet to consider the aboveMemoranda in the Prime Minister1sRoom at the House or Commons thesame evening at 6 p.m. :(b) That the Cabinet should meet onMONDAY next, JANUARY 25th, at11.30 a.m., in the Cabinet room at 10 Downing Street, to considerthe Report by the Irish situation committee.
RECRUITING 4.  The Cabinet had before then, the Report (CP.-11FOR THE ARMY.(37)) of the Committee which had been appointed atReoort ofCabinet the Meeting referred to in the ruargjn to investigateConaiiittee.q the problems of Army Recruiting.    The Report emphasised(Previous that nothing short of action on a large scale would reference:Cabinet 69 be likely in present circumstances to stimulate(36), Con-elusion 7.) recruiting;    suggested that whatever plans werepr^ \\ (yj)l adopted should be put into effect at one and the same&quot; 3fcC5?)&quot;&quot;. time;    and made recommendations under the following headings:-   &quot;Pre-Enlistment Proposals&quot;;    &quot;proposals affecting the period of Colour Service&quot;; and &quot;After-Care Proposals&quot;.  (See Appendix.)The First Commissioner of Works, as Chairman ofthe Cabinet Committee, said that the most importantmethods for stimulating recruiting were to provide employment on return to civil life and to reduce the term of service abroad.    As mentioned in the Report,neither the introduction of a four years overseastour nor of a six years period of Colour service in the Infantry was a practicable measure at present,and the Committee had only been able to recommend theabolition of &quot;holding&quot;.    So far as concernedGovernment employment for ex-Regulars he warned theCabinet that the figures in paragraph 20 of theReport were misleading, as a large proportion of theex-Service men at present employed in GovernmentDepartments consisted of &quot;ex-hostilities&quot; men.He had not been able to obtain figures as to how manyex-Service men were now being taken into GovernmentDepartments.A suggestion was made that sufficient information* on this latter point could be obtained by analysingthe records of entrants into the Civil Service for asingle year.    The object of securing such information
would be to ascertain how far Government departments were providing employment for ex-Service men and tofacilitate the preparations for vocational training.If the number of men being taken into GovernmentDepartments proved considerable it would affect thenumbers for which the Ministry of Labour hoped toprovide vocational training.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that this information could only be obtained by a long andtedious process of examining the papers of everyentrant during the past year, and it was suggest edthat a more effective course would be to inviteGovernment Departments to state how many vacanciesfor new entrants during future years could be reservedfor ex-Service men.    This would have to be doneDepartment by Department.This was agreed to.The Secretary of State for War expressed doubt as to whether the proposals of the Committee wouldhiin^aLd. $jf ^liave tiie result of attracting a sufficient number of recruits.    Only 50 per cent,  of his original proposals had been adopted, but as a member of the Committeehe had realised that some of them could not be&apos; &quot;ilefjc- lie /yia^UlVU^zft-ss d.&apos;/u  tlaUt^iJ? \ accepted.The Secretary of State for India said that india was much concerned with these proposals.    He had donehis utmost to help the War Office and had not withheldhis concurrence from the Report, but that concurrencemust be regarded as provisional.    First, no new chargecould be imposed on India without the assent of theCouncil of India.      He had not had an opportunity toput the proposals to the Council as yet, but he anticipated that, grave objections would be taken tothe imposition oi new charges on Indian revenues for
the British Army in India.    as the Government ofIndia was about to introduce a Budget which wouldprovide for a deficit, he had felt bound to warn theGovernment of India of these possible impendingcharges.    The Government of India had reacted badly.Eventually there would be considerable recurringcharges on Indian finances from these proposals.The Appendix to the Report did not give a completepicture of these charges.    For example, opposite theitem &quot;Provision of Suppers&quot; there were queries in thetwo columns relating to the annual cost to India.He had, however, been investigating the subject further.He thought it probable that the best way of making this concession in India might not be by providingsuppers but by an increase to mess allowance, and thiswas estimated to cost  100,000 a year.    This, added tothe items in the Report, night bring the charges on india within the region of  200,000 a year. Admittedlythere would be a saving in the first year owing to theabolition of &quot;holding&quot;, but this would only be temporary and would involve an ultimate increase of  46,000 ayear.    The Government of India had proposed to devotethe temporary saving to mechanisation as required,not for Indian, but for Imperial purposes.    If he now had to apply the expected savings to the popularisationof recruiting the reorganisation scheme would suffer.In fact, he gave a warning that he might feel obligedbefore long to put in a plea to the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for War that india should be given some assistance from Imperialresources for measures of reorganisation that were required for Imperial and not for Indian purposes.
The Secretary of State for War pointed out that theGovernment of India would save on the first year andmight therefore be asked to undertake these charges in the hope of a better Budget next year;   but theSecretary of State for India pointed out that this did not take into account the permanent increase of 200,000 a year.The Lord Privy Seal thought that as India was savingmoney this year it was not unreasonable that they should accept these proposals, but that if charges up to 200,000 a year were to be imposed the Secretary ofState for India deserved his sympathy.The Secretary of State for War thought there was abetter case for India in the matter of mechanisationthan on these recruiting proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that theGovernment of India ought to take a long view of thesituation and to realise that if the British Army couldnot be maintained India would eventually go down.The Home Secretary drew attention to paragraph 24of the Report, on Police employment for ex-Regulars.There was no difficulty about Lhe principle of accept-ing ex-soldiers as policemen:    in fact they were ratherwelcomed as such.    Real difficulties arose, however,from the fact that many ex-soldiers had neither thephysique nor the education to become policemen.    Morepolicemen were drawn from the Guards than from other branches of the Service.    Another difficulty wasthatthe Police Force was a long service.    Men served 25years for their pension and 30 years for a full pension.Consequently they were recruited as young as possible,and the present limitation was 25 years of age.    That,conceivably, night be moved up to 27 years of age.
This made it extremely difficult to carry out theproposal that the normal method of recruitment of thePolice should be &quot;principally through the defence forces&quot;.    That would mean that on the outbreak of wara proportion of the Police Force would be liable to becalled up as Reservists.     Under modern conditions,possible air raids, and so forth, it was out of thequestion that any laige proportion of the Force couldbe spared in time of war.    Admittedly there was anagreement that the War Office would not call upReservists in the Police Force for the first threemonths of a major war, but he felt that the proposal of the Committee necessitated further enquiry in theHome Office, which he undertook to make in the mostsympathetic spirit.The First Commissioner of Works reminded the Cabinetthat ex-Service men enlisted in the Police would onlybe liable to be called up as Reservists for five yearsof their total service in the Force.    He mentioned oneChief Constable who considered that much larger numbersof ex-Service men than the 5 per cent of servingReservists now allowed could safely be taken.One suggestion was that the subject should be studied by the Sub-Committee under the Postmaster-General&apos;chairmanship on which the Home Office were represented.The Secretary of State for War informed the Cabinetthat, apart from the question of physique, one reason why Guardsmen enlisted so extensively in the police force was that they only served for&apos; four years and were therefore within the age limits.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that theex-Service men destined for the Police should be putin a class and have their education polished up.-8-
The Secretary of State for Scotland supported theHome Secretary.    He viewed with apprehension a reversal -of the principle that Police Forces should nht beregarded as available for military mobilisation, as very likely when the time came it would be impossibleto release them.The First Commissioner of Works, in reply to aquestion by the Home Secretary, said that he understoodthat the total intake for the Police Forces in thecourse of a year was about 3,000.    At present only about 300 were ex-Service men.    It would be a greathelp if this number could be raised to 2,000.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence pointedout that this was a plan to get recruits.    If prospective-tive recruits were told that, provided they possesseda certain st andard of physique and education, theywould have a good chance,on leaving the Service, ofemployment in the Police Force, that would tend to drawinto the Army men of good intelligence and physique.       . jThe Secretary of State for India drew attention tothe statement in the Report that &quot;We see no adequatereason why the normal method of recruitment to thePolice should not be principally through the defence forces ......&quot;, and suggested that for the word&quot;principally&quot; should be substituted &quot;to a much greater extent than at present&quot;.After sone further discussion the Cabinet agreed  To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee on Recruiting lor the Army(CP.-11 (37)), subject to the following: -(a) That the Treasury, in consultationwith the First Commissioner of Worksas Chairman of the Cabinet Committee,should invite all Government Depart-ments to report how many of their annual intake of Civil Servants could in future consist of ex-Service men:
(b) Tnat the recommendations of theReport to the effect that the normalmethod of recruitment to the police should be principally through theDefence Forces (Conclusions[&quot;andRecommendations,&quot;&quot;Paragraph 27should be reserved pending a reportby the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Scotland asto how far this was feasible:(c) A caveat by the Chancellor of theExchequer as to whether, if butterwas provided for the Army, it wouldbe necessary, as suggested by theMinistry oif Labour, to introduce it also in the Ministry&apos;s Training:Centres (Page 7, first paragraph.)
SUGAR. 5.    The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum &quot;by theProposed Inter-Lord President of the Council (CP.-12 (37)) on thenational Con-ference on.        subject of a Proposed International Sugar Conference,in which he outlined the circumstances which led him(previous reference:        to make the following recommendations:-Cabinet 56(35), Con- (i) That an International Sugar Conferenceelusion 13. ) should be convened in London on or aboutthe 5th April next, and that His Majesty&apos;sFTR. .9^7)6. Government in the United Kingdom should participate in it and provide accommoda-tion, etc. , as for the World monetary and Economic Conference of 1933:(ii) That (provided the German government agree to this procedure) the conference should be convened under the auspices ofthe Bureau of the World Monetary andEconomic Conference, acting through theLeague of Nations Secretariat:(iii) That the Lord President of the council should be authorised to write to Dr. Colijn,as the Chairman of the Economic Commissionof the Conference, in terms of the draft attached to CP.-12 (37).The Lord President of the Council, in thecourse of a short statement, mentioned that the germans were reported to be ready to attend a Conferencesummoned by the League of Nations, provided thatBritish influence was predominant in the presidencyand the Conference was held in London.The Minister of Health, speaking on behalfof the President of the Board of Trade (absent in theUnited States of America) said that the Board of Trade,though not very optimistic as to the prospects of theConference, considered that it ought to be held.Prom the point of view of public health, a restriction on sugar supply might do no harm.The Secretary of State for the Coloniessupported the proposed Conference in the interests ofthe sugar-producing Colonies.!
The Secretary of State for Scotland suggestedthat before the letter was sent to Doctor Colijn, thesubject should be explored in its political aspectsby the Cabinet Committee on Trade and Agriculture.The Lord President agreed that thequestion might well be so referred but, in view ofthe importance of the time factor, the letter toDoctor Colijn should not be held back pending theseexplorations.The Secretary of State for India agreedthat the matter was urgent.The Secretary of State for Air thought therewas no risk rise in prices of sugar.     prices were already much too low and certain Colonies hadto be subsidised to maintain the sugar indistry.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the recommendations ofthe Lord President of the Councilin CP. 12 (37) as set forth at thehead of this conclusion, includingauthority to him to write toDoctor Colijn as the Chairman of theEconomic Commission of theConference in terms of the draft attached to CP. 12 (37).
-HE BALANCE OF       6. The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePAYMENTS OFTHE UNITED President of the Board of Trade (CP.-339 (36))KINGDOM.covering a Memorandum on the subject of the Balanceof Payments cf the United Kingdom, prepared at his request by the Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.    The first part of the Memorandum dealtwith the present balance of payments.    It might befound that in the year 1936 a slight, but not alarming,adverse balance had been incurred, and it was suggestedthat the remedy   apart from any weakening of ourexchange   should be sought in increased exports.The second part dealt with our export trade.&apos;   Somelimiting factors to the success of our protective andpreferential policy were indicated, but certain general principles were suggested which should be borne inmind in considering our commercial and industrial policy.    No specific decisions were called for atpresent, but the President of the Board of Trade found himself in general agreement with Sir frederick leith-Ross1s conclusions and hoped that his colleagues would keep them in mind as and when occasion arose.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencedrew attention to paragraph 7 on page 10 of thememorandum by the Chief Economic Adviser containingremarks as to the effect of the re-armament programme on this issue.     He did not disagree with the ChiefEconomic Adviser&apos;s commentary, but he wanted theCabinet to realise the consequences,     In the matter ofproviding machine tools, he had encouraged manufacturers to maintain their exports to a considerable extent and,in co-operation with them, some of our requirements inmachine tools for armaments had been obtained from
CANADA.pjw Trade Agree-pent withPreviousReference:pabiriet 1 (37)Conclusion 15. )abroad, with the result that he hoped that by theend of the year the greater part of our machine tools would have been obtained without sacrificingthe export industry.     He was following out thesame methods in other branches of industryaffected by the re-armament programme.     TheCabinet must realise, however, that this policy didexpose the Government to criticisms from those elements in Parliament and in the country who wereinsisting that re-armament should be pursued atall costs and without regard to the future ofindustry.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he realised that a point might well be reached whenre-armament was finished, trade was falling andespeciallywhen,/if the element of goodwill in our export tradeeconomichad been sacrificed, a very difficult/and financial situation would arise, more particularly as thepermanent cost of maintaining car armaments wouldhave greatly increased.     On a later occasion, he might wish to say something to the Cabinet as to how the risks of such a situation could be alleviated.The Lord Privy Seal drew attention to paragraph 11 on page 12 of the Report, dealing withthe undesirability of further restrictions on theimports from foreign countries.     He had recentlyread telegrams from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington reporting somewhat bitter objections takenby the United States&apos; Secretary of State to the prospective trading Agreement with Canada.     this seemed rather to confirm the gist of the paragraphhe had mentioned.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said hehad only just seen the Ambassador&apos;s telegram and he did not know enough of the details of the ottawa agreement to he able to say whether Mr. Cordell Hull&apos;scriticisms were justified.     He happened to know,however, that the American Secretary of State dislikedImperial preference and his acerbity was probably dueto his objections to a new manifestation of imperial preference.     While attaching importance to themaintenance of good relations with the United States,he could not admit that our policy conformed to theviews of the American Secretary of State.The Secretary of State for Air reminded theCabinet that the American Department of Commerce had brought about preferences to Cuba and the PhillipineIslands, which were far higher than anything Canadagranted to ourselves, although those countries did notform part of the United States.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsconfirmed the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s view as tothe probable- explanation.The Cabinet agreed:(a)To take note of the memorandumby the Chief Economic adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Government onthe balance of payments.That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorised to send a copyto the Chairman of the ImportDuties Advisory Committee.
THE DIVORCE(SCOTLAND)BILL.previous reference:Cabinet 69(36), Con-clusion 11.)7.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP.-7 (37))stating that a Bill to amend the law as to thegrounds on which decrees of divorce can be granted in Scotland had been introduced in the House of lords and was likely to be put down for Second Reading soon after Parliament reassembled.    The Secretary of state proposed that on the Second Reading and in Committee(if the Scottish Bill were given a Second Reading)the representative of the Scottish Office in theHouse of Lords should be authorised to take a similar-line te that laid down by the Cabinet in the case ofthe Marriage Bill at present under consideration inthe House of Commons (Cabinet 66 (36), Conclusion 12,and Cabinet 69 (36), Conclusion ll), and that cabinet ministers and the Scottish Office representatives inthe House of Lords should not vote on the Second reading of the Bill.The Secretary of State for Scotland said he asked for this decision so as to ensure that theGovernmentTs policy was similar in regard to bothEngland and Scotland in this matter.The Lord Chancellor warned the Cabinet thathe was about to see the Attorney-General on certain points arising on the/Bill which impinged upon oursummary juridical procedure.While realising that before long it might benecessary to reach some decision as to theirattitude to the Divorce Bills in the case of bothEngland and Scotland, the Cabinet agreed for the-present:To approve the orouosals of the Secretaryof State for Scotland in CP.  7 (37),as summarised above.
8, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP.-13 (37)) seeking, with theconcurrence of the Secretary of State for Scotland,Cabinet authority for the early preparation andintroduction in the House of Lords of a short Billto amend the National Health Insurance Aot, 1936, inorder to remedy a difficulty connected with the rightof corporate bodies (including limited companies andao-operative societies) to contract with insurance committees for the dispensing of medicines under theNational Health Insurance scheme.    In substance thenecessary legislation would merely substitute thewords &quot;persons who are registered pharmacists orauthorised sellers of poisons within the meaning ofthe Pharmacy and Poisons Act, 1933&quot; for the words&quot;persons who are entitled under the Pharmacy andPoisons Acts, 1852 to 1933, to use the title 1 Chemistand druggist&apos;&quot;.The Cabinet agreed!(a) To aporove the proposal of the Ministerof Health in concurrence with theSecretary of State for Scotland, for theearly preparation and introduction inthe House of Lords of a short Bill toamend the National Health InsuranceAct, 1936, for the purposes set forthab ove.(b) That the Bill should be submitted tothe Committee of Home Affairs.

The Cabinet had under consideration the ShopsuEiTAXLADING SAFE-     (Retail Trading Safeguards) Bill, introduced by aJARDS) BILL-Private Member and down for Second Reading in the Houseof Commons on Friday, January 29th.The Cabinet were informed that the only countries where action had been taken against multiple shops and trading stores, as proposed in this Bill, were Germanyand Belgium.The Cabinet agreed:That the Minister of Health should invitethe Parliamentary Secretary to the Boardof Trade to take the line on this bill that while sympathising with the&apos; case ofthe traders who were hit by the multipleshop and trading stores, the interests ofthe consumers, who would strongly objectto the Bill, had to be taken into account.He should be ^-nthorised to state,  ifnecessary, that the Government could not support the Bill,
THE DEAF 10,    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byCHILDREN . ,    \\(SCHOOL ATTEND- the President of the Board of Education (CP.-9 (37);ANCS) BILL.requesting instructions from his colleagues.es as to theattitude he should adopt towards the Deaf Children(School Attendance) Bill, the second of three PrivateMembers1 Bills down for Second Reading in the Houseof Commons on Friday, January 29th.    The object ofthe Bill was to reduce the age of compulsory attendance at school by deaf children from 7 to 5.    The cost tothe Treasury, who had been consulted and had noobservations to make, should not exceed  5,000 a year.If his colleagues agreed, the President of the Boardof Education proposed  (i) If the Bill conies on, to express hissympathy with it;(ii) If the Bill does not come on, toadopt the Bill as a government measure.The President of the Board of Education didnot ask for a decision on (ii) on the present occasion.The Cabinet agreed:To authorise the President of the Boardof Education to express his sympathy with the Deaf Children (School Attendance)Bill if it was taken.
11. The Cabinet had under consideration the LocalAuthorities (Enabling) Bill, introduced by a; private member and down for Second Reading in the House ofCommons on Friday, January 29th.It was thought unlikely that the above bill would be taken, but in the contrary event, theCabinet authorised the Minister of Health to oppose it.

APPENDIXCOMMITTEE ON RECRUITING FOR THE ARMY.Summary of Conclusions and Recommendations.General.(a) We wish to emphasise that nothing short of action ona large scale is likely in present circumstances to stimulaterecruiting.    Whatever plans are adopted should therefore   beput into effect at one and the same time.    Piecemealapplication will probably be useless (paragraph 3)..Pre-Enlistment Proposals.(b) The central control of recruiting publicity should   boplaced in the hands of a highly-qualified Public RelationsOfficer, assisted by an advisory committee (paragraph 4-).(c) We recommend that an experiment of a unified recruitingoffice for all three Services be arranged, and that the extensionof the scheme be considered in the light of that experiment(paragraph 5).Proposals affecting the period of Colour Service.(d) We regret that the introduction of a 4 years1overseas tour and of a 6 years&apos;  ^period of Colour Service in the infantry is not an immediately practicable measure (paragraphs and 9).    As a first step, however, towards shortening the duration of the tour overseas, we recommend the abolition of&quot;holding&quot;.    This will involve India going short of about 9,000men for the time being, but the Secretary of State for India isprepared to accept the risks involved (on the understanding setout in paragraph 10).    If the returning soldier is   notadmitted to a Vocational Training establishment, we recommendthat he be offered the option of extending his    service, up toa maximum period of 3 months, in this country, in order togive him an opportunity of regaining touch with homeconditions (paragraph 12).
(e) We make no recommendation on the subject of uniform,in view of the opportunity of testing the popularity of blueuniform   which the Coronation will afford.    We recommend,however, the extension of the privileges of wearing plainclothes when out of barracks and of &quot;all night&quot; leave(paragraph 15).(f) We recommend the abolition of certain stoppages fromthe pay of recruits and an increase in the total kit allowance in the first year of service;    the provision from public funds of the pith helmet and the extra uniform required by thetrained soldier on proceeding abroad (paragraph 16);.   theprovision of suppers (paragraph 17);    and various minor improvements in the conditions of the soldier (p&amp;paragraph 18).After-Care Proposals.(g) The Minister of Labour has undertaken to reserve for time-exoired regular sailors,  soldiers and airmen two ofhis Vocational Training Centres - Southampton, with an estimated annual output of 1,000 men,  and Leeds, with an estimated annual output of 1,400 men.We consider that soldiers not fully time-exoiredshould continue for the time being to go to the existingArmy Vocational Training Centres,  at which the fees nowcharged should be remitted.We recommend the eventual absorption of the ArmyCentres in the Ministry of Labour scheme (paragraph 19).(h) Owing to the operation of various    age-limits,&quot;ex-hostilities&quot; men will begin in some 4 years1 time to cease to be available for the Government employment normallyreserved for ex-regulars (paragraph 20).The present congestion in the waiting-lists forGovernment employment will, however, persist for a much longer period, unless positive action is taken to-ii-
discriminate between categories of post-war ex-regulars.      Werecommend a measure of discrimination in favour of men whohave just completed their colour service.    In some cases thediscrimination might take the form of a quota, under which an increasing proportion of the vacancies would be reserved fornewly discharged men.    In many cases, however,  it will not bepossible to do more than invite Departments to keep in mind thedesirability of providing employment for ex-regulars within areasonable period of their discharge (paragraph 21).(i)   We have invited the Sub-Committee on Government andLocal Authority Employment for Ex-Regulars   to continue their examination of the matters referred to at (h),  of those questions of pay, pension and seniority which   affectex-regulars in the Civil Service,  and of the problems of LocalAuthority employment, for ex-regulars, and to report to theCabinet (paragraphs 21, 22 and 23).(j)   We see no adequate reason why the normal method of recruitment for the Police should not be principally throughthe Defence Forces.    The Home Office and the Scottish office have been asked to examine,  in consultation with chief constables, the possibility of securing a larger number ofentries of ex-regulars into the Police (paragraph 24).Effect on Royal Navy and Royal Air Force.(k)   The effect of our proposals on the Royal Navy and royal Air Force is shown in paragraphs 25 and 26.
