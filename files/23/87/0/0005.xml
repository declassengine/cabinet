I. In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet held a Special Meeting toconsider a Report by tne Irish Situation Committee(CP .-23 (37)), wno had had before them two memoranda by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, onegiving a full summary of tne main points discussed intwo long conversations ne had recently nad with tnePresident of tne Irish Free State (CP .-14 (37)), andthe otner containing his recommendations as to theattitude to be adopted towards the recent Irish FreeState legislation.    The Committee found tnemselves ingeneral agreement with the views expressed by theSecretary of State, and submitted to the Cabinet thefollowing re commendations:-(l) That our final conclusion on the subjectof the effect of the position created bythe new Irish Free State constitutional proposals and by Mr de   valera&apos;s observa-tions thereon can only be reached as amember of the Eritisn Commonwealth ofNations and after communication with tneother members of tne Commonwealth:(2) That we should indicate to the Dominionsthat wre snould be prepared, if tne otherDominions are also prepared, to regard the fundamental position of tne Irisn FreeState as a Dominion as not altered by theIrish Free State Constitutional legislation:(3) That we should continue to urge informallyupon Mr de Valera the desirability of considering alterations in tne language of the legislation   ^bich would, make  clear the Irish Free State&apos;s full membership ofthe Commonwealth an,i recogxvition of tne King:(4) That we snould endeavour to persuade himto subscribe to an Imperial ConferenceDeclaration in the course of which theposition of the Crown as the symbol ofthe free association of tne members ofthe Commonwealth is confirmed:(5) That we should inform the other dominions of our intentions under (3)  and (4) and ofthe reasons why we attaen importance to theaction proposed thereinl(6) That the discussions between Officials on defence, the financial dispute and trade should be resumed as soon as possible.
The Cabinet were informed by the Prime Minister thatas had been agreed at the previous Meeting the irish situation Committee had considered the Memoranda (CP. 14(37)  and CP.  15 (37)), which had been circulated by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs, and had reachedthe conclusions contained in the Report (CP. 23 (37)) now before the Cabinet. He suggested that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs should open the discussion.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs assumed that the Members of the Cabinet were aware of the various considerations contained in his two Memoranda and of therecommendations in the Report of the Irish situation committee.     His own views as to the policy to be adoptedhad been expressed in the concluding paragraph of CP.  15(37).The crux of the whole question was this - that we shouldbe able to regard the position of the Irish Free State as having been unaltered by the recent Irish Free Statelegislation and by the re-writing of the Irish Free StateConstitution as Mr. de Valera proposed, only if the positionof the King as the Head of the British Commonwealth ofNations and the Crown as the symbol of the free associationof the Members of the Commonwealth was fully maintained.If the position in these respects were not maintainedit would be most difficult to resist theclaim of foreign countries to enjoy all the privileges of membership of the Commonwealth (such as Imperial preference)under the most-favoured-nation clauses of our commercial treaties.The position of the Crown was very inadequately andunsatisfactorily expressed in the new Irish Free Statelegislation,  and we ought to press Mr. de Valera to provide,if necessary by amendment of his legislation,for a clear
acceptance of the Irish Free State&apos;s full Membership ofthe Commonwealth and recognition of the King.      The irish situation Committee1s Report contained a specific recommendation (No.  (3)) to this effect.      When, however,the new Irish Free State legislation was read in conjunc-tion with statements made by Mr. de Valera in public(e.g. in the Dail) and in private (e.g. in the conversa-tions with the Secretary of State)  it would be seen thatMr. de Valera agreed that tne position could be correctlydescribed as being that the Irish Free State remainsfull Member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, thatthe King is King of Ireland, and that he is the symbol of association with the Commonwealth.      Moreover it seemed probable that Mr. de Valera might be prepared to accept a form of Coronation Oath based on the King&apos;s Title and opening with the words &quot;Will you solemnly promise and sweatto govern the peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada,Australia, New Zealand and South Africa.........&quot;.    Furtherit was not improbable that the Irish Free State would berepresented at the Coronation by the Irish Free State HighCommissioner.      While it was true that in future nofunctions will be performed by the King or his representa-tive in the internal affairs of the Free State, His Majestywill continue to perform for the Free State all theconstitutional functions which he performs for any of theDominions regarding external affairs.     In fact, since thenew Irish Free State legislation, submissions in regard to matters such as the appointment of Irish Free State consular officers abroad had been made to the King.Although there were no doubt weighty arguments againstaccepting the position, he (the Secretary of State) hadsatisfied himself that on balance the arguments set out on pages 3 and 4 of CP. 15 (37) were heavily in favour of our
regarding the recent Irish Free State legislation as not having altered the fundamental position of the Irish FreeState as a Dominion.      The Irish Situation Committee had reached the same general conclusion.The question, however, was not one which concerned only the United Kingdom and the Irish Free State.      It wasone of vital interest to the Commonwealth as a whole, andto each of the other Dominions individually.      It was forthis reason that the Irish Situation Committee had statedthat the Government of the United Kingdom could not reach a final conclusion on the subject of the effect ,of theposition created by the new Irish Free State constitutional proposals and by Mr. de Valera&apos;s observations thereonuntil the other Dominions had been communicated with andtheir views ascertained.     This point w^s covered in thefirst recommendation of the Irish Situation Committee1sReport (CP. 23 (37)).      Recommendations (2),  (3)s  (4)  and(b)  of that Report were concerned with matters to which hehad already referred.      Recommendation (6) was somewhat different, but,  on the assumption that we reached theconclusion after consultation and in agreement with theother Dominions that the fundamental position of theIrish Free State as a Dominion had not been altered by theIrish Free State legislation,  then it was proposed thatthe discussions between officials on defence, the financialdispute and trade snould be resumed as soon as possible.If the Cabinet agreed to the course proposed, and if theother Dominions also agreed, he (the Secretary of State)thought that there was a real chance of securing greatly improved relations with, and the co-operation of, the IrishFree State.      These might only be realised slowly.Improvement of relations and better co-operation would greatly contribute to the increased security of the UnitedKingdom and the strengthening of the Commonwealth as a whole.
The First L&amp;rd of the Admiralty agreed generally with the conclusions reached by the Irish situation committee * but enquired what icind of a lead it was proposedto give to the Dominions when we communicated with them.Having regard to the history of the Irish question, it would undoubtedly be much easier for the Conservative Party toaccept the policy recommended in the Irish situation committee&apos;s Report if that Party could be faced withagreement in,and acceptance of that policy ley,the otherDominions voluntarily reached by them without any pressure from the United Kingdom.      From this point of view itwould be very advantageous if the matter could be treatedvis a vis the Dominions in very much the same way as theconstitutional crisis In December, 1936 had been treated.From the point of view of explaining the position to theConservative Party, the case on paper would not be easy todefend.      In some respects Mr. de Valera was moving back,e.g. in his refusal to incorporate Article I of the existing constitution in his new Constitutional Bill, and he wasalso apparently adamant in regard to the financial dispute.If, in addition to matters of this kind, it appeared thatthe Government had been pressing the other Dominions toadopt their point of view, serious political trouble might arise.     He thought, therefore, that in stating theposition to the Dominions, we should be careful to useimpartial and judicial language.The Prime Minister agreed that the Dominions must begiven a free choice in the matter.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreedthat the procedure followed in the constitutional crisislast December would be a good precedent on the present occasion.     He also agreed that it would be very importantwhen the time came to make a public announcement that the
Government should be able to say that they had reached their conclusions in consultation with all the othermembers of the Commonwealth, and that the conclusion wasa Commonwealth conclusion voluntarily reached by each member3The Home Secretary pointed out that in December lastthe communications with the Dominions started by telegrams from Prime Minister to Prime Minister.      In the present case, however, It would be necessary to indicate the viewsof the United Kingdom Government.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreedthat on the present occasion it would be unnecessary to open the communications with the Dominions by telegrams from Prime Minister to Prime Minister as was done inDecember.      The communication would have to indicate theprovisional views reached by the United Kingdom Government.at the same time- making it clear that that Government di-inot propose to reach any final conclusion until the viewsof all the other Dominions had been ascertained.The Home Secretary pointed out that Mr.  de Valera,while reluctant to circulate the texts of his Acts to theother Dominions, had agreed that the United Kingdom government:.-ment should be free to send what information they wished toall the other Dominions as well as any views which they themselves held and thought the other Dominions ought to be aware of.      This arrangement would facilitate the proposedcommunication to the Dominions and would enable us toemphasise to them considerations such as those in (3) and(4) of the Report of the Irish Situation Committee.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that our case on papermight appear to&apos;be a much weaker one than it was in actualfact, but the remarkable thing was that i/Ir. de valera had been able to persuade his supporters to go so far in accepting the Crown as they had done.      He also thought
that the Cabinet were very much indebted to the SecretaryOf State for Dominion Affairs for the way in which hehad conducted these very difficult negotiations.The Prime Minister entirely agreed with the lord privy Seal and cordially thanked the Secretary . of State forDominion Affairs on behalf of the Cabinet.The Lord Chancellor enquired whether the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs thought that if we now told the other Dominions that we were prepared,  if they agreed,&quot;to regard the fundamental position of the Irish FreeStat,e as a Dominion as not altered by the Irish FreeState Constitutional legislation&quot;, there would be any prospect of Mr. de Valera altering the language of hislegislation or subscribing to an Imperial ConferenceDeclaration as contemplated in (3)  and (4)  of CP. 23 (37 ) tWould it not be better to say to the Dominions something to the effect that, provided Mr. de Valera altered hislegislation and subscribed to an Imperial ConferenceDeclaration, we should then be prepared,  if the otherDominions also agreed, to regard the fundamental positionof the Irish Free State as a Dominion as not altered bythe recent Constitutional legislation.      It would be opento us to explain to the other Dominions that, while wewere ready to regard the statements which had been madeby Mr. de Valera on the subject in public and in conversa-tions with the Secretary as satisfactory, we could not regard the position as expressed by Mr. de Valera in hislegislation and as contemplated by him in his newConstitution as anytning but very unsatisfactory, and weshould therefore regard it as of very great importance,that the language of his legislation should be altered.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs did notthink that the Lord Chancellor&apos;s proposal would facilitate
the reaching of an agreed conclusion.     Mr. de Valera hadundoubtedly been impressed with the arguments in favour of amendment of his legislation and we should continue to urge--the adoption of our suggested alterations.     The Governmentsof the Commonwealth of Australia, and possibly of otherDominions, might be informally approached with a view tothose Governments independently urging Mr. de Valera toamend his legislation, for example, by retaining Article 1of the present Irish Free State Constitution.     He agreedthat it might be easier for Mr. de Valera to take thiscourse if he received representations on the subject fromthe other Dominions.The Secretary of State for India hoped that in anycase we should not say that we regarded Mr. de Valera&apos;snew legislation as unobjectionable.     He himself thoughtthat it was most objectionable, and as he had stated at theMeeting of the Irish Situation Committee he was particularly concerned as to the possible effect of the legislation onnationalist opinion in India.     At the same time the only question seemed to be whether the legislation was soobjectionable that we must regard the Irish Free State as no longer a Member of the Commonwealth of Nations.      he felt obliged to agree with the Irish Situation Committeethat we could not regard the fundamental position of theIrish Free State as a Dominion as having been altered bythe legislation.The Prime Minister said that he could not see whatalternative was open to us, and he     entirely    agreed withthe view just expressed by the Secretary of State for India.It was impossible to forecast whether Mr. de Valera intendedto remain permanently within the Commonwealth on the basisof his new legislation or whether it was his object to use his new position as a lever to secure even more far-reaching
concessions hereafter.     He thought that we were justifiedin stretching a point in order to keep the Irish FreeState within the Commonwealth, &quot;but we might well arriveat a position where we could make no further concessions.The Irish Situation Gommittee had unanimously reached theconclusion that in view of all the circumstances it was open to us at the moment to regard the fundamental positionof the Irish Free State as a Dominion as not having been altered by the new legislation.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence thoughtthat it would be very significant if the Irish Free state was officially represented at the Coronation.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries pointedout that after some discussion, the Irish situation committee had adopted the expression &quot;the fundamentalposition of the Irish Free State&quot;, the point being that by the use of these words it was thought that the Irish&quot;Free State would be preserved as a Member of the ..The Lord Chancellor suggested an alteration of the wording of (2)  of CP. 23 (37) to meet the point made byhim earlier in the discussion.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not regard the recommendations in CP. 23 (37) as laying down the precise words to be used in the communications to theDominions. In the expression &quot;to regard the fundamentalposition of the Irish Free State as a Dominion&quot; the word&quot;regard&quot; signified that we would be prepared to waive ourobjections. In deciding whether the policy now proposed was wise or unwise, the only possible alternative, namelya resort to threats, was no- solution. We might say that so far as the United Kingdom was concerned we refused to
regard the Irish Free State as a member of the Commonwealth,but it was certain that we could not turn the Irish FreeState out of the Commonwealth by any unilateral action onour part, and that the agreement of all the other dominions in this course would be necessary.      He (the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer) ejid not, however, think that it would bepossible for the rest of the Commonwealth to exclude theIrish Free &apos;.:tate by reason only of the very limited effectof the new legislation in regard to the internal affairs of the Free State,      If, however, Mr. de Valera had gonefurther and had excluded the Crown from the external affairs of the Free State, his own view would have been a differentone.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat the proposed message te the Dominions would have to bevery carefully drafted, and he proposed that it. should bedispatch.      He agreed that ultimately it would be necessaryto publish all the communications on the subject with theDominions in a White Paper.      Mr. de Valera knew that itwas our intention to communicate with the Dominions,  andit seemed desirable that he should be made acquainted withthe -general line we had adopted and with the tentativeconclusions reached.      By so doing his decisions in regardto other urgent matters, e.g. Irish Free State represent-ation at the Coronation, would probably be facilitated.The Cabinet agreed :(l) To approve the recommendations containedin the Report of the Irish situation committee (CP.  23 (37)) as set out onthe first page of this conclusion.(2) To take note that the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs would submit to theIrish Situation Committee for consideration and approval, the draft messages to be sentto the Dominions as contemplated inRecommendation (2)  of CP, S3 (37)).  andalso the draft message to be sent to theIrish Free State.considered and approved by the Irish/Free Otato before
PROPOSED 2.        The Secretary of State for Air explained to theRAFTORY AT Cabinet the position in regard to the proposal to erect&quot;WALTHAMT BERKS. an aircraft factory at White Waltham.      This factorywas one of those to be provided and owned by theGovernment but run by a motor firm under the shadowindustry scheme.      In determining the sites of these factories there were two fundamental conditions (i) the site must be reasonably secure from hostile attack,and (ii) the site must be in a place where the firmmanaging the factory are prepared to run it.In the present case the managing firm, Rootes Ltd.,decided after exhaustive review of other sites that theWhite Waltham site was the best.      The site adjoined an existing aerodrome and Rootes Ltd. were satisfied thatan adequate supply of suitable labour was available inthe district.      The Air Staff had satisfied themselves that the site was reasonably secure and was suitable inother respects.      A decision was very urgently required as the output of air frames of a particular type, whichthis factory was designed to supply, was greatly in arrear, and -fe*rertr further delay in proceeding with thematter would have given rise to a serious position..Rootes Ltd. definitely declined to run the factoryif it was situated in. South Wales on account of theirfear of labour troubles.     A suggestion had been made that the factory should be placed on the North Last coast,but the Air Staff regarded this area as less satisfactoryfrom the security point of view, and did not encouragefirms to go there.     The position which had arisen inregard to Billingham exemplified the objections tolocating war-time factories in this particular ai^a,
White Waltham, on the other hand, had very goodcommunications &quot;both with Bristol and Coventry, the AirMinistry had already acquired part of the site, plans forthe factory had been approved? and other steps taken forits speedy erection.The Chancellor of the Lxehequer pointed out that he had raised objections to the suggestion that this factory shouldbe placed at White Valtham when the proposal first came before him.      He had reluctantly acquiesced after the AirMinistry had assured him that this was the best of &quot;thepossible sites.Opinion in the House of Commons on the matter wasvery strong and the Parliamentary Secretary to the treasury had expressed the opinion that the Government would haveto give way.      He (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)suggested that the matter should be considered by a Cabine!&quot;Committee.The Prime Minister agreed with this suggestion.      Itwould be necessary to take into account the politicalasxoects of the matter.      It appeared that there would bevery little, if any, support for the proposal from any quarter of the House of Commons.The Cabinet agreed.-(1) That a Cabinet Committee composed asfollows?The Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for Air,The Minister for Co-ordin ation otDefence,The Minister of Agriculture andFisheries,The Minister of Labour, andThe First Commissioner of Works,should consider the question of the proposedaircraft factory at White Waltham.-IS-
(2) That the First Meeting of the Committeeshould, he held in the Prime Minister&apos;room at the House of Commons at 5 p.m,that evening, Monday, January 25th, 1937.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.January 25th, 1937.
