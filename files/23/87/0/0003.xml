I&apos;HE INTER-NATIONA.LSITUATION.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(36), Con-elusion 6. )ft2. As this was the first meeting of the Cabinetin the New Year the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs made a brief statement on the international situation.    This, he said, was likely to be a criticalyear in foreign affairs.    Many reports reaching theForeign Office indicated that Germany was unable to face the prospect of another winter in conditions similar tothose existing there today.    It looked, therefore, as though this year would determine Germany in following a policy alternatively of co-operation or foreignadventure.    There were two schools of thought in Germany.The first and more cautious school included the Army,the Foreign Office and, among others, Dr.  Schacht.The second and more aggressive school of thought wasthe Nazi Party.    Our object must be to try and restrain the latter.    This, he thought, could/be achieved by ourpresent policy of being firm but always ready to talk.There was one means by which assistance could be givento the Foreign Office in their difficult task.    anything that would tend to show both our determination to pressforward with our armament policy and that the programmes were proceeding satisfactorily would have a steadyingeffect.    For example, if, before Herr Hitler made his statement to the Reichstag on January 30th, the Ministerfor Co-ordination of Defence (who unfortunately was absentindisposed) could make any encouraging statement on theexecution of our programmes it might tell in our favour.The Lord Privy Seal said that one of the difficultiesin the situation arose out of the contrast between thenature of the contacts we had established with theFrench and German Governments respectively. With Franceour contacts were very good, and this was satisfactory,but with Germany they were very tenuous.    Probably theForeign Secretary could write privately to M. Delbos,if he wished, without causing any trouble;   but he
certainly could not do so to the German Foreign Secretarywithout arousing all kinds of difficulties.    All thatseemed to him unwholesome.    He would like the Foreigng Secretary to consider whether means could he devised toimprove our contacts with Germany..   In the Spanish affairhe thought that the Germans had some justification fortheir resentment against the sympathy expressed for france in this country and the criticism of Germany.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he did not, as a matter of fact, correspond withM. Delbos.    The official contacts between this countryand Germany were the same as those with France.    In theSpanish affair he agreed that the French, as well as theGermans, were at fault, and it had not been the ForeignOffice aim to blacken Germany in this matter.    A distinc-tion between the two Governments, however, was that france had always been ready to stop allowing volunteers to goif other countries would.    In the case of the ChristmasEve Note it had been difficult to avoid sending a jointcommunication with France for the reason that the FrenchGovernment had wanted to take an initiative themselves.He agreed, however, with the Lord Privy Seal in a desireto improve contacts with Germany.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed out thatthe difference in the systems of government in France andGermany made closer contacts more difficult.    There were really only two people in Germany who counted for much,namely, Herr Hitler and General Goering.    He himself hadbeen somewhat horrified by the extent to which volunteershad crossed the frontier from France into Spain.    Therewas, however, a difference between France and Germany$ in so much as German volunteers were organised and armed,whereas the French volunteers were unarmed.
The Secretary of State for Air said that theRussians were really the counterpart of the Germans and italians.    They had sent a great deal of material to theSpanish Government, and some personnel.    It wasjdifficultto get accurate information from Spain, especially fromGeneral Franco&apos;s side, hut he had received a certainamount, some of which was rather encouraging.    It was estimated that the Germans and Italians had put about200 aeroplanes altogether into Spain.    He did not know the number of Russian aeroplanes.    The.Russian fighters had proved very superior, but, notwithstanding this, hewas advised that they were/ inferior in performance to our&quot;Gauntlet&quot; aeroplane, of which there were large numbers in the Royal Air Force.    Moreover, the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; aero-plane was not the last word in Fighters.    The Ru-ooi-aas-Fighters/j/vere inferior to our own &quot;Fury&quot; Class.    the tactics of the Russians had been described as inferior,which confirmed reports apart from the Spanish affair.Nevertheless, they had established a superiority overthe Bombers of the other side.    Latterly the germans and Italians had sent some better Bombers.    The GermanFighters had not been very good.    In   fact, his info ma-tion from Germany was that their new Fighters were only just coming forward, and it was quite wrong to suppose that at the present time the Germans could enter a warwith an ultra modern force in this respect.    So far asthe war in the air was concerned it appeared that it wasbeing fought out not by up-to-date aeroplanes but bymachines of a lower order.    The Italian Bombers had notbeen effective in bombing trenches, .though of course the?/had dropped bombs on Madrid with some effect.    He had heard no suggestions of any failure in the willingness to attack of any of the foreign personnel in Spain.
The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled atelegram (No. 46 (Saving) from Yugoslavia) reporting* a conversation &quot;between Prince Paul and the InfanteAlfonso, who knew a great deal about aviation in Europe.The Infante had said that the Italians made the bestpilots, and that thev had brought down 53 Frenchmachines compared with 9 Italian machines brought downby the French.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the information in the Foreign Officeconfirmed the excellence of the Italian pilots.Some discussion then took place as to the desiresof the Lord Privy Seal for improving contacts with GermanThe First Lord of the Admiralty pointed out thedifficulty of improving matters.    It was perhaps almostinevitable that our people tended to look at some ofthese questions through French spectacles, owing to the close contacts ^-t*e-&amp;*&amp;&amp;s- of the two countries;    forexample, In the case of volunteering and the allegedGerman penetration of Spanish Morocco.    In the latter case especially almost everyone had believed the storiesfrom French sources, but when enquiries came to be madethey had turned out to be almost a maresnest.    He thought,however, it was important to keep recent events in mind and to be very cautious in future about accepting suchrumours.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, -whileagreeing in the difficulties that had been mentioned,said that he was making as much use as possible of theGerman Ambassador, Hen Ribbentrop.    The latter would* return shortly from Berlin and he would hear more of theposition.
The Prime Minister said that he shared the desireexpressed by several of his colleagues for improvingrelations with Germany, and he knew that this was everpresent to the mind of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs.    The difficulties,    however, were very real.
THE DEFENCE 3.  In the course of the discussion on Foreign% PROGRAMME.Affairs referred to in the preceding Conclusion, a(Previous request was made that in this critical year the cabinet reference:Cabinet 63     might be given information at rather shorter intervals(36), Con-clusions 2     as to progress with the armaments programme.and 4.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that theinformation given should be in the form of an estimateof the probable position by a certain date, and that theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Chiefs ofStaff Committee might consider the best date.The First Lord of the Admiralty recalled that aIPaper somewhat on these lines had been prepared not long ago for the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Prime Minister instructed theSecretary to draw the attention ofthe Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence to the desire of the cabinet for further and more frequent informa-tion.
GERMANY. 4. The Secretary of State for Air informed theCabinet that he had approved the acceptance by certainVisit ofOfficers Officers of the Air Staff of an invitation to visit of the AirStaff. Germany.    This would be in return for a visit paid by certain Officers of the German Air Force last year.-8-
ffi situation SPAIN.(previous reference:Cf ) inet 75 (36)Conclusion 3.)vanish Morocco.5.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that consideration was being given to what could be done to check the despatch of volunteers to Spain independently of the co-operation of theparties to the Spanish struggle.     A plan was being-worked out between the Foreign Office and theAdmiralty.     He could reassure the Cabinet that it did not involve independent action by this country.The Non-intervention Committee had met twice on theprevious day and had made good progress, especially atthe morning meeting when the co-operation ofmembers had. been good.     The Committee had formulateds4x/questions to the Governments concerned whichshould elicit the position of the differentGovernments.     At the afternoon meeting, whenquestions connected with Spanish gold had beendiscussed, greater difficulties had been encountered.He had not yet received any reply fromthe German and Italian Governments to his recentNote.     The first reactions in these countries hadbeen favourable.     The French were in agreement,but the Russian Government were somewhat non-forthcoming.     He could not forecast when theofficial replies would be received.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the French Ambassador had recentlyinformed him of the anxieties of the FrenchGovernment as to German activities in spanish morocco.     The attitude of the French Press had also been very excitable.     Before Christmas hehad called for information from our consular representatives and, on receiving the Frenchinformation, he had asked for an immediate report.- 9 -
The Foreign Office had also suggested that &quot;The Times&quot;should send a Special Correspondent.     The BritishConsulate at Tetuan did not confirm the French reportshut,  just before the end of the year, a German ship had landed war material and personnel at Melilla,    Thelatter were believed to consist largely of airmen.(The Secretary of State for Air interpolated thatGeneral Franco&apos;s forces were, in fact, being used tobombard ports in the south of Spain from spanish morocco.)     The German Government had now givendefinite assurances to the British and FrenchAmbassadors that they had no designs in spanish morocco*     His own view was that the French attitude had not been justified, but ^sfea^s no harm had beend^cL^ fi^rhaJjL^   l&amp;h^t qfoc*-done aas^the resentment in France v/ould tend to warn the German Government against anything of the kind.It had to be remembered also that German economic activity in Spanish Morocco was very great, and that large amounts of iron ore required for theconstruction of German armaments were being shipped toGermany.
ITALIAN WHEAT     6.        The Cabinet took note of a MemorandumIMPORTS.circulated by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (CP.-5 (37)) showing that the recentlarge imports of wheat into Italy might be attributed to a considerable extent to the deficiency in the Italian harvest for 1936, tothe depletion of stocks during the &quot;sanctions&quot;period, and perhaps to a feeling on the part ofthe Italian Government that it was undesirable to take any risks in the present uncertain stateof international relations.
7.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-8(37)) reporting that on a number of occasions theEelgian Prime Minister had asked, him whether thesupply of munitions to Belgium from tne UnitedKingdom could be discussed by the two Governments.The Secretary of State recommended that, on political grounds, the Cabinet should authorise conversations between the Belgian Miliitary Attache and tne *VarOffice in order to ascertain exactly what the Belgianrequest amounted to, and to endeavour in every possible way to meet it.    He suggested, with theconcurrence of the Secretary of State for war, tnatthe Belgian Military Attache should be invited  (l) To state the Eelgian Government&apos;s requirements in detail;    and(2) To explain whether it is a matter of immediate purchases or whether it isa matter of making arrangements nowwhereby purchases  could be made inthe event of war.The Cabinet approved the above proposals
8.    The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs on the subject of Irisn Free State Constitu-tional Legislation:-C.P.-4 (37),  circulating for the informa-tion of his colleagues the full texts ofthe two Acts passed by the Irisn FreeState Dail in connection with tne abdica-tion of King Edward VIII.    The first Act(Annex I) made a number of importantmodifications in the Irish Free StateConstitution, involving the deletion ofall references to tne King (except inArticle 51, where he is now referred&apos;toas an &quot;organ&quot; to be used for certainpurposes connected with external relations),and hence the elimination of all his functions in the internal affairs of theFree State, and the abolition of tneGovernor-General.    The second Act (Annex II),which gave legal effect to the abdicationof King Edward VIII,  contained provisions relating to the execution hy His presentMajesty of certain functions in relationto the external affairs of tne Irish FreeState.   The effect of the amendments madeby the former Act appeared in Annex III.C.P.-4A (3 7)  circulating copies of extracts from the Official Report of tne Irish FreeState Dail for the 11th and 12th December.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs recalled that, at the meeting referred to in the margin,the Cabinet had decided that he should ask such questions as he might deem desirable of Mr. de Valera in order toobtain further information..     Instead of doing thisthrough official channels, he proposed to takeadvantage of the presence of Mr, de Valera in london on the morrow to see him personally, after which he hoped to be able to submit a memorandum.The Prime Minister suggested that the time had come when the matter should be discussed also withthe Prime Minister of Northern Ireland.
In a short discussion on the proposal, it wassuggested that a consultation with the Prime Ministerof Northern Ireland should precede a consultation withthe other Dominions, since Northern Ireland was a partof the United Kingdom and it was important not only toascertain what information they had as to what had occurred, hut also their views as to the future and what was to he done.     A strong desire was also expressed that the Prime Minister himself should seeLord Craigavon. A suggestion was made that if theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs were to see Mr. de Valera and the Prime Minister, lord craigavon, a good deal of speculation might hearoused.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said he would do his hest to avoid publicity in his conversation with Mr. de Valera, although this wouldbe difficult.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs thathe should see Mr. de Valera, whowould be passing through London onthe morrow.(b) That the Prime Minister should invitethe Prime Minister of NorthernIreland to visit this country in thenear future, and should not onlydiscuss matters personally with him,but should also invite him to theIrish Situation Committee *
9.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for tne Colonies (C.P.-1 (37))circulating an appreciation by the High Commissionerfor Palestine of the internal situation in thatcountry, and other correspondence.    Tnis appreciationconfirmed the viev; the Secretary of State had formedas to the non-political character of tne acts ofbrigandage which had been taking place, and also asto the improbability of any serious general disorder in Palestine until the Report of the Royal commission had been received and the intentions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, based upon that Report, were made known.He warned his  colleagues, however, that very strongaction might have to be taken if disorders again broke out after publication of the Royal Commission&apos;s Report.Supplementing his memorandum, the Secretaryof State for the Colonies reported that, according toPress information, the evidence of the Arab Leadersbefore the Royal Commission indicated that the Arabsmeant to provide the Government of Palestine.     Therewere present three aspirants to govern in Palestine,the Arab Mufti, the Jewish Agency and the BritishGovernmente     All appeared to agree that, after theReport of thepublication of the/Royal Commission, trouble was certain to arise.     The Jews had now obtained somearms and rather resented the suggestion that theyhad sheltered   under the protection of the british forces during the last rising.     The Arabs hadretained many arms.     It was not likely, however,that the outbreak would arise before Easter.     if and when the trouble came, it was necessary to takethe most drastic action from the first possible moment.
The Secretary of State for War said thatthis had always been, the War Office view and he hopedthat in the event of trouble, the High Cornmissionerwould at once delegate responsibility to theGeneral Officer Commanding.The Secretary of State for Air said that air Vice-Marshal Peirse, who had commanded inPalestine at the outset of the troubles, had only recently returned and confirmed that on thepublication of the Royal Commission&apos;s report and the Governments decisions thereon, there wouldbe a renewed outbreak.     Provided immediate action was taken, he thought that a Division of troops would be sufficient to get the situation in hand.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs suggested that all concerned should be warned ofour intention to act drastically.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesrecalled that Field Marshal Plumer used to send forthe Arab Mufti and warn him that if there weretrouble, he would be held personally responsible.He added that his own intention was to keep theCabinet very fully informed on the developments of the situation.
10, Tiie Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Scotland(H.A.-1 (37))   covering the draft Harbours, Piers andPerries (Scotland) Bill, tne objects of which wereto secure the maintenance of adequate means of cominu-communication by sea, especially in the Highlands and islands where many Piers were provided by Proprietorsof Estates who cannot now keep them in proper repairor by County Councils whose rating powers were nowinadequate for maintenance purposes;    and to make it easier for Pier and Harbour Authorities to obtainpowers (such as were provided for England by the fishery Harbours Act, 1915) for the construction ofnew works and other purposes.
