SPAIN.(previous reference:&apos; Cabinet 2(37), Con-clusion 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that as the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was in Geneva he had invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of state to attend the Cabinet for the items concerningforeign affairs.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State forForeign Affairs said that so far as military opera-tions in Spain were concerned there still appearedto be a stalemate.    The Foreign Office were stillreceiving reports of departures of volunteers from italy, which were difficult to confirm in detail.So far as the political stuation was concerned,the German and Italian replies on the question ofvolunteering were considered by the Foreign Officeto be fairly satisfactory, but they stipulated that agreement should be reached on various matters.These would come before the Non-intervention Commit-tee on the morrow, when a scheme of control would be under consideration.    This could not be settled at thefirst meeting as the scheme was a new one and wouldhave to be referred by the representatives to theirrespective Governments.So far as the repatriation of volunteers serving in Spain was concerned, the Foreign Office had hitherto thought it would be impossible to produce a scheme which would allay the mutual suspicions ofthe various Governments.    At the meeting of the Non-intervention Committee he understood that the Earl ofPlymouth would ask the German and Italian repre-sentatives how they proposed that this should becarried out. -// ,      nl   ^In reply to a question he said that/the Germanand Italian governments principal desire at present
was that there should not be a Bolshevist Governmentin Spain.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat this was less than their original aim, whichhad been a victory for General Franco.
AFGHANISTAN.Export Creditsfor-(previous reference:Cabinet 45(34), Con-elusion 8. )2.  The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Export Credits forAfghanistan:-A Joint Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State &quot;for India (CP.-26(37)) setting out the historicalbackground of a request by the AfghanGovernment for credits for the purchaseof British goods, and the reasons which led them to make the following recommend-ations:-(i) That the Cabinet should acceptthe view that the machinery ofthe Export Credits guarantee department should be applied to united Kingdom exports to afghanistan:(ii) That the Afghan Prime Minister,during his forthcoming visit,should, if necessary, be informed of this decision;   and(iii) That the Departments concerned should be instructed to work out a scheme for implementing thisdecision.......A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-32 (37)) commentingadversely on the above proposal, whichhe considered to be wrong in principle.In support of this view he attached aMemorandum by the Secretary of theDepartment of Overseas Trade, who,in the absence of the President ofthe Board of Trade, was the Ministerdirectly responsible for the export credits Guarantee Department.The Secretary of State for India said that thesuggestion in the Memorandum was that the export credits Guarantee Department should be authorisedto grant an export credit to Afghanistan up to 250,000.    He then proceeded to summarise the reasons why the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and himself attached the greatest importance to somethingbeing done to assist British trade with Afghanistan.He first reminded the Cabinet of the politicaltroubles through which Afghanistan had passed inrecent years.    The present King was a minor and thecontrol was in the hands of his uncles, who had
established a fairly stable administration.    Theywere anxious to improve the economic conditions oftheir country by increasing production.    The politicaland economic conditions of the country, however,rendered this difficult.    The Afghan Government found it essential to import (l) armaments, (2) machinery.They could only do this on credit.    Certain foreigncountries recognised the advantages of economicpenetration into countries like Afghanistan.    this applied   eq.ual.ly to Russia, Japan and Germany.Germany, for example, had given King Amanullah a credit of,.6,000,000 Reichsmarks, followed, after his/d?&amp;a4te^ by a second credit of 6,500,000 Reichs-maiks for machinery, and more recently by a further10,000,000 Reichsmarks.    The result was that the afghans had felt obliged to turn towards Germany forthe realisation of their objects.    Recently aGerman-Afghan Company had been formed for thedevelopment of the mineral resources of the country.In explanation of the German attitude he drew attention to the following extract from a Memorandumon the Balance of Payments of the United Kingdom(CP.-339 (36)) by the Chief Economic Adviser to his majesty&apos;s  j e s ty&apos;s 6 ove government nt:-&quot;16.    In Asia, German exports havebeen greatly assisted by the readiness of their traders to undertake contracts for capital equipment on the basis of payment spread over a long period ofyears.    These contracts have.been financedin Germany by advances from the GermanBanks backed by Government guarantees.Such contracts are attractive to theGerman industrialists, as they therebyaoquire a credit in foreign currencyagainst a liability in Reichsmarks,which they no doubt hope one of thesedays to liquidate on profitable terms.The business undertaken would, in manycases, be regarded as risky by the moreconservative &quot;financiers in this country,but hitherto it has apparently provedsuccessful, and there have been remarkablyfew bad debts to write off&quot;.
In contrast he gave a farther quotation from thesame Memorandum to illustrate the attitude of theExport Credits Guarantee Department&quot;The Export&quot;Credits Department, whichshould assist in carrying risks, hasbeen perhaps unduly influenced bybanking principles and has hesitatedto underwrite business in countries such as China, where information asto credit risks is difficult to obtain&quot;.Prom the point of view of Afghanistan he himselfagreed with the above-quoted statements.    TheGovernment of Afghanistan, though not willingly,was finding itself obliged to turn more and more toGermany.    Some of the Ministers had spent some timein Germany, where they had undergone successfulsurgical operations.    The effect of all this on british trade with Afghanistan was disastrous.Precise statistics were difficult to obtain, but,according to the head of the Ifetional Bank of afghanistan,the proportion of British trade had fallen in 25 years from 64% to 5% of the total offoreign trade.    The Government of India had done agood deal so far as armaments were concerned.    Theyhad established an Afghan Reserve Fund into whichthey paid  37,500 every year to accumulate up to 187,500.    In addition they had supplied Afghanistanwith 30,000 rifles and ammunition at a cost of 190,000, and aeroplanes at a cost of  30,000.The two latter items Jaad-boo-a delivered on creditterms, and in the event of a default in payment  which was not expected, however   the cost would fall on the Afghan Reserve Pund.    The Afghanspreferred to receive aid from the United Kingdomrather than from Germany, Russia or Japan.    ThePrime Minister of that country was about to pay a visit and would ask for assistance, and that wasthe reason for urgency in this matter.    So far as
India was concerned he was anxious that economicpenetration, especially by Germany, should not proceed.One result was that large numbers of Germans were brought into the country in the guise of experts.At present, for example, there were 90 Germans in afghanistan, which was far more than the nationals of any other country, and the establishment of the mineral resources Company would mean a further increase.    He need hardly develop the objections tothis penetration;    it was only necessary to recallthe embarrassment that we had encountered during theWar as the result of German economic penetration in persia.    He was also anxious to avoid the Hitler-Stalin vendetta being carried on on Afghan soil, as this would result in unrest affecting the North-west frontier of India.    He then quoted the following passage from the last paragraph of the Memorandum bythe Chief Economic Adviser to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment, as foilows:-&quot;We cannot expect our trade with therest of the world to expand at thesame rate, but we should do all wecan to maintain it&quot;;the final method, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross added,being as follows:-&quot;By organising a more extended use ofour Oredit resources through theExport Credits Guarantee department and, where possible, by means of market loans&quot;.In reply to a question, the Secretary of Statefor India explained that the credits were requirednot for arms and munitions which had been supplied by the Government of India, but for the provision ofmachinery.    He was aware, of course, that the export credits Guarantee Department was prohibited by act of&apos; Parliament from granting credits for purposes ofwar material.     He added that he did not under-estimate
the arguments in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;sMemorandum against the use of the machinery of theExport Credits Guarantee Department for these purposes.    He and the Foreign Secretary, however, werenot wedded to this particular form of machinery, hutasked for some kind of Eritish Government assistance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressed somesurprise at the concluding remark of the Secretary ofState for India to the effect that he was not weddedto the use of the Export Credits Guarantee Department,since that provided the main proposal in CP.-26 (37).He insisted on the importance of keeping distinct theeconomic and political aspects of the question, whichhad been rather confused in CP.-26 (37).    The bulkof his own Memorandum (CP.-32 (37)) had been devotedto the particular proposition as to the Export credits guarantee Department and the proposal that they shouldbe instructed to work out a scheme.    There was acertain haziness as to the nature of the orders whichthe Afghan Government desired to give.    He suspectedthat some of the machinery would be used for otherthan purely peaceful purposes.    After writing his ownMemorandum he had met the Secretary of the Departmentof Overseas Trade and had found him very seriouslyconcerned at the proposal, which was likely to bring to a rapid end the usefulness of the Export credits guarantee Department.Coming to the commercial side, the Cabinet were asked, in spite of the fact that Afghanistan&apos;s creditwas somewhat shaky and but little was known of theprospects, to assume that this proposal would be goodbusiness, first because other countries adopted it,and, second, because the Afghan situation had somewhatimp roved.    So far as the Memorandum by Sir frederick leith-Ross was concerned, the author had not had-7-
Afghanistan so much in mind, when he wrote it, as China.One result of his remarks had been that the export credits Guarantee Department, after studying1 his recommendations, had decided to send a representative to China to examine the question in detail.    If theDepartment did grant further credits to China thiswould be not for political reasons, but for the goodof British trade,    on that side the Export credits guarantee Department was as well informed as anyone else.    If they thought such guarantees were notjustifiable it would be outrageous for the Governmentto force them to grant them.    The only result would bethe resignation of the Advisory Committee, which was an essential part of the organisation.    He felt sure that the Cabinet could not accept that proposition.Turning to the political aspect, he thought thatif the political considerations side was strong enoughthere night be a case for doing something.    In facthe had contemplated this in his own Memorandum.    Hehad pointed out that it would require legislation, andhad put as his o^n vie-^ that it was not good business.If, however, the Secretaries of State for ForeignAffairs and India were prepared to abandon the export credits proposition and consider the matter in its political aspects and   put forward a proposal onthis basis, he was prepared to consider it.The Secretary of State for War recalled that onlya few years ago the danger to the North-West frontier of India had been considered as so serious that theService Departments had b?en told to prepare plans for this contingency.    The risk had since abated, butnight crop up again.    The Defence Minister of afghanistan-stan, whom he had seen on his arrival here fromGermany, had told him how anxious he was to improve relations with the United Kingdom and to come closer
to us instead of drifting apart.    Anything that wouldcoiibat foreign influence in Afghanistan would be valuable from the point of view of Imperial Defence.The First Lord of the Admiralty, who, as Secretaryof State in succession for Air, India and ForeignAffairs, had had to devote much stud?/ to thisquestion, expressed the hope that the political considerations would be taken into account.    Fromthis point of view it was essential to tighten therelations with Afghanistan.    He recalled that the inquiries of the Committee of Imperial Defence at theend of the last decade had shown how important it wasto get the Afghans to build roads so that the british army could come to their assistance.    The Report ofthe Defence of India Sub-Committee had shown that oneof the essentials to British policy in Asia was toimprove communications, but that the Afghans could notbe induced to do this without other concessions.The Secretary of State for Air agreed in this,and suggested that, if possible, the aid should begiven without legislation, since the House of commons would be sure to insist on conditions similar tothose imposed for export credits.    It was important,however, not to exclude arms from the credits.Would it not be possible, he asked, for the Governmentof India, which had already advanced money to afghanistan, to guarantee a credit to Afghanistan bythe Joint Stock Banks in London?    If this were done the orders would be controlled mutually by the AfghanGovernment and the Government of India.The Secretary of State for India did not think the Government of India would be willing to undertake this in addition to what they were already doing.
The Lord Privy Seal was impressed by the arguments on both sides.    It was easy to forget, but not long ago the Afghan boundary had been regarded as theAchilles&apos; Heel of the British Empire so far as landwarfare was concerned.    Only twenty years had elapsed since Afghanistan and Russia had been dangerously atloggerheads and our own relations with Afghanistan bad.The recent improvement in relations was due to what had been done by the Government here and by theGovernment of India.    He hoped, therefore, that the secretaries of State foi Foreign Affairs and Indiaand the Chancellor of the Exchequer would look intothe question.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he -;,ould do so,provided it was no-- approached from the political pointof view.    Formerly Afghanistan might have been regardedas our Achilles&apos; Keel, but at the present time,unfortunately, there were other danger points more seriously threatened.    The Government of India was much more concerned than we were, and could hardlyexpect to obtain much assistance from this country.The Secretary of State for India demurred to this,and pointed out how much India had already done.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That they could not accept the viewthat the machinery of the export credits Guarantee Department shouldbe applied to United Kingdom exportsto Afghanistan:(b) That the Secretaries of State forForeign Affairs and India and the(laejht^ ufi(L Chancellor of the Exchequer should/ * a place their Departments^/in contact(&amp;tt*7L j/        with a view to an examiration ofT*\e-cL-^ whether, from the political point ofview, it was desirable to take actionin some other form to promote british trade writh Afghanistan, and, if so,as to the form such assistance shouldtake:(c) That the consultations referred to in(b) should take place at once, in orderto anticipate the arrival next week ofthe Prime &quot;Minister of Afghanistan.
ROYAL(g FORCE.ity withe Germanir Force.reviousjeference:cabinet 29Ill^      3.     The Cabinet had before them a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Air (CP. 27 (37)quoting the principal relevant statements made in theHouse of Commons on the question of parity with theGerman Air Force, which made it clear that in(35))     assessing whether or not we were inferior to Germany5we had committed ourselves to taking as a standard of comparison the German Air Force and our MetropolitanAir Force.     The Secretary of State suggested that theproper interpretation of the Prime Minister&apos;s pledgeon this subject should be to the following effect:-We are determined that we will not beinferior in air strength at home to any country within striking distance of ourshores.     This implies -(i)   That we should build and maintain a defensive force adequate to meet any anticipated scale of attack.(ii)    That we should build and maintain a counter-offensive force not inferiorin power and efficiency to the offensive force of a foreign power/German offensive force.The Secretary of State for Air said it was important to get a decision on this question, owing toa Debate that was to take place in the House ofCommons the same afternoon.     He did not propose thatthe Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence should raise this issue himself, but if, as was probable, theprevious pledges were raised, he should be in aposition to deal with them.     He was anxious to getaway from the interpretation of the pledges asdenoting a mere comparison of British machine with german machine..     If, for example, he had carte blancheas to the Air Force, he would not make it identicalmachine for machine with that of Germany.     What hewould wish and what, in fact, the Air Council wereaiming at was the proper interpretation of the pledge
namely, that we should he in a sufficiently strong position strategically to provide our defensive needs0The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the following statement made by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Air in the House ofCommons on the 19th March, 1935:-&quot;There is a further point that I should like to emphasises     First-line strengthsform the readiest basis for a simplecomparison between air forces, but theyare far from being the only criteriono&quot;This he thought would be useful for quotation in the debate,,The Secretary of State for Air agreed and said that he himself had made statements to try and get rid of the idea of the mere counting of machinesas being the interpretation of parity0     Supposing,for example, we arrived again at a negotiation for an air Agreement, he did not believe that this could be arrived at on that basis.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed but thought it important not to include in our totalscertain machines that had not been counted hitherto,He entered a caveat in particular as to the inclusionof the Fleet Air Arm which might be treated by theHouse of Commons as &quot;window dressing&quot;.The Secretary of State for Air said theFleet Air Arm machines would not be included in hiscomputation0     He would include fighters and bombers,but, so far as this Debate was concerned, would keepthe position of the Fleet Air Arm as at present, evenif at some future date he might have something to sayon the question.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said he had no intention of raising this question
himself, but he thought it quite probable, in thecourse of the Debate, somebody might quote the earlierpledges and ask if we had parity on a simple test of numbers.     If that were asked, it would be competentfor him to reply that comparison of numbers was thefirst point to consider in the test, but that after that other factors entered into the calculations suchas the quality of the new machines.It was pointed out that such a statement would raise a considerable argument.     The Minister might,if he said this, be challenged on the figures and thequestion was how was he to meet it0       The answer that had been suggested was that he should begin bydiscussing the question of numbers and then should goon to discuss the quality of the machines.     It was atthis point that the statement by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Air might be quoted.The view was expressed that the general impression on the minds of Members of Parliament bythe previous statement was that they covered twopromises:    first, that we should not be in a positionof inferiority to any nation within range of theseshores;    and second, a sort of added guarantee ofnumerical equality.The Secretary of -State for Air pointed outthat the numerical comparison was misleading.   Germany,for example, had to provide a much larger number of army Co-Operation Squadrons, owing to the much greatersize of her Army.     We only provided seven Squadronsfor Army Co-Operation, but Germany would require very many more.     On the other hand, we ought to have morefighters than Germany.     There was alBO the case of theGerman aircraft ear-marked for use with the Fleet,which need not necessarily be counted.- 15 -
11 AIt was pjxLrited-outthat it would, he advisablenot to mention Army Go-Operation Squadrons, as itv/ould be suggested that these could be divertedfor use as bombers. It was proposed   that sofar as the Fleet Air Arm was concerned, it would besafer to deduct the numbers from Germany rather than to add our own figures.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that the questions likely to be raised might beput in the following form -Question 1: Do you recede from the pledge ofparity?Answer:   No.Question 2: Do you claim that at present you have equality with German first-line strength?The answer expected to this question would be &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, but itwould be possible to say that itincluded many other considerations,such as the Power against whom the comparison was made, types of machines, the relative strengths infighters and in bombing Squadrons.It could be added that what we require is an adequate fighter forceand an adequate offensive force.Reference might be made to theArmy Co-Operation Squadrons to illustrate the fallacy of merefigures.The First Lord of the Admiralty thoughtthat types of machines and reserves would be safer forpurposes of illustration.(The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs withdrew at this point.)The Lord President of the Council suggestedthat the formula given   at the end of CP. 27 (37)might be interpreted as substituting the word&quot;adequate&quot; for the word &quot;parity&quot;.     It was important for the Government to avoid the appearance of shiftingits ground.
The Secretary of State for Air agreed.      Ourreal intention was to have as effective a force asanything that could he brought against us.     Themethod as to how that was to be achieved was a matter for the Government.The Minister of Health said a statement ofthat kind might be interpreted as a whittling awayof clear pledges.The President of the Board of Education .saidthis would especially be the case if types of machines,were quoted for.purpose of illustration.The Secretary of State for Air said that upto the middle of 1938 all the information at the AirMinistryfs disposal satisfied him that both numericallyand in actual strength the Prime Minister&apos;s pledge would,in fact, be fulfilled by the scale to which the AirCouncilrs plans were directed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that astatement on those lines would lead to questions aboutthe position on particular dates.     He understood thatat present we were a long way behind Germany numerically.The Secretary of State for Air agreed that wewere somewhat behind on a purely numericalcalculation, but that this did not apply to comparativestrength.The Lord Chancellor suggested that theMinister for Co-Ordination of Defence had now heardsufficient to enable him to reply in the Debate.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that his intention was, if possible, to avoiddirect references to Germany.The Prime Minister thought that the minister might, with advantage, remind Members of the danger
of referring directly to Germany at a time when wewere trying to get on terms with that country.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said he would do his best to carry out the wishes ofthe Cabinet.

After drawing particular attention to certain of the conclusions and recommend-ations of the Committee, the Secretary of State saidthat in due course he would submit to the Cabinetconcrete proposals arising out of the Report, togetherwith an estimate of their cost.The Secretary of State for Air said that thereport contained two main propositions which wereclosely linked, viz.:-(l)    That the Government should for the timebeing accept responsibility for theprovision of radio facilities^(2)    That an exclusive licence should for alimited period he given to a singlecompany or combination of companies to operate certain main internal routes inthis countryoHe had anticipated acceptance of the first proposition,by   public opinion but a good deal of criticism againstthe second and he had deferred bringing the report before the Cabinet until some time after its publication.     As a matter of fact, the anticipatedcriticism had not materialised.     He suggested that heshould be authorised to discuss the financial aspectsof the proposal with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand, if the latter considered these to be reasonableon merits, he would see the companies operatingCivil Aviation on the routes proposed with a view to
their getting together.     At present, these companies were losing money.The Cabinet agreed:to the latter1       proposal and the Prime Ministerinvited the Secretary of State forAir, in due course, to make a further report to the Cabinet.

HYSICALRAINING ANDS CREATION.Draft white paper.PrevieusReference:Cabinet 57(36), Con-clusion 20, )11(27)11.7.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-24 (37)), as Chairmanof the Cabinet Committee on Physical Training, circu-lating for consideration a draft White Paper containing;a Statement of the Government&apos;s Proposals for extendingFacilities for Physical Training and Recreation.    Thedraft embodied the Committee&apos;s conclusions and recom-mendations, and if their proposals were approved they suggested that the Cabinet should authorise  (a) The iniiiediate presentation to Parliamentof the White Paper, and(b) The preparation of the necessary legis-lation.In the course of the discussion suggestions weremade for adding to the list cf bodies not solelyconcerned with physical training and recreation inparagraph 5(b) as follows:-By the Secretary of State for War.The British Cadet Association.By the Lord Chancellor,The Polytechnic.By the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries,Women1 s Institutes.Rural Community Councils.The latter Minister urged that some reference should be made to agricultural bodies.The President of the Board of Education pointedout that at the end of paragraph 5(b) there occurred thefollowing &quot; and various other similar organisations&quot;which was meant to cover such bodies as had been mentioned.      It was impossible to give a comprehensivelist and if the present list was not consideredsatisfactory it might be better to reduce it ratherthan to increase it.     He would consider the point.The First Commissioner of Works suggested some reference to athletics, which were important because

He suggested this addition inparagraph 5(a), line 3,  &quot;sports, athletics and games&quot;,and on page 4, line 2,  ;fswimming, athletics and otherphysical activities&quot;.The President of the Board of Education saidthat reference had been made elsewhere in the draft white Paper to &quot;athletic sports&quot;, but he undertook toconsider the point.The question was raised as to whether the white paper should not contain some reference to the questionof nutrition.      Nearly every speech (apart from thoseof members of the Government) which had been made onthe physical training proposals of the Government hadcontained some reference to nutrition as at least as important a factor as physical training and recreation in health. Moreover it was generally recognised that thesubject of nutrition would have to be takon up if only in connection with the distressed areas.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that all members of the Cabinet Committee realised the importanceof nutrition as affecting physical fitness.      nevertheless the subject had become a matter of Party controversy.The Labour Party were exploiting certain reports on thesubject for Party purposes.      If nutrition Was mentionedin the White Paper they would fasten on that point.His view, therefore, was that it would be better tokeep the two subjects distinct;    not to say thatnutrition was not of importance, but that it was a subject that required to be taken up separately.
The President of the Board of Education said thatwhen the White Paper was published he proposed to talkto the Press and to broadoast on the question.      he might take that opportunity to make a statement whichhe would draw up after consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord Privy Seal.      He was notaverse,    however, to an addition on the subject in theWhite Paper.The Home Secretary said that if the subject was mentioned in the broadcast and in the Press but nothing was said in the White Paper a position of some uncertainty would be created for the government supporters.The Lord President of the Council said that thereal issue was as to whether the position would bebetter if an explanation was made on the lines of theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s remarks in the white paper or whether it was reserved for the Press and the broadcast.The Minister of Labour was rather doubtful aboutincluding a reference to nutrition, but some othermembers of the Cabinet thought that a reference tothe subject in the final paragraph would be advisable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that onedifficulty was that the Government did not yet know what policy they were aiming at on nutrition.      Hethought, however,  it would be safe to add a paragraphstating that the Government recognised that nutritionwas vital to physical fitness., The Secretary of State for War hoped that ttieTerritorial Army would be represented on the National
Councils especially as requests might he made for theuse of their drill halls,  etc.      He did not asx forany reference to this in the White Paper.The Chancellor f*f the Exchequer reassured theLord Chancellor that certain existing bodies for promoing physical training would not be excluded from thepossibility ef grants.The Cabinet agreed:To atrorove the White Paper asattached to CP.  24(37) subject tothe incorporation of an appropriatereference to nutrition and to other suggestions of detail by Ministers,which where left to the Presidentof the Board of Education todecide.

The Committee suggested that ifr.R.kiC5j)/. these conclusions and recommenda-tions were approved, they shouldbe authorised to arrange for thepreparation of a draft Bill forconsideration in due course by theCommittee of Home Affairs and theCabinet:CP.-29 (37), in which suggestions were made on the question of thelimit on the number of secretaries of State and Under-Secretaries ofState sitting in the House of Commons.The Home Secretary gave the Cabinet a fullsummary of the proposals contained in both Reports.He pointed out that, if the Bill was passed, an interesting point would arise, since for the first time it would be necessary to define the term&quot;Cabinet Minister&quot;.    He thought that up to thepresent time the Cabinet had no status in theConstitution.The Secretary of State for India recalled thaton April 1st. the Secretary of State for Burma would come into existence.    He was not included in thaCabinet Committee1s list.    This, however, should bedone, though it might be advisable to include afootnote to explain that,so- long as the posts of secretary of State for India and Secretary of Statefor Burma were held by the same individual, only onesalary would be drawn.    A second point was that itwould be necessary to explain that if the under-Secretary of State for India was in the House ofLords, it would have to include the Under-Secretaryof State for Burma.ministers 17. The Cabinet had before them the followingReports by the Committee on Ministers&apos; Salaries,
The Minister ol Transport asked if the status ofCivil Servants was affected by the increase in the salaries of Ministers.    The Minister of Transport,for instance, was to have his salary increased.The Ministry was not to be raised to a status equalto that of the most important Departments, notwith-standing that the Minii ry was one of those modernDepartments that was of growing importance.The Prime Minister said that he did not proposeto ask the Cabinet to take a decision that day.There was a point, however, that he was anxious thatall his colleagues should think over before the next meeting, namely, the question of whether this necessary reform ought to be applied during the-ationterm of the present Government.    A similar consider/arose in connection with the salary of the PrimeMinister.    The responsibilities of the Prime minister were such that they could not be converted into termsof money.    It was an open secret that before longthere would be a change in the Head of the Government.Would it be an advantage for the new Prime Minister-to begin by accepting the proposed increase in salary, or would it perhaps be wiser and safer tomake&apos;provision in the new Bill that it should not take effect until after the next General Election?The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the decision ofprinciple until a later Meeting:(b) In the meanwhile parliamentary counsel should be instructed.to draft a Bill.-
