SPAINjctervent ionjjqjjriix 11 e e *proposed ^legislation.(previous reference:Cabinet 9(37) , Con-conclusion 1.)1.   At the request of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs the Earl of Plymouth, as chairman of the International Non-intervention committee on Spain,was invited to attend the Cabinet,and made a statement on the present position.    he explained that legislation was required to implement the International Agreement.    The matter was one ofgreat urgency.    A preliminary draft of the Bill hadFR. 13(37) 1.    accordingly been prepared, the effect of which was toimpose certain obligations on masters of british merchant ships.    The Bill, however, was not quitecomplete, as agreement had still to be reached on certain points.   He hoped that this would occur at aMeeting arranged for Friday next.   His idea was thatthe International Agreement should be issued toParliament as a White Paper.    It was not possible to start, the international scheme on Saturday, March 6thas originally anticipatedbut he hoped, it would bepossible very shortly.    Consequently the Bill oughtto be passed into law either next week or by themiddle of the following week.    In reply to questionshe said that the Government Departments concerned,were being consulted about the Bill.   The Board, ofTrade was the Department mainly interested.   The&apos;Billwoul^1 be in four or five Clauses, and. should not, hethought, be very controversial.   He thought it mightbe introduced in the House of Lords .The President of the Board of Trade said, thatthe Bill was the least harmful way of dealing with avery difficult situation.    On the whole he thought itmight perhaps be passed through the House of commons in a single afternoon.The Prime Minister sai^ that the house of Commonsprogramme was very full, and in order to find time forthis urgent measure it might&apos;be necessary to jettisonother fiu.sines\s u
The Lord Privy Seal, as Leader of the House ofbonds, said, that if agreement, were reached by theInternational Committee on Friday he would, not exclude the possibility that the House of Lords might be ableto pass all stages of the Bill on the following Tuesday.They could not be aske^. to do this, however, unlessthe House of Commons would treat the Bill as of equalurgency .The Prime Minister said that he would consult the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury as to thepossibility of getting an agreed Bill and1 so being ableto treat the matter in the House of Commons as a matterof exceptional urgency.   The Bill ought to be examined,by the Committee of Home Affairs, which he understoodwould be meeting next Monday.The Earl of Plymouth said that as the Bill couldnot be completed until Friday he might have to circulateit in its present incomplete form to the Committee ofHome Affairs .The Cabinet agreed   a -       .( a) That t4ae--&amp;e^&amp;&amp;t.vry ..of. St^-t-o-for- -Pe-r-ei-gnA^ a4r&amp;s should prepare a Non-interventionBill in as advanced a state as was possibleprior to the settlement of final details bythe International Non-intervention Committee,for consideration by the Committee of HomeAffairs on Monday, March 8th:(b) That, subject to approval of the Billby the Committee of Home Affairs, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should he authorised to arrange for theintroduction of the Bill in the House ofLords without any further decision by theCabinet:( c)  That the Prime Minister should make enquiries as to whether it would bepossible to secure that the Bill should,be treated in the House of Commons as an agreed measure and. passed rapidly, inwhich case he should inform the lord privy Seal, who should try and arrangefor its expeditious passage throueh theHouse of Lords.(The Earl of Plymouth withdrew ,)
SPA-IN. 2.   The Cabinet had before them the following&apos;.1^6 Position of documents:-british  Mining&quot;,;r,panies in a Memorandum by the Secretary of Stateinsurgent for Foreign Affairs (CP. -80 (37))Territory. calling attention to the serious position which had arisen from the action of theSpanish insurgent authorities in requisi-(Previous tioning the products of the mines ofReference: Rio Tinto Co., Ltd., the Tharsis CopperCabinet 9 and Sulphur Co.  and certain other  cbn-(37), Con- cerns,    partly for their own use andelusion 1.) partly for export to Germany and Italy,/   \ under pressure from those countries.Fft. N (.&quot;.)- The Secretary of State suggested that theUnited Kingdom had the power to end this state of affairs without too much troubleby making use of warships to intercept anyship carrying such products to Germany orItaly, and that General Franco should beinformed that we were ready to applycompulsory measures.    This course shouldnot be embarked upon, however, withoutclear determination to go through with it to the end:A Note by the First Lord of the Admiralty(CP.-82 (37)), who was prevented byillness from attending the Cabinet,covering a Memorandum prepared for himby the Naval Staff and pointing out thelegal difficulties and internationalcomplications arising from interferencewith other than British and Franco Govern-ment ships.    Germany and Italy would strongly resent any such interference, andit was therefore necessary to recognisethat the end of the course of actionsuggested might quite possibly be warwith Germany&apos;and Italy together.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsapologised for having been obliged to bring thisquestion up at very short notice.   He had felt, however,that he ought not to delay in giving the Cabinetcognizance of the matter.    It was only on the previous friday, on his return from a short vacation, that hethathad learned how bad the situation was, and/the matterhar1 been going on for some time .   The Members ofParliament for certain constituencies where works hadbeen closed down owing to fhe stoppage of pyritesI from Spain were aware of the situation, and it wassurprising that the matter ha-&quot;1 not already been raised in Parliament.    It was only since his Memorandum hadbeen written that he ha&apos;q been able to hold a
preliminary consultation with, his Legal Advisers.As the result he had decided not to ask for a decisiontoday on the proposal in his Memorandum for the eventual use of warships to intercept ships carryingproducts to Germany and Italy .   His difficulty wasthat, apart from this proposal, we had no bargainingweapons for putting pressure on General Franco.    to end the Trade Agreement recently concluded wiih theInsurgent Government at Burgos would damage thiscountry more than the Spanish insurgents.   While,therefore, he would not like to exclude the possibilitylater on of consideration being given to the proposal in his Memorandum, for the moment, the only decisionhe asked for was that he should be authorised to makevery strong representations to General Franco&apos;sGovernment, pointing out the effect which his action would have on our ultimate relations with Spain if heshould succeed., and pressing for redress to the british companies  concerned.In the course of a discussion on this proposalit was suggested that General Franco had the right to requisition the products of foreign Companies in returnfor compensation.    In these circumstances it was asked if it woul^ not oe advisable to confine action to a warning that, a claim would, be put. before some selectedinternational tribunal on the ground that the compensa-tion paid was not adequate.   A difficulty urged against this course was that to bring the insurgent government before an international tribunal would be tantamount to recognition.    It was suggested, however, that as general Franco&apos;s Government did function de factothe case might be met by holding over his head a claim for damages to be advance^ later on.    If he had any hope of success this should cause him to weigh thematter seriously.
Another suggestion was th?t, on a long view,there were a good many articles (e.g., oranges) inwhich Spain would be vulnerable if we were to denounce the existing Commercial Treaty.The President of the Board, of Trade agreed thatif we broke off the Spanish Treaty the prospects forSpain would be somewhat, grim.    In the long run Spaincould not dispense with something on those lines.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inreply to a question, said that two or three weeks agoSir Andrew Duncan had. reported to him on the serious-ness of the iron ore situation, and. had pointed outthat this was due partly to the world situation,partly to the fact that our own annual demand had now reached 14,000.000 tons as compared with a production of 13,000,000 tons, but partly also to the withholding of supplies by the Spanish insurgents .This had. led him to call the attention of the ForeignOffice, to the matter, and the Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in theabsence of the Secretary of State, had undertaken to look into it.   He gathered that although the position had not been submitted, to higher authority, it hadbeen within the knowledge of the Foreign Office.The iron ore aspects of the situation were seriousbecause so^e of the leading armament firms werethreatened with a shortage of steel.The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat it was not only iron ore that was in question,but, at the moment, pyrites.   He was informed thatsulphur was obtainable from other sources and. thatour re-armament was not held up for lack of thatcommodity.   He (like other members of the Cabinet)welcomed the new proposal of the Secretary of State
for Foreign Affair? as the suggestion in his Memo-random had caused him some concern.    It had to beremembered that we were dealing not only with theSpanish insurgents, but, behind them, with theGermans and. Italians.    General Franco was not a free agent.   Mo doubt he hoped to win, but hardlywithout assistance from the Germans and Italians.Consequently he was unlikely to agree to any under-taking which was unacceptable to the Germans and italians unless we were able to do something disagree-able to him in return.    The Germans and Italians wouldnot allow him to do so.   To insist up to the pointproposed in the Secretary of State&apos;s Memorandum,therefore, was not only useless but must lead to avery serious situation with Germany and. Italy.    if and. when General Franco had won the Civil War,however, the situation would he very different, and.no doubt he would be looking round for help fromother countries besides Germany and Italy.    Thatwould be the moment at which to put strong pressure upon him..   When that moment was reached, we ourselvesmight not. perhaps want iron ore so much;    but thatwould be the time for action.    This did not mean that, he favoured inaction.   His proposal was to:&apos;t\ake very strong representations to General Franco,to point out that his action was a breach of theSpanish ^treaty, an&quot;1 that he was not paying propercompensation to the British firms.    In other &quot;words,his proposal was not to threaten General Franco totne point of involving a risk of war, but to makevery strong representations.The President of the Board of ^rade agreed,with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;&quot; proposal.The original proposal had caused him great misgivings .
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should, be authorisedto moke strong representations toGeneral Franco&apos;s Government on thelrnes proposed in the course of the^discussion and to ask for redress tothe British Companies concerned:that he should draw up his  communi-caticn in consultation with thePresident of the Board, of Trade andany other Ministers specially con-cerned, and should show it. to thePrime Minister before despatch:(b) That the proposals for coercingGeneral Franco, discussed in cp.-SO (o7)  and C.P.-82 (3.7) ,need, not be discussed at the presenttime .
3.  In pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet again had before the:.- thefollowing documents on the question of the Govern-ment&apos;s attitude towards the Caledonian Power Order,1937, which related to a scheme of the British OxygenCompany to erect works for the production of calcium carbide and other materials at Corpach, in the WestHighlands:-A Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (CP.-55(37)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP.-60 (37)):A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP.-62 (37)):together with -A Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (CP.-75(37)) submitting a report on theDefence aspects of the question andon other matters arising on the Order,in which he stated, inter alia, thatit was a clear Service interest thatuninterrupted supplies of calcium carbide should be available- in thecountry in emergency:A Memorandum by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-79(37)) pointing out that the Anglo-Norwegian trade agreement of 1933 provided for dutyfree entry of calcium carbide from norway in return for the purchase inthis country by Norway of 70 per cent,of her coal requirements, and that ifit was now proposed to protect a newcalcium carbide industry in this country it would be difficult or impossible tosecure more favourable treatment forour coal.In the course of the discussion the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence emphasised that calcium carbide was essential for the construction of aircraft,for shipbuilding and many kinds of war material.If this was the case it appeared necessary to secure a source of supply in this country, as in the eventof Avar the Scandinavian sources of supply could notbe relied upon.    As 60,000 tons a year would berequired, this would mean that 1,200 tons a weekTH3 CALEDONIANPOWER ORDER,;.937.productionof calcium carbide.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(37), Con-clusion 5.)
would have tc be brought from Canada.    The maintenanceof a reserve was impracticable as, owing to its powerto absorb water, calcium carbide deteriorated very rapidly.    Even for its transport fxm Canada very specialhearrangement s would/ necessary.A suggestion was made that our war. requirementsmight be met by the construction of a &quot;shadow&quot; factorywhich would be built and equipped in time of peacebut not used until the outbreak of war.Various criticisms were made of this proposal.Even if the factory were built, the joining up withthe electric &quot;grid&quot; would take some six months.Moreover, no skilled labour, with experience of heavyelectrical work of this kind, and especially of themanufacture of ferro-chrome, would be available.It was then suggested that the labour difficultymight be surmounted by an arrangement with the canadian government whereby they should be prepared, in theevent of war, to ensure the production of sufficient quantities of calcium carbide for our Immediate needs and, in addition, to send skilled labour to put inoperation the &quot;shadow&quot; factory that would have been built in xime of peace.    The comment was made, however,that it would be very difficult for the Canadianlabour to take over the factory in such novelconditions.The Lord President of the&apos; Council said that hewas advised very strongly that calcium carbide wasbeing used more and more in industry as a whole:that every important country except the United kingdom was producing1 this material; and, therefore, that apart from Defence considerations there was a very strong case to be made on merits for the establishmentof an industry here.
The Cabinet were reminded, however, that even ifthe proposed Private Bill was passed, it was unlikelythat the industry could be established on a sound footing:without the imposition of a Duty on imports.    This couldonly be composed by cancelling or amending the NorwegianAgreement, and Norway attached ihe utmost importance tothis part of the Agreement.    The difficulties, therefore,would be very great and would almost certainly react uponthe benefits obtained by our coal industry from theAgreement.A suggestion was made that the British OxygenCompany night be able to come to terms with the Norwegian,Swedish and Canadian concerns, which worked closelytogether.    Doubts were expressed, however, as to this possibility.The Cabinet were informed that originally the promoters of the scheme had not asked for a Duty, butthere was reason to believe that at present they did not see their way to making a profit without some assistanceo f the kind.The subject was then discussed in its political aspects .The Cabinet were reminded that in the last session the Lord Advocate had recommended the Mouse of Commons toaccept the Bill in principle, on the main ground that anadequate and easily accessible supply of  calcium carbidewas an essential requirement for the Services, especially the Air Service, and. that there was now no production ofit at all in this country, the supplies having to beobtained from overseas, mainly from Norway (which might-be a dangerous sea passage) or from Canada (which wouldbe long, as well as, on some sections, possibly dangerous),and. that the same considerations applied, to the productionof ferro alloys proposed, under the scheme, particularlyferro-chrome.   A secondary ground had been the desirability
of establishing a considerable and. permanent ind as try-in the Highlands.It was suggested that it. would hardly bepossible to make a less definite statement when theBill came up a week hence.   Prom the point of viewof the claims of the Highlands this was particularly difficult, because many of the objections urgedagainst the Bill a year ago had been met by the newBill, so thai some of the Scottish objectors were nowsupporters of the Bill.    One difficulty about givingGovernment support to the Bill was recognised to bethat any statements made in its favour by Government-representatives might be misused by quotation in theprospectus of the Company.A good, deal of discussion took place as to theprospects of the Bill in Parliament.    It was statedthat it would, be supported by the greater number ofthe Scottish Members, by the Leader of the LiberalOpposition, and by a considerable number of labour members, apart from representatives of South Wales.There was a good deal of doubt, however, as to theattitude of English Members of Parliament;    a&apos;nd inthis connection it was recalled that the Debate onthe Bill would  come immediately after a two-daysDeba.te on the Distressed Areas .The general view appeared, to be that the bill would, be rejected unless supported, by the government as essential to Defence.The Cabinet, were informed that if the SecondReading of the Bill were rejected by a majoritycomposed, mainly of English M.P&apos;s, without even beingreferred, for examination by some Committee of the-House of Commons, it woul^  create considerableresentment in Scotland, from which the Governmentwoul^ suffer .
The subject was discussed also from the point ofview of unemployment.    Tt was recalled that when theprevious Bill had been debated an important factor hadbeen the claims of South Wales as compared, withScotland.    The Cabinet were reminded, however, thatthe Highlands were suffering as much from, unemploymentas some distressed areas;    that eventually some government action would probably be necessary to relieve the position;    and. that for that reason aloneit would be most imprudent not to support a concernwhich was prepared to do so much to meet the difficul-ties of the situation.   As against this, however, was urged the far greater claim of South Wales from thepoint of view of the numbers of unemployed involved.Prom the economic point of view attention was drawn to the  conclusions of the Electricity Commis-sioners, set forth in the last paragraph of C.P.-75(37), from which it appeared that the Highlands scheme would be much cheaper than the South Wales scheme.The difference might amount to as much as  60,000a year.After further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Government could, not avoidmaking, a statement on the Bill whenit. was debate^ in the House of Commonsnext week:(b) That the Secretary of Ste.te for scotland should, be the Spokesman for the Govern-ment:(c) That the Secretary of State for Scotland1sline should, not be too much at variance with the statement by the Lord Advocateon the previous Bill.   He should devel6pthe case to show that an adequate andaccessible supply of ..calcium carbidewas of the utmost importance, and that from this point of view a source ofsupply at home was eminently desirable.He should, however, make clear that itwould not be fair to the House for himto suggest that the proposals in theBill were absolutely essential fromthe point of view of &quot;Defence and. thatthere was no other way of obtaining-12-
supplies except &quot;by its passage.     he might point out that the Governmentwere not at present in a position toexpress a final opinion as to wherethe best place would he for theestablisliment of a factory.     He should indicate that the Government would give no guarantee that they would impose a duty in the event of the Bill passing.On the aspect of Special Areas he should set out the arguments on either side,pointing out that the Bill ought notto be rejected on the ground that the highlands were not scheduled as aSpecial Area.     While not going so faras to advise the House of Commons topass the Bill, he should make clearthat the result of its rejection wouldbe to close the Highlands to an industry that would be very welcome from anunemployment point of view0     He should express the government&apos;s view that, on balance, the Government would like tosee the Bill examined by a Private BillCommittee which was suited to considerquestions of cost and the economicpossibilities of the scheme, whereas the House itself was not able to make such an enquiry:    if that course were refused,  the Government would find itnecessary to consider the best methodof establishing   the industry in GreatBritain.     In that event it wasconceivable that, in the end, Corpachmight be selected:That the Prime Minister should make enquiries as to whether a Private bill could be dealt with by a Select Committee,in which case the Secretary of State forScotland should suggest this in thecourse of his statement;That members of the Government shouldnot vote against the Bill, but that each member should be free to decide whether he voted at all.
4.      The Lord President of the Council informed the Cabinet that, after making enquiries in the properquarters, he had advised the Prime Minister that ministers should attend the Service at St. Paul&apos; cathedral at which the King and Queen were to be present in connection with the Coronation Programme,The Cabinet agreed:That members of the Cabinet should attend the Service at St. Paul* cathedral at which the King and Queenwere to be present on Empire Day, the24th May.
CIVIL AVIATION.Proposed. south atlantic AirService.(previous reference:Cabinet 4(37), Con-clusion 6. )50     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air (CP.-73 (37)) on thequestion of the proposed South Atlantic Air Service.After describing; the course of the various negotia-tions and stating in broad outline the distributionof the main subsidy expenditure now envisaged, theSecretary of State submitted for the consideration ofhis colleagues that the following announcement mightbe made:-C.&apos;l) That after careful investigation theGovernment felt unable to accept anyof the proposals submitted for theSouth American air service, and thatit has been decided to proceed by stages, instituting&apos; in the firstinstance a service to the West african colonies by way of the West Coast;(2) That on the grounds indicated in theReport of the International air communications Committee, and subjectto satisfactory terms being agreed,it has selected British Airways, Ltd.,to operate that service and to act asthe chosen instrument of the Governmentfor the development of any futuresubsidised South American service.The Secretary of State for Air said that he did not wish to make the announcement proposed in his memorandum until he was in a position to answer any questions that might be raised on matters of detail.He envisaged, therefore, prior examination with theDepartments concerned of two main questions, namely,the practicability of establishing the necessary air bases in^West African Colonies and the p5?es^-cH73&quot;Trr&quot;mail coBte&amp;e^B-o      He had seen the representativeof British Airways, who he thought he could say wouldbe prepared to undertake this projects     He thought the Inter-departmental Committee had been right to reject the more ambitious proposal to proceed with thefull scheme to South America and that it was desirableto go by stages.      This fitted in with other policies,
31 2tl X for example, Mr. Pirow&apos;s plans for a service from SouthAfrica up the west coasts      It should enable Mr. Pirowto reject Dutch and possible future German wvertu.ros fora West African service.     The employment of british airways might lead to the provision of an effectivesecond string to Imperial Airways.      He paid tribute tothe value of the Inter-departmental Committee as alreadydemonstrated in the case of the Atlantic route.The Secretary of State for the Colonies pointedout that the arrangements and cost for extending thescheme southward from the Gambia Colony to the other west african Colonies had not yet been worked out.      The onlyGovernments that had taken any action for the developmentof air services, namely, Nigeria and the Gold Coast, haddirected their efforts towards the Sudan.       Theoriginal idea of tho present scheme had been to treat theGambia as a stepping stone towards a service to SouthAmerica.     Now it was proposed to link up first with theWest African Colonies.     Technically, the most serious problem arose at Sierra Leone, where only an inadequateaerodrome existed and conditions for establishingsatisfactory facilities were difficult.     There was alsothe question of the long hop from Sierra Leone to the Gold.Coast which required investigation, more especially as it involved crossing or skirting Liberia and the french colonies.     He was, however, prepared to agree to theSecretary of State for Ai^s proposal that the scheme should be approved in principle subject to its eventualapproval in its practical and financial aspects by theSecretary of State for the Colonies,The Secretary of State for Air hoped that hewould also agree to the experimental trips to the Gambia,The Secretary of State for the Colonies agreedo- 16 -
A suggestion was made that, in order tosecure an easier acceptance of this proposal by theHouse of Commons, it might be advisable to call fortenders on the first and experimental stage.       TheCabinet were reminded of the difficulties in this respectthat had arisen in Parliament in connection with the scandinavian scheme.     It was suggested that criticismwould be directed against the fact that for the completescheme ef a service to South America, three firms hadbeen allowed to tender and all three had been rejectedbut that when only one stage of the scheme was underconsideration, only one of the three firms had been selected.The Secretary of State for Air pointed out thatthe reason for selecting only one firm was that theInter-departmental Committee had found that this was theonly one of the three which was in the least competent to carry out the experimental stage of the larger scheme.In view of this, he felt it would be almost dishonest toencourage the other two firms to tender again.    Eventually,the Committee&apos;s Report would probably be published.The Cabinet v/ere reminded that the Inter-departmental Gommittee&apos;s conclusion was based on thefact that a good deal cf experiment was necessary before a Trans-Atlantic service could be inaugurated:    that atthe present time none of the firms were capable ofestablishing a complete scheme to South America so thatan experimental first stage was necessary:    that it wasnot practicable to put that stage out to tender.      Thatwas why the Inter-departmental Committee had chosen thebest available concern to carry through the experiments in co-operation with the Air Ministry,,In answer to,a criticism.that the tendering for civil Aviation was confined within too narrow a circle, the
Secretary of State for Air pointed out that the present policy of the Air Ministry was no longer to confinedevelopments to Imperial Airways, hut to secure a secondfirm by entrusting important developments such as the scandinavian service and the one now under considerationto British Airways,The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested thatthe attitude of Parliament would depend a good deal uponthe presentation of the proposals under consideration.He thought that the matter could be presented in afavourable light and acceptable reasons given as to whyother firms should not tender.     As air servicesextended, he hoped it might be possible to develop other firms.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That no announcement of the Government&apos;policy should be made until afteragreement had been reached by theSecretary of State for Air and theSecretary of State for the colonies as well as with the Treasury if any financial alteration was involved onthe feasibility and cost of extending the scheme southward from the GambiaColony te the other Wast african colonies:(b) That after agreement as in (a), anannouncement should be made to thefollowing effect -(i)    that, after careful investigation,the Government felt unable toaccept any of the proposals submitted for the South Americanair service,and that it has beenecided to proceed by stages,instituting in the first instancea service to the West african colonies by way of the west coast;(ii)    that on the grounds indicated inthe report of the international air Communications Committee, andsubject to satisfactory terms being agreed, it has selected british airways Limited to operate that service and to act as the choseninstrument of the Government fcrthe development of any futuresubsidised South American servicejbut that this should be subject to agreement on-the details referred to above between theSecretary of State for Air, the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, if modifications of theproposed arrangement were involved.- 18- -

gTlNB.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesation in.drew attention to a telegram from the OfficerAdministering the Government of Palestine dated theon pilgrimage should he taken to issue an orderexcluding him from Palestine.   - The reason for thisproposal was that otherwise the Mufti would return from the pilgrimage with enhanced prestige and thathis return would he the signal for a renewed outburst of anti-Government activities.      The General OfficerCommanding considered that law and order could not be fully restox^ed in Palestine until the Mufti, whom he regarded as the main instigator of the rebellion, hadbeen removed from his position.     The OfficerAdministering the Government agreed that so long asthe Mufti&apos;s influence remained, there was unlikely to be lasting peace in Palestine   but opposed hisexclusion now as likely to promote disturbances in circumstances in which the Government would find itdifficult to defend their action.      It would bereplied that the Government had been afraid to dealwith the Mufti as long as he was in Palestine, but that so soon as he left the country and when actuallyengaged on his religious devotions, they had, by atrick, secured his exclusion;    and this, moreover,when the country was at peace and when the PoyalCommission, having heard his evidence, were preparingtheir report.     The exclusion of the Mufti in such circumstances would be regarded not only in Palestineas an instance of British perfidy and bad faithwhich would be quoted against us for years to come,but it would moreover leave the Mufti at large toviouserence:inet 4elusion27th February, 1937, In which he dealt with a(37)18)       suggestion by the General Officer Commanding that
intrigue against us in other Arab countries.The Secretary of State for the Coloniessupported the views of the Officer administering the government     His own main objection was thatif and when as he hoped it was possible to get rid of the Mufti, it would be desirable to send him faraway, for example, to the Seychelles,    If he weresimply not allowed to return, ho would go aboutconducting propaganda in Arab countries against us.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairssupported this latter objection from his own pointof view.      The Mufti&apos;s presence would create a verydifficult situation in Saudi Arabia,The Cabinet agreed with the Secretaries ofState for the Colonies and Foreign Affairs,

In thecircumstances, he had come to the conclusion that thebest course would be not to support the shelvingmotion to refer the question to a Select Committee, butto put the objections to the Bill, to urge the pe-je-e-^senthe amendments and to submit that the question shouldbe referred to a Standing Committee in the ordinary way.The Cabinet approved the above course.
