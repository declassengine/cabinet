ha.pranco-ridshfspute.grevious,ference:[cabinet 851), Con-msion 1. )1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that at the Council of the Leagueof Nations the dispute between Turkey and France as toAlexandretta had been put in a fair way to settlementbut still presented many difficulties.    One importantresult was that the Turkish tone towards Prance had much improved since the settlement.    Germany andItaly had rather sought to fish in troubled waters,and the Italian Government had asked the turksh foreign Minister to meet the Italian Foreign Ministerat Genoa.    Actually the meeting had taken place atMilan.    The Germans had also sent messages of full support to Turkey.    One satisfactory feature of theaffair was that our own influence at Angora was greaterrather than less since this episode, as shown byIsmet Pasha&apos;s recent speech in the Turkish Parliament.
previous reference:Cabinet 54(36), Con-elusion 6. )2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that no very satisfactory solution had been found at the Meeting of the Council of the League of Nationsover the Danzig problem.    There was much to be said for the League being rid of this question, but thiswas impossible as a unanimous decision of the council was necessary and Poland would never agree.    It was difficult to enforce the Constitution;   in fact, itwas impossible, because no means were availableagainst the Government of Danzig itself, which wasNazi in character.    All that could be done was to putwhat pressure was possible on the Poles to make theDanzigers behave.    It was an exhausting and discourag-ing business.    On this occasion, however, Herr Greiserhad been less difficult to deal with than in the past.
GERMANY&quot;.?3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsarr hitler   said that nothing new was contained in Herr Hitler1sspeech on January 30th.    It had received a very poorworld Press, especially in America, Sweden and Poland.Its object had probably been to reassure the Germanpeople as to their economic situation and theirpreviousReference:Cabinet 1(37), Con-clusion 2. ;reit-S fa)?     foreign affairs.    On the whole, the speech struck anote of confidence^-aer to the increasing military strength of Germany.    It held out no prospect of any advance in the direction of international co-operation.The Germans apparently intended to pursue the paththey had chosen and did not mean to be very,helpful.It was, however, to the good that the &quot;era ofsurprises&quot; was declared to be at an end, but therewas no statement that the era of collaboration was to begin.    It was arguable, however, that the speechdid represent a success for the moderates in Germany.The Dutch Press, it was interesting to note, consider-ed the European situation less tense than it was amonth ago, and gave as the main cause of this thefirmness of our own policy and our re-armament&quot;TAjZ-programme. . A disturbing feature was^a-re-feresft&amp;e^ja-pthe-speeeh^te^Czecho-Slovakia,^whoro -tho -peaart-ieua-was d-e-s-es^e^-ars not included among the realitieswhich Hitler recognised.    There was, however, a reference to minorities which might be intended tobe friendly. An immediate coup by Germany now appeared less likely, and there night b&quot;. more timefor our own re-armament, the significance of which to European peace daily became more apparent. germany had no-   taken her position, and there was nothing tobe done by us except to see whether it indicated aturn of the tide.In the course of the discussion the Secretary ofState added that the French Alliance with Russia-3-
was not the only obstacle to some general settlement in the West, for Germany was probably equally concerned about Czecho-Slovakia, where Prance had similar engage-ments.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsindicated his intention of submitting a Paper to theCabinet before long on the question of Czecho-Slovakiaand what ought to be our own attitude if Germany shouldtake some initiative against that country.(Certain other more important matters  .mentioned in the discussion are referredto in the two following Conclusions.)

In the course of a short discussion which followed the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs referred to in the preceding Conclusion,attention was called to Herr Hitler&quot;s references to apossible German guarantee to Belgium and Holland,viz.&quot;The German Government has assuredBelgium and Holland of its readiness. a  to recognise these States at any time^u^AflA  as inviolableXterritories and to guarantee them&quot;.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had ascertained that neither the Belgian nor theDutch Government knew anything about the declaration,but the Dutch Government at any rate were making enquiries.It was suggested that this fairly definite state-ment of willingness ought to be followed up.The Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs that the initiative in the firstinstance lay with the Dutch and Belgian Governments.
FORMERniss.viousgrence:inet 62), Con-sion 4. ;5. In the coarse of the short discussion which followed the statement by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs referred to in Conclusion 3, attention was drawn to Herr Hitler&apos;s statement on the formerGerman colonies.Suggestions were made that the Cabinet ought tomake up its mind as to what its policy was towards/o^7Jixa German request for a return of a colony.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was difficult to lay down in advance an answer to ahypothetical question.    If a specific issue were raised the Cabinet would not take long to clear itsmind on the subject.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat there had been references to German colonialambitions in previous statements, and he did not take an alarmist view as to those contained in Herr Hitler&apos;sspeech.    The Foreign Office had no confirmation ofrumours in the Press that the German Ambassador, whowas returning that day, would bring a Despatch on thesubject:     in fact, the latest Press information was rather to the contrary.
pE SITUATION 6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in SPAIN.reported that at Geneva the French representativesSpanishMorocco, had spoken to him rather seriously ahout the futureof Spanish Morocco.    Whatever the result of the civil(previous reference:        war in Spain, difficulties were likely to arise.    IfCabinet 1(37), Con-v       the Government forces were to win there was reason toelusion 5.)RR.fi (37)believe that the Spanish Government did not much want to retain this colony.    If the insurgents were to windifficult questions would arise of concessions tocertain Powers.    He imagined that, from a strategicalpoint of view, we were not very anxious to see theFrencli/established in Spanish Morocco.    One possible solution would be an extension of the neutral zone atTangier to include it.On the suggestion of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs the Cabinet agreed  That the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeshould re-examine the question of spanish Morocco in relation to thecivil war in Spain and the possible consequences that might arise thereafter.
SPAIN&quot;.ne Non-rterventionjcjiidttee.previous reference:Cabinet 4(37), Con-conclusion 1. )-7^7)&apos;7. (The Earl of Plymouth, parliamentary under-Secretary of State, ForeignOffice, as Chairman of the Inter-national Non-intervention Committee,entered at this point.)The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,Foreign Office, reported that all the principal Powersagreed in principle that there should he a ban onvolunteers for Spain provided that all the countries concerned participated.    Some countries regarded the fixing of an early date as urgent.    Some scheme of supervision to follow as soon as possible on the banwas urgent as a condition.    It was therefore necessaryto begin preparations.    The old scheme drawn up bythe Non-intervention Committee, providing for control in Spain, was now dead, as it had not proved accept-able to either party in the civil war.    A new scheme had been drawn up involving operations outside of spain, and was now before the various Governments.An essential part of the scheme was a patrol, inwhich several Navies would participate, to check the entry of ships into Spanish ports.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that shipsbound for Spain were to call at specified ports andpick up neutral Officers who would proceed on boardthem to their destination in Spain, where they wereto watch the disembarkation of the cargo.    In addition,the land frontiers were to be patrolled, and there wasto be a patrol at sea.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that theobject of the patrol at sea was to prevent ships fromevading the arrangements already referred to and toreport.    The Admiralty were prepared to co-operatewithin a specified zone if other countries would dothe same.    They regarded the zone system as fundamental.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said the French were not very happy about the proposed zones.Great difficulty arose in finding a suitable zone forthe Russians in the territory occupied by the forcesof either the Spanish Government or the insurgents,though for different reasons.    He paid a tribute tothe work of the Earl of Plymouth, which was endorsed by the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the totalofcost of the new scheme was even higher than/the old,namely,  898,000 a year, of which our share would be 144,000.    He was dubious as to the probability ofsuccess being achieved by the scheme, but as it appearedto be the only method by which agreement could bereached on a ban on volunteers for Spain he felt boundto advise acceptance.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State, Foreign Office, should beauthorised to inform the Non-intervention committee that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould accept the new scheme of non-intervention subject to its acceptance by the other countries concerned andsuch minor alterations as it might benecessary to introduce:(b) That the Foreign Office should keep inclose touch with the Admiralty in theevent of any alterations being proposedto the scheme which would affect theNavy, and, more particularly, any suggestions for modifying the zonescheme.(The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, ForeignOffice, withdrew.)
JAPAN.KeelungIncident.(previous references:Cabinet 60(36), Con-clusion 4;and Cabinet66 (36), Con-elusion 6. )Invitation toCoronationiiaval Review.8.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-45(37)) on the bearing of the Keelung incident(which was described in the Conclusions mentioned inthe margin) on the issue of an invitation for a japanese warship to attend the Coronation NavalReview.    The Secretary of State considered that,notwithstanding the incident remained unsettled, an invitation should be sent to the Japanese at the sametime as the other maritime Powers are invited, butsuggested that, if possible, the issue of allinvitations might be suspended for ten days or a fortnight, in order not to prejudice the chances ofobtaining- a satisfactory solution of the incident.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That an invitation should be sent tothe Japanese Government to send awarship to attend the CoronationNaval Review:(b) That, without further delay, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should instruct His Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Tokio to convey this invitation byword of mouth to the Japanese Government.He should take the opportunity to linkit up with the Keelung incident by pointing out what a pity it was thatthis question was not already settled and asking if it could not be regulatedbefore the formal invitations were issued.
(JHANISTAN.edits for.previous reference:cabinet 4 (37)conclusion 2 (b)(c).)I9.    The Secretary of State for Indiainformed the Cabinet that, as decided at theMeeting referred to in the margin,  the ForeignOffice, India Office, Treasury and the Board ofTrade had examined ae to whether -(a) from the political point of view it was desirable to take action in some form topromote British trade with Afghanistan, and(b) if so, as to the form such assistance should take.The answer to the first question was in the affirmative.     It was desirable to take action topromote British trade with Afghanistan     As regardsthe second question, if the United KingdomGovernment were to guarantee credits they would haveto be submitted to Parliament in one of thefollowing ways:-(l). A special Bill applicable to foreigncountries generally.(2)   A special Bill applicable only to afghanistan.(3)   An entry in the Foreign Office Vote,The latter method was deemed the easier.     precedents for this procedure were provided by variousadvances made to the Persian Government at thebeginning of the present century and later on in1913-14, which had been met by entry in the ForeignOffice Vote,,     A suggestion made by the treasury had been that an approach should be made to theExport Credits Guarantee Department as to what theirattitude would be towards a credit guaranteed by theAfghan Government on the security of lambskins, ofwhich every year   there was a large exportation.It was doubtful, however, whether the department would regard that     security as good enough and itwas not thought advisable to ask the Afghan Prime
Minister to approach the Export Credits guarantee department unless they were likely to accede to his request.     The suggestion had been made that the export credits Guarantee Department was more likely to give afavourable answer if they were told that, in the eventof the proposal being rejected, the Government themselvesproposed to provide a credit by an entry in the ForeignOffice Vote,The Chancellor of the Exchequer criticisedthe proposal for using the exports of lambskins as aguarantee of a credit on the following grounds:-(l)   There was no means of compelling the AfghanGovernment to spend the proceeds of the saleof lambskins in this country on machines,(2)   There was no means of forcing anyone in thiscountry to buy lambskins,(3)   The Export Credits Guarantee Department was likely to regard the proposal with suspicion,and he was most anxious to preserve the independence of that Department from even suspicion of political pressure and to keep it on a commercial basis.There was general agreement that to proceed by means of a special Bill would be very inconvenient.The Bill would be very controversial in Parliament andit was practically certain that an amendment would beintroduced to exclude expenditure on arms and ammunition.The Cabinet then considered the lines onwhich the proposal to provide the credit guarantee byentry in the Foreign Office Vote could be defended inParliament.     It was suggested that something might bemade of the Persian precedents referred to above, and ofthe ^desirability   of maintaining stability in Afghanistan.It could also be said that the credit guarantee wa3likely to prove a good investment and that it would help to secure a stable and friendly Government in afghanistan.     It was recognised, however, that it would
be difficult to avoid giving political grounds as the mainjustifications     The very fact that the credit was carriedon the Foreign Office Vote would give it a politicalcomplexion and it was suggested that the Afghan government might be shy of accepting that method as they were alwayssusceptible of any suggestion that their foreign policy was subject to British influence,,The Cabinet were informed that the Afghan PrimeMinister had not yet preferred any request to the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and there was general agreement that no initiative should be taken on our partsThe Cabinet agreed:(a) That no initiative should be taken onbehalf of our Government to offer to thePrime Minister of Afghanistan a guaranteedcredit.(b) That if, as was considered almost certain,the Afghan Prime Minister asked for something of the kind, it was desirable totake appropriate action to promoteBritish trade with Afghanistan4(c) That such assistance could best be givenin the form of an export credit to be^\ . i .    provided for by an entry in theJ)upl4y*eU4.&apos;t.

&quot;^UIREMENTSjlte Paper.previous inference:Cabinet 13 (36)Conclusion 3.)10.     The Prime Minister said that a parliamentary question had heen addressed to him asking whether a white Paper would he issued in connection with our defence Requirements similar to those issued in1935 and 1936.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that the Defence Policy and RequirementsOommittee had considered this matter at their last meeting.     He himself had rather felt that a white paper might he unavoidable but all his colleagues were opposed to it and considered that the needs ofthe situation might be met by a Parliamentary speech.There was much to be said for this as those whowould have to produce the material for the white paper were already much over-worked.A suggestion was made that as the policy had been set forth in the White Paper last year and only the question of implementing the Programmeswas involved, the present situation would be met byfull statements.as to the position in the memoranda accompanying the Service Estimates and bythe Estimates themselves and the speeches thereon.The Cab net agreed:That the Prime Minister should discussthe question with the Minister forCo-Ordination of Defence.
DEFENCE REQUIRE- 11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byMENTS.the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-40Progress m.(37)) on Progress in Defence Requirements, furnished(Previous in accordance with the wish of the Cabinet expressedReference:Cabinet 1 at the Meeting mentioned in the margin.(37), Con-clusion 3. ) The Chancellor of the Exchequer drewF.     lyjj /3.    attention to the statement on page 3 of thememorandum (CP. 40 (37)) that tools for the newlyacquired establishment at Scotswood could not beprovided in less than a year, and to anotherstatement on page 4 that it would be impracticablewith the present rate of gun construction to complete the Naval Programme of anti-aircraft re-armament,and that even the A.A. re-armament of the main fleetmight have to be delayed,,    He wished the Cabinet torealise that these;two.instances showed that.even thepresent Programmes were placing a heavy.strain on our resources.     Any additional strain might put ourpresent Programmes in jeopardy.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence agreed.     He pointed out that the arrangements withthe machine tool trade, under which they were increasingly tending to postpone the completion oftheir ordinary orders, had been arranged before thepurchase of Scotswooda     He emphasised that, whilethe figures in his memorandum had been checked, the opinions expressed were his own,     He proposed toissue a corresponding, but probably shorter,statement to tire Cabinet at the end of each month,in order to keep them abreast of the situation.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the statement by theMinister for Co-Ordination of Defence(CP. 40 (37),

$ ROYALjo[b forge.parity withrmany.previous reference:Cabinet 4 (37Conclusion 3.;^.9(57)5-.12.   In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Conclusion, the Secretary of State forAir said he had an important communication to make to the -Government about the figures for German air strength.     He had deliberately avoided circulatingthese either to the Cabinet or the Committee ofImperial Defence, as they had been given under conditions of great secrecy*     He recalled that theCommittee of Imperial Defence had frequently been givenestimatedfigures both as to/German strength and capacity for production of aircraft.     These figures were theresult of pooling all the information at the disposalof the Government from all sources.      On the manufacturing side, the figures had be,en approved by theindustrial Intelligence.. Section in the/^Soa^^-o^fHrh^ad-e-.In July last year, he had discussed thematter with the German General Milch, who happened tobe on a visit to this country and who had now becomevirtually Air Minister in Germany since General Goeringhardly everwas otherwise occupied and    /     went near the Ministry.He himself had remarked to the General that it was apity that Germany could not give the world someparticulars of   the   position of their air developments and their intentions.     He had pointed out that our ewnGovernmentr for Parliamentar3^ reasons, was bound to givevery full information.     Ho effect had been produced atthe moment, but in October he had received a message from General Milch to the effect that, provided completesecrecy could be guaranteed and especially that nodisclosures of information would be made to parliament or to any foreign country, his own Government would furnish the British Government with information,,     The
suggestion had been discussed at the Committee ofImperial Defence and it had been decided that in spiteof certain objections, the information was of such importance that the offer should be accepted.     TheGerman Government had then given us a very definitestatement of the position reached in October last year.It was interesting to recall that the actual figuresrealised by Germany were within two squadrons oof -the estimates, of   the Air Staff IntelligenceDepartment.     The information of that Department had been so complete that they were able to identify most of the squadrons at particular German stations and, except ina few details, their intelligence had proved correct.probablyHe thought it.unlikely that the Germans /knowing thatwe had pretty full information, would try to misleadus.    Our German estimate for the future had been drawn on the assumption of a Programme of 1500   first-line aircraft by the Spring of this year.     The German Govern-ment had -given-ma-statement.iof. their eventual Programmes.Since the above, a new fact of greatimportance had occurred.     A Mission of Air staff officers had been invited to Germany where they had been shown a great deal.     During this visit, General Milchhad invited the Deputy Chief of the Air Staff to comealone to the German Air Ministry, where he would showhim his Programmes.     He had stipulated that he shouldnot be accompanied by any Staff Officer or anyone fromthe British Embassy.The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff had acceptedthe invitation and met General Milch, who was accompanied;by senior Officers of the General Staff and the supply department.     He had produced the volumes containing his j;Programme   and offered -to give the fullest information.
The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff had then said thathe could not receive this information without givingit to his Minister and that his Minister could notkeep it hack from the Cabinet.     General Milch had accepted these conditions and had then given figures as to the Programme- of-, the German Air Porce..to berea-ched by the Autumn of 1938.(Note:    In view of the pledge of secrecy givento General Milch, these figures are notcirculated although a copy is on record withthe standard file of the Cabinet Conclusions.This applies also to certain other information given by General Milch.)After completing his account of the interview with General Milch, the Secretary of Statefor Air said that the fairest estimate which, on allthe facts within our knowledge, could.be made of therelative first-line strength of the British andGerman Air Forces as at 1st January this year was asfollows:-Estimate of total German first-line establishment, based onidentified squadrons   .........      1107Alternative estimate, based on theassumption that our original estimate of German intention tocreate a first-line strength of1500   by April has in fact been completely fulfilled   .........     1300(Notei The lower figure was in accord withidentification, intelligence and other reports.)British first-line establishment.(1) Metropolitan squadrons    .    ...      1040(2) Fleet Air Arm (of which 102at home)    ............       204(3) Squadrons overseas .......       272Total       1516The First Lord of the Admiralty said thatthe Admiralty had also received full information as to
tthe developments of the German Navy and, so far as their statements could he tested, they had provedbona fide.The Prime Minister thanked the Secretary ofState for Air for his very interesting statement.

The Prime Minister said that the Chancellorof the Exchequer had undertaken to see the Deputationof the coal royalty owners the same afternoon, andthe Home Secretary, who had been acting for thePresident of the Board of Trade as Chairman of theCommittee on the Organisation of the Coal MiningIndustry, wished to make a statement as a matter of urgency.The Home Secretary said that the point he had toraise was one of importance.    In due course theCabinet \:vould receive the full Report of the CabinetCommittee.    The point he wished to raise, however,concerned the meeting the Chancellor of the exchequer was to attend that afternoon, and dealt with themethods for the unification of coal royalties, towhich the Government was committed.    The CabinethadCommittee/ reached two broad conclusions:-(l) That it was not practicable that a coal Royalties Bill should state ina figure the amount of the purchase price to be paid unless that figurewere provisionally either agreed bythe royalty owners or ascertained bysome form of arbitration:(2) That it was impossible to proceed onthe basis of introducing legislationunder which the Government undertook to acquire the royalties no matter what cost of acquisition resulted fromthe arbitration, for an inflated figuremight mean that the scheme might beinsolvent.Consequently the Cabinet Committee had agreed thatit should be ascertained at once from the royalty owners whether they would be prepared to agree  (a) that the multiplier necessary to arriveat the global sum from the annual valuealready agreed should be ascertained bya single agreed Referee, and(b) that when the global sum has been thusascertained the Treasury should have theright within a limited time to exercisean&quot;option to purchase at this figure.
There would he an interval after the figure had been passed within which the Government would decide whether it could afford the figure or not.    he asked that the Chancellor of the Exchequer shoulde authorised to/   put that proposition to the royalty owners the same afternoon.The Chancellor of the Exchequer   pointed outthat the situation of the coal owners and of theState in this matter was very different.    if thecoal owners accepted a figure which was on the lowside from their point of view they would not becomebankrupt, but would merely become a little.poorer.      The State, on the other hand, was committed to a scheme under which royalties wereto be used to pay interest and to adjust the ratesof royalty, and if the figure paid was too highthen the whole scheme would be ruined&quot;and bankrupt.The upsetting of the Government1s scheme would leave the owners in a much worse position;    conse-quently he did not entirely despair that someaccommodation might .be reached.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Chancellor of theExchequer to pioceed on the lines proposed by the Home Secretary asset forth above.
m KOLS OF THEglUHBTTABMY.Report of chiefs ofStaff Com-committee.(previous reference:Cabinet 75(36), Con-clusion 6.)14.    The Cabinet had under consideration thefollowing documents on the subject of the Role ofthe British Army*-A Most Secret Report by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee (CP.-41 (37)),furnished in accordance with theConclusion referred to in the margin.A summary of the Committee1s Conclu-sions is attached as Appendix I tothese Minutes:A Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (CP.-46(37)) commenting on the above Reportof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeand putting forward certain conclu-sions he had formed as a plan whichthe War Office would be able, inconsultation with the Treasury,to take immediate steps to put intoeffect.In addition, the Cabinet had before them thefollowing Papers on the same subject, which had beenunder consideration at the Meeting referred to above:-Memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor War (CP.-326 (36) and CP.-337(36)):A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP.-334 (36)):A further Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for War (C.P.-325 (36)) onthe organisation, armament and equip-ment of the Army.After a somewhat prolonged discussion in the courseof which criticism was directed against a number of points in the Memorandum by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee and replied to by the Secretary of State forWar, the proposals of the Minister for Co-Ordinationof Defence in CP. 46 (37) as summed up below inConclusion (a) were found to commend themselves inin principle to the Cabinet.The Secretary of State for War, while hopeful ofan agreement, pressed that the Territorialshould be permitted to realise that the intention
was that they should he used alongside the RegularArray and trained for this purpose.      If an announcement to this effect could he made to the TerritorialArmy he did not think it mattered very much inprinciple whether material was provided for two divisions or more.      In practice, however, he felt sure that if and when an emergency arose the lowerbasis would prove too lew.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence said thathis idea had been to give the Territorial &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;sufficient equipment for training purposes,  and hewas informed that this,  in fact, would provide sufficient materiel for the equipment of about two divisions.      If the Chancellor of the Exchequer was prepared to adopt his suggestion he would ask thatthe Director-G-eneral of Munition Production beauthorised to proceed on that basis so that the delay in placing a number of imroortant orders could be avoided.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while favouringin principle the proposal of the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence,  said that before making adecision he must know the cost of the proposed plan.Admittedly, national safety came before finance, butthe bill for armaments was running up very heavily.He attached importance also to the time faetor.There was, perhaps, some alleviation in the inter-national situatiorvand the dangers of overloadingthe programmes beyond the material capacity of thecountry had to be considered.      Was  it r-eallynecessary to stick rigidly to a date in 1939 for
completion of our programmes?The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence s.aidthat he had already almost lost sight of the date,and it had become a matter of proceeding as fast as circumstances permitted.The Secretary of State for War recalled that theWar Office were already under instructions from theCommittee of Imperial Defence to work out a conspectusof the War Office programme equipment,  and theestimates now asked for by the Chancellor of theExchequer might be provided by basing the conspectuson the proposals of the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence.      He asked, however, that in consideringthe equipment required for training the Territorialsthe margin should not be cut so fine as to leavenothing over in an emergency beyond the provision of equipment for two Divisions for active service.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That with a view to an early decision the Secretary of State for war should circulate as soon as possiblean estimate of the cost of his proposals based on the suggestions of the Minister for Co-Ordination ofDefence in C.P. 46 x&apos;37), which maybe summed up as follows:-(i) The Regular Army and the two Anti-Aircraft Divisions of theTerritorial S^rce must beprovided with the most complete and efficient equipment(ii) The remainder of the TerritorialFwcie must be trained in the useof the same weapons as theRegular Army.(iii) For this purpose they must begiven sufficient equipment fortraining purposes which wouldbe spread evenly over the wholeof the twelve Divisions.
(b) That in working out their plan the War Office should also state the dates to which they were working.(c) That the time factor in the programme should be further considered by theMinisters concerned. -
S3 RESERVEORCES BILLj767.previous reference:Cabinet 73(36), Con-elusion 9. )15. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for War (CP.-43 (37)) seeking approval to the early introduction of the reserve forces Bill, 1937, a draft of which was attached tohis Memorandum.    The Bill was designed to carry outthe decision of the Cabinet at the Meeting referredto in the margin, and would have the effect both ofwidening the field of recruitment and of lengtheningthe period of time during which men enrolled inSection A. could continue to serve therein.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Secretary of State for Warset forth in CP.-43 (37) and summarised above.

MOST SECRET.APPENDIX ITO BE KEPT UNDER LOCK AND KEY.It is requested that special care may be taken toensure the secrecy of this document.ROLE OF THE BRITISH ARMY.Summary of Conclusions by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.38.   Our conclusions may be summed up as follows :  (i) We re-endorse the definition of the role of the British Army which was included in the Statement of Defence issued in March 1936, and weemphasise that the essential functions stated therein cannot be per-formed without an army (paragraphs 4 and 5).(ii) The strength of the Army at home is in the main dictated by our normaloverseas requirements in peace. These forces at home constitute theonly immediately available Imperial Reserve and are so organised thata maximum striking force of four Divisions and one Mobile Divisionmay be available for despatch overseas if required (paragraphs 6-8).(iii) The Units of the Regular Army are interchangeable and interdependent.All should, therefore, be equipped to the same scale. The mandate forthe modernisation of the Regular Army must therefore extend to every Unit and not only to those who happen at any given moment to constitute the striking force referred to in (ii) above (paragraph 9).(iv) We are agreed that it is doubtful whether the German Army could be stopped by the sole agency of any air forces which the French and ourselves could ever oppose to it and that the Allies must therefore be capable of putting considerable land forces into the field for thispurpose (paragraph 14).(v) We assume that any idea of leaving to our Continental Allies the exclusiveburden of providing these land forces, and thereby of limiting, our contribution to air forces however greatly expanded, is out of thequestion for political reasons (paragraph 15).(vi) It is therefore impossible to discount altogether the contingency of having to send military forces to the Continent at some stage of the war and perhaps at its very outset (paragraphs 16 and 17).(vii) If this contingency should materialise the only land forces available, underthe most favourable conditions, for immediate despatch would be theRegular Field Force of four Divisions and one Mobile Division(paragraph 18).(viii) We cannot contemplate leaving this force unsupported on the Continentor leaving ourselves without any troops whatsoever to deal withemergencies which might arise in other parts of the world. It is,therefore essential to make provision for a reserve, and under ourpresent system this can only come from the Territorial Army(paragraph 19).(ix; lhe present strength of the Territorial Army is dictated by administrativerather than strategical considerations, but we should deprecatestrongly any interference with its existing organisation, which mighthave serious effects on its general efficiency and morale (paragraphs 20and 21).[14507-1]
(x) The Territorial Army has a low peace strength, and would require largenumbers of men and four months&apos; intensive training after the out-break of war before being fit for service (paragraph 22).(xi) Units of the Territorial Army should ultimately have the same type of equipment as the corresponding Units of the Regular Army (para-graph 23).(xii) Modern developments enable our potential enemies to develop a maximumscale of attack immediately on the outbreak of war. Consequently,the earlier all our forces can be brought into action, the better(paragraphs 25 and 26).(xiii) Since it might be necessary (vide (vi)) to despatch land forces overseas atthe earliest possible date after the outbreak of war, the preparednessof our land forces should be as far advanced as is possible without prejudicing the naval and air programmes of re-equipment (pan-graph 27).(xiv) So far as the Territorial Army is concerned, it should be our ultimate aim to equip it to a scale which would enable it to be ready four mouthsafter the outbreak of war (paragraph 28).(xv) It is impossible to equip the Territorial Army on any considerable scale in a short time, but if the principle of its modernisation is accepted,the present basis of production of supply can be broadened.   Meanwhile, such modern equipment as can be made available for it shouldbe spread evenly throughout the Territorial Army (paragraph 24).(xvi) Plans are being  prepared which would,  if the  situation at homepermitted, enable us to land on the Continent the whole of our RegularField Force by Z -t- 15 days.   We consider that the movement of this force would not be prevented by enemy action (paragraphs 29-33).(xvii) It is impossible to equate land and air forces.    Their roles are notexclusive but complementary (paragraphs 34 and 35).(xviii) In view of the importance of the time factor we wish to emphasizethe serious effect that the delay in reaching a decision on the role ofthe British Army is causing.  This delay gives us the gravest concern(paragraphs 36 and 37).(Signed) ERNLE CHATFIELD.E. L. ELLINGTON.C. J. DEVERELL.2 Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,January 28, 1937.
