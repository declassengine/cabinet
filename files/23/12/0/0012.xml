The Railway 1. The Prime Minister said he had summoned a full meetingStrike. Qf Ministers owing to the gravity of the present situation.    Afterthanking the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Food, and theother Ministers who were organising the counter-measures for theirsuccessful services, which had surprised both the country and the strikers, he gave a brief summary of the course of events from the intervention of the Transport Workers&apos; Federation on the 1st october to the note handed to them on the previous day, which the PrimeMinister read to his colleagues. (For details and text of note seeAppendix.) At the request of the Deputation, which had beenacting as intermediaries, this note had not been published, which seemed to indicate that the Deputation was still seeking for conciliation, although the railwaymen had rejected the Governmentsoffer.The Prime Minister invited the views of his colleagues on thegeneral situation, and in the course of his statement and in the subsequent discussion he raised more particularly the following questions : (o.) The expediency of summoning Parliament in the event ofthere being no extension of the strike beyond the railwaymen.(6.) The expediency of summoning Parliament in the event ofa general strike,(c.) The stage at which an announcement should be made thatthe positions of men remaining on strike would not be guaranteed after a certain date.(d.) Whether, and when, an announcement should be madeguaranteeing their positions and promotion to men whobad remained loyal or  had come to the help of theState.(e.) Propaganda in order to combat the distorted versions of the.: facts which were being circulated..- (/.) An appeal to Mayors and Chairmen of County Councils toundertake local organisation and publicity.The War Cabinet then heard statements regarding various aspects of the anti-strike organisation by the Minister of Transport,the Minister of Food, the Home Secretary, the Minister of Labour,and the Postmaster-General. These were on the whole of a satis-factory character&quot; although certain points emerged for furtherconsideration.Special Constables.Ml2. A suggestion was strongly pressed that some action should betaken to increase the number and improve the organisation of special constables.The War Cabinet Strike Committee was asked to take thisquestion up at once.Proposed SpecialAppeal toRailwaymen.- 3. A suggestion addressed to the Prime Minister from Liverpoolwas considered, namely, that the Government should issue a specialappeal to railwaymen and give them a time limit to resume work.It was pointed out that this matter was being watched by a Sub-Committee.The War Cabinet adopted the view of the War CabinetStrike Committee that any action of the nature suggested should be postponed until the attitude of the Trades UnionDeputation was cleared up.
ProposedAlteration of pre-war BasicBate.3 WC 6274. With a view to a prevention of the spread of the strike withits incalculable consequences, the suggestion was made that, as thewages of the lower grades of railwaymen had been inadequate beforethe war, a proposal made by Mr. Whitley and Mr. SeebohmBowntree&quot;should be considered, namely, that an announcement should be made that the Government were prepared to take up a readjustment ofthe basic rate as a starting point, and that if this vague statementdid not satisfy the men the following explanation should be given tothe negotiators, but not for publication.&quot; I will give the assurance that the special considerationpromised to the men of particular grades is to be taken to mean that in any settlement no adult whole-time worker in the lowestgrade shall receive less at any time than the equivalent of 25s.a week reckoned at pre-war prices.&quot;A number of objections were urged against this proposal. Itwould be a departure from the policy steadily adhered to by theGovernment that they could not continue negotiations until the men-returned to work. The Government offer was in fact at least asgood. The proposal would be difficult to explain, and would probablybe interpreted that the minimum of 40s. had been lowered to 25s.and would generally muddle the public.The War Cabinet&apos;generally endorsed the policy hitherto pursued by the Government in declining to continue negotiationsuntil the railwaymen returned to work and left the above proposal for consideration, if and when the right momentshould come, by the Prime Minister in conference with theMinisters mainly concerned.Propaganda. 5- In the course of the above discussion the general view was expressed that even further steps must betaken to make the Govern-ment&apos;s offer plain and clear to the public by posters, advertisements,leaflets, &amp;c.The War Cabinet invited the Minister of Pensions to associate&apos;himself with the Minister of Labour in the organisation of propaganda.Extension of period of guaranteed Wage.6. In regard to a suggestion by Mr. Barnes that the period during whbh wages were guaranteed against reduction might beextended beyond the 31st March, 1920, the War Cabinet agreedthat The question was one which might be referred to arbitration.The summoning of Parliament7. There was a short discussion as to the desirability of sum-moning Parliament.The general view was that Parliament should be summoned onlyin the event of the extension of the strike to the whole of organised labour.The Secretary of State for India wished his dissent from this,view to be recorded.The Ministers present endorsed the policy hitherto pursued bythe Prime Minister and those most closely associated with him indealing with the situation, and expressed their complete confidence in the policy arid their desire that the Prime Minister should feel hehad a perfectly free hand in conducting the Governments case.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,October 3, 1919.[1042]
APPENDIX.EARLY yesterday afternoon, the 1st October, the Prime Minister received a request from the Transport Workers&apos; Federation to receive a Deputation. This he agreed to do.At 3 p.m. the Deputation was introduced by Mr. Gosling. He explained that theTransport Workers Federation were so closely concerned with the Railway Strike, andwere receiving so many demands from their members for action that the Executive had felt it incumbent on them to consider the question. They had decided to call in theConference representatives of other trades unions in the same position as themselves,and the result of that Conference was the present representative Deputation which included besides Mr. Gosling himself, such prominent trades unionists as : Mr. Arthur Henderson.Mr. Clynes.Mr. Robert Williams.Mr. Bevin.Mr. 0&apos;Grady.Mr. Muir.Mr. Brownlie.Mr. Nay lor.Mr. A. Bo wen.Mr. Walker.Mr. Gosling first addressed the Prime Minister and he was followed by Mr. Clynes,Mr. Arthur Henderson, Mr. Brownlie, and Mr. Bevin.They explained that they had heard the views of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bromley,and they had agreed that it had been established that a real trades unions strugglewas going on which affected them all. They emphasised that they did not wish todiscuss merits, and explained that the object of the Deputation was to try and ascertain whether some means could not be found of securing a resumption of negotiations;otherwise it would be very difficult for the trades unions affected by the dispute to stand by without taking action.The attitude of some of the speakers was not without menace. Mr. Clynes, forexample, said frankly that those they represented thought that this was a challenge totrade unionism that they must take up. Mr. Brownlie quoted a member of his unionas saying: &quot; If ever there was an issue on which we should fight, it is here.&quot;Mr. Bevin said that in a journey during the week-end through South Wales and theMidlands he had everywhere been urged to call out his union. Mr. Henderson madethe notable remark that it was realised that the Government were better situated tomeet a strike than they had ever been before, since the war machine could be put inoperation against the men and could be used to smash the trades unions and to draintheir funds. He pointed out, however, that if this occurred the Government would only be at the beginning of their trouble. Broadly speaking, however, the spirit of theDeputation, if firm, was conciliatory. All speakers dwelt on the gravity of the situa-tion which would be created by a continuance of the strike.The Prime Minister in his reply did not underrate the gravity of the situation,and dwelt at some length on this aspect of the question, which had led him to make every possible efibrt to avert a strike. As the Deputation admitted having heard thecase of Mr. Thomas and Mr. Bromley, the Prime Minister felt it his duty to give thema summary of the proceedings from the point of view of the Government, in the courseof which he dwelt on the various phases with which the War Cabinet are familiar, and emphasised the suddenness of the strike, the refusal to grant a few days extra fordiscussion when he demanded it, and the entire absence of good-will. These and otherincidents which he referred to, such as the comment of the railwaymen on hearing the government&apos;s proposals that :&apos; the time for discussion was over,&quot; had brought it home to him that he was not dealing with men who desired to settle. This entirely justifiedthe allusion in one of his public statements to the strike as &quot;part of an anarchistplot,&quot; whiclfone of the speakers had resented.   He adhered entirely to this statement.The Prime Ministers statement made a very great impression on the Deputation,who, in spite of their desire to avoid merits, put one question after another elucidatingpoint after point. It was clear that they had not in the least understood the government&apos;s case, and their whole attitude became more friendly and conciliatory.
5WC 627After several attempts had been made to induce the Government to re-open negotiations with the railwaymen,. which the Prime Minister met by the statement that the men must return to work as an indispensable preliminary condition,Mr. Gosling put a definite question whether the Prime Minister would be willing tosee the other side with a view to re-opening negotiations.Before answering this question the Prime Minister felt it right that he should consult his colleagues, and after an adjournment for this consultation, he gave thefollowing considered reply, which was at once published :  &quot; If I am asked to see the Executive of the National Union of Railwaymenmy answer is, that I shall be ready to meet them and hear what they have tosay, but you will, I am sure, agree with me that there is nothing to be gained by any ambiguity, more especially as there has been a good deal of misunder-standing already.&quot; I want, therefore, to make it quite clear that in the opinion of theGovernment it would be quite impracticable to continue negotiations until work is resumed. Apart from other considerations the Ministers who would be concerned in the negotiations could not possibly attempt to deal with thequestions involved while their whole energy is devoted, as it must necessarily be, to improvising means of carrying on the life of the nation.&quot;The Deputation then retired shortly before 7 pan. By this time the desire of theDeputation to bring about a settlement had become very strongly marked.At 8&apos;45 p.m. they returned with the executive of the National Union of railwaymen.A prolonged conference then took place, the Prime Minister being accompaniedby Mr. Bonar Law.Mr. Thomas, who spoke on behalf of the railwaymen, was obviously labouring underconsiderable emotion and suffering from great fatigue. In a long preliminary statement,in the course of which he spoke of the solidarity of his men and the success of the Strike,the only concrete otfer was that he would order the Strike off if the Government would,in the question of standardisation, apply the same principle that the Government had applied in the case of the drivers and firemen. If he attempted to order the Strike offon anything less the men, he said, would accuse their Executive oi :&apos; selling them.&quot;The Prime Minister, in reply to this, said at once that he did not think thatMr. Thomas&apos;s observations had advanced the matter one step. It left the positionexactly where it was. In view of Mr. Thomas&apos;s remarks, he pointed out how thefacilities at the disposal of the Government were increasing every day and the country was becoming less paralysed. Each day the trains running exceeded, the forecast. Heindignantly repudiated the statement by Mr. Thomas that some of his colleagues hadbeen less anxious for a settlement than he. lie elaborated the point that, while theStrike continued, the Ministers mostly concerned must put all their energies into thework of feeding the country, including the 600,000 railwaymen, with their wives and families, therefore the first essential step in the resumption of negotiations is that the railwaymen should go back to work. &quot; Because you cannot let the country starvewhilst Ministers and railwaymen are discussing what wages will be paid next year.&quot;From this point on the conference consisted mainly in incessant attempts byMr. Thomas to bring it to the stage of negotiations which were repulsed by the PrimeMinister. These proceedings do not lend themselves to summary, more particularly asa large part of them consisted in disputes as to what had occurred at the previousconferences, with frequent references to the shorthand notes of those conferences. Onceor twice it looked as if the conversations must be broken off, but Mr. Thomas keptreverting to the folio wing sentence in the Prime Ministers opening statement: &quot;Wedeny there is any difference in the principle applied,&quot; which, he said, offered a ray ofhope. On each occasion this phi-ase was quoted to try and draw the Prime Ministeragain into &quot; negotiations,&quot; but without success.Towards the end Mr. Gosling intervened again, and suggested that therepresentatives of the various trade unions should be left to discuss the mattertogether. This was agreed to, and the conference adjourned at 9&quot;40 p.m. At about11 &quot;30 p.m. Mr. Gosling&apos;s Deputation, leaving the railwaymen in the Cabinet room,waited on the Prime Minister in an adjoining room. In the course of a long andsomewhat rambling statement Mr. Gosling made the proposal that an attempt shouldbe made to establish what the principle was on which the locomotive men&apos;s wages hadbeen fixed.   If there was no difference of opinion as to what principle had been adopted,
the matter should be referred to the arbitration of some independent body.&apos; When theprinciple bad been established it should be applied to the whole of the remaininggrades.The Prime Minister pointed out that this would inevitably lead to misunderstanding.The men would go back to work under the belief that the principle claimed byMr. Thomas was to be applied to their cases, and if Mr. Thomas&apos;s principle was upsetthey would say they had been sold and the trouble would begin all over again. Therewas no more reason for adopting Mr. Thomas&apos;s formula in this way as a basis than theGovernments formula.After a long discussion of detail, the following extracts from Minutes of a meetingwhen the locomotive&apos;s men&apos;s wages were under discussion was produced: &quot; Sir Robert Home : The proper question from my point of view is : Are yougoing or are you not going to use what is done in the case of the driver, the cleaner,and the firemen as a guide as to what is to be done in the other grades ?&quot; Mr. J. H. Thomas : I am prepared to deal with the other grades on the merits of the case as I will deal with these, and I am able to say I believe an equal!v formidable case with regard to those grades as I hope to show with this one.&quot; &quot;The Deputation were considerably impressed by this statement, and Mr. arthur henderson took a copy to show to Mr. Thomas.After rejoining the railwaymen for a short time Mr. Gosling returned to say thatthey felt they could get no further that night, and that they would like to resume thediscussion in the morning.    The meeting adjourned at 12&quot;40 a.m.Soon after noon to-day (3rd October) Mr. Gosling&apos;s Deputation, which had already had a meeting with the railwaymen, again met the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law.They had two proposals to make ; first, that the Government should raise the minimum wage from 40s. to 50s., and second, that there should be no change in the rates ofwages before the 31st December, 1921.The Prime Miuister could not accede to the raising of the minimum, for, as he pointed out, where the rates of pay of the different grades are separated by such small amounts, it is impossible to raise the minimum without raising all the other gradesproportionately, otherwise the ladder of promotion is interfered with; moreover, thiswas really dragging the Government into negotiation before the essential condition ofthe men returning to work was fulfilled.Mr. Henderson rather resented this rejection of the first proposal, and suggestedthat it was banging the door in the face of the Deputation. Mr. Williams, however,intervened at this point and strongly suggested that the offer of the Deputation wasnot their last word. In fact, there was a chorus against suggesting that the last wordhad been uttered. Mr. Williams then went on to suggest that the essential pointreally was to obtain an extension of the time during which the present rates of wages were to be paid.o
