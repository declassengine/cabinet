The War Cabinet had under consideration a telegram from canada at the Governor-General of Canada to   the Secretary of State forWashington. the   Colonies,  containing   detailed   proposals for the   distinctiverepresentation of Canada at Washington.The general trend of the discussion was in favour of agreeing tothe principle of Canadian representation at Washington, although it-was recognised that the working out of details involved constitutionalconsiderations of high policy, and that it might be best to proposesome temporary and experimental arrangement pending the con-ference to be held in the not distant future to discuss the readjustmentof the constitutional relations of the component parts of the BritishEmpire.The Secretary of State for the Colonies kaving read a draft telegram as a basis for consideration, the War Cabinet agreed that The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the Colonies, together with anyofficials they might require, should confer in order to draft a reply for the consideration of the War Cabinet.Support for the    &quot; 4.

That it should be pointed out that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were in general sympathy with theproposal to give support to the Polish army, andthat negotiations were already in progress for pro-viding certain stores for that army in return for payment.(2.) That His Majesty&apos;s Government regarded the respon-sibility for helping the Polish army to be one whichrested with the Allies generally, and only to a veryminor degree with Great Britain, but that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were nevertheless ready toexamine the whole question, and possibly help to a minor degree, provided that the French and UnitedStates Governments took their share.The War Cabinet further decided that The British military representative at Versailles should beinformed (a.) That His Majesty&apos;s government&apos; intend to limit the stores to be given free to non-marketable munitions,such as ammunition, guns, and tanks;(b.) That he should not assent to any recommendationwhich involved the British Government in the mainresponsibility for the transport of the stores or forthe cost of their transport.Breaches of the **&quot; The War Cabinet had under consideration the followingLaws of War by documents relating to the extent to which air attacks could be&quot;the Enemy: treated as breaches of the laws of war, for the purpose of chargingQuestion of Air        enemy persons :-11 ct c 1\ sMemorandum from the Air Ministry (Paper G.T.-8258).Reports from a Committee of Enquiry into Breaches of the Laws0,03 of War (Paper G.T.-7806).________Memorandum by  the  Secretary  of State  for War (Paper2- ^ G.T.-8280).  o o He &quot;jhg Attorney-General having stated that the list of persons tobe demanded for trial was being revised, and that the new list(which would be ready in the course of the next week or so) wouldcontain a few names only of aviators, the War Cabinet decidedthat-(a.)

J. B. Hurst (Paper G.T.-8119).Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War (Paper G.T.-8218).After some discussion, the War Cabinet decided that As no other military Power gave any indication of desistingfrom preparations for the employment of asphyxiatinggases in warfare, the War Office should continue its gasorganisation, without denouncing the Land War Conven-tion and the Declaration of 1907, so far as these tie our hands in the matter of gas.Congestion of 7.. With reference to War Cabinet &amp;S2, Minute 7, the WarPorts. Cabinet had under consideration the Report of a Conference on theShipping Situation and the Congestion in the Docks (Paper G.T.-8309).Some discussion took place as to paragraph 2 (a) : &quot; That the Ministry of Shipping, in consultation with theMinistry of Transport, should have authority to block Govern -ment traffic at the port of shipment in cases where they aresatisfied that the import would add to or cause congestion dueto lack of storage accommodation in this country. Departmentsimporting goods on Government account to be required to showto the Ministry of Transport how they propose to store the goodsin this country before shipping facilities are arranged.&quot;It was explained that, owing to the absence of the Minister ofFood in Brussels, at a meeting of the Supreme Economic Council,when the Conference in question was held, the recommendations contained in the Report had only recently come to his notice, andthat a Conference was to be held that afternoon between repre-sentatives of the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Shipping todiscuss the congestion of storage accommodation.The War Cabinet decided (a.) That a further meeting of the Conference, under the chair-manship of Sir Eric Geddes, set up by War Cabinet 632,Minute 7, should be held to discuss with the Minister ofFood the recommendations contained in paragraph 2 (a)of the report.(&amp;.) To approve the following recomuiendations : &quot; That the Storage Committee of the Ministry of reconstruction should in future act as a clearing-house for the allocation of storage in the hands of Governmentdepartments other than in ports, and should make recommendations as to the best use of availableaccommodation.&quot;&quot; That the Storage Committee be transferred to theMinistry of Transport.&quot;Some discussion took place with regard to paragraph 5 &quot; (a.) Congestion of traffic could not be completely preventedso long as the imports of important commodities are under thecontrol of Government departments, and a return to normalconditions, whereby such imports are- in the hands of privatetraders, is essential to a permanent solution of the problem.
5WC 631&quot;(6.) In order to release storage and circulate stores and materials without delay, all Government stores in the UnitedKingdom, and in every theatre of war and at all ports what so-ever, should be declared surplus forthwith, and sold as soon aspossible, excepting only sufficient to provide for the peace-time requirements of the fighting services, and such duly authorisedreserves as prudence may require in the interests of safety ; such requirements and reserves to be declared by the departmentsconcerned within a reasonable time to be laid down by theCabinet.    One month is suggested.&quot; The Disposal Board should effect sales even at reducedprices, rather than hold out for better results entailing theretention of storage accommodation urgently required for thecommerce of the country.&quot;It was explained that arrangements had been made to set up aJoint Committee of the Ministry of Munitions, the War Office, andthe Admiralty to examine the question ; that the militaryauthorities were now declaring as surplus large quantities ofmilitary stores ; and that no further action was required at present.Transfer of Motor 8. The Minister of Munitions drew attention to the fact thatLorries. it would be necessary that the Ministry of Transport, to whommotor lorries had been handed by his department during therailway strike, should take them on charge at a definite figure.The lorries were handed over by the military authorities ata valuation fixed by a,n independent committee, and were repairedby the Ministry of Munitions. If disposed of to the public theywould be sold for cash, and if transferred to other departmentsa definite charge should be entered.The War Cabinet decided that The matter should be left to the Minister of Transport and theMinister of Munitions to settle.NationalShipyards.Sale of AdmiraltyTrawlers andDrifters.9. With reference to a memorandum by the Shipping Con-troller (Paper G.T.-8178) on the question of national shipyards, theShipping Controller stated that negotiations for the sale of nationalshipyards were proceeding, and that he hoped he might be able tosettle the matter without bringing it before the War Cabinet.10. The War Cabinet had under consideration a memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty (Paper G.T.-8057) concerningthe disposal of Admiralty-owned trawlers and drifters, together withmemoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper G.T.-8058),the Secretary for Scotland (Paper G.T.-8091), and the President ofthe Board of Agriculture (Paper G.T.-8170).The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that, as a result of conferences between the departments concerned, the followingscheme had been agreed upon, subject to the War Cabinet decidingthat any scheme at all was necessary:- (a.) That the drifters should be sold to ex-service fishermenowners or groups of fishermen, payment being made by instalments over a period of ten years.(b.) That 200 trawlers should be sold to a company composed of ex-service fishermen, the company to provide money for equipment and working expenses, the purchase-money for the vessels to be secured by a Government mortgageat 5 per cent, for twenty years.
Sir Eric Geddes pointed out that what applied to trawlers andfishermen appeared to him to apply also to Royal Army ServiceCorps officers and men and Motor-Lorry Services, and that he mighthave to ask the Cabinet similarly to consider such applications at alater date.Some discussion took place as to the terms on which the vessels should be sold ; 10,0001. had been the figure agreed upon by thedepartments concerned for a trawler, and 4,OO0Z. for a drifter, as afair average price if all the vessels were sold in one lot. It waspointed out that, as existing trawler owners were refraining frombidding, in the hope that later on they would obtain the vessels ontheir own terms, the Government would have difficulty in findingpurchasers for the vessels in the open market. On the other hand,the view was expressed that, having regard to the great demand for shipping of all kinds, the Government should have no difficulty inselling the vessels for at least what it had cost to build them 18,O00L each particularly if the Government let it be known thatin the last resort they would not refuse foreign offers. It waspointed out, however, that, having regard to the heroic work whichhad been done by fishermen mine-sweepers in the war, and the expectation they had formed that they would be offered fishing-vessels on favourable terms, the matter could not be regarded solelyfrom the point of view of sale for the best price obtainable.It was stated that the Secretary for Scotland wished the questionof separate companies for England and Wales and for Scotland tobe regarded as open to consideration.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the scheme submitted by Lord Lytton onbehalf of the Admiralty, with the concurrence of theother departments, subject to the reconsideration of thepurchase - price proposed both for trawlers and fordrifters.(6.) That the Admiralty should confer with the Minister ofShipping with regard to the price, and, subject to agreement between them, action might be taken withoutfurther reference to the War Cabinet.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,September 16, 1919.
