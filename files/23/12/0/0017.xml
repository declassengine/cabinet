Bates AdvisoryCommittee.Mr. F. Gore-Browne.1. The Lord Chancellor asked the War Cabinet to take note of the fact that Mr. F. Gore-Browne, K.C., had, to his own know-ledge, made a considerable personal sacrifice in accepting the post of Chairman of the Rates Advisory Committee of the Ministry ofTransport.Agricultural Policy,ForthcomingStatement by thePrime Minister.GuaranteedMinimum Price.2. The meeting was called to enable the Prime Minister to consult his colleagues as to the main lines of an important state-ment on agriculture, to be made by him to a deputation on thefollowing afternoon.3. The War Cabinet were informed that the area of arable-cultivation in the United Kingdom which had been extendedduring the war by some 1-J million acres but was still about2f million acres less than the corresponding area for the year1871 was tending to fall. This was due to the apprehensions of farmers that the price of corn was likely to drop. These appre-apprehensions were, in the opinion of the War Cabinet, ill-founded, as,owing to the rise in the cost of coal, transport and labour inforeign countries, there was small prospect of a fall in prices.These apprehensions, however, existed, and constituted a realimpediment to more exf.ended arable cultivation.The War Cabinet authorised The Prime Minister to make a statement in general terms tothe effect that the policy of the Government was to extend the guarantee for such period as might be necessary; butthe Government could not be definitely committed, either as to the price to be fixed or to the number of years towhich the guarantee would extend pending the report ofthe Royal Commission which is now enquiring into thematter. The farmers, however, should be encouraged -to. extend the areas at present under cultivation, and shouldbe given sufficient assurance to induce them to do this.CapriciousEvictions.&apos;4. In view of the fears of the farming community substan-tiated, as they were, by instances of losses actually incurred thattheir farms might be sold over their heads and themselvesevicted an apprehension which led farmers to extract the utmostout of their lands, while it discouraged them from incurring any expenditure of money on the development of the said lands theWar Cabinet decided that The Prime Minister should be authorised to state to thedeputation that the policy of the Government would beto safeguard tenant farmers from capricious eviction inthe event of sale or notice for raising rents. In case of dispute as to the latter, the matter to be settled by arbitration.Scientific Research.State Aid.5. The War Cabinet took note of the statement that theamounts proposed by the President of the Board of Agricultureand Fisheries for expenditure on scientific research do not involve any demands for money not already authorised. The continuation of those grants, which are less than/those of any foreign country,was generally supported, and the President of the Board of Agri-culture and Fisheries was requested to see that grants were not given to universities without previous consultation of the Presi-dent of the Board of Education.
Tenants&apos; Eight ofAppeal.3 WO 6326. Having regard to the fact that successive Commissions on agriculture, had uniformly reported that landlords had done their duty to the best of their ability in repairing tenants&apos; buildings The War Cabinet did not consider it necessary to announce that provision should be made for appeal by the tenantagainst refusal by a landlord to carry out repairs.The question of giving compulsory powers to the county committees in extremely bad cases was left for furtherconsideration.Credit Facilitiesfor Agriculture.7. The War Cabinet decided that In view of the heavy capital commitments of the Governmententailed by the housing, transport, and other reconstruc-tion schemes, the Prime Minister should not announceany scheme of Government responsibility for givingcredit facilities to farmers or landlords. It was con-sidered sufficient for the Prime &quot;Minister, on thefollowing day, to announce that agriculture would need more credit owing to new conditions; that farmers should use farm banks as in other countries; but that theGovernment should not be committed to further expendi-ture unless other resources are found inadequate.Eailway Bates.8. It was pointed out that, as a hint had been given to theRates Advisory Committee that it was the intention of the Govern-ment to differentiate railway rates in favour of agriculture, thePrime Minister should include this in his statement of policy,since, otherwise, it would be assumed that the proposal had beenadopted independently by the Advisory Committee, and theGovernment would get no credit for it.The War Cabinet approved the suggestion.Compulsory Bowers 9. Some discussion took place as to the expediency of con-over Cultivation of j tinuing, in time of peace,. the powers acquired under the CornBand. Production Act for exercising compulsion in regard to the cultiva-tion of land.It was held, on the one hand, that the exercise of compulsory powers under the Defence of the Realm Act had led to a greatdeal of foolish and vexatious action by the Agricultural county committees, and that it would be very difficult to maintain, intime of peace, the power to interfere with the free exercise of afarmer&apos;s judgment in the cultivation of his land, in his own interest, at the dictation of a Committee of his neighbours.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, as the Governmentwere going to guarantee prices, they were entitled to secure thenation against bad husbandry; that the compulsory powers hadbeen most effective in checking bad farming; that an arbitrary andunfair exercise of them would be prevented by the power of appealcontained in the new proposals, which had not existed under theDefence of the Realm Regulations; and that the national farmers&apos; Union desired that the compulsory powers should beretained, in the interest of good farming.The War Cabinet decided that The compulsory powers over the cultivation of land should beretained.
Bread. Subsidy. 10. Reference was made to the proposal to discontinue the bread subsidy, but, in view of the fact that further consideration was required before a definite proposal could be laid down, it wasagreed that no mention should be made of the bread subsidy inthe Prime Minister&apos;s statement.11. The War Cabinet concurred in a proposal that a strongappeal should be made to agricultural labourers to put forwardtheir best efforts, and that it should be made clear that the con-tinuance of the existing high level of agricultural wages must depend upon an adequate return for the wages paid.Appeal toAgriculturalLabourers.Certain generaladvantages of theAgricultural Policy.12. The War Cabinet suggested that the Prime Minister, inthe course of his statement, should lay stress on the followingpoints, which were of importance to the community as a wholerather than to the agricultural interest: (a.) The price of food ought to be lessened by the increasedhome production.(&amp;.) The exchange  difficulties  of the country would bealleviated.13. The War Cabinet generally approved the lines of thePrime Ministers statement, subject to the conclusions aboverecorded.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.October 20, 1919,o
