THE War Cabinet bad before them draft heads of a reply tothe railwaymen (see Appendix).1. The War Cabinet considered the possibility of introducing a paragraph to show that the Government were prepared to go further than the rigid application of the principle of 100 per cent, increasein the standard rate of wages in anomalous cases. After some discussion it was agreed to adopt the following form of words : &quot;In fixing the new standard rates the basis has beenroughly an average addition of 100 per cent., and the Govern-ment will not act on rigid lines, and will in the future, as in thepast, be ready to consider and discuss anomalies and cases of hardship to any particular grades in the application of thepercentage of increase to be made.&quot;2. A proposal was made that, in view of the uncertainty of the upward or downward fluctuation of prices, an offer should be madeto continue the present agreement until prices had been furtherstabilised.   Three variants of this proposal were discussed : -(1.) That the existing arrangement of pre-war wage plus war wage should be definitely continued until next June,when the whole question would be reconsidered.(2.) That the rates should not be lowered until the price ofliving had fallen from 115 per cent, above pre-war levelto say 110 per cent., and had remained there for at least three months.(3.) That an undertaking should be given not to bring down the war wages until the cost of living had fallen to asubstantial extent, viz., to 100 per cent, above the pre-war level as compared with the highest point reached,viz., 125 per cent., and the present level of 115 per cent,above the pre-war prices.It was pointed out in respect of the first proposal that Mr.Bromley would probably represent that the -Locomotive Drivers&apos;Union would be prejudiced by such an agreement, owing to the factthat they were entitled by the current railway agreement to apply for the reconsideration of the standard rates after the 31st December,and were now formulating a new programme for that purpose.It was also suggested that the whole question of fluctuation in wages to correspond with changes in the cost of living should bereferred to the Court of Arbitration, which had been specially setup for this purpose, and that were a settlement made with theRailway Companies based on a rise or fall in the cost of living, theCourt would find themselves bound by it in their dealings withother industries.The second proposal was adopted.It was generally agreed that in the event of a rise in prices anincrease of the war wage would have to be made, but it was pointedout that an increase in the cost of living to 125 per cent, was thestandard upon which the war wage had been fixed, and that acorresponding rise in wages could not be claimed unless the cost ofliving rose above 125 per cent.Suggested Increase 3. The Cabinet further considered whether it was possible to of Minimum Wage, raise the minimum wage of railway workers from 40s. to 45s., on theunderstanding that the last 5s. should be taken off when the cost ofliving fell. A large number of objections were raised against this (a.) It  would  seriously reduce  the difference between theminimum wage and the wages of the higher gradesConcessions toAnomalous Grades.Fluctuation inWar Wagecorrespondingwith Cost ofLiving.
which would discourage the desire for promotion, andthe proposal could hardly be adopted without readjustingthe ladder right through the various grades.(6.) It would cost 9 or 10 millions.(c.) As in the case of the 12 per cent, increase, it would reactright through all trades, including possibly the navy and Army.On the whole it was felt that the balance of argument was against the proposal, and that it should not be made in the firstinstance.   If proposed by the railwaymen it would be considered.The Cabinet decided that : A reply should be made to the railwaymen on the lines laiddown above, and that the Prime Minister, Mr. Bonar Law,the President of the Board of Trade, the Minister ofTransport, the Minister of Labour, and Sir Francis Dunnellshould forthwith prepare a statement to be made to the railwaymen by the Prime Minister.Decisions of The remaining Ministers having withdrawn, the Prime MinisterDrafting Com- read the draft of a statement which had been prepared earlier inmittee- the day by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofLabour.Subject to certain corrections, this suggestion was adopted as thebasis of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.It was further agreed that the reading of this statement shouldbe followed by a statement of the concessions already agreed to andthe heads of the reply referred to above, which were amended by certain textual alterations and the deletion of paragraph 4.The statement as finally approved is contained in the steno-graphic notes of the subsequent conference.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,September 26, 1919.[p.t.o.
APPENDIX.Railway Strike.Proposed Heads of a Reply to the Railwaymen and of the Official Statement to be issued to the Press in case of a Strike.1. THE new standard wage proposed is equal to an average of at least  100 percent, over the pre-war wage, and guarantees to every adult railway worker, irrespective of any fall in the cost of living a permanent minimum of 40s. per week. This figureof 40s. compares with an average of 1.8s. to 20s. per week before the war.2. In addition, the extra payments for Sunday duty, night duty, and overtimeagreed to are equal on the average to another 20 per cent, on the pre-war wage.3. In addition to these money wages the hours of labour have been reduced toeight.4. This increase, on the average of 120 per cent., together with a guaranteeminimum of 40s., irrespective of the war wage and increased earnings for overtime, &amp;c,is put forward as what we hope to be the permanent railway wage to remain,irrespective of any possible fall in the cost of living.5. In any event the issue does not arise till the 31st December, as until then noman will receive less than his present aggregate earnings, and during that time thereis time for negotiations, which the Government are willing to continue.6. In addition to this standard increase there is no question of reducing thepresent total wage at the 31st December, if the cost of living should be the same as atpresent, and as long as this high cost continues the men will receive the full aggregatewages they obtain now. Further, the Government are willing to undertake that no reduction will be made in the war wage until there is a fall in the cost of living to theextent of        per cent.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.
