Kussia:The Baltic States.fro4,1. WITH reference to War Cabinet 623 (1), the War Cabinetresumed their discussion on the subject of the policy to be followed in dealing with the Baltic States.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read an appreciation (Appendix I) of the situation in the Baltic States andthe results which might be anticipated to ensue from the policywhich had been proposed on the previous day as affecting (a.) The Baltic States themselves.(b.) General Denekin and the other anti-Bolshevist forces inRussia.(c.) The German forces in the Baltic States.(d.) British interests.The Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs then read thedraft of a telegram, based on the principles suggested at the previous meeting of the Cabinet, which it was proposed to address to theGovernments of Esthonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, a notification on similar lines being made to Finland if they applied to the ForeignOffice for information. The draft telegram contained alternativesentences dealing with the subject of diplomatic representation, thefirst of which indicated a different attitude according as any negotia-tions concluded between the Baltic States and the Bolshevists should result in an armistice or in a peace which opened up full diplomatic relations between the Baltic States and the Bolshevists. The second alternative comprised a sentence of a more general character, and theWar Cabinet felt that this draft was the preferable one of the two.After some discussion the War Cabinet agreed that the telegram should in some form make it clear that, while the British Governmentwere not prepared to give to the Baltic States supplies for thepurpose of aggressive operations against the Bolshevists, they would,nevertheless, in the event of an attack by the Bolshevist Govern-ment on the freedom and liberties of the States, be prepared to reconsider the situation.After learning from the Director of Military Operations theviews of the General Staff as to the effect which the proposed policy,assuming it resulted in a peace between the-Baltic States and the bolshevists, would have on the other anti-Bolshevist fronts, andafter considering certain points put forward by the Secretary of Statefor War, which are reproduced in Appendix II, the War cabinet decided (1.) To approve the draft telegram prepared by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, subject to its being amended in accordance with the discussion sum-marised above. (The telegram as amended is reproduced&apos;in Appendix III.)(2.) That a copy of the telegram should be sent by the ActingSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs to Sir Eyre Crowe,the representative of the British Government on theSupreme Council in Paris, for communication to, and forthe information of, the representatives of the principal allied and Associated Powers in Paris.Assistance toGeneral Denekin.0(4l0reference to War Cabinet 612 (2) andfor despatch  to General Denekin, thethe &quot; packet &quot;War  CabinetWithauthorisedagreed That, in order to avoid demurrage for shipping, the Chancellorof the Exchequer should sanction the despatch to general denekin of a ship conveying an advance instalment of the storescomprising the &quot; packet,&quot; of which the Secretary of State forWar undertook to communicate particulars for consideration bythe Cabinet during the early part of the following week.
3WC 624Situation and 2. The War Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstPolicy in Ireland. Lor(j Qf the Admiralty (G.T.-8215) on the situation in Ireland,together with- correspondence between the Acting Secretary of theWar Cabinet and the Attorney-General (G.T.-8210) showing that unless legislation was previously enacted the Government of ireland act would come into operation on the ratification of the last of thePeace Treaties which is likely to be the Treaty of Peace with turkey.The Viceroy and the Chief Secretary verbally expressed complete agreement with Mr. Long&apos;s memorandum.The Viceroy made a general statement on the seriousness of thesituation in Ireland, the gist of which is contained in a memorandum which he undertook to circulate (G.T.-8227). The Viceroy requested that certain measures should be taken to strengthen the hands of theIrish Administration in connection with the following matters : (1.) Improvement of the Secret Service.(2.) Extension of powers of the Executive under Regulation 14 b of the Defence of the Realm Act.(3.) Provision of prison accommodation in  England for Irishprisoners.(4.) Encouragement of the Royal Irish Constabulary, particularly by an advance by the Treasury of 10Z. per man pending a passage of the Bill now before Parliament.(5.) Increase in numbers of the G Division of the Dublin Metro-politan Police.(6.) Increase of the establishment of the Royal Irish Constabu-lary, particularly in view of the approaching reduction ofthe military forces in Ireland.(7.) Assistance to discharged soldiers and sailors through the medium of the Central Council instituted in Dublin forthat purpose.(8.) The passing into law without delay of the Education bill and Land for Soldiers Bill.The Chief Secretary made a statement supporting the measuresadvocated by the Viceroy (with the exception of the proposed extension of powers under Regulation 14 b) and indicated to theCabinet the difficulties in securing the administration of justice andthe punishment of crime in Ireland. He drew particular attentionto the importance of announcing, as suggested in Mr. Long&apos;s rnemo-randum, that the Irish Government had behind them the wholesupport of the British Government, and to the necessity of making an early statement on future policy. The general trend of thediscussion which followed was to the effect that -(1.) It was impossible simply to repeal the Government ofIreland Act.(2.) Steps must be taken to prevent it from coming automaticallyinto operation on the ratification of peace, since it wasnot acceptable to any of the interests concerned, andsome of its provisions, notably the financial clauses, were no longer applicable.(3.) The matter must be dealt with in the forthcoming Parlia-mentary Session, and in view of the dangerous situationin Ireland and the possibility of an early ratification ofthe Peace Treaties, legislation must be introduced earlyin the Session.With a view to a further discussion on the subject by theCabinet on the morning of Tuesday or Wednesday of the following week, the Secretary was instructed to circulate the following documents : (1.) A memorandum to be handed in by the Viceroy.
(2.) The two draft Bills for the Government of Ireland preparedby committees under the chairmanship of Lord Curzonand Mr. Long in 1917 and 1918 respectively.De Valera. 3. The War Cabinet had before them a letter from the chief secretary to the Prime Minister (G.T.-7838) on the question of thereturn of Mr. de Valera to Ireland.The War Cabinet decided : That Mr. de Valera should be prevented from returning toIreland until further orders.The Registrar- 4. A question which was raised concerning the Department ofGenerals the Registrar-General was referred for decision to the ChancellorDepartment. of the Exchequer and the Minister of Health.&apos;2, Whitehall Gardens,September 25, 1919.4
WC 624APPENDIX I.Appreciation by Acting Secretary op State por Foreign Affairs.THE Baltic States attach paramount importance to the satisfaction of two oftheir claims: (1) the . recognition of their independence de jure; (2) the supply ofmaterial wherewith to continue the struggle against the Soviet Government. Of thesetwo the first plays a predominant role.. An undertaking on the part of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to support merely their autonomy in the future settlement of eastern europe will be nothing to them. Any Russian Government, short of one that ispurely reactionary or Czarist, will concede them autonomy, possibly to the full extent,and our support will be purely superfluous. Their demand is for independence pureand simple. It. is to gain this alone that provides the Baltic Governments with amotive for continuing the war against the Bolshevists and for furnishing a stimulus fortheir armies.His - Majesty&apos;s Government have now decided that they are not prepared torecognise the independence of these States, and it may therefore be assumed that on receipt of the news the latter will proceed with their negotiations for peace with the bolshevists.In all probability they will be followed at no distant date, first hy Finland andthen by Poland. The Finnish Government have virtually informed us that, unless weintervene now by recognising the independence of the Baltic States, they will considerthat we have disinterested ourselves in any action which may be taken by Russiansneighbours and will adopt a policy of their own. This is a fair inference from tworecent notes which have been presented by the Finnish Minister; and a furtherinference, almost equally fair, is that unless we intervene in the sense which they suggest, the Finnish Government will themselves enter on peace negotiations withthe Bolshevists. This would, indeed, be a natural consequence of a peace between theBaltic States and the Bolshevists, since Finland would then be left isolated beforethe enemy in the north, and, if the anti-Boishevist front is once broken, she wouldhave no particular object in remaining in the war.Poland has so far given no direct indication that she proposes to make peace withthe Bolshevists, but already a fortnight ago the Polish Minister stated privately thathe expected any day to receive instructions from his Government to sound DMajesty&apos;s Government as to how they would view such a move. The successfuloffensive of the Polish forces in the East has now reached the limits to which Polishpublic opinion will allow them to go. and the call to transfer them to the defence ofthe Western frontiers against the Germans has now become imperative. If theNorthern States make peace, it will clearly be difficult for the Polish Government todefend continued action.We must therefore be prepared for the collapse of the whole anti-Bolshevist frontas far south as the Ukraine, and the whole brunt of the Bolshevist attack will therefore fall&apos;on Denekin.At the&apos;same time, the discontinuance of a front between the Baltic States and theSoviet forces will facilitate the passage of Bolshevists out of, and of Germans into,Russia. At the present moment British prestige stands so high in the Baltic States,and German consequently so low, that the Germans find an unfavourable jumping-offground in those countries. The position will be reversed when it is realised that weare practically going to abandon them to their fate, and it will not be surprising if,like the Finns and certain sections of Russians before them, the Baltic States turn toGermany to help them to realise the aspirations which we have denied them.Our attitude towards these States, however, once they have made peace with the bolshevists, needs to be defined. In the ordinary way we should presumably break offdiplomatic relations with States that make peace with the common enemy; and we nodoubt should have to do so in this case, if they receive Bolshevist agents or emissaries,or if they show any tendency, as a consequence, to go Bolshevist themselves. If,however, they do not go so far as this, we have an interest in accepting with good gracea situation for which we should be partially responsible, and in mitigating theconsequences, in so far as they may involve the surrender of our place to the Germans,by maintaining as cordial relations as we can and obtaining as much as we can out ofthe changed conditions for British trade and enterprise. It must, however, beremembered that British firms are virtually making a declaration by us that we will[958] &quot; C
recognise the independence of these countries a sine qua non for doing business withthe Governments concerned.   A declaration in the reverse sense will put a stop toatheir proceeding with any proposals which they may have been inclined to entertain.It is, moreover, only fair to the Baltic States that we should frankly recognisethat they have no alternative but to make peace if we decline to allow them theconditions on which they would be justified in continuing the war. Without them the only reward for their making a successful offensive against the Soviet Governmentwould be the establishment of a Power whose first act would be to put an end to theindependence which was their motive for fighting. It would be a form of suicide whichwe could hardly expect them to commit.While, therefore, we cannot encourage them to make peace, we should, if they doso, endeavour to make the best of the situation, and consolidate our position in those parts by such new means as we may find at our disposal.A final problem arising out of the conclusion of peace between the Baltic Statesand the Bolshevists will be how to extricate the Russian forces under General Yudenitch,and for this we shall probably in the end be compelled to make ourselves responsible.APPENDIX II.The Baltic Situation.Notes by the Secretary of State for War.FIVE decisions were arrived at by the Cabinet yesterday about the Baltic States I. We are to tell them that we will send them no more supplies.II. We are to tell them that we cannot encourage their hopes of independence.III. We are to tell them that we cannot assist them with a loan.IV. In these circumstances we have no right to press them to continue theirstruggle with the Bolshevists.V.-We are to tell them that we have ordered the Germans to leave Courland,and will take steps to make them do so.It is worth noting that every one of these steps, necessary as some of them are,helps the Bolshevists, with whom on other parts of the front we are at war. Thefollowing consequences may arise therefrom : 1. The Baltic States may make peace with the Bolshevists.2. The   North-West   Russian army may,  in consequence   of  such   peace,   beannihilated.3. Finland probably, and Poland possibly, may follow the example of the baltic states or join with them in making a peace.4. 97,000 Bolsheviks on these fronts will be liberated, and will immediately behurled upon the armies of General Denekin.5. The effect of any of these peace settlements, particularly a peace settlement byFinland, upon the fortunes of the North Russians, whom we have left tofight it out alone at Archangel and Murmansk, will probably be fatal.6. Petrograd, whose hopes of deliverance and food have been encouraged all thisyear by the operations of the British Navy, will be reduced to despair.7. If the Germans in Courland do not obey our orders to quit, all the Russians inthis North-Western region will have no hope but to turn to them and try to make common cause with them.8. The death-knell will have been struck of British influence in these regions, andthe episode will be, rightly or wrongly, regarded by Russia as a supremeact of indifference and abandonment.In these circumstances, the final decision which the War Cabinet have to take isone of far-reaching importance.It would be much simpler, much safer, and, in the long run, much cheaper tocontinue to make war upon the Bolshevists by every means in our power (which do not involve the employment of British troops or the expenditure of large sums of money),with a coherent plan on all fronts at once, until such time as either a definite victory iswon, or it is decided to make a general peace in which all parties would be included.(Signed) WINSTON S. CHURCHILL.September 25, 1919.
7WC 624APPENDIX III.Cypher Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Representatives at Reval (No. 157), Riga (No. 66),and Kovno (No. 1).(Urgent.) Foreign Office, September 25, 1919, 9 v.m.THE numerous requests for assistance in different forms and for a definitedeclaration of policy that are continually addressed to His Majesty&apos;s Government onbehalf of the Baltic States have required the former to reconsider the question in itsbroadest aspect. It now appears that none of the States concerned wishes or intends to act separately, and that concerted action is in contemplation. Indeed, a conference has been summoned for the purpose on the 29th September, at which the replies to theovertures of the Soviet Government will be duly considered.His Majesty&apos;s Government have no right to anticipate what the decision of theConference may be. It will doubtless be arrived at from a consideration of the futureinterests of the States as a whole as well as of the preservation of the liberties of theindividual States, who, with the aid of the Allies, have fought so bravely for their freedom. This has in each case been successfully achieved, and it remains to be decided by what means it may be most effectively safeguarded in the futui-e.His Majesty&apos;s Government have already recognised the autonomous existence ofthe Governments of the Baltic States and have dealt with them as such. The questionof the de jure recognition of the independence of the States is one which it isimpossible for them to decide upon their own responsibility or in severance from their allies. The Peace Conference alone or the League of Nations, sitting in sequel to thePeace Conference, can arrive at a definite decision on a matter in which interests more comprehensive than those of any individual State or community are concerned. Inany such decision His Majesty&apos;s Government may be relied upon to exert such influenceas they may possess to secure the satisfaction of the legitimate aspirations of Esthonia(Latvia) (Lithuania), so far as may be consistent with a final and peaceful settlement in north-East Europe.The principal menace by which this settlement is now threatened and delayed isthe presence of German forces under General von der Goltz. The retirement of these forces is the first condition of the achieved liberation of the States. Marshal Foch,acting on behalf of the Allies, has already requested the German Government, throughthe Armistice Commission, to order their immediate withdrawal, and in view of thefailure of the German authorities to comply with this request, steps are now beingtaken to apply definite measures of coercion, by which the speedy evacuation of these territories may be secured.His Majesty&apos;s Government are asked whether they can continue to supply militarymaterial and stores to the States whom they have assisted in their struggle for freedom.The reduction of the available stocks of material consequent upon the termination of thewar and the shortage of shipping unfortunately render it impossible to continue thesecontributions, which have hitherto fallen almost exclusively upon Great Britain. Thisdecision is arrived at without prejudice to any action that may be taken by any other of the Allied Powers or by the Powers acting in Paris as a whole.Neither is this decision intended to imply any abandonment of the States in theevent of their boundaries being crossed and their existence imperilled by an invasion ofBolshevist forces. In such a case, where the national liberties of Esthonia (Latvia)(Lithuania) would be at stake, His Majesty&apos;s Government might be prepared to makethe sacrifices, which are not justified by present conditions, and to reconsider their decision as to the supply of war material.Similarly, as regards the provision of credit, it is impossible for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to assume at this stage a financial responsibility which they have hitherto been unable to accept. While they have exerted themselves to aid the States in theprovision of loans from independent quarters, they cannot, in view of the grave financialstraits in which the entire world is placed, depart from the attitude in this respect,which they have consistently assumed.In these circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government feel that they are not entitled toexercise any pressure upon the free initiative of the Baltic States and that their governments must be at liberty to decide upon such action as may be most conducive&quot;to the preservation of their own national existence.   It is for them to determine with
unfettered judgment whether they should make any arrangement, and, if so, of whatnature, with the Soviet authorities ; and if, as seems to be in contemplation, theydecide to act in unison, the effective control of the situation should be within their power. His Majesty&apos;s Government will not cease to use their influence, both in the council&apos;s of the Allies and through their diplomatic representatives in the States, toassist in the preservation of their liberties and in the task of their economic and commercial reorganisation.You should make a communication in the above sense to the Esthonian (Latvian)(Lithuanian) Government.Addressed to Reval (No. 157), Riga, and Kovno.Repeated to Astoria (No. 1179), Helsingfors (No. 646), and Warsaw (No. 288).
