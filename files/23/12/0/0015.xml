The War Cabinet had a short discussion on the subject ofrailway wages, as the question was to be taken up with the repre-sentatives of the railwaymen the same afternoon.It was generally agreed that the railwaymen must be made to face the question of the effect of rises in wages upon the finances of the railway^s. The view was expressed, and not objected to, thatthere was no reason why permission should not be granted, if the railwaymen pressed for it, to an accountant, nominated by them, toexamine and report on this aspect of the question.In this connection the Minister of Transport stated that he proposed, as soon as Parliament met, to lay before it, in the form of* Note by the Secretary. Before the end of the Meeting, Sir Robert Home sentword that he had seen Sir Allan Smith, who had stated that he could do no more inthe matter, and the Prime Minister then issued a formal Minute of Appointment forthe British Delegation to the Labour Conference.
