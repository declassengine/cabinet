Visit of PresidentPoineare^ and the shah of Persia.1. The War Cabinet, at the suggestion of the Acting Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs, authorised -The First Commissioner of Works to utilise, for the decorated-tion of the streets during the forthcoming visit of Presi-dent Poincare and the Shah of Persia, so much as might prove necessary of the residue of the amounts allotted forthe decoration of London during the Peace Celebrations-Return ofMr. Balfour.Payment ofRoyalties on Oil.L. F. B.G. M. E.2. The Prime Minister welcomed Mr. Balfour on his firstappearance at the War Cabinet after his prolonged absence at thePeace Conference. On behalf of the Government he thankedMr. Balfour for his arduous and successful services to the countrywhile in Paris.3. With reference to War Cabinet 803, Minute 4, the WarCabinet, again discussed the question of the ownership ofpetroleum produced in the United Kingdom, which was to beraised by a question in Parliament as to whether the Governmenthad come to a decision as to the payment of royalties on oil dis-oovered in Derbyshire.In view of the great difficulty of assessing the royalty to bepaid, owing to the fluidity of oil, which, though discovered on oneproperty, might emanate from or be tapped on another property,and in view of the fact that the sale of property on which oil wasdiscovered might have been transacted without the possibility ofits presence entering into the purchase-price, the War cabinet decided that- (a.) The ownership of all oil from borings in the UnitedKingdom should be vested solely in the State, and no compensation should be paid to owners of oil-bearingproperty from the oil itself.(&amp;.).. Compensation should only be paid in respect of dis-turbance of property and loss of amenity caused by theworking of the wells.The War Cabinet further decided that The Minister of Munitions, in consultation with the Parlia-mentary Draughtsman, should prepare a Bill, for early introduction in Parliament, carrying out the above decisions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer raised the question as towhether it was desirable, in view of the fact that the Governmenthad already spent 800,000Z. on experimenting for oil and that only one actual oil-producing well had yet been discovered, to dis-continue the operations.Sir John Cadman, however, was able to give later informationof a more favourable kind, and stated that Messrs. Pearson wereprepared to take over the whole of the operations from the Govern-ment, provided the question of royalties was satisfactorily settledfrom their point of view, and to recompense the Government for expenditure already incurred.The Chancellor of the Exchequer then withdrew his proposal.Aliens RestrictionBill.Pilotage Certificate,Hi4. The War Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (Paper G.T.-8378), inwhich it was stated that a clause had been inserted in Committeein the Aliens Restriction Bill to the effect that no alien shall holda pilotage certificate for any port in the United Kingdom. Itwas further pointed out that the clause is in direct contradictionto the Anglo-French Convention, to which effect is given in
3 WC 633Section 24 of the Pilotage Act, 1913, under which provision ismade &quot; (i.) For the renewal of pilotage certificates grantedbefore the 1st of June, 1906, to an alien master or mate.&quot; (ii.) For the granting of fresh certificates in cases where an alien master or mate shows, to the satisfaction of theBoard of Trade, that he is a master or mate of a ship whichis of substantially the same class and trading regularlybetween the same ports as a foreign ship which on the 1st ofJune, 1906, was exempt from the obligation of carrying alicensed pilot or had habitually been piloted by a master ormate of a ship who held a pilotage certificate. In such casesthe Board of Trade may authorise a master or mate to applyto a Pilotage Authority for a pilotage certificate.&quot;\   The War Cabinet decided that The clause of the Aliens Restriction Bill referred to above should be modified by making its application subject tothe provisions of Section 24 of the Pilotage Act,and requested The Home Secretary to take the necessary steps to carry thisdecision into effect.Employment of Attention was also drawn to  the fact that the followingAliens on Merchant clause was inserted in the Aliens Restriction Bill in Committee : Ships.&quot; No alien shall act as master, chief officer, or chiefengineer of a British merchant ship registered in the UnitedKingdom, except in the case of a ship employed entirely in trade between parts of the world outside the BritishEmpire,&quot;and that Lieutenant-Commander Kenworthy would move amend-ments thereto which would make the clause read as follows : &quot; No alien shall act as master, officer, or engineer, or as. member of a crew of a British merchant ship registered in theUnited Kingdom, except in the case of a ship employedentirely in trade between parts of the world out of the BritishEmpire, provided that for a period of three years from thedate of the passing of this Act an alien may act as memberof the crew of &apos;a British merchant ship registered in theUnited Kingdom should no British seafarers be available.&quot;The Home Secretary reported that the Admiralty urged thatthe prohibition should apply at any rate to aliens acting as. masters.After some discussion, in the course of which the ShippingController urged that the Government should press for the deletionof the whole clause when the Bill was discussed at the third reading, the War Cabinet decided that The clause be so amended that the restrictions imposedthereby should apply only to aliens acting as masters,and that the provisions *of the clause should not in anycase apply to aliens who are at present acting as mastersin British ships.
