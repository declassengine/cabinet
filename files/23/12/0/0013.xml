The internationalLabour Conferenceat Washington.Composition of delegation.Instructions toDelegates.1. The War Cabinet had before them Memoranda by Mr. Barnes(Papers G.T.-7998 and G.T.-8222) on the subject of the InternationalLabour Conference at Washington.After Mr. Barnes has given his summary of the recent negotiations and proceedings at Paris and Amsterdam in regard tothe proposed Conference, the position of neutrals and Germans and austrians, the War Cabinet agreed That a British Mission should leave for Washington as proposedby Mr. Barnes.2. As regards the composition of the British Delegation, as setforth in Mr. Barnes&apos; Memorandum (Paper G.T.-8222), there was considerable criticism of the employers&apos; selection, and an impression that the matter had not been considered sufficiently seriously. Theopinion was expressed that the persons selected would not adequatelypresent the case of the great British industrial organisations, andthat failure to do this might subsequently lead the employers of thiscountry to refuse to accept the recommendations of the Conference.The weakness of the Employers&apos; Delegation was contrasted with thestrength and representative character of the Labour Delegation.The War Cabinet decided that Mr. Barnes should arrange with the Minister of Labour fora further consideration of the list, with a view to strengthening the representation of employers.3. With reference to the instructions to be given to the officialBritish Delegates on specific questions, like hours, unemployment, &amp;c,the War Cabinet decided : To adjourn the discussion of this matter until the Minister ofLabour could be present.The Secretary was instructed to raise the question on the nextoccasion on which Sir Robert Home was available.Situation and policy 4. With reference to War Cabinet 624, Minute 2, the War Cabinetin Ireland. had before them a Memorandum by Mr. Long (Paper G.T.-8215),a joint Memorandum by Lord French and Mr. Macpherson on thesubject of the situation and policy in Ireland (Paper G.T.-8217),and the following draft Bills that have from time to time been drawn up by the following Cabinet Committees : Lord Curzon&apos;s Committee, May 1917 : Draft of a Bill for theGovernment of Ireland (Paper G.T.-8238).Mr. Longs Committee, June 1918 : Draft of a Bill for a FederalSystem for the United Kingdom (Paper G.T.-8239).Mr. Long&apos;s Committee, August 1918 : Draft of a Bill for theGovernment of Ireland (Paper G.T.-8240).It was realised that, at an early stage in the parliamentary session, some declaration of policy by the Government would beexpected. One view was that the circumstances were whollyunfavourable to any settlement in Ireland at the present time ; thatin existing conditions it would be a mistake to adopt any policy that would be bound to fail merely in response to popular clamour;and that, in consequence, the only feasible plan at the present time was,frankly to announce that the time-was not ripe for a settlement,and to introduce legislation for the postponement of the operation ofthe Home Rule Act, 1914.Against this view it was urged that there would be norecrudescence of steady and sane opinion in Ireland until a home rule Act was passed and put in operation,; and that the best of the
3 WC 628Nationalists in Ireland always urged that a Bill ought to be.forced upon them, and that, if this was done, they would be prepared towork it.The War Cabinet decided that (a.) A Cabinet Committee, composed of Mr. Long (Chairman),Lord French     &quot;1 -tv/t   t\/t    i. rex omeio,Mr. MacphersonJ       mr.. Fisher,Lord Birkenhead,Mr. Shortt,Sir Auckland Geddes,Sir Robert Horne,Mr. Roberts,Sir L. Worthington Evans,Sir Gordon Hewart,Mr. Kellaway,Mr. Philip Kerr       1      JointCaptain L. F. Burgis J Secretaries,should examine and report on the probable effect onIreland, on Great Britain, and on opinion abroad of eachof the possible alternative Irish policies, and should advise the Cabinet as to the policy they recommend for adoption.(b.) The Committee should particularly consider : (1.) What would happen in the event of a Home Rule bill being passed and put into operation (i.) If the Irish people refused to touch it.(ii.) If a sufficient number of moderate Nationalistswere  prepared   to   accept  it  and  form a parliament.(hi.) If the Sinn Fein Party accepted the IrishParliament set up under the proposed Act,and used it in every possible way to thwartthe British Government.(2.) The financial position of Ireland in relation to GreatBritain, particularly in regard to the collection of customs duties, Irish indebtedness on account of theLand Purchase Act, and the Irish contribution tothe cost of the War.  .(3.) The effects of a further postponement of the home rule Act, 1914.  .(4.) Whether, in the event of the Home Rule Scheme beingdecided on, power should be given to His Majesty,by Order in Council, to postpone the operation ofthe new Scheme by a resolution of both Houses ofParliament.(c.) The Committee should be free to consider a general federal scheme for the United Kingdom.(d.) The Committee, having explored the possibilities, should present their recommendations in the form of a DraftBill,(e.) The introduction of the proposed Education Bill for ireland should be postponed pending the decision of the Govern-inentfs policy in regard to a Home Rule Bill.The War Cabinet instructed The Secretary to circulate certain Memoranda by Mr. Long andMr. Chamberlain on the application of a Federal Scheme tothe United Kingdom (Papers G.T.-4486 and G.-212).,
The War Cabinet further decided -To sanction certain measures for which the Viceroy had requestedapproval at the meeting of the War Cabinet held on the25th September (War Cabinet 624, Minute 2), viz. :-(1.) Improvement of the Secret Service.(2.) Provision of prison accommodation in England for irish prisoners.(3.) Encouragement of the Royal Irish Constabulary,particularly by an advance by the Treasury of 101.per man pending a passage of the Bill now beforeParliament.(4.) Increase in numbers of the G Division of the dublin metropolitan Police.(5.) Increase of the establishment of the Royal irish constabulary, particularly in view of the approachingreduction of the military forces in Ireland.(6.) Assistance to discharged soldiers and sailors throughthe medium of the Central Council instituted in dublin for that purpose.(7.) The passing into law without delay of the Land forSoldiers Bill.Eussia: 5. With reference to War Cabinet 622, Minute 4, and WarAssistance to Cabinet 624, Minute 1, the War Cabinet  had  before  them aGeneral Denikin.      Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War making proposals as to the final contribution to General Denikin (Paper G.T.-8224).After hearing a statement on the existing situation in russia by the Secretary of State for War, in the course of which he read a note by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, the War cabinet decided .To approve the proposals of the Secretary of State for War,,involving, apart from surplus non-marketable supplies, a future expenditure for winding up our obligations in Russianot exceeding 3,000,000Z., subject&apos;to the general condition that the War Office should supply General Denikin from existing stocks without replacement, and should confinepurchases within the narrowest possible limits.The War Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State forWar proposed to notify General Denikin that a termwould be fixed to the employment of the officers and other ranks who had volunteered for service with the british mission in South Russia. ,4Military Officers 6. With reference to War Cabinet 627, Minute 2, the Secretaryassisting in the of State for Home Affairs raised the question of the recall of theOrganisation of the military officers who had been sent to assist the local authorities inCitizen Guard. organising a Citizen Guard, and the inadvisability of doing anything which  would  give  the impression  that  the Government wereorganising a Citizen Guard as a military organisation.The War Cabinet decided -/53 &amp; That the Home Office should recall the military officers sentduring the strike to assist the local authorities.The War Cabinet took note that the Secretary of State for home Affairs intended to submit, for their consideration,the instructions which it was proposed to issue to the localauthorities in connection with the registration of menwilling to serve in emergency in a Citizen Guard.2, Whitehall Gardens.
