The OfficialHistory of theWar.Mr. Forteseue&apos;sArticle.1. The attention of the War Cabinet was drawn to an article in &quot; The Quarterly review &quot; of October 1919, by the Hon. J. W.Fortescue, entitled &quot;Lord Frenches 1914.&quot; It was pointed outthat Mr. John Fortescue is the Official Historian for the FirstVolume of the Military History, and is in receipt of a salary fromthe Government for this purpose. The publication of this article,on the very period with which his official book deals, must not onlyimpair the impartiality of the Official History, but is also a seriousbreach of discipline and good faith.In these circumstances the War Cabinet instructed theSecretary  .(a.) To inform Mr. Fortescue that his services would be dispensed with.(&amp;.) To ascertain with whom rests the property in the completed portion of Mr. Fortescue&apos;s work.British Claims for reparation underthe Peace Treaty.2. With reference to War Cabinet Paper F.C.-11, the War.Cabinet decided that The Finance Committee of the Cabinet, together with Mr.Balfour, Lord Curzon, Lord Cunliffe, Lord Sumner, sir john Bradbury, and Sir Warren Fisher, should meet onthe following day to consider the procedure to be followed in regard to the British claims for reparation fromGermany.Military Policy in asia Minor.3. With reference to War Cabinet 630, Minute 10, the WarCabinet had before them two Memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor War (Papers G.T.-8292 and G.T.-8396).After the Secretary of State for War had explained the resultof a discussion which he had had with M. Venizelos in connectionwith the general situation in Asia Minor, a short discussionensued regarding the steps which had been taken to ascertain whether President Wilson would regard it as a matter of offenceif the Turkish situation were to be discussed in London during hisillness.The War Cabinet decided To adjourn the further consideration of the question, pendingthe receipt of a reply from Washington to a telegram onthis subject which had been sent by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs.4. With reference to War Cabinet 628, Minute 5, theChancellor of the Exchequer called the attention of the WarCabinet to the fact that, in the Revised Estimates presented toParliament, he had decided not to take credit for the supplies, given to General Denikin, as he considered it advisable to keepthe liabilities of the old Russian Government separate from anyliabilities undertaken by General Denikin.... After a short discussion, during which the Secretary of StateOA   ^ for War pointed out that the greatest care was being taken on botho sides to keep complete records of General Denikin&apos;s&apos; liabilities The War Cabinet approved the course taken by the Chancellor;of the Exchequer.Russia.Assistance toGeneral Denikin.
3W.C. 635.5. The War Cabinet had before them the Memoranda by theFood Controller (Paper G.T.-8382) and by the Chancellor of theExchequer (Paper G.T.-8391) on the subject of the price and supply of sugar.The War Cabinet took note of the fact that the FoodController had reduced the sugar ration to 8 oz. per head per week,and that he proposed further to reduce the allocation to manufacturers by 25 per cent.In view of the representations made by the Food Controller,that the private importation of sugar side by side with government purchases tends unduly to inflate the price in foreign markets, theWar Cabinet decided- To approve the proposal of the Food Controller to issue anOrder prohibiting dealers from taking delivery of anysugar imported into this country on private account afterthe 1st January, 1920.The proposal, made by the Chairman of the Sugar Commis-sion, to increase the retail price of sugar, was postponed for further consideration until the matter had been examined by the Finance Committee in conjunction withthe prices of other foodstuffs.6. Arising out of the discussion on sugar, the War Cabinetshortly considered the subject of the price of bread. It transpired that not only was imported wheat bought at prices considerablyabove those paid for home-grown produce, but that wheat wasbeing imported at Blue-Book rates, which were so low that theydid not pay the cost of running the wheat ships. Freights were,therefore, subsidised by the Shipping Controller, and this subsidyought to be included in order to obtain the complete total of thewheat subsidy.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To invite the Food Controller to circulate a memorandum giving full particulars as to the financial effect of the transactions of the Ministry of Food in variouscommodities, including a statement of his differenttrading accounts, showing, in particular, where he ispaying his way out of profits and where he is consuminghis capital.(6.) To request the Food Controller to prepare a statement showing (1.) The cost and the proportion of the suppliesobtained from America, Australasia, and theUnited Kingdom, and the proportion of the costrepresenting freight.(2.) The prospects of any reduction next year owing toprobable reduction of freights or.the provisionof improved shipping facilities.7. The War Cabinet also shortly considered the question ofprices paid for home-grown meat in relation to the cost of imported meat.The War Cabinet decided To remit the whole question of food prices and Government,subsidies on foodstuffs to the Finance Committee forconsideration.
Citizen Guards. 8. With reference to War Cabinet 628, Minute 6, the WarCabinet had under consideration a Memorandum by the HomeSecretary (Paper G.T.-8394) on the question of the formationof Citizen Guards, which stated that, with one or two exceptions,it was the unanimous opinion of the authorities concerned that the desired objects could best be obtained by relinquishing the idea\   it^^ of Citizen Guards   and by expanding and strengthening the\v Special Constabulary instead, so as to form an efficient PoliceReserve.The War Cabinet decided To remit the question to the Supply and Transport Committeefor consideration  in the first instance.Control of Official 9. With reference to War Cabinet 615, Minute 2, the WarMotor-cars. Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the Chancellor of the. Exchequer (Paper G.T.-8381) on the use of Government motor-cars, and recommending the establishment of a common pool and acentralised control for the following reasons : (1.) As long as cars are allocated to particular departments the separate reserves of cars must necessarily be larger than the single reserve, which will be all that wasnecessary if all cars were pooled :(2.) As long as each Department retaining cars has separate and independent control of those cars no standardisation-tion of the car in use is possible :(3.) As long as the cars remain under separate Departmentalcontrol no central authority can exercise an adequate control over their use, or compare the expenditure on&apos; cars   by   one   Department   and   that   of   another department similarly constituted.\ The &quot;Secretary of State for War pointed out that, in modern\ I conditions, motor-cars were really just as much a part of &apos; the equipment of the Army as were rifles and bayonets, and heprotested strongly against cars belonging to the Fighting Servicesbeing placed under the control of a Civil Department. he undertook to state a case on paper in the course of the next fewdays.The War Cabinet decided (a.) To approve the proposals of the Chancellor of theExchequer in regard to the establishment of a commonpool and centralised control of Government motor-cars, both in London and in the provinces, in the caseof Departments other than the Fighting Services.(6.) That the Department responsible for the pool and control should be the Ministry of Transport.(c.) To reserve their decision, in the case of the FightingServices, until the Secretary of State for War had* furnished a Memorandum on the subject and the&apos;FirstLord of the Admiralty could be present.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,October 27, 1919.o
