1. With reference to War Cabinet 622, Conclusion 4, the WarCabinet had a full discussion on British policy in the Baltic States,arising out of the following telegrams: No.  9 from the ForeignOffice to Colonel Tallents (Riga), dated the 23rd September, 1919;No. 247 (R) from Mr. Bosancruet (Reval), dated the 22nd September,1919; No. 248 from Mr. Bosanquet (Reval), dated the 23rdSeptember, 1919; No. 372/21, 709/699 W., from M. Ulmanis,Prime Minister, and M. Meierovics, Minister of Foreign Affairs,Latvia, dated the 21st September, 1919 ; No. 131 from ColonelTallents (Riga), dated the 22nd September, 1919 ; No. 56 (R) fromDeputy Commissioner (Reval), dated the 21st September, 1919.These telegrams raise the questiou of recognising the indepen-dence of the Baltic States; of enforcing the evacuation of theGermans from the Baltic Provinces; of the furnishing of supplies,and Of providing a loan ; and generally of Allied policy in these regions.The Acting Secretary for Foreign Affairs explained that theterms in which the Provisional Government of Lithuania had been recognised as a de facto independent body by the Foreign office telegram No. 59 of the 23rd. September, 1919, to Colonel Tallents(Riga) were identical with those which Mr. Balfour gave instructions were to be employed in the case of Esthonia and Latvia, and theWar Cabinet approved this action.After a prolonged discussion the War Cabinet decided: &apos; That the Acting Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should draft, for the consideration of the Cabinet, a reply from thePrime Minister to the Latvian Government, couched infriendly and cordial terms, but based on the following principles : (1.) The question of the independence of Esthonia,Latvia, and Lithuania must be dealt with atthe Peace Conference, or by the League ofNations, and the British Government can give no undertaking apart from their Allies.(2.) The Allies are taking s,steps to enforce theevacuation of the Germans from the baltic provinces.(3.) The   British   Government cannot undertake tofurnish any further military supplies to theBaltic Provinces.(4.) The British Government cannot provide a loan.(5.) Responsibility    for   making   peace    with   theBolsheviks must rest with the Baltic Provincesthemselves.The question of a corresponding despatch to the other de factoStates on the Baltic Sea was left for further consideration.2. The War Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Education on the question of providing anew site for the Headquarters of London University and for King&apos;sCollege (G.T.-8209).The question was referred for decision to a Cabinet Committee,composed as follows : Chancellor of the Exchequer,Secretary of State for the Colonies,President of the Board of Education,President of the Board of Trade.3. The War Cabinet discussed the threatened strike on therailways. .   -
3X ti.fWC 623After the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofTransport had given a full account of the circumstances in whichthis crisis had arisen, and Sir David Shackleton, on behalf of theMinister of Labour, had stated that a strike had practically beendecided on by the railwaymen, the War Cabinet considered the termsof a draft reply to Mr. J. H. Thomas, and decided that: (1.) The reply to be sent by the Minister of Transport to theletter addressed by Mr. J. H. Thomas to the President ofthe Board of Trade should be modified so as to bring outthe point that until the 31st December, 1919, the railwaymen would continue to receive both their presentwage and their war wage, and that consequently theywould be no worse off than at present, and there wasample time for negotiation, which rendered the pre-cipitation of an immediate strike indefensible.(2.) That the Ministry of Transport should give full publicity tothese aspects of the question.(3.) That the re-drafting of the proposed reply be left to theMinister of Transport.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,September 24, 1919.o
