The Strike. 1. The Prime Minister gave the War Cabinet an account of thenegotiations with the National Union of Railwaymen, which had resulted in a breakdown, with the consequence that a railway strike on an unprecedented scale would commence at midnight. The War-Cabinet then proceeded to consider the measures necessary to cope with the situation.General Directionof the government measures.2. The War Cabinet decided : That a special Cabinet Committee, composed as follows: The Minister of Transport (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for Home Affairs,The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Food,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for War (with representativesof the General Staff and Home Forces as required),The Minister of Shipping (cr his representative),The Minister of Labour,Lieutenant-Colonel L. StorrlMr. G. M. Evans jSecretaries,should be set up at once to take charge of the Govern-ment&apos;s arrangements for meeting the strike.Strike Funds. 3. The question of. placing an embargo on the strike funds wasremitted to the Cabinet Committee.Food Stocks andDistribution.4. The Minister of Food stated that the stocks of the principal foods in dealers&apos; hands amounted to from two to four weeks&apos; supply.He gave an outline of the arrangements that had been made for thedistribution of food, more particularly milk, margarine, and yeast.The general question of stocks and distribution of food wasremitted to the Cabinet Committee.UnemploymentPay.bi The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that his department was studying the practicability of using naval craft on the canalsfor purposes of food distribution.6. The War Cabinet briefly considered the question of theissue of unemployment pay during the strike. The Minister ofLabour undertook to go at- once into the question and to make recommendations.Maintenance of order.. 7. The only place where some doubt was expressed as to themaintenance of order was Liverpool, where the police force isbelow strength, and contains many newly enlisted men.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated that, he was informedthat the presence of the destroyer in the Mersey had had aconsiderable moral- effect in Liverpool. He undertook to examinethe feasibility of keeping a larger warship on the river for such time as might be necessary.The Field-Marshal commanding the Home Forces reportedthat he had plenty of troops in this, country, but their mobility hadbeen diminished by, a recent decision of the War Cabinet that military transport should be released for sale in the open market.The Quartermaster-General reported that large numbers of motor lorries were still in France, and that instructions had been
Export of Coal. 8. The President of the Board of Trade reported that he had atonce issued orders to stop all export of coal and to retain all coaPnow at the ports for bunker purposes.9. After the withdrawal of the members of the new CabinetCommittee for the purpose of holding an immediate meeting, theWar Cabinet conferred with the Ministry of Labour as to the termsof an announcement to the press which Sir Robert Home haddrafted for their consideration.There was considerable discussion as to the form which theannouncement should take.Sir Robert Horne&apos;s draft was prepared in the form of a pressinterview with the Minister of Labour, in which the whole of theGovernment case was stated at some length.The suggestion was made that, in addition to the interview, a shorter statement should be published, giving a brief summary ofthe points at issue and drawing attention to the dastardly nature ofthis sudden strike, not against persons who were notoriously makingexcessive profits, but against the Government, which was actuallylosing money on the maintenance of the railways.The War Cabinet decided that (1.) Subject to certain amendments, the statement for thepublic press in the form of an interview with the Ministerof Labour should be published and that Sir RobertBorne should give it the widest possible publicity.(2.) On the following day the Prime Minister should send ashort and crisp telegram, to be read at the publicmeeting in Wales which he had not been able to attend,drawing attention to the character of the present strike and to the fact that the railwaymen had placed thenation in this very serious predicament after the Govern-ment had offered to give consideration to the case of anygrade of railwaymen for which it could be shown thathardships or anomalies of any kind were imposed by thenew standard rates.Statement forthe Press.2, Whitehall Gardens, 8.W. 1,September 25, 1919.3 WC 626 &quot;issued to bring over as many of these as possible by means of the train ferries.The question of maintenance of order was remitted to theCabinet Committee for consideration.
