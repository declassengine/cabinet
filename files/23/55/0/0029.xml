41 iPORBIGN AFP AIRSYUGd-S LA VTA .ALBANIA.Treaty with italy.f previous reference:Cabinet 58(27), Con-elusion 2.)POLAND and lithuania,..(PrevlousReference:Cabinet 54(27), Con-elusion 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign At fairsinformed his colleagues that he would be leaving for a meeting of the Council of the League ofNations on Saturday next and consequently wouldnot be able to be present at the next meeting ofthe Cabinet..   There were two disquieting featuresin the foreign situation.First there was the signature of a Treatyof Alliance between Italy and Albania.    Sir austen chamberlain said he was about to circulate a full account of a conversation with the italian ambassador on this subject, a summary of which was contained in a telegram already circulated to theCabinet, the gist of which was that he had asked the Ambassador to notify Slgnor Mussolini thathe was disappointed at his refusal to convert theTreaty of Alliance with Albania into a tripartiteguarantee to which the Serb-Croat-Slovene state would be a party, and that Italy could not expect the continuous assistance of Great Britain if no attention was paid to British advice.The second disquieting question, one whichwould come before the Council of the League, wasthe serious dispute between Lithuania and Poland.The principal element of risk In the situation wasthatv if Lithuania insisted on continuing a technical state of war with Poland and on themaintenance of the fiction that Vilna was consti-tutionally and by law the Capital of Lithuania,and the League was unable to alter this situation,no-one could foretell what action Marshal Pilsudskimight take.-
RUSSIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(27), Con-conclusion 1.)2. Sir Austen Chamberlain informed the Cabinetthat there were many rumQars  to the effect thatM, Litvinoff, th : Read of the Russian delegation which was now present at Geneva in connectionwith the Conference on Reduction and Limitationof Ana-rents, was likely to seek for an interview with him during the forthcoming meeting of theCouncil.    We himself would not seek or desirean interview of the kind, but if M.. Litvinoffasked for it he felt he ought not to refuse.He would keep a full record, and would be most careful not to commit His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto any change of policy.In a short discussion on the subject the Cabinet were reminded of a statement madepublicly by the Secretary of State for Indiato the effect that, when Soviet Russia had givenevidence, by deeds and not merely by words, overan extended period of time, of a change in itsconception of international relations, It might-be possible to consider the re-establishment of relations.   This statement had afterwards been confirmed by a Foreign Office representative inthe House of Commons.The Cabinet were also informed&apos; that, inconnection with a case of espionage which would shortly be tried in camera,  it had transpired that the Russian Soviet was concerned.    Althoughit had not teen founc possible to connect thecase directly with the late Russian Charge&quot;dT Affaires, there was little doubt that GheshamHouse was concerned.
IRAQ. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Previous informed the Cabinet that, at the request ofReference:Cabinet 57 Mr Ormsby-Gore, he had presided at a Government(27),  Con-elusion 10.)       Luncheon to King Faisal, at which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had also been present.   Theresults of his conversation ware recorded in aNote which was circulated immediately after theCabinet Meeting (Paper CP.-300 (27)).Ths Chancellor of the Exchequer gave ashort account of a subsequent interview he had had at the Treasury with King Feisal, which is described in a Note circulated after the Meeting(Paper CP.-299 (27)).The Cabinet took note with satisfaction that King Feisalhad postponed his departureand that negotiations were tobe resumed.3 it    4 -
4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Labour (Paper C.P.-295 (27))setting out the facts in regard to the existingunemployment in the ooal-mining industry and explaining the lines on which he was attacking the problem, namely, by preserving collieryvacancies for workpeople over 18 years of age for persons already in the industry;   by the useof the Employment Exchange machinery to facili-tate transfers from one coalfield to another;by utilising the absorptive capacity of otherindustries;    by overseas migration;    by the utilisation of training centres both with aview to migration and absorption in other trades;by the establishment in some areas of juvenile unemployment Centres;    by affording relief both to Guardians and to the administration of theUnemployment Scheme, by the new Old Age Pensionarrangement, under which, from the 2nd Januarynext, the qualification age for the Pension islowered to 65;    by co-operation between the ministries of Health and Labour for keeping a close watch upon the power of Local Authoritieswhose finances are strained to provide relief.The Minister of Labour concluded his Memorandumby pointing out that he could not extend hisarrangements for giving some form of training tothe unemployed miners unless he was provided with some further funds, - a provision, however,which would not involve a large Increase and would,in its nature, be of a purely temporary character.
Consideration of the above Memorandum gave rise to a full discussion on the question ofunemployment in the mining industry.   Considerableemphasis was laid on the desirability of a further exploration of the possibiliti s of migrationwithin the Empire for miners,,    It was pointed outthat several of the Dominions, particularly canada and Western Australia, required additional popula-tion, and in the miners there was ready to hand asplendid type of emigrant.    Insomuch as money would certainly have to be spent on maintaining the miners before other employment could be found for them, the Cabinet were urged to considerwhether it would not be worth while to spend alittle more money with a view to migration.In this connection the Cabinet were informed thata number of the miners were ready to migrate,A suggestion was made that it might even bepossible to provide for their emigration as aepecial case outside of the emigration schemes the cost of which was shared between Great Britainand the Domdnions.    It was sviggested that the agent-General for Western Australia and the HighCommissioner for Canada should be consulted onthe subject.The question was raised as to what attitudethe Government were to take in the forthcoming debate on the subject, and it was suggested that from this point of view, no less than from that of migration, it would be desirable to have thequestion studied at once by a special Committeeof the Cabinet.The Minister of Health said that if aCommittee were appointed he wotild be prepared -to
offer some suggestions.Reference waa made to the Inquiries whichhad been conducted by the Committe- of civil research during the summer,, which had bean temper-arily suspended, but which should provide acertain amount of material.The Cabinet agreed -That a Committee, composed as follows the Lord Privy Seal (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer(or the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury),The President of the Board of Trade,The Minister of Health,The President of the Board of Education,The Minister of Labour,Colonel Lane-Fox,Mr T, Jones ( Secretary) ,-should meet to consider the general question of unemployment in the coal trade, including the special problemof migrating miners.    For the purposesof the latter part of the InquiryLord Lovat should&quot;. be added to theCommittee.
the localauthorities(emergency provisions)ACT, 1926.Question ofE-xtension.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(26), Con-conclusion 14.)5^ The Cabinst had before there a Memo ran dum bthe Minister of Health (Paper C.F.-297 (27))proposing the introduction of&quot; a Bill in thecoming Session of Parliament to extend theoperation of the Local Authorities  (emergency provisions) Act, 1926, for a further period oftwo years.The Cabinet approved the Ministerof Health&apos;s proposal.
IRISH 6.    Arising out of a Question to be put to the.LOYALISTS.Prime Minister in the House of Commons on the(Previous following day in regard to a particularly hardReference:Cabinet 48       case which had arisen out of the awards of the(25),  Con-clusion 8.)      Wood-Renton Committee to Irish loyalists, theCabinet discussed the question at some length0It transpired that a difficult situation had arisen owing to the fact that the awards given bythe Committee amounted to  1,200,000 as comparedwith the  400,000 which the Cabinet had agreed toallot to this purpose.    It was felt that thewhole question, which was found to be very complicated in its details, required immediateexplorati on.The Chancellor of the Exchequer particularly asked that the final decision should be reservedfor the Cabinet itself,\ The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Lord Privy Seal,The President o-&quot; the Board of Education,The Attorney-General,Mr R,B.Howorth, C.E.(Secretary)-should meet to consider and reportto the Cabinet on the subject ofthe awards of compensation for theclaims of Irish loyalists.
7. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat, as India was found, to be concerned in thequestion of Beam Wireless and Cable Services, hehad added Lord 7&apos;interton to the Cabinet Committee.
JUDICIALVACANCIES.(previous reference reference s:Cabinet 56(2V)? Con-clusion 1.)8, The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinetthat he was about to move a Resolution the same afternoon in the House of Lords in regard to theappointment of two additional Judges.   The Reso-lution in the ^ouse of Lords, however, would beof no value without a corresponding resolution in the House of Commons, and he appealed to thePrime Minister to enable him to obtain thisbefore Christmas.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat there were certain political complicationsin connection with this matter, and he invitedtha Lord Chancellor to discuss the matter withhim on an appropriate occasion, when he would arrange for the presence of the Chief Whip andanyone else who might be concerned.2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.&apos;v*l%.November 30,  1927.
