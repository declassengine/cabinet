TO TI ON ANDJTATI ON OP(AL ARMAMENTS.urgency to consider the following telegrams from1.The Cabinet were summoned as a m tter ofthe British Delegation at the Conference onGenevaif ere nee.the Reduction and Limitation of Naval Armaments.(Geneva 213,214, 215, 216 L.N.) (Appendix).fviousfere nee:As apprehended by some Members of thebinet 44(27)nolusion l).Cabinet at the previous meeting, the UnitedStates Delegation had made it clear that theyhad no authority to sign any treaty restrictingarmaments of new construction cruisers to gvinsWashington for instructions.The-Chief of the Naval Stara (lord beatty), read a private telegram he had receivedfrom Admiral Pound (sent with the authority ofthe First Lord) intimating that nothing couldbe done until a reply was received from washington and it was known whether the United StatesGovernment persisted in the attitude announced bytheir Delegates, but asking whether in the last resort it would be possible to agree to somegun intermediate between 6-inch and 8-inch,such as 7- inch      Lord Beatty also read his reply in a private telegram stating that hewas personally opposed to any departure fromthe Delegates&apos; instructions and that theintroduction of a new type of gun would be highlyinconvenient and involve Increased tonnage and expense.Questioned as to what would be theeffect on. our building programme of a breakdownThey had telegraphed to1.
of the Conference., Lord Beatty said that thesituation would be precisely the same as it had been before the Conference:    that is to say we shouldcontinue to build in accordance with our existing programme.      We had so long a lead in cruiserscompared with United States of America that wecould allow them to build two or three programmes of six cruisers apiece without departing in theleast from our own programme, or giving any impression of an armament race.In the course of the discussion, it became clear that whether we made an agreementVftil 1931 or not, it would not make much difference in our cruiser programme, except that in the eventof our being forced to adopt the 8-inch gun the cost would be increased.     Asa- ftaditl-orial disadvantagewould be that we should recognise the 8-inch gun asthe proper armament of small cruisers,  and shouldpractically be committed to this armament for alltime.      It was recalled that in regard to thenumber of small cruisers, we had admitted that united States of America might build to parity, eventhough this was not justified by their needs,but we had refused to concede the principle of equality of..need by a formal treaty.      In thesame way In regard to armament   .of cruisers it was true that the Americans might in fact compel us by their example to adopt the 8-inch gun for Our smaller, cruisers, but we ought not to accept by treaty the principle that thisarmament, which was characteristic of the greatcruisers required for fleet action and involvedadditional expenditure, was the necessary orproper armament for the smaller cruisers neededonly for commercial protection.. &apos;     .     j2. r     .   r .  &apos;      .\   J&quot; i i , - f
The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send atelegram to the British delegation at Geneva, in reply to theirtelegrams Nos. Geneva 213 - 216 L.N.,to the following effect:-&quot;Cabinet feel that nothing hasoccurred to cause them to altertheir previous decision about and 8-inch guns.      We cannot therefore authorise you to offerany compromise,. &apos;    If the Americansrefuse your latest proposal andif this is their last word you must make a declaration in accord-ance with Cabinet 44 (27)  conclusion  (g),  (i.e.,  our full   proposalsfor disarmament ana economy including those relating to capital ships).If, however,  the United Statessubmit on their own initative a counter proposal of any kind, youwill of course report it to us for consideration with your comments.(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should telegraph the text of Cabinet 44 (27) Conclusion 1 (g)to  the British Delegation, in case theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster-had not yet received copies of theCabinet minutes.(c) That those members of the cabinet who are within reach of London should hold themselves in readiness for ameeting of the Cabinet, if necessary,on Wednesday next, August 3rd,  at noon (unless an emergency meeting had to be summoned on Tuesday).2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1.- .29th July,  1927.
APPEND IX.From   SWITZERLAND.Deoypher   H.M.&apos;s Consul.  (Geneva),July 28th,  1927.D. 8.50 a.m.    July  9th, 1927.R.11.20 a.m.    July 29th,  1927.Ko. 213.    L.N.----oOo----IMMEDIATE.Following from Mr. Bridgeman for Cabinet andthe &quot;Admiralty.At a meeting of delegates this afternoon,  Icommunicated British proposals in form set out in my telegram No. 212 and gave oral explanation of newfeatures.     Mr. Gibson at once stated that he had no authority to sign any treaty restricting armament, ofnew construction cruisers to a gun less than 8&quot;calibre.   He would telegraph at once to Washington but before doing so would like to know precisely how far,if at all, we could go to meet them.     We replied thatour instructions did not permit us to do more thanagree under proposal 4 to United States of Americaconstructing one or two ships carrying 8&quot; guns inorder to equalize relative strength in this inter-mediate class between British Empire and United Statesof America.   Mr. Gibson then asked for a precise statement of British attitude on question of 8&quot; gun towhich we&quot; replied as follows:-&quot;British government feel that unless treatyprovided for limitation of 8&quot; gun it would be atreaty...
treaty not for a limitation but for an Increase ofarmaments.&quot;He undertook to telegraph fully to his governmentembodying above statement but said categorically thathe could hold out no hope that they would give wayon question of gun.     He promised for his part tosupply a written statement giving American attitude in precise terms.     Text since received follows in my immediately following telegram.      Asked whether he sawother difficulties he replied &quot;No insuperable difficulties.We then asked Japanese delegates whether they wished toexpress any views on this question.     All they would saywas that though they did not intend before 1936 tobuild any cruiser carrying 8&quot; guns other then those inmaximum class they did not want to be definitely bound by any treaty provision in this respect.      We  finallygained the impression however that they would subscribe to any arrangement on this point on which we and  &apos;Americans might agree.As regards submarines there is still some dis-agreement between ourselves and Japanese.Viscount Ishii stated that his government had agreed somewhat reluRCtantly to ratio of 65$ for japan in surface auxiliary craft in hope that submarinetonnage would be settled on basis of 60,000 for all.Their original demand had been for 70,000 but they had agreed to transfer 10,000 to surface tonnage.      if however we and Americans claimed 90,000 they would desireto return to 70,000.In view of fact that it was impossible to conduct negotiations.,.
negotiations any longer in secret we urged, and othersagreed, that British proposals should be publishedunder cover of a short communique.      It was arrangedhowever that a note should be incorporated showingconcession which we are prepared to make under proposalText of note follows in telegram No.  215.From today&apos;s conversations it looks as ifAmericans would hold out against the 6-inch gun limitwhile not regarding any of our other proposals asinsuperably objectionable.      We must wait to see what isthe result of their reference of our proposals to washington.      If their objection to the 6-inch gun ismaintained, Conference must break.     Only alternative Ican see is an attempt at compromise on gun of between -inch and 7-5 which would eliminate arugment with whichAmericans are obsessed about armed merchantmen.      Poundhad telegraphed to Admiralty as to possibility?/ of this.Please see Admiralty on subject.It was agreed provisionally to hold plenary meetingon Monday by which time Gibson hopes to have receivedhis answer from Washington.Even if it was unfavourable we should endeavour tokeep discussion alive until we had obtained finalinstructions from you.r   c
Decode.   Mr. London.   (Geneva).July 28th,  1927.D.      9.25.a.m. July  9th,  1927.   -S.    11.20.a.m.  July 29th,  1927.2Jc.  214.  L.1I.     (3) .-----oOo-----IMMEDIATE.Following is text referred to in my immediately preceding telegram.&quot;It will be remembered that in its original pro-posals American delegation indicated its belief that within a total tonnage limitation for cruisers eachPower should be free to dispose of its tonnage as best suited its special needs.      In view, however, of im-portance attached by British delegation to restrictionsof types American delegation agreed as will be rememberedto discuss number of maximum size cruisers sub jectto agreement on a tonnage level which would constitute a genuine limitation and with further condition thatsecondary types of cruiser within such tonnage limita-tions should be of a maximum individual displacementwhich would not preclude mounting 8&quot; guns (a calibrewhich was agreed upon by signatories of washington treaty)&quot;.
Following is text of note referred to inparagraph 4 of my telegram No. 213.General intention on this proposal is to providefor retention of existing ships which though still infull efficiency fall neither within 10,000 ton 8 inchclass or contemplated class with a maximum displace-ment of 6,000 tons and maximum armament of 6 inch guns.British delegation recognising that thisproposal would leave United States with no 8 inch guncruisers in this class are prepared to agree toconstruction by United States of vessels which in opinionof naval advisers of the 3 delegations would equalisestrength of British Empire and United States in this class.Decode.   Mr. London,   (Geneva).28th July 1927.D.    9.25 a.m.  29th July 1927.H.  11.20 a.m. 29th July 1927.No.  215.L.N.     (2).
Immediate.Following from Lord Cecil.Situation here has deteriorated owing to our absencein London.     Meeting this afternoon made it clear that without some compromise on 8 inch gun cruisers thereIs in the opinion of American dolegation   no hope c an agreement.     They seized on that point first ofall and stated that unless it were settled it was use-less to discuss other terms though if it was settledthere was a reasonable   chance of success on other questions.     So the issue is raised in a definite form.In view of decision of Cabinet we did not feel at liberty to suggest even in private limitation of treaty to 1931 with permission for all parties to build 8 inchgun cruisers.     But my impression is that there is some prospect that such a solution would be even now accepted.     In view of serious consequences of a failureof conference to Anglo-American duel and, still more,prospects of achieving any general measure of reduction and limitation of armament, I have thought it right togive Cabinet this personal impression of the situation.Lecypher.       Mr. London (Geneva).28th July, 1927,D.       10.00 a.D. 29th July, 1927.H.       11.55 a.m. 29th July, 1927.So. 216.  L.N.
