1 01-L iJ jl.THE reduction and LIMITATIONOF naval armaments.The geneva conference.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(27)/ Con-elusion 1,)1. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum(Paper CP.-212 (27))prepared by the Secretary/giving the Conclusionsof the Cabinet Committee on the subject of theReduction and Limitation of Naval Armaments, therecommendations of which are summarised in theMemorandum as follows(l) The comprehensive statement of british policy in regard to reduction and limit-ation of naval armaments (attached as appendix l)M should be announced in both Houses-of Parliament.(2) The British Delegates should return to geneva and endeavour to seoure anagreement on the basis of the so-called&quot;Japanese Scheme0, modified as recommended-mended by the Admiralty, who willlay before the Cabinet a revised version of these proposals incorporate-ating the changes they desire.(3) The decision as to whether the agreement should terminate in 1931 or in 1936 isreserved for the Cabinet.    If 1931 is adopted, the Admiralty propose to droptheir insistence  on 6-inch gun cruisers and to have the right to arm even thesmaller types of Cruiser with 8-inch guns, in order to avoid the risk thatthe British 6-Inch gun Cruisers builtbefore 1931 may be outclassed andrendered obsolete after that year bya refusal on the part of the UnitedStates of America and Japan to limit their future small Cruisers to guns of 6-inch calibre.(4).The programmes of naval constructionagreed to at the Geneva conference should be regarded as a maximum, andthe Government of the day should notbe held to be bound to build up tothem.    They must remain free todecide the programme of naval con-struction in each year according tothe needs of the situation and theavailable financial resouroes.Appendix I to the Memorandum is notreproduced herewith, but the form ofthe statement as finally approved bythe Cabinet will be found in Appendix Ito these Conclusions.
The Cabinet examined the Draft Statementof Policy attached as an Appendix to Paper C.P.-212 (27)9 which was acoepted for announcement in both Houses of Parliament on the next day,subject to the following amendmentsThe Statement to be preceded bysome introductory observationsto be drawn up by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.Page ii, line 9:   Instead of thewords &quot;and for&apos; protecting linesof communication&quot;, put &quot;and neces-sary for the protection of the linesof communication.Line 15: Omit the word &quot;more&quot;before the words &quot;vital necessity&quot;.Line 15: Omit the words&quot;than to one which is essentiallycontinental;   to an Empire&quot;.Lines 17 and 18: Omit thewords &quot;than to one which is self-supporting and self-contained;   toan Empire&quot;&apos;.Line 19: Insert a full stopafter the word &quot;trade&quot; and omit therest of the paragraph.(NOTE: The above correctionswere made in order to avoid a comparison between the positionof the British Empire and theUnited States of America, whichit was thought might be provo-cative to the latter.)Line 25: Before the word&quot;America&quot; put &quot;the United States of&quot;.Page iv? line 10: Omit the words &quot;forthis is liable to be interpreted inthe future as a formal surrender ofthe doctrine of maritime equality.Such temporary agreement must not&quot; ,and substitute the words &quot;which might&quot;.Lines 15 and 14: Omit thewords &quot;or deemed to embody a settledprinciple&quot;.(Attached, Appendix I. )
mThe Chancellor of&quot;-the D-oichy of Lancaster -a tat eel&quot; that,although at the Cabinet Committee he had acquiesced inthe Statement and did not wish to dissent from it, inhis view the effect of the announcement would be to add to the difficulties of the Delegates at Geneva.On the other hand, the First Lord thought it essentialthat the substance of the Statement should in any oasebe comnunioated by him to the other Delegations immedi-ately on his return, and felt that the hands of the delegates would be strengthened if this Statement weremade as a Cabinet declaration in London and not nsrelyby them in Geneva.The First Lord Ooum^communicated to the Cabinet the amend-ments proposed by the Admiralty to the so-called- &quot;JapaneseSoheme&quot;, which were aooepted (Appendix Ii).At the request of the First Lord of the Admiralty,Admiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty, the First Sea Lord and chief of the Naval Staff, was introduced and made thefollowing statement to the Cabinet on behalf of all theNaval Members of the Board of Admiralty now in London:-&quot; In attempting&apos; to modify the Anglo-Japanesescheme In such a way as to make the best of it from the point of view of the British Empire,it is necessary to point out that in so doingwe are departing from the Admiralty proposalsfor the reduction and limitation of armamentswhich were accepted and approved as the basisof the negotiations to be carried on by theBritish Delegation at Geneva.In the modified Anglo-Japanese scheme weare definitely creating a precedent and accept-ing a principle of inferiority on the sea withthe United States.Furthermore, we are accepting a ratio of combined Cruiser and Destroyer tonnage with; Japan which is below the safety ratio, andwould provide insufficient surface vessels to maintain security of the sea communications;the British Empire will, moreover, be left with an insufficient margin to safeguard our interests In the Mediterranean and Home Waters,in view of the building programmes of such vessels by France and Italy.As a result, the Sea Lords feel it incumbent upon them to. point out
that if the Unite6V-State-s -of Amerixfa-and Japan exercise their fall rights under the Agreement j they will not beable- with the means left at their disposal, to fulfil the responsi-bilities hitherto resting upon them&quot;.After making the above statement Lord Beattyanswered a number of questions of detail.   he stated that If the Agreement was extended to 1936and if in that interval the United States ofAmerica were to build nine annual programues of6 or 7 Cruisers, which they were capable of doing,they would (having regard to the relative geograph-ical positions of the two Powers) attain a positionof decisive superiority over the British Empire.Their Cruisers oould be concentrated and ourswould have to be dissipated.   They would alsoacquire a very important advantage by 1936 owing tothe fact that, ship for ship, a proportion of theirCruisers would be of more modern type than ours.He emphasized the importance of the French Cruiser-^ Cruisersprogramme which includes j- built, four 10,000-tonCruisers under construction, and two projected.He admitted that the United States of Amerioa,possessing the longer purse, could outbuild us, ifthey had the will, but he pointed out that theyhad not the same motive for sacrifice as a power which has already depended and still depends forits existence on adequate naval protection.    Helaid great emphasis, from the point of view of economy, on the adoption of the 6-inch gun as themacimum.size for the armament of small Cruisers.On the question of whether the Agreement shouldterminate in 1931 or 1936, Lord Beatty, on behalfof the Naval Members of the Board of Admiralty,expressed a strong preference for 1936.    If theyear 1931 were adopted he pointed out that, onthe expiration,, of the Agreement, the United States
and Japan might-refuse to accept for the future--the-&apos;limitation of 6-inoh guns for small Cruisers.    Theyoould then huild Cruisers -with 8-inch guns, whichwould outolass the Cruisers with 6-inch which wehad built, in accordance with our programme, between1927 and 1931 , rendering them obsolete.    The onlysafe course, if 1931 was adopted, was to drop theidea of 6-inoh gun armament and to provide in theAgreement for an 8-inch gun armament for Cruisers.This would involve a heavy sacrifice of economy, asan 8-inch gun Oruiser cost  250,000 more than a6-Inch gun Cruiser.    To adopt the 8-inch guns forall Cruisers in a programme extending to 1936 wouldbe a very uneconomical policy.After Lord Beatty&apos;s withdrawal the whole subject was discussed at great length.    Between 1931and 1936 the issue was gradually fined down to two alternatives, namely - a modus Vivendi terminatingin 1931 under which we should have to insist on theright to arm our smaller Cruisers with 8-inch guns;or an Agreement extending to 1936 under which weshould decline to enter into an arrangement which did. not Include the adoption of the 6-inch gun as themaximum armament for the smaller Cruisers.    TheCabinet were informed that the former proposal wouldinvolve an inorease of expense over our present programme, and would not provide an effeotivelimitation of armaments;   and that the latterproposal, which was in accordance with the decision taken-at the previous meeting of the Cabinet, was unlikely to prove acceptable to the United States o!Amerioa, who might even break up the Conferencerather than adopt this far more economical scheme.
While some members of the Cabinet (includingthe Delegates themselves) were in favour ofgiving to the Delegates some latitude (if theycould not by any means achieve agreement on thebasis of a maximum armament of 6-inoh guns) tonegotiate in the last resort a modus vivendiuntil 1931 on the basis of the right to arm thesmaller Cruisers with 8-inch guns, the majorityfelt that they should adhere to the decisionreaohed at the last meeting of the Cabinet, not without difficulty, before the Prime Minister1sanddeparture for Canada,/that, in face of the strongview of the Naval Members of the Board of Admiralty,it was essential, in the interests of economy and national security, for the Delegates to stand firm on the basis of an Agreement not terminable before1936, and not to enter into an Agreement whichpermits the armament of the smaller Cruisers withguns exceeding 6-inch calibre.    This was     subject,however, to an acoonmodation enabling the UnitedStates of America to build an appropriate numberof Cruisers armed with 8-inch guns to set offagainst the British &quot;HAWKINS&quot; Class and &quot;YORK&quot;and the Japanese &quot;FURUTAKA&quot; Class, which areintermediate between the 10,000-ton and 6,000-tonolasses of Cruiser.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lanoasterasked that it might be placed on record that , ifthe Conference (to the success of which he attached the greatest importance) should breakdown on the question of 6-inch guns, he must&quot;be free to consider his position.
The decisions of the Cabinet were as follows:-(a) To approve the Statement attached-*-n Appendix I for announcement onthe&quot; following day in both houses of Parliament, preceded by someobservations on the lines indicatedin the Note at the head of the State-ment:(b) Thats in the course of the forthcoming debate on Reduction and Limitationof Armaments, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs or the Chancellorof the Exchequer should take theopportunity to read an appropriateextract from Lord Balfour&apos;s speech at the Washington Conference, inwhich he emphasized the strikingdifference in the respective needsof the British Empire and the UnitedStates of America in the matter of cruisers for the protection of trade routes:(c) That the Delegates should returnforthwith to Geneva with a view to continuing negotiations on the basisof the so-called &quot;Japanese Scheme&quot;,modified as indicated in Appendix II:(d) That the Cabinet must take full responsibility for the possible oonse-quences resulting from the above decision,of an insufficiency of cruisers and Destroyers to safeguard our communioations in the event ofsimultaneous difficulties in europe and in the Far East, as apprehendedby the Naval Members of the Board ofAdmiralty.    Any programme for naval construction must be based on somehypothesis, and the Government couldnot provide against every conceivablecontingency:(e) That the Delegates should be empoweredto   accept an Agreement not terminatingbefore the year &quot;1936, but subject toa provision that the armament of thesmaller type of Cruiser must notexceed 6-inch calibre.        , Theyshould have authority to agree tothe construction by the United Statesof America of ah appropriate numberof Cruisers armed with 8-inch guns to compensate them for the British&quot;HAWKINS&quot; Class and &quot;YORK&quot;, and the vNJapanese &quot;FURUTAKA&apos;1 Class, which areVintermediate between the 6,000-tonV&quot;and 10,000-ton classes of Cruiser: &apos;(f) That any programme of naval construo-tion agreed to at the Geneva Con-ference should be regarded as maxima,and the Government of the day shouldnot be held to be bound to build up
to them.    They must remain free todecide the programme of naval con-struction in each year acoordingto the needs of the situation and the available financial resources:(g) That, in the event of a breakdown of the Conference, the british delegates should insist on an oppor-tunity to make a public statement,preferably at a Plenary Meeting, ofthe British proposals as a whole,including Capital Ships, in orderto make widely known the large measure of limitation and economyat which they had aimed:(h) That the Naval Officer selected bythe Admiralty to replace Viee-admiral sir F. Field, who has had to leavethe Conference owing to indisposition,should be appointed&quot;a full delegate to the Conference, and that the&quot;Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should arrange for the despatch to geneva of the necessary full powers.
THE coal situation.The Miners1Welfare Fund.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(27), Con-elusion 11.)2.    The President of the Board of Tradementioned that Lord Chemlsford, the Chairman ofthe Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, had stated that?if theGovernment raised the question of the applicationof the Miners&apos; Welfare Fund, he would resign fromthe Chairmanship of the Committee.The Cabinet authorised the President ofthe Board of Trade to take no action until theCommittee of Civil Research could consider thematter again after the Prime Minister1 s return.
llEXT MEETING 3.    The Cabinet .agreed  CABINET.That their next Meeting should beheld on THURSDAY, JULY&apos; .8th, at11-30 a.m.    to consider the questionof the proposed heads of a Treatyof Alliance with Egypt and any other business that it is&quot; necessary to. clear up before the summer adjonrn-ment of Parliament.2, Whitehall Gardens., S.W. 1,&apos; July 26, 1927.10-
APPENDIX I.THIRD REVISE OF DKaFT STaTL;.,ENT .(As approved &quot;by the Cabinet on 26th July, 1927).(NOTE;-     The following statement, when made inParliament, will be preceded by some introductoryobservations to be drawn up by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs).The Conference on Naval Disarmament now sittingat Geneva have discussed many important points in technical Coiamittees and Plenary Conferences, but,in spite of the efforts of our Delegates at Geneva,serious misapprehension of the aims of His kajestyfsGovernment still prevails in some quarters.      HisiAajesty&apos;s Government has even been charged with thedesire to destroy that equality of sea-power asbetween the United States of America and the BritishEmpire vrtiich the Washington Conference contemplated -a suspicion for which there is no foundation.The invitation of the President of the UnitedStates of America to take part in a DisarmamentConference was understood by His r/lajestyrs Govern-ment to be based on his desire to develop the policyof the Washington Conference by diminishing yetfurther naval expenditure while maintaining national security.      iilth this two-fold end His M&apos;ajestyrsGovernment are in complete agreement, and they desire to measure the merits of every proposal by
C\ a ftthe degree to which it furthers this two-fold end.It is on this principle that they have proposed to diminish the size and armament of battle ships, while leaving unaltered the numbers fixed at Washington.It is for this reason also that they suggest limita-tion in the number and armament of large fightingCruisers on principles similar to those adopted atWashington for battle ships.     This proposal, like thefirst, would greatly diminish national expenditurewithout endangering national safety.The questions connected with small Cruisers areof a more complicated character.     The strength offleets can be stated in figures and compared withprecision.     Their primary function is to fight otherfleets, and, speaking broadly, they can easily be compared with each other.     No such simple way oflooking at the subject is possible in the case ofsmall Cruisers employed for police purposes in times of peace, and necessary for the protection of the  .lines of cotrauunication in time of war.     Geographicalconsiderations cannot be rationally ignored.      Itcan hardly be denied, as was clearly stated .)sy us when accepting the President^ invitation, thatsuch vessels are of vital necessity to an empire, whose widely scattered parts are divided from each other by seas and oceans;   whose most&quot;populous parts acre dependent for their dailybread on seaborne trade;    and whlph would perishif it failed to protect its external trade.
It has to he noted further that the sea routes onwhich Britain depends for hex1 existence lie largely innarrow waters bordered by other States.     This is notthe case with the United States of America, whose mostimportant   lines of communication lie either on land withinher own frontiers, by sea along her own coasts, or in thegreat oceans.     These circumstances received di30consideration at Washington in 1922 and have not lostany of their importance.     But it is hardly necessaryto say that His Majesty&apos;fs Government, while urging the special difficulties due to Brltain&apos;s geographical position, are  ar from claiming the least right to dictate any small Cruiser policy to other Powers.They accept the general principles which, as theyunderstand them, underlie the President^ policy that no maritime Power should maintain a larger navythan is required for its own security.     To translatethis into figures is, for the reasons already given,far more difficult in the case of small Cruisers thanin the case of the larger types of surface vessels.Anything resembling the quasj.-permanent formula adopted at Washington for battle ships is quite inapplicableto vessels designed for purposes which not only may,but must, vary with the geographical and economic position of the several Powers concerned.     It becomeseven more inapplicable when strength is estimated interms of gross tonnage, without reference to numbersor armament.     Two nations each possessing a hundred thousand tons of battle ships may be regarded without serious error as being (so far) equal in fighting power.Ho such statement can reasonably be made about twonations one of which has IP Cruisers of 10,000 tons,while the other has 20 Cruisers of 5,000 tons.      It all-ill-
depends upon zircuifists-.noeo j     though naval expertswould, probably agree that,  If it  same to fighting, theemore numerous but smallor vessels would stand but apoor chance against their more powerful but lessnumerous opponents.      If so, the country which for any reason was obliged to distribute its available tonnageamong smaller units would be at a permanent disadvantagecompared with one which was able to adopt a differentscheme.     There would be nominal parity but real inequality.This is,  of course, merely an illustration.      But itsuffices to explain why, in the opinion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, no provisions open to this kind of criticismshould bo given the international authority already possessed by those parts of the Treaty of Washington which deal withstrength and numbers.      In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment there need be no difficulty in arriving at atemporary arrangement about the immediate future of Cruiserbuilding. .. But the British Empire cannot be asked togive to any such temporary arrangement the appearance of an immutable principle, which might be treated as a precedent.     Any other course would inevitably be interpreted in the future as involving the formal surrender by the BritishEmpire of maritime equality,  a consummation which HisMajesty !s Government are v/ell assured is no part of thePresident *s policy.4. o a c c o c c o a2-p Whitehall Gardens, Sj J.,July 26,  1927,
