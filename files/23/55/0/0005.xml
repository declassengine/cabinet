1. The Cabinet had before there a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for War in regard to the employmentof Communists in War Department establishments (paper cp.- 120 (27)), proposing that such persons as ean be shown by reasonable evidence to be actively engaged inthe dissemination of anti-constitutional and revolutionarypropaganda,. either oral or written, should be dischargedforthwith and without pension or other superannuationbenefit;    and that as regards persons who merely labelthemselves as Communists or profess an academic allegiance to the doctrines of Communism without taking any active part in the furtherance thereof, no immediate action should be taken, but they should be eliminated as andwhen opportunity offered, i.e., by discharge on reduction.It was understood that Bolshevist Communism included abelief in the employment of revolutionary means to enforceits doctrines upon the nation.There was general agreement in regard to the Secre-tary of State&apos;s proposals so far as regards persons falling within the first category mentioned above were concerned,but the description of those falling within the secondcategory was felt to require some amendment.   This latter point was left to the Secretary of State for War and the attorney-General to settle on behalf of the Cabinet.    they agreed on the wording during the Meeting, and the acceptedlanguage is accordingly reproduced in the Conclusions setforth below.During the discussion it was alleged thatCommunist propaganda and doctrine are diffusedin lectures at the London School of Economics,sihd the suggestion was made that the attention
of the Head of the School of Economics, -who isalso the Vice-Chancellor of London University,should &quot;be drawn to the matter.The Cabinet agreed that the followingpolicy should be adopted by Government Departments(the Civilian as well as the Service Departments)in dealing with Communists:-(a) Persons y/ho can be shown byreasonable evidence to be actively engaged in the dis-semination of anti-constitutional and revolutionary propaganda,either oral or written, shouldbe discharged forthwith andwithout pension or other super-annuation benefit:(b) Persons who merely label themselves as Communists without taking any active part in the furtherance of communism should be eliminatedas and when opportunity offers,i.8M by discharge on reduction.-2
safeguarding of INDUSTRIES(previous reference:Cabinet 13(S7),  Con-clusion 10..)2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper cp.-161 (27)) recommending the appointment ofa Committee of the Cabinet- to consider an appli-cation from the hosiery trade under the Safe-guarding of Industries Procedure and any otherrenewal of a safeguarding application which hasalready formed the subject of a reference to aCommittee under the White Paper- procedure, and suggesting that,if this course is agreed to bythe Cabinet, he should inform the hosiery trade that the Government do not propose to re-appoint the original Committee, which has already made afull report, and that any decision which may benecessary will be taken by the Government withoutfurther reference to a Committee.   The Memorandumalso dealt with the position of the worstedindustry.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) As regards the Hosiery Trade, thatthe President of the Board of Trade.should have authority, at.such time as he might deem appropriate, toset. up a Committee or re-assemblethe original Committee under the safeguarding of Industries Proce-dure, to consider whether the new  .&apos;&apos; -factors which have arisen since theoriginal&quot;inquiry necessitate newrecommendations:(b). As regards the Worsted Industry,,&apos; that the Chancellor- of the Exchequerand the President, of the Board of&apos;   Trade,&apos; after preliminary Depart-mental consultation between theBoard of Customs&apos; and Excise and.- the Board of Trade.,., should ,.dec ids .whether, if it were desired to- -impose ,a Duty,, the drawback,proposed by the original. Committeeappointed under the&apos;safeguarding of Industries Procedure would be-^administratively workable,; after which the matter could, if,    necessary., be further considered:,by the Cabinet.- . .     ,&apos;r-3r
CHINA. 3. The Cabinet had before thea the Conclusionsof the Second Meeting of the Cabinet Committee(previous reference: on China, relative to -Cabinet 34(27), Con- (i) The policy o^ the Government inelusion 2.) regard to Peking and Tientsin;and(ii)  The proposed withdrawal of indian troops,(Paper CP.-167 (27)) .Pekine and As regards Peking and Tientsin, theCabinet took note of and approved action already taken on the following decisions of the Committee(a) That Sir Miles Lampson should beinformed that, in the view of HisMajesty&apos;s Government, there was, on present information, no necessity to evacuate British subjects or HisMajesty&apos;s Legation from Peking:(b) That General Duncan should be author-ised to despatch, on demand by theColonel Commandant, North China,one Battalion from Shanghai toTientsin for use at Tientsin or at peking as might be required:-(c) That General Duncan should be   .instructed to proceed to NorthChina to examine the situation at tientsin and Peking:(d) That the Foreign Office and WarOffice should concert together in sending the necessary instructions -- t-c Sir Miles Larcpson and GeneralDuncan.The Secretary of State for War read a- telegram which he had just received from GeneralDuncan, commanding the Shanghai Defence Force,recording conversations with the Japanese GeneralMatsui and with General Butler of the UnitedStates-Marine Corps .    The latter, who had just.returned from Peking, had emphasized the necessityfor withdrawing the Legations in the early future and for concentrating larger forces at Tientsin.
The proposed In regard to the proposed withdrawal of thew    Withdrawal of1    Indian Troops.       Indian Mixed Brigade, the Cabinet had before therea Memorandum by the Secretary of State for War(Paper CP.-169 (27)) giving particulars of thecost of the retention of the Indian Mixed Brigade,but recommending the withdrawal only of a PackBattery.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he had learned from Tokio that theJapanese Government felt some suspicion that the shanghai Defence Force was not to be withdrawn.From this point of view the withdrawal of someof the forces at Shanghai would be useful, but sir Austen Chamberlain was not prepared to recommend it in present circumstances.    He asked his col-leagues., however,  to bear the Japanese suspicionsin mind in future consideration of this question.In view of the clouded situation in China,the Cabinet agreed  That none of the troops composing theIndian Mixed Brigade should be with- -  &apos;drawn, and that the transports nowdetained at Hongkong should beallowed to leave.Wei-hai-Wei. Before the Meeting, a Report by the Committeeof Chiefs of Staff in regard to the defence ofWel-hai-Wei (Paper CP.-1V1 (27)) was circulatedto the Cabinet, but the subject was not discussed at this Meeting.)    -   -

The latest Information was to the effectthat the King had put great: pressure on theEgyptian Cabinet to accede to Lord Lloyd&apos;s demands and that the Cabinet were likely to accept thesituation;    but Sir Austen Chamberlain warned hiscolleagxies that they must be prepared for thepossibility of developments of a less favourablekind.
Passports forParties ofChildren.5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised the question of granting passports toparties of school-children to proceed to Russia.Up to the present time he had (though with great reluctance) permitted the Passport Office togrant such passports because he had been advised by the Home Secretary that even if the passportswere r-fused there was no power to prevent thechildren proceeding to Russia on board Russianships, nor, in practice, could their returnwithout passports be prevented.    Sir austen chamberlain, however, felt the greatest doubt as to whether it was desirable to facilitate such,journeys, even though they could not be prevented,since they were undertaken solely for the purposesof Communist propaganda.   Before bringing thematter before the Cabinet he had ascertained thatthe President of the Board of Education-sharedhis views.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority to instruct the PassportOffice to refuse passports toRussia to organised parties ofo hi-1 d ta an ucrv^i Xvv-*a*-* .T
