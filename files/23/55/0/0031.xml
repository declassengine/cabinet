POLAND AND 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsLITHUANIA.reported to the Cabinet that the Council of the(Previous League of Nations had succeeded in putting an endReference:Cabinet 59 to the technical state of war which Lithuania(27), Oon-clusion 1.) had insisted on maintaining towards Poland ever since the occupation of &quot;Vilna.   The Council hopedthat the two Governments would now come together on questions of detail and settle them one by one,so that gradually they might reach a footing of normal relations, which would eventually resultin the resumption of diplomatic relations.Sir Austen Chamberlain paid a tribute to thecomplete loyalty with which Dr, Stresemann hadco-operated with the other Great Powers on thisquestion, and referred to assistance given byM. Litvinoff in putting pressure on M, Valdemaris,the Prime Minister of Poland,  to end the state of
ITALY. 3.    After referring to his own communication to the Italian Ambassador, Which had been( previous reference: transmitted to and had undoubtedly affectedCabinet 59(27), Con- M.

TEE prorogation of PARLIAMENT.(previous reference:Cabinet 60(87), Con-,elusion 7.)5-.&apos;     Tbe Cabinet agreed  That Parliament should beprorogued until FEBRUARY 7,1928.
7. Ths Cabinet resumed their consideration ofa Memorandum by ths Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (Paper C.P.-301 (27)) in regard to a proposed tax on imported malting barley., whichhad been rejected by the Cabinet on April 15,1926.    In this Note it was explained that, inview of the continued agitation among a sectionof farmers on this subject,, the question hadbeen re-examined by the Agricultural Policy Sub-Committee, who had decided against the tax andhad asked that their recommendation should be reported to the Cabinet, with a suggestion that,if the Cabinet concur in the recommendation, a white Paper should be issued setting out theobjections to the proposed Duty,   The Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries had attached to his memorandum, the dra^t of a White Paper which hereoomm-extended for the approval of the Cabinet.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesmade a comprehensive statement to the Cabinet onthe question,  at the end of which he suggestedthat the Report of the Falcon Committee should now be published.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explainedthat in the House of Commons he had several timesrefused to publish this Report, and he would liketo discuss the matter with Mr Guinness.The Minister of Agriculture was asked,  inthe course of the discussion, not to over-ratein the White Paper the technical difficulties involved in carryin? out the proposed tax onmalting-barley, and to include in the  white Paperany political and general reasons in addition to
the technical objections to the tax.The Minister of Agriculture explained thatthere was a strong demand from Members of Parlia-rent to know the facts, and that he was bound tostate the administrative difficulties involvedin the tax in some detail, but he promised toexamine the White Paper in the light of theCabinet discussion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the policy proposedby the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries, on the under-standing that the minister should re-examine the white paper in the light of theCabinet discussion and intro-dues such modifications as he might deer, advisable:(b) That the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries should discuss thepublication of the Falcon 7Committee Report with theChancellor of the Exchequer,and, subject to the agreementof the latter, should have authority to publish it.
AGRICULTURAL 8. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumCO-OPBRATTON.by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries(Previous (Paper C,P,-309 (27)) in regard to AgriculturalReference:Cabinet 32 Co-operation.    In this Memorandum it was explained(27)    Oon-elusion 9.) that the Agricultural Wholesale Society, whichwas a large body promoted shortly after the Warwith a good deal of semi-official support, had gone into liquidation, and as a result of a judgment in the House of Lords a number ofAgricultural Co-operative Societies find themselvesunexpectedly confronted with a liability to pay for shares which, under a legal interpretation of the Rules,  they were bound to take In the wholesale Society.    In order to avoid the veryserious setback which agricultural co-operation would otherwise experience from this state ofaffairs, and to show in a practical way the determination of the Government to give assist-ance to the agricultural industry where possible,the Minister of Agriculture proposed two alterna-tive schemes, one costing  35,000 and the other 50,000.    He also proposed the introduction, asa Government measure, of a short Bill to preventthe liability of members of Societies registered. under the Industrial Provident Societies Act,1893, being increased by an alteration of theRules without&apos; their consent in writing.In the course of the discussion attention was &quot;drawn.to the fact that two Members of Parlia-ment were&apos; Involved in serious financial losses in connection with the failure of the AgriculturalWholesale Society.   The Cabinet wer? given tounderstand that these Members would probably not
benefit from the measures how proposed, but evenif they did unexpectedly benefit to some extent it was felt that the policy was easily defensible.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of theMinister of Agriculture andFisheries that he should have authority to negotiate on thelines of the proposals in his memorandum, subject to a limitation of  50,000 in theamount which he shoxfld beauthorised to expend.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer gave the Boxer notice to the Cabinet that he was studying the indemnity.possibility of utilising part of the BoxerIndemnity for the cost of the British forces inChina.    In the present chaotic state of Chinait was impossible to divert the Boxer Indemnityto the purposes approved by the Cabinet.    Some 2,000,000 had accumulated, and the amountreceived was  400,000 a year.    In the following year the cost of maintaining military forces inChina was estimated in the region of  800,000.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned th* Chancellor o^ the Exchequer that ifany part of the Boxer Indemnity were divertedfor other purposes there would be many claims:for example, the victims of the present unsettledcondition of China., Whitehall Gardens, 3.^.1,December 14, 1927.
