EGYPT. 1.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that his conversations with(previous reference: Sarwat Pasha on the Treaty of Alliance betweenCabinet 53(87), Con-- Great Britain and Egypt were now ended f-,nd Sarwatelusion 1,)Pasha had left for Egypt.   The results of the conversations had been reported to the EgyptianAgreement Committee, and the latest draft of theTreaty had been circulated to the Cabinet (paper cp.-267 (27)).   He would shortly ask the cabinet for a final decision, as he wished Sarwat Pashato be informed of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s viewsimmediately on his arrival in Egypt.   He waswaiting for the Report of the Chiefs of Staff.In the meantime his Private Secretary had gone to paris in order to agree with Sarwat Pasha the precise wording of some further provisions towhich he had assented bafcre his departure.The Prime Minister stated that a Meetingof the Cabinet would probably be summoned afterthe -Armistice Ceremony on Friday morning next.Some discussion arose as to whether theReports of the Chiefs of Staff should be submittedseparately for each Service or jointly as the findings of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence.The Cabinet took note of the statement ofthe Seci-etary of State for Foreign Affairs, and agreed that each Service should submit its report and that there should also be a joint Report fromthe Committee o^ Chiefs 6f Sta^f.
POLAND and lithuania .(PreviousRsfersn.cs:Cabinet 50(37), Con-clusion 5.)2.    The Secretary of Stats for Foreign Affairscalled the attention of the Cabinet to a dispute between Lithuaria and Poland which was causingsome anxiety.   Lithuania was technically in astate of war with Poland and was about to submit the dispute to the League of Nations, where he hoped it &quot;&apos;rouli be possible to secure the co-cpera-tion of Franca and Germany in relieving the situa-11 on.
!HE BALKANS.3. The Sacretary of State for Foreign Affairsfago-Slavtreaty withjrance.another source of very considerable anxiety.also called the attention of the Cabinet toThis was in Macedonia.   There had recently beeninclined to be conciliatory towards her neighbourowing to her own unsatisfactory relations with italy,   The Macedonian revolutionary organisation was fomenting outrages with the deliberate purposeof preventing the growth of peaceful conditionsin that region.    The Government of Yugo-Slaviahad shown great moderation, and the bulgarian government had proclaimed a state of siege ontheir borders and had been advised by France and england to take vigorous measures against theauthors of these outrages ,There was a further development in the formof a Treaty which was about to be signed by theGovernments of France and Yugo-Slavia.   this treaty had been under consideration for some timeand its terms had been -srodified and its signaturedelayed., under pressure from M. Briand, in order not to wound the susceptibilities of Italy andto give Italy an opportunity of making a three-cornered instead of a bi-lateral pact.    Italy,however, had not responded,  and it was now proposedthat the treaty should be signed in Paris duringthe present week.    The Secretary of State addedthat he had no knowledge of the contents of thetreaty,&apos;but he had been&apos; assured by M. Briand thatit was harmless and completely in harmony with thespirit of the-League of Nations.   Dr. Marinkovitch,the Yugo-Slav- Minister for Foreign Affairs, who[previous reference:Cabinet 50some rapprochement between the Governments of(37), Con-conclusion 4.)Yugo-Slavia and Bulgaria.   Yugo-uSTavia was more
was on his way to Paris to sign the treaty, had expressed a desire to see him (Sir AustinChamberlain)^ but he had replied that he shoulddeprecate a visit Just now unless Dr. Marinkovitchwas prepared to visit Rome also.
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (Paper O.P.-265 (27)) on the subject of the proposals of theJockey Club for the amendment of the Gaming Laws.Attached to the &quot;Memorandum was a&quot; copy of theReport of a Committee appointed by the JockeyClub to inquire into the means by which Bettingmight best be made to contribute to the mainten-anca of Sport,   This Report had been adopted bythe Jockey Club, and the Stewards had been instruet-ed to take any necessary steps to secure theadoption of the recommendations contained in theReport.   The Stewards had accordingly interviewedthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and had askedwhether the Government would introduce legislation to permit -(i) The installation of the Totalisatoror Par! Mutuel on racecourses;    and(ii) The charging of fees by the RacecourseExecutives to bookmakers on the courses.The Chancellor of the Exchequer stated thatthe proposals of the Jockey Club had been favour-ably received by the Press, but that he did not wish the Government to take upon themselves theresponsibility for deciding the matter.   Theopinion of the House of Commons should first besought, and, if it were favourable, financial arrangements could be discussed at a later stage.The Cabinet agreed -That, the Chancellor of the exchequer should inform the Stewards of theJockey Club that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be guided by thedecision of. the House of Commons onthe question of the legalisation ofthe Totalisator and will give facili-ties for a Private Member&apos;s Bill onthe subject, provided that any financial arrangements proposed are satisfactory to the Government.
THE ROAD CON-VEYANCE OPPASSENGERSAOTD GOODSBY RAILWAYCOMPANIES.(previous reference;Cabinet 45(S7), Con-elusion 1.)5.    The Cabinet had before them Memoranda bythe Minister of Transport on the subject of theRoad Conveyance of Passengers and Goods by railway Companies  (Papers C.P.-200 (.27)  andC.P.-261 (27)).    In the latter Memorandum theMinister of Transport stated that, in accordancewith the Conclusions of the Meeting of the Cabinetmentioned in the margin, his Department had studiedthe safeguards which could be suggested for incor-poration in any legislation which Parliament mightsee fit to approve for giving the Railway Companiespowers to run services by road.   He had also received a copy of the Bill which the RailwayCompanies proposed to introduce next Session.The Minister of Transport explained broadly the proposals contained in his Memorandum (paper.Pg-251 (27)), making special reference to thedifficulties the Railway Companies were expefiene-ing   in earning their standard revenue, and tothe safeguards which it was desirable to impose upon the Companies if their powers were extended..In the course of the discussion some appre-hension was expressed that the Companies mightneglect their proper functions and be tempted to run road services which were not directly ancillaryto railway services.    It was pointed out, on theother hand, that the Railway Companies madesubstantial contributions to the upkeep of theroads and that to forbid their sxterided use wasto subject then; to unfair competition.
O P&apos;The Cabinet expressed their general agreementfollowincwith the/conclusions and recommendations set forth in the Minister of Transport&apos;s Memorandum (paper cp.-261 (27)), and authorised the Minister of   -Transport to communicate with the Railway Companieson the lines of (xi )&apos;-(i) A substantial and immediate extensionof the existing powers of railwaycompanies to run road services is fair to them and likely to be advantageous to the public.(ii) There is no reason to await the resultsof any further inquiry before this stepis taken.(iii) The geographical area over which eachcompany seeks power to run services byroad is wide and somewhat indefinite,but it is difficult to suggest closerdefinition.   There would seem to be noreason for controlling a railway company in respect of the routes which it mayuse while other carriers by road areunfettered,  but in order that the extentto which any powers granted are being used may be known, all regular servicesestablished and the areas in which other services are maintained should be reported to the Minister.The power to enter into agreements isalso extremely wide and the wording ofthe clause requires further considera-tion.    The Companies have been askedto look into this with a view to seeing whether some limitation can be proposed.(iv) No overriding safeguard can be proposedwhich will prevent all risk of wasteful  .competition between one railway company and another or entirely obviate the riskof a transfer of traffic from theirrailways by the institution of potentiallycompetitive road services, but the cumulative effect of the partial safe-guards which are practicable should be considerable.    It must be left to theCompanies to satisfy Parliament if thepoint is raised that they see their wayto operate their road services without these undesirable consequences.(v) The appeal to the Railway Rates Tribunal-as to the reasonableness of rates and charges may be accepted, but provision should be made for publication of. rates.(vi) Sufficiently stringent provisions shouldbe inserted to enable the Tribunal toabate the amount to be raised by railway.
O P* o45 8charges if the road services of theRailway Companies or their investmentsin, or their guarantees and agreements in connection with, road services donot yield a fair return.(vii) The Companies should furnish suitableaccounts, returns and statistics, and show the extent of their investmentsand guarantees in their publishedaccounts.   They should also show theresults of their road services for particular areas and not merely forthe whole group.(viii) The Railway Companies should not be putin the position of being required toprovide facilities, but the Conversanceo*&apos; Mails Act should be made applicableto their road services if the Postmaster-General so desires.(ii.) Publication of agreements should notbe insisted upon, tut copies of allagreements under the Act should belodged with the Minister, who shouldhave liberty to transmit them to theRates Tribunal if he thinks them rele-vant to the Tribunal^ proceedings.(x) There should be a suitable extension ofthe foregoing obligations to cover thecase of traffic carried not by RailwayCompanies themselves but under closeworking agreements with Railway Com-pa-nies, but the manner in which this,is to be effected requires furthercons consideration.(xi) Discussion with the Railway Companieson points of detail has, of course,been without prejudice to the main ques-tion whether the Government car. lend any -support to the Bills.    I suggest that Tshou.il be authorised to inform theCompanies that if they proceed withtheir Bills the Government will gener-ally be prepar-d to state on SecondReading that they are satisfied thatthe time has com^ when an extensionof the   Railway Companies&apos; powers may properly be granted, that the SelectCommittee will have to consider whatsafeguards should be introduced intothe Bill, that the Government has cometo the conclusion that certain safeguards^of ^hich the general nature is summarised above, are prim;a facie desirable, andwill indicate them to the SelectCommittee under the usual procedure,together with any further minor anddrafting points that may arise and anyfurther points that may arise on thefilled Bill, and that the Companies willhave to satisfy Parliament as to thepoints raised, in (lii) and (iv) ,-ifnecessary.
THE report of THE CROWNPROCEEDINGSCOMMITTEE .(previous reference:Cabinet 53(27), Con-cTusion 5.)6, The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum bythe Postmaster-General (Paper 0oP.-264 (27)),in which he laid before the Cabinet, for purposesof record and future reference should occasionarise, his views on the subject of the CrownProceedings Bill.   His intention had been to acquaint the Crown Proceedings Report committee with his views on the Bill so far as the PostOffice was concerned, but the Committee had reported to the Ccbinet before he was in aposition to do so.2, Whitehall Gardensv SfcW.i,November 9, 1927.
