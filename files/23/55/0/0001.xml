1. The Cabinet &quot;had before them the Fifth&apos;Report, of the Chiefs of Staff Committee on     4the subject of Sanctions (Paper CP.-141 (.27)).The Chief of the Naval Staff answeredquestions in regard to the draft Report.In reply to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, Lord Beatty agreed that there wouldbe no objection, if the Cabinet so desired,to the insertion of words in the instructionsto the Naval Commander-in-Chief to make itclear that punitive action taken in regard tooutrages which endangered British property4but not British lives, should only be taken after reference to, and sanction by, HisMajesty&apos;s Government.    He emphasized, however,the importance of not fettering more than was absolutely necessary the discretion of theNaval Commander-in-Chief, who had up to nowshown the greatest circumspection.After the withdrawal of the Chiefs ofStaff, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that, with a viewto following up the favourable attitude of thenew Japanese Foreign Minister (to which SirA\isten Chamberlain had referred at the last meeting of the Cabinet) he was about to send atelegram asking a number of questions as tothe Japanese attitude.    He did not.expect toobtain any considerable results from thesequestions, but he wished to show that GeneralTanaka&apos;s remarks had been taken seriously. -Sir Austen Chamberlain also mentioned that he had authorised Sir Miles -Lampson to visit Shanghai in order to ascertain thesituation there.-1-
The Cabinet then discussed the proposedwithdrawal of Mr Newton, the British Representsative with the Provisional Government at Hankowas suggested.by Sir Miles Lampson&apos;(TelegramNo. 833 of May 7th), the approval to which(by telegram No. 35S of May 9th) had beenheld in suspense by a later telegram (No. 356of May 9th) pending consideration by theCabinet.In this connection the Cabinet were informed that, if Mr Newton was withdrawn, achannel of communication with the HankowGovernment would still exist through the consul-General.Attention was drawn to the statement bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs inthe House of Cosrmons on May 9th, and the q\ies-tion was asked as to whether the BritishGovernment would be precluded thereby fromdenouncing the Hankow Agreement.Attention was also drawn to TelegramNo. 353, of May 8th, to Sir Miles Lampson,intimating strong disapproval of a project(reported in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegram No.834, of May 5th) by a Major Nathan to financeChang Tso-lin under the guise of an industrialloan.    The opinion was expressed, and met withsome support, that neither from the point ofview of international law was it necessary,nor from that of the public interest was itdesirable, to discourage financial assistancefrom private sources to Chang Tso-lin, who had at least shown himself less unreasonable and  .less anti-British than the Nationalist Govern-ment who in he was fighting and who were reo.-- -  &apos;
support in arms and money from the SovietGovernment.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the FifthReport by the Chiefs of Staffon- Sanctions in China  (paper c.-P.  141 (27),  subject to amendment of the draft instruc-tions to the Naval Commander-in-Chief with the object of making clear the circumstances in whichthe prior sanction of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should be obtained before taking punitive action.(b) That the First Lord of the Admir-alty, in consultation with theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  should draw uptelegraphic instructions to theNaval Commander-in-Chief basedon the Fifth Report of the Chiefsof Staff,  amended as above, andthat the telegram should be repeated to the British Ministerat Peking:(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs&apos; telegram No, 353to Sir Miles Lampsoh, authorising the British Minister to withdrawMr,  Newton from Hankow and to notify the Hankow Government on the lines proposed in his telegram No. 832,should now be approved:(d) To take note that the becretaryof State for Foreign Affairs was preparing and would circulate aMemorandum on the subject of theHankow Agreement) in order that theCabinet might have full material for forming a judgment upon it.(e) To take note that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would consider carefully the views expressed at the Cabinet in regardto the disapproval (in TelegramNo. 352 to Sir Miles Lampson) ofprivate proposals for financingChang Tso-lin, and that Sir austen chamberlain would report the resultsof his. re-examination to the PrimeMinister, with a view,  if thePrime Minister should deem necessary,to. further consideration of thequestion by the Cabinet.
2.   The Cabinet had before them Paperscirculated by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs on the subject of Italy&apos;special interests in Albania, including atelegram from M. Mussolini and Sir austen chamberlain&apos;s proposed reply (Paper CP.-144(27)).The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs summarised the earlier history of thequestion which had led to the correspondence with M. Mussolini, and emphasized that,mainly owing to Mr Seeds&apos; despatch No. 59of April 18th (Paper CP.-144 (.27), No.2),he had come to the conclusion that it wouldbe in the best interest of FTis Majesty&apos;sGovernment no longer to assert the view thatthey would not suffer Italy to interfere inthe internal government of that country inorder to ensure the continuance of a Governmentfriendly to Italian interests.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Memorandum forM. Mussolini (Paper CP.-144(27) , No. 4) .
3.  The Cabin-t had before them a memorandum submitted jointly by the Lord President ofthe Council, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs on the subject of the representation in the Dominions of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain (Paper CP.-140 (27))..The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee,composed as follows -The Lord President of the Council(in the Chair),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State forDominion Affairs,The President of the Board ofTrads -should meet to work out, in con-sultation with other ministers concerned (e.g., the Chancellorof the Exchequer or the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury) andwith the Dominion Governments,schemes for the representationof Great Britain in the Dominionssuitable to the circumstances ofeach Dominion.The Chancellor of the Exchequerentered a caveat as to the desir-ability of avoiding increase ofexpenditure without compensatingeconomy.
