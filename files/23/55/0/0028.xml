EGYPT.Draft Treatyof Alliance.(previous reference:Cabinet 55(27),  Con-conclusion l(b).)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscalled the attention of the Cabinet to the views which had been expressed by the Dominions on theDraft Treaty of Alliance with Egypt (dominions office Telegrams Nos. 308, 309, 310, 311, 312,316,  317, 318 and 319).    Theae replies were s\ichas  to warrant instructions being now sent to theHigh Commissioner in Egypt authorising him to sign the Treaty.    The Secretary of State proposed,therefore, to request Lord Lloyd to inform SarwatPasha that he was prepared to sign the Treaty.Lord Lloyd would also be asked to read to SarwatPasha^ and to leave with him, a despatch setting forth certain points on which understandingshad been reached between Sarwat Pasha and theSecretary of State and to which the Cabinetattached importance.The Cabinet agreed to the course proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs .
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he was doing all thatwas possible to reduce the friction between theGovernments of Italy and Yugo-Slavia, and he had suggested to M. Mussolini the desirability of offering to make the Treaty with Albania into a tripartite agreement by which Italy and Yugo-Slavia would ,  guarantee to one another and to Albania to preserve the integrity of albania.
RFDUCTION and limitation OFARMAMENTSCommittee on policy.The FinnishProposal.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(27), Con-elusion 4 .)3... In view of the Debate on Disarmament whichwas to take place in the House of Commons thesame afternoon, and o** the early departure ofLord Cushendun for Geneva to attend the meetingsof the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament-Conference,  the Cabinet held a Special meeting to consider the Report of the Committee on Policyin regard to Reduction and Limitation of Arma-ments (Paper C.P.-293 (27)), which had been circulated late on the previous evening.   TheCabinet also had before than a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on thesubject of the Finnish Proposal (Paper C.P.-294   (27)).Before proceeding to discuss the Report ofthe Committee on Policy, the Chairman of theCommittee (Lord Salisbury) asked the Cabinet tomake the following additions and corrections inthe text of the Report, which had been hurriedlyprinted (Paper C.P.-293 (27)):-Page 3, last line:    after the word&quot;disputes&quot; insert the following:-t-hough obviously care must betaken that they do not uselanguage which may hereafterhamper the Government in resisting political pressxireat home to secure the adoption by this country of the optional Clause.Page 4:    after the paragraph ending&quot;in other regions&quot;, insert anew cross-headline:-IV&quot;.- FINNISH  SCHEME OF FINANCIALGUARANTEESand make the consequential-amendments in the enumerationof subsequent sections.
The Lord. Privy Seal drew the attentionof the Cabinet to the salient points of theCommittee&apos;s Report, and laid special emphasis onthe sections dealing with the Optional Clause,the importance of the Finnish Scheme,, and theviews held by the Attorney-General on the devel-opment of Arbitration.     Lord Salisbury (in theabsence of the Secretary of State for War)  then read a Memorandum, which had been received asthe Cabinet assembled, by the Chief of theImperial General Staff, dealing with budgetary limitation (Appendix).    The Secretary of Statefor War, who arrived shortly after,, interpretedthe War Office point of view to be that, in orderto avoid direct limitation of materiel,, theWar Office would prefer a budgetary limitationof personnel and materiel combined.    This,  intheir view, was to be preferred to reaching a deadlock on materiel.A full discussion ensued, in the course ofwhich importance was attached to the following,among other, considerations for the guidance ofthe Foreign Secretary in the Debate in the Houseof Commons, that afternoon and of Lord Cushendunat the meetings of the Preparatory Commission atGeneva next week:-(a) The British case rested on the great and unparalleled measures of disarraa-ment which had been spontaneouslycarried out since the ;Var.    It was for other Powers to follow the example set by this country.(b) The proposals put forward by theAdmiralty for the limitation of the size of battleships and the extensionof their age, and for dealing with&apos;J    Destroyers and Submarines, were a mostimportant contribution to the cause,of peace and economy.    These proposals were still available and should bestressed, so far aa this could bedone without raising . controversy
on the question of total tonnage and Cruiser policy.(c) There were political advantages Inpositively accepting the principleof -Arbitration,  subject       adequatereservations, but the attitude ofthe Government&quot;&apos;s representatives atpresent should be- based on SectionVII (a)  of the Report of the ImperialConference, 1936, dealing with compulsory Arbitration in Inter-national Disputes, which runs asfollows:-&quot;One question which we studiedwas that of arbitration in inter-national disputes, with special reference to the question of accept-ance of Article 36 of the statute of the Permanent Court of Inter-national Justice, providing for the compulsory submission of certainclasses of cases to the Court.    Onthis matter we decided to submit noResolution to the Conference, but,whilst the members of the Committeewere unanimous in favouring the widest possible extension of themethod of arbitration for thesettlement of international disputes,the feeling was that it was atpresent premature to accept the obliga-tions und&quot;-&apos;r the Article in question.    Ageneral understanding was reached that none o^ the Governments repre-sented at the Imperial conference would take any action in the dirsc-tion of the acceptance of the com-pulsory jurisdiction of the.PermanentCourt, without bringing up the matter for further discussion&quot;.(d) In dealing with Arbitration theBritish representative should notonly indicate the importance of the reservations which would be essential in any instrument acceptable to   PisMajesty&apos;s Government and the Dominions,as set forth in thn Committee&apos;s Report,but should also point out the disatili-ties under which an. international court must function at present inthe infancy of international juris-prudence, the absence of case lawand rules of evidence and procedure.(e) Reference was made to a Memorandumdated July 81, 1924, by ViscountHaldane, when Lord Chancellor, on compulsory Arbitration and thePermanent Court of InternationalJustice (Paper C.P.-25&amp;7 (2&amp;) )( Omd.2768,   p.28.)
and to the desirability-HrT-^iircTi^l&amp;t-- .ing this Memorandum to Parliament ifViscount Haldane assented to thiscourse.   The Foreign Secretary wasin communication with Lord Haldaneon this point.(f) The British representatives should endeavour throughout the Debatesto avoid using language of an^absolute and final character whenopposing disarmament proposalswhich today were impracticablebut which at some future date HisMajesty&apos;s Government might findeasier of acceptance in their present or in some modified shape.(g) Objection was taken to the passageon page 5 of the Committee&apos;s Reportbeginning  &quot;They recommend thereforeand Lord Salisbury undertook,in consultation with Sir austen chamberlain      to re-draft the passage^in the light of the Cabinet disaussida(h) Attention was drawn by the foreign secretary to the third and fourthparagraphs of Article 8 of theCovenent:-&quot;Such plans shall be subject toreconsideration and revision atleast every ten years.After these plans shall have beenadopted by the several Governments,the limits of armaments thereinfixed shall not be exceeded withoutthe concurrence of the Council&quot;.This might prove a formidable obstaclein the way of disarmament;if a country reached a certain levelof disarmament it could not departfrom it without the unanimous assent&apos;of the Council.   Any limitationshould be for a specified number of &quot;years, and it should not continueto be binding in the event of a new agreement not being made.Subject to the foregoing, the Cabinet(i) To approve the recommendationsof the Report of the Cabinet Com-mittee on Policy (Reduction and limitation of Armaments)(Paper C.P.-293 (27)).(ii) To continue the Committee in being and to ask the Secretary of State-^ -for Scotland to serve as a member in the absence of the Secretary of.Statefor War.$ The passage was subsequently amended by Lord Salisburyand Sir Austen   Chamberlain to read as follows:-/-
They recommend therefore that  our representatives should state theAdmiralty proposals as set forth in their Memorandum which is annexed (Annex 2), with specialmention of the scheme for thereduction of capital ships, butthe controversial questions towhich we have just referred shouldnot be pressed against opposition.The recent announcement of the modification in our naval programme should, of course, be mentioned as evidence&apos; of the spirit in which weare pursuing the oauss of disarma-ment.
THE INDIAN 4.    The Secretary of State for India,  as aSTATUTORYCOMMISSION. matter of urgency, informed the Cabinet that therecent disturbances in the Debates in the House(Previous Reference:Cabinet 57 (2V), of Commons were having an unfavourable effectConclusion 5.)on the attitude of the Labour Party to theIndian Statutory Commission, and he would notbe surprised to learn in the course of the day that it had been, decided to withdraw the twoLabour representatives from the Commission.Should that occur, it would give rise- to apolitical issue of the highest and gravest importance.    A resolution was to be submitted that day to the Labour Party by the Executive, in whichthe view was expressed that -&quot;The Commission should consult, on equal terms, with a commission appointed by the Indian legisla-ture:    that there should be jointmeetings of the two Commissionsfor the taking of evidence (though not to the exclusion of either bodytaking other evidence by itself);that after all the evidence hasbeen heard and the inquiries made further consultations between thetwo Commissions should be held;and that the reports of both Com-missions should in due course be presented to the Joint Committeeof the two Houses of Parliament&quot;.Lord Birkenhead read to the Cabinet the correspondence which had passed between himself and Mr Ramsay MacDonald on the subject of theCommission from July last onwards.    In these letters a Parliamentary Commission was acceptedby Mr MacDonald, and Lord Birkenhead had plainlyindicated the procedure which would probably befollowed by the Commission, and had refused tofetter its freedom in regard to the evidence which it should call.   These letters werePersonal and Secret, and could not, of course,be -quoted in public without permission.
In the event of it being decided by theLabour Party to withdraw Mr Walsh and Viajor Attleehe proposed to move the adjournment of the debate on the Coir-Trlssion which was to take place that afternoon in the House 0* Lords, and he wouldlater advise the Cabinet as to the course which,in his view, should then be adopted.The Cabinet agreed -That in the event of the LabourParty deciding to withdraw theirrepresentatives from the IndianStatutory Commission before the debate in &quot;the House of Lords that afternoon, the Secretary of state should move the adjournment andshould inform the Prime minister so that the business of the Houseof Commons for tomorrow (Friday)might be adjusted accordingly.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November. 24,  192? .
APPENDIX.REDUCTION AND LIMITATION OF ARMAMENTS.REPORT OF THE CABINET COMMITTEE ON POLICY.(CP.&quot;293  (27)).Me-orandu^ by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The only comment I have to make upon this report of theCabinet Committee  on Disarmament policy refers to the recommendation that there should be no limitation on budgetaryexpenditure.The Committee give a number of reasons to support the irrecommendation, which I will not deal with in any detail.I would, however, point out that comparisons can be made and misrepresentation will occur under a system of publicityof budgets just as much as under a system of limitation ofbudgets.      Our figures will not alter in either case.Furthermore, the probable duration of the Convention willbe only five years;    in that time there can be no serious,risk of unforeseen developments,  if an adequate margin for contingencies is ensured.The main point I wish to emphasise is that as a resultof this recommendation we are now without any concrete proposalfor the limitation of material in any shape or form.      Thereasons why we  cannot accept direct limitation of materialor of expenditure on material alone have been stated, in theMemorandum by the Secretar3r of State for War - CP. 254 (27).Our representative at Geneva will thus be placed in a verydifficult position if,  after taking&apos; a strong line on thelimitation of trained reserves, he is  compelled to admit thatwe have no proposals of any kind for limiting material forland armaments.     VVe shall be open to the accusation that we
are ready to press a form of disarmament upon others fromwhich we ourselves are immune, whereas we refuse to accept any limitation at all where our own interests are concerned.It is at least possible that we may be faced at Genevawith a unanimous demand for limitation of budgets.      Inthat event the Cabinet will be faced with the possibilityof a breakdown of the Conference owins, to our attitude,or of an eleventh hour surrender entsdllng an inevitableloss of prestige and the probability of considerable odium.I am anxious that the effect of the recommendationreferred to should be fully understood and duly weighed.(Intd.)    G.F.M.r Office, S.W.1.24th November-, 1927
