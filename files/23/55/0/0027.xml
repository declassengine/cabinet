It followed closely theTreaty with france. pacific lines of the Treaty between France and roumania, and was in harmony with the spirit of(previous reference: the Lea cue of Nations,    Nevertheless,  the conolu-Cabinet 54 .(27),  Con- sion of the Treaty had embittered the relationselusion o.)of France and Italy.    For this reason he had^on the previous day, expressed to the french ambassador his earnest hope that the french would make a serious effort to get on better terms with Italy, that we in this country hadthe greatest interest in the matter as italy was one of the guarantors of the Treaty of locarno and everything should be done to avoidforcing Italy into another combination based on germany.ALBANIA. 2. At a later stage in the proceedings of the -Treaty with Cabinet the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsItaly.read a telegram which had reached the Foreign(Previous Office from Albania to the effect that a defensiveReference:Cabinet 31 military alliance for a period of twenty years(27).,  Con-conclusion 3.) had been concluded between Italy and Albania.
DISARMAMENT. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsHouse of read to the Cabinet the resolution,  of whichCommonsDebate on. notice had been given for the following day byMr Ramsay MacDonald, on Disarmament:-(previous reference: &quot;That this House deplores the lack ofCabinet 50 preparation by the Government and(27),  Con- the military character of the Britishelusion 9,) delegation which seriously contri-buted to the failure of the recentnaval conference at Geneva,  the slow progress made by the League of NationsPreparatory Commission for theDisarmament Conference, and the refusal of the Government to acceptthe principle of arbitration and promote a scheme of internationalsecurity guaranteed by the Leagueof Nations&quot;.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Government should move to omit all the words after that this House in order to insert.....recognising that the efforts of His Majesty&apos;s Government havebeen constantly directed to themaintenance of peace, the reduc-tion of armaments and the advance-ment cf the authority of the Leagueof Nations;    and remaining opposedto the assumption by this country of the extended and dangerousobligations embodied in the protocol of 1924, approves thepolicy pursued by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.(b) That the First Lord of the Admiralty,.   k .   n m.     / - --, in replying for the Government, should^ 7 IKM^r ^7 I__A rebut the charges which were beingJL. made in the Pross that the Chancellorof the Exchequer was in some specialor exceptional sense responsible forthe policy followed at the naval conference;    and should insist thatthe policy pursued at Geneva wasthe policy of the Cabinet.   The FirstLord should also remind the House ofthe statement on policy read in theHouse of Commons and in the ^&apos;ouse ofLords and endorsed by Parliament,on July 27th,  1927:(c) That the First Lord, should endeavourto trace the foundation of the rumourswhich were being circulated in regardto conversations alleged to have takenplace between the American Naval Repre-sentative and Admiralty officials, before the meeting of the naval conference at Geneva.
38.64. Lord Salisbury, as Chairman of the Committeeon Policy in regard to Reduotion and Limitationof Armaments, informed the Cabinet that the   .Committee&apos;s Report was being circulated that day.In view of the Debate on the subject whichis  to take place in the House of Commons tomorrow(Thursday) and of the early departure of LordOush^ndun for Geneva for the meetings of thePreparatory Commission for the Disarmament Con-ference,  the Cabinet agreed  -That the Report of the Committeeon Reduction and Limitation ofArmaments (Paper C.P.-293 (27))  &apos;should be considered at a meetingof the Cabinet to be held onTHURSDAY,  NOVEMBER 24 th.,  &apos;at 11 a,m.,  at 10 Downing Street.
6* The Secretary of&quot;State for India referredto the fiteps which had been taken to secure theCo-operation of the Labour Party Executive inthe composition of the Indian Statutory commissioners-*ion% and to their nomination of Mr Stephen Walshand Major Attlee.   The Labour Party had not formally accepted the appointment of a purelyParliamentary Commission as the wisest procedure\ire,but they had gone so far as to recommend thesetwo members of the Commission.   Since the public announcement of the names, opposition to theParliamentary character of the Commission had increased among a section of the Labour Party,and he (Lord Eirkenhead) had been in closecommunication with three delegates of the IndianCommittee of the Labour Party (Mr Ramsay MacUonaid,Mr Snowden and Mr Lansbury) In the hope ofsmoothing out the difficulties which had arisenand which were being fomented largely by certainSwarajist leaders now in this country.   It wouldbe an unfortunate circumstance should the Labourtr-errbers of the Commission be withdrawn.   he understood the matter was, being discussed by theLabour Party that morning.
CHINA. 6j The Cabinet had before them a Note by theOperations Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet covering a Reportagainst theBogus and of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Commit tea of thepanefs IslandForts. Committee of Imperial Defence dealing with thequestion of operations against the Bogus andPreviousReference: Dane1 s Island Ports.,  near Canton (Paper CP.-273 (27)).    The Memorandum stated that theCabinet Committee on China had had the Reportof the Chiefs of Staff Committee under consid-eration and had recommended the following Con-elusions of the Chiefs of Staff Committee forthe approval of the Cabinet:-(fc)  That provided the necessary forces are concentrated for the purpose,the capture and demolition of theBogue and Pane&apos;s Island Forts isa feasible military operation.(b) In order to ensure success,  the attacks on both, systems of fortsshould be simultaneous, and shouldbe carried out in such a way as toensure surprise in both cases.   Welay particular emphasis on this latter point in view of the sugges-tion in Sir Miles Lampson&apos;s telegramNo 01563,  of the 4th November,  1927,that &quot;the very knowledge that suchpreparations are being made shouldhave additional deterrent effect&quot;.Any such leakage would seriouslymilitate against the chances ofsuccess,(c) Having regard to the military conse-quenoes of possible reactions inother parts of China, we suggestthat- the proposed operations arein&amp;dvis ab1s tThe Cabinet agreed to the Conclusions ofthe Chiefs of Staff Committee as recom-- . mended by the Cabinet Committee onChina (paper CP.-273 (27)).
7. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Belligerent rights at Sea:-A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(Paper 0.P.-258 (87)):A Note by the Secretary of Stsfc efor Foreign Affairs coveringMemoranda by Sir Maurice Hankeyand Sir Cecil Hurst (Paper C.P.-286 (27)):Some Observations on Sir CecilHurst&apos;s Memorandum (Paper C.P.-287  (27)) .At the request of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs,  the Cabinet agreed  To institute an enquiry into thesubject fcf Belligerent Rights at sea, tne precise nature of theCommittee and its composition tobe raised by the Prime Ministerat a future meeting.
jjjssm oilpurchases.(previous refer^no.:Cabinet 33(27),  Con-clusion l(a).)8. The Cabinet had before th-itn a M-sa!or&apos;an;dumby the President of the Board of Tra.de on thesubject o^ Purchases of Russian Oil (Paper C289 (27)), in which Sir Philip Cunliffe-Listerstat-d that the Board of Trade was being pressed to state the view of ^is Majesty&apos;s Government inregard to purchasing Russian oil.   practically all the oil exported by Russia was obtained fromconcessions ^hich had been taken by the SovietGovernment from foreign Powers.The Cabinet agreed  That the answer of the Governmentshould be that, while no obstacleis placed by the Government in theway of any form of trade,  and whileevery British subject is free to buy or not as he pleases, it is thepractice of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto a^oid buying goods formerly theproperty of their own nationalswhich have, been confiscated withoutpayment.
9. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet of the efforts which were being madeby the Air Ministry, th^ Colonial Office and theBoard of Trade to secure that the Iraq pipelineshould pass not to a French Syrian port but toa Palestine port (Haifa).   The Turkish PetroleumBoard had laid it down that the matter was oneto be decided on commercial grounds, and the AirMinistry and the Colonial Office were engaged inthe preparation of the case for Haifa.
IRAQ,, 10.   The Cabinet had before their a Memorandum by negotiations the Acting Secretary of State for the Coloniesfor Revisionof Treaty. on the subject of negotiations for the revisionof the Anglo-Iraq Treaties (Paper C.P.-888(27)),(previous previous reference: covering a Note by Sir Henry Dobbs, the HighCabinet 56(27), Con- Commissioner for Iraq, on the results of the elusion 5.)breaking down of the negotiations.    In his memorandum the Acting Secretary of State for theColonies stated that the discussions with king feisal and his Ministers had broken down on thedesire of King Feisal to obtain Treaty recogni-tion of the &quot;complete independence&quot; of Iraq,and that the question of the right of the EritishGovernment to tender advice to Iraq on all important matters also remained unsettled.    The &apos;two alternatives for the decision of the cabinet were:-(i)  To offer further concessions toKing Feisal with a view to keeping the negotiations alive:or(ii) To face the fact that a new Agree-ment is impracticable and to allowmatters to take th-ir course.The Acting Secretary of State for the Col-colonies recapitulated the position reached in thenegotiations with King Feisal as set out In his memorandum and in that by Sir Henry Dobbs.    Inhis (Mr Ormsby-Gore-&apos;s) view it would be unwisefor the Government to appear to be afraid of a breakdown.    A breakdown was preferable to theacceptance of Feisal&apos;s demand for &quot;complete independence&apos;&apos;.   His Majesty&apos;s Government was a mandatory Power, and to admit &quot;coirplete independ-ence&quot; before Iraq entered the League of nations would only lead to widespread misunderstanding.&apos;.
A breakdown would probably bave some serious consequences and would lead to nationalistagitation in Baghdad and the Mosul towns.    Onthe other band, Iraq as a whole did not wishconscription,  and many of the tribes wishedBritish authority maintained.    If the cabinet decided against Peisal, his Government would fall and it might become necessary to postpone the reduction of British forces in Iraq.   A.draft announcement had been drawn up for publication with the object of minimisingtrouble (Paper C.P.-288 (27) Appendix), but it-was not unlikely that Peisal would endeavour to anticipate its publication by private comraun-io-a--tions to the London Press.The Secretary of State for Air stated that,A.ir Vice-Marshal Sis Edward Ellington, who wacActing ^&apos;igh Commissioner of Iraq, did not share the alarmist views of Sir Henry Dobbs as tothe probable results of a breakdown of negotia-tions, and the Chief of the Air Staff did notat present anticipate that it would be necessaryto alter the programme for the reduction oftroops.    The remaining Indian Battalion was due to come away in three months.   Ha agreed generally  with Mr Ormsby-Gore that the cabinet should not take too alarmist a view of thesituation and should make no advances to Peisal.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsrecounted the history of the proposals that Iraqshould enter the League, and pointed out that toaccept &quot;complete independence&quot; now would be a breach of the agreement with the League whenMosul was awarded to Great Britain, when itwas laid down that we should maintain our
mandatory position for 85 years or until Iraqwas admitted a member, whichever was the shorter period.    Sir Austen Chamberlain referred to the embarrassment of the British Government which had followed the Declaration of the Independence ofEgypt-    To grant complete independence to Iraqin the present circumstances would be to repeat the mistake we had mad? in Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer concurred in the course proposed by Mi&quot; Ormsby-G-ore, and added that he had confidence in Sir &quot;ugh Trenchard&apos;desire to reduce expenditure in Iraq as soon ashe could, and he (Mr Churchill) would not press for the withdrawal of the Indian Battalion until it was clearly safe.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the conclusion of a new agreementwith King Peisal was impracticable onthe conditions which he laid down:(b) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should arrange fora suitable public announcement atthe appropriate moment:(c) That the Secretary of State for air should inform )the Cabinet of his intention to withdraw the IndianBattalion before taking steps todo s o .

PROPOSEDPURCHASEOP PERSIANOPIUM BYrnjTE  COVERN-MENT OPFONH-FONfr.(previous reference:Cabinet 36(27 ) Conclusion 6).11.The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the proposedpurchase of Persian opium by the Government ofrTong- Kong:-A Memorandum by the Acting Secre-tary of State for the Colonies(Pap-r C.P.-284 (27)):A. Joint JAemorandnm by the Secre-taries of&quot; State for Foreign affairs and the Home Department (paper cp.-291 ^27)) covering a Memorandumby Sir Malcolm Delevingne., theChairman of the Standing Inter-Departmental Commit tee on theOpium and Dangerous Drugs Policyof His Majesty&apos;s Government.In his Memorandum the Acting Secretary ofState for the Colonies stated that the governor of &quot;ong-Kong was urgently anxious to be author-is ed to purchase Persian opium, without which an experiment upon which his Government hadembarked (with the object of rescuing theAdministration from an intolerable situationresultin? from the prevalence of opium snugglingand the efforts of the Hong-Kong Government to suppress it) was bound to fail.    After relatingthe history of this question, the ActingSecretary o^ State for the Colonies submittedto the Cabinet that the Hong-Kong Governmentshould be authorised to purchase Persian opiumfor this purpose.On the other hand, the Secretaries ofState for Foreign Affairs and the Home Departmentdid not see how the change in policy introduced by the Governor of T7ong-Kong could be approvedor his request for permission to purchase largequantiti-s of Persian opium could be sanctioned
&quot;with.out revoking the policy to which theGovernment was pledged, viz.,  to suppressopium smoking throughout British territory.Our position at Geneva would be made impossibleThe Acting Secretary of State for theColonies stated that he would be content if theCabinet authorised the Governor of Hong-Kong topurchase only 300 chests (instead of 480), andthat  these should be made to suffice until theend of 1928.   After a discussion, the Cabinet-agreed - (a) That the request of the governor of Hong-Kong for authority topurchase Persian opium for thepurpose of continuing the supplyof cheap Government brands shouldnot be granted:(b) That the Colonial Office,  inconsultation with the ForeignOffice and the Home Office, should prepare a draft Memorandum,addressed, to the League of Nations .setting forth the difficulties experienced by the Government in&quot;&quot;controlling the traffic in opium&apos;/and inviting, the League to send aCommission to the East to examinethe problem on the spot.
HOURS OONVET-I-TTOU.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(27),  Oon-conclusion 2.)12. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandumby the Minister of labour on the sxibject of theWashington Hours Convention (Paper C.P.-285 (27))In his Memorandum the Minister of Labour called attention to the great opposition he had experi-experienced at the hands of the employers and theobloquy unfairly thrown on the Government bytheir action.    An opportunity for a fresh startmight arise in January owing to the action ofthe French, who may bring up a proposal to revise the existins: Hours Convention in 1930.    In his view the next step in this matter should be for him. to suggest both to the Employers&apos; confederation-tion and to the Trade Union Congress general council that, with the Government&apos;s co-operation,they should unit^ to consider what was the policyin relation to the ^ours Convention that was most likely both to fit British industry and tohelp it by ensuring some effective international action which would brine other countries more into line with this country.    The Minister ofLabour suggested that the Employers should beinformed that the Government is prepared to insist that in some way or other the question of theWashington Hours Convention must be settled,and that it accepts the position that, if a new draft Convention satisfactory to this countryis the result of further discussions at Geneva,Hours legislation will have to be undertaken atsome time in the future to give effect to its provisions. &apos;/&quot;The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour should beau tb or is ed t. o]^ o o-n t imi o-no g o t ia t ing   1wi-th Fmployoro and Trod-&apos;:&apos; Union loadersW4?4^r-^r-^&apos;3re;&apos;ff-&quot;t0&apos;-a 8Qii!^:**g-iT&quot;^^
13 -The Cabinet bad before their a Memorandum bythe Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries on thesubject of the Albany Street Estate (Paper C.P.-S79 (27)).    The Memorandum stated that, inpursuance of the decision of the Cabinet reached at the meeting mentioned in the margin, theCommissioners of Crown Lands had approached theLondon County Council in order to ascertain whether they would be willing to purchase atleast a portion of the Albany Stree  Estate witha view to car?rying out a housing scheme there.The Council, however, were so fully occupied with other housing schemes which in their opinionwere morse urgent, that they were not prepared atthe present time to entertain the proposal.    TheCommissioners thereupon endeavoured to persuade the prospective purchasers, introduced by SirHoward Frank, to bind themselves to undertake the provision of accommodation for at least two-thirds of the present working-class population,but without success.   The Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries considered that the right policy was to take no further action for the present,and he had informed Sir Howard Frank that theinstructions given to him to find a purchaserw ere wit hd rawn.The Cabinet took note of theaction taken by the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries ,

BEAM WIRELESS 15. The Prime Minister drew the attention ofAND GABLESERVICES. his colleagues to a Memorandum (unnumber-d) which(Previous he had received from the Postmaster-general reference:Cabinet 40 setting; forth the altered position of the Cable(24),  Con-clusion 12.) Companies sine&quot; the introduction of the four* Bear wireless services between the United Kingdomand Australia, Canada, India and South Africa.Heavy losses had fallen upon the Cable Companies,and as the Beam services became known and more efficient,  the cable losses would be proportion-ately increased.    The Committee of ImperialDefence had recently approved a Raport advocatingthe retention,  even on the main routes served by the Beam, of some at any rate of the cablesfor strategic purposes.    The Postmaster-General -suggested that a Cabinet Committee should be set .up to consider the whole question, which was o..oof immediate urgency.The Cabinet agreed  That a Committee, composed of -The Secretary of State for Scotland(Chairman),The Secretary of State- for Air(or his representative)-The Postmaster-General.The Acting Secretary of State for .the Colonies,The Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs,The Financial Secretary to theTreasury,should examine the situation whichhas arisen as a result of the corn-petition with the Cable companies of the Beam Wireless Services andreport to the Cabinet on the policy to be adopted by the Government inregard to the matter.
