THE reduction and LIMITATIONOP NAVALI^IRMAMENTS.The geneva conference.[previous reference:Cabinet 41(27), Con-elusion 1. )1.   The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating, to the proceedings at the geneva Conference on the subject o;f Reduction and limitation of Naval Armaments, and more particularly to the questi on of Cruiser construction:-A Note circulated by the Secretaryrecording the results of a meeting between the Cabinet Conmittee and&apos;the First Lord of the .Admiraltryand Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, who are Delegates tothe Geneva Conference (Pa-oer CP. -211 (27)):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState foi India, (who was unable tobe present) setting forth his vie&apos; s(Paper CP.-210 (27)).In the course of the Meeting the Prime minister informed the Cabinet of the views of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, which Mr Amery had communicated to him in writing before leaving onhis tour of the Dominions.At the outset the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs drew attention to telegrams fromSir E. Howard (Washington) Nos. 341 and 343, ofJuly 21st, indicating a less optimistic attitude in Washington in regard to the prospects ofagreement on the Cruiser question.The Secretary of State for B^oreign affairs then made a statement to the Cabinet in regard tothe Meeting of the Cabinet Committee, which had resulted in fining down the issue before theCabinet to the two alternative proposals setforth in CP. -211 (27),The Lord&quot; Privy Seal informed his colleagassthat, at the request of the First Lord of theAdmiralty, he had- discussed the whole question that morning at the Admiralty with the Delegates..:
to the Geneva Conference of Australia, New Zealand(including Admiral of the Fleet Earl Jellicoe)and South Africa.    The Delegates of Canada am the Irish Free State had not been present.    Those-present had been definitely opposed to the policy set forth in the first alternative, and were-unanimously of opinion that the only course was tocontinue negotiations on the basis of the schemedrawn up by the &quot;junion naval experts&quot;, commonlyknown as the &quot;Japanese scheme&quot;.The general view of the Cabinet was that thefirst alternative presented by the Cabinet Committee(Paper CP.-ail (27)) was not likely to prove acceptable to the Delegates of the United Statesof America or of Japan, and that to propose itwould result in bringing the Conference to an end.Discussion therefore focussed mainly on thesecond alternative, which involved a continuation of the discussions on the basis of the &quot;Japanesescheme&quot;, subject to a &apos; comprehensive statement of the policy we should have preferredin regard to limitation of all forms of naval arma-ments, and a caveat to make clear that the &quot;Japanese,scheme&quot;, so far as it related to the smaller Cruisers ,could be accepted only as a modus vivendi for thenext few years , without committing us to anyprinciple and without prejudice to our complete freedom of action after the expiration of the present agreement.Some members of the Cabinet felt the greatest-reluctance to adopt the second alternative andpreferred the first alternative.    Various suggestions were made as to the form in which the second
alternative should he presented, and the lengthof the period for which it should operate (e.g. ,the period covered by our present programme ofcruiser construction, instead of until 1936), andas to the number of Cruisers to be included in the programmes.    The Lord President of the Councilcontributed the draft statement of policy in theAppendix as applicable to either alternativesuggested by the Cabinet Committee , the last para-graph (left blank) to be completed in accordancewith the course actually adopted.The First Lord of the Admiralty stated thathe had instructed his Department to advise what modifications would be required in the &quot;Japanesescheme&quot; to bring it into conformity with theindispensable requirements of Imperial Defence,and undertook to report these to the next Meeting;of the Cabinet Committee.The Delegates to the Conference insisted onthe importance of their early return to Geneva,f I   After a discussion in which every memberipresent expressed his view, the Cabinet decided  (a) That their general policy at the geneva Conference should be basedon the second alternative presented,by the Cabinet Committee in CP.-211(27) , namely, that negotiations shouldbe continued on the basis of theso-called &quot;Japanese scheme&quot;, but should be accompanied by a declarationof the policy we should have preferredon the general lines of the statement in the Appendix, and that a caveatshould be entered at&apos; once , and shouldalso be included in any agreement,to make clear that the programme ofCruiser construction (so far as itrelated to the smaller Cruisers) oouldbe agreed to only, as a modus vivendifor the next few years, without committing us to any principle, andwithout prejudice to our complete freedom of action after the expiration of the agreement:
(b) That the First Lord of the Admiralty-should complete the examination inthe Admiralty of the modificationsrequired in the &quot;Japanese scheme&quot;,and should also prepare , on theabove basis, a draft of instructions for the further guidance of the delegates, for consideration at aMeeting of the Cabinet Committeeto be helcL on Monday, July 25th, at11-*S0 a.m* and subsequently at aMeeting of the Cabinet fixed for p*m. on the same day.Thjfr :%3jk F of &quot;this JVieeting&apos; was altered fromII a. m. to &quot;il-30 a.m. ,as it was found thatthe Lord president of the Council&quot;fead an &apos;*engagement -at a meeting of.the privy council .at -ll -a,m.
THE PRIMEMINISTER&apos; visit to canada.2. The Prime Minister discussed &quot;with hiscolleagues the question whether, in view of theimportant national issues involved in the geneva Conference, it would he advisable for himto postpone his departure for Canada on thefollowing day as the guest of the &quot;canadian government on a visit for which an elaborateprogramme had been arranged.In view of the decision in principlerecorded in the preceding Conclusion, theCabinet felt that it. was not indispensable,nor in the public interest, that the PrimeMinister should postpone his departure.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,July 22, 1927.
APPENDIX.The Conference on Naval Disarmament now sitting atGeneva have discussed many Important points in technicalCommittees and Plenary Conferences, hut no general viewof the problem has as yet &quot;been put forward by any ofthe Governments concerned.    It is not therefore surprising that in some quarters serious misapprehensions haveprevailed as to the aims of His Majestys Government ,which has even been charged with the desire to destroythat equality of sea-power as between the United Statesof America and the British Empire which the washington conference desired to establish; - a suspicion for whichthere is no foundation.The invitation of the President of the United Statesof America to take part in a Disarmament Conference was understood by His Iuajesty!s Government to be based onhis desire to develop the policy of the Washington Confer-ence by diminishing yet further naval expenditure while maintaining national security.   With this two-fold endHis Majesty&apos;s Government are in complete agreement, andthey desire to measure the merits of every proposal bythe degree to which it furthers this two-fold end.    It ison this principle that they have proposed to diminish the size and armament of battle ships, while leavingunaltered the numbers fixed at Washington.    It is forthis reason also that they suggest limitation in thenumber and armament of large fighting Cruisers on principles similar to those adopted at Washington forbattle ships.    This proposal, like the first,&quot;would greatly diminish national expenditure without endangeringnational safety.The questions connected with, small Cruisers are of amore complicated character.    The strength of fightingships and of fleets composed of fighting ships can be stated in figures and compared with precision.    their primary function is to fight each other, and, speakingbroadly, they can easily be compared with each other.No such simple way of looking at the subject is possiblein the case of small Cruisers employed for police&apos; purposes in times of peace&apos;, and for protecting lines of communication-tion In time -of war.    Geographical considerations cannotbe rationally ignored.    It can hardly be denied that such vessels are of more vital necessity to an Empire, whosewidely scattered parts are divided from each other by seasand oceans, than to one which is essentially continental;to an Empire whose most populous parts are dependent fortheir daily bread on seaborne trade, than to one which isself-supporting and self-contained;   to an Empire whichwould perish if it failed to protect its external trade,than to one for whom external trade, however important,was not a matter of life&apos; and death.    A limitation of light cruisers on the lines appropriate to large fighting ships would doubtless give equal financial relief to ail thenations concerned, but would it leave them in the enjoyment of an equal measure of security?It has to be noted further that the sea routes onwhich Britain depends for her existence lie largely in
narrow waters bordered by other States.      This is notthe case with America, whose most important lines ofcommunication lie either on land within her ownfrontiers, &quot;by sea along her own coasts,  or in thegreat oceans.      These circumstances received due consideration at Washington in 1322 and have notlost any of their importance.      But it is hardlynecessary to say that H.ivI.G.,  while urging thespecial difficulties due to Britain&apos;s geographical position, are far from claiming the least right to dictate any small Cruiser policy to other Powers.They accept the general principles which, as theyunderstand them, underly the President&apos;s policy that no maritime power should maintain a largernavy than is required for its own security.    . Totranslate this into figures is, for the reasonsalready t?iven, far more difficult in the case ofsmall crdisers than in the case of the largertypes of surface vessels.     A fixed and quasi-permanent formula will not be easy to devise,  andit would be regrettable that its further considera-tion should delay the valuable agreements whichare within our reach, and we think that a provisional arrangement on the following basismight not be unacceptable(Here follows the &quot;Japanese Scheme&quot; withnecessary modifications and the Balfour&quot;Caveat&quot;.)A. o Jo B*4, Carlton Gardens,July  22nd,  1927.
