He explainedthat he had not intended by this to rule outconsideration at some earlier date.   He under-stood that the War Office and India Office werediscussing the question of the capitation rate,and he saw no reason why, if It should proveconvenient, the question of the continuance ofthe subsidy should not be reopened in connectionwith these discussions, as it would be a great advantage if the Departments could reach agreement.The Secretary of State for India expressed his concurrence in the Lord Chancellor&apos;s view.--- a       ,,      - ^The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whileregretting that the Award had gone against theTreasury view, expressed the hope that theSecretary of State for India would withdraw any objections he felt to the settlement of other questions by arbitration.The Secretary of State for War suggestedthat the matter of the capitation grant was alsoa suitably subject for arbitration, as it had -been in dispute for some years.The ^Secretary of Stats for India said he was always willing to submit any matter to arbitration-9-
