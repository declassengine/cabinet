3 ft 9EGYPT.Draft Treatyof Alliance.(Prevj previous reference:Cabinet 54(27),  Con-elusion 1. )2.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of the Draft Treaty of alliance between Great Britain and Egypt:-A Report bv the Chiefs of Staff,(Paper CP.-272  (27 ) ):A Note by the First Lord&quot;of theAdmiralty,  covering a Memorandumby the First Sea Lord,: (Paper CP.-271  (27 )):A Note by the Secretary of Statefor War,  covering a Memorandum bythe Chief of the Imperial GeneralStaff,(Paper CP.-274  (27) ):A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War,&quot;(Paper CP. 275  (27) ).Inasmuch as some members of the Cabinet hadnot heard the discussions at the Egyptian Commit-tse, the Prime Minister invited the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs to make a full statement on the negotiations which had led up to the draft treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Egypt(Paper CP.-267  (27) ).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsprefaced his statement by informing the Cabinetthat his Private Secretary had seen Sarwat Pashain Paris and it had been agreed to alter Annexe 1  (aby substituting &quot;with their present functions&quot;for &quot;on the terms&quot; in this paragraph.     On thequestion of barrack accommodation Sarwat Pashawas prepared to provide in the Canal Zone the equivalent of what we at present occupy, and he(Sir Austen Chamberlain) asked for authority tosettle the clause in that sense.      Sarwat Pasha hadresisted all attempts to persuade him to agree toa definite limitation of the number of theEgyptian Army, on the ground that such an arrange-ment was without parallel in any Treaty of
Alliance and would make it impossible for him toput the Treaty through.      In the clause dealingwith the League of Nations it was agreed that   -the Egyptian Government would conform to therequirements of the League when applying for membership.      According to the League procedurecertain questions would be put to the EgyptimGovernment which would, for example, involve the definition of Egyptian boundaries as not includingSudan, and an examination of the extent of Egypt&apos;military force.      The matter would be reviewed bythe Permanent Advisory Committee, and attentioncould there be called to any improper attempt toincrease military preparations.      In all the fore-going respects Sarwat Pasha was prepared to meetthe British Government and to make the Treaty,  soamended, his own, and to do all in his power tocarry it though the Egyptian Parliament.      He had secured the approval of King Fuad and the supportof Adly Pasha to the present proposals.Sir Austen Chamberlain, proceeding, urged the Cabinet to give their approval to the draft treaty as marking a great improvement on theposition which had obtained since the end of theGreat War.      An opportunity like the present one was unlikely to recur.      It was true that theTreaty did not meet with a cordial receptionfrom the High Commissioner, who would prefer to take it back to Egypt for consultation with his advisers, but it did provide for certain matterson which the High Commissioner laid the greateststress;    it secured a military alliance and itbarred from the service of the Egyptian Stateforeigners other than British subjects.
In addition, the Treaty laid down our right tomaintain such troops in perpetuity as we deemed necessary for our purposes.      In the event of our being menaced with, or engaged in, war,  in a way which did not directly affect or endanger Egypt, theEgyptian Government undertook to afford us allassistance in their power,  including harbours,waterways,  and communications.      This being so,the fear that it might be possible for the egyptian government to intern British troops on grounds of neutrality had no legal foundation.(At this point the Home Secretaryentered).It was for the Cabinet to consider not whatadditions to the Treaty were ideally desirable,but rather what it had been found possible toget Sarwat Pasha to accept.      There was now an unprecedented opportunity of placing our relationswith Egypt on a footing more permanent and securethan any basis we have had since our first occupa-tion of the country.      He urged the Cabinet to bearin mind the changed conditions since our firstentry into Egypt.     High-handed or overbearingactions were now immediately and effectivelychallenged.     His chief fear about the Draft treaty was that he had put so much pressure on SarwatPasha that the task of securing its acceptancemight prove too heavy for hiira.    Should he succeed,our position would be made stable and the dangerswe -now ran would be diminished.      In his view the risks feared by the Chiefs of Staff in regard tothe Suez Canal would be less, not more, as theresult of substituting an Alliance for the presentambiguous and unsatisfactory position.
The Secretary of State for Home affairs expressed his grave anxiety about the wisdom of concluding the proposed Treaty, and feared theonly result would be a demand for further conces-thesions and/gradual whittling down of our power in Egypt.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that he proposed to say to Sarwat Pashathat, subject to the amendments already referredto, the draft represented our last concession andmust be taken or left.(The Home Secretary withdrew,  inorder to attend to urgent business in the House of Commons).In the course of the discussion which followed,the Draft Treaty was strongly oppos ed on thegrounds of public policy and Imperial defenceset forth in the Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War  (Paper CP.-275  (27)), the Memoran-dum by the Chief of the Imperial General Staff(Paper CP.-274 (27)) and the Memorandum by theChief of the Naval Staff (Paper C.P.-271 (27)).The Cabinet were reminded of the history of thenegotiations in regard to Egypt which had gone onin recent years, and of the further worsening of .the British position which it was argued would follow from the adoption of the proposed Treaty.So recently as July,  1926, the Cabinet had decided to stand firmly on their present positionand not to allow any weakening of our authority in Egypt  (Cabinet 49 (26), Conclusion 1).Considerable anxiety was expressed In regard to clause VII of the Draft Treaty, and especially tothe words &quot;pending the conclusion at some future
&quot;Majesty entrusts His Majesty the King of Egypt&quot;with the task of ensuring this protection&quot;, andthe Foreign Secretary was urged to endeavour toobtain their omission.      Doubt was also thrown onthe ability of Sarwat Pasha to bring about betterpermanent relations between this country andEgynt, as he did not command the support of theNationalist Party.     This Party would only makethe present concessions a ground for fresh demands.The Secretary of State for Air stated that ithad not been thought necessary to present aMemorandum from the Air Staff. Thelp view wasthat the defence of the Canal had been renderedeasier, as compared with the pre-war period, by administrative problems involved in any removalof^e*a* Middle East depot from Alexandria.In reply to some of the criticisms made uponthe Draft Treaty, attention was called to the unfavourable and ambiguous position in whichHis Majestyfs Government had been placed bythe Declaration of 1922.      It was impossible to ignore that Declaration or the probable resultof an appeal to the League of Nations.With reference to the words in Clause VIIto which objection was taken by several membersof the Cabinet, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs undertook to address a despatch to the High Commissioner which would form thebasis of an aide-memoire to Sarwat Pasha.     Inthis despatch, he  (Sir Austen Chamberlain) would the conquest of Palestine.chiefly apprehensive about the expense and7The Air Staff was
repeat what he had already made plain to SarwatPasha, viz., that the words in Clause VIImust not be interpreted as involving any sort of conditional pledge to.withdraw British troops from Egypt at any time.      The hope expressed bySarwat had been that relations between the twocountries would so improve that we should beprepared to treat Egypt with the same confidenceas we treated our Dominions.      In any case Sarwatwas prepared to leave that to the healing effectof time.     The League of Nations would be empower-ed by the Treaty to decide that troops were notrequired in Cairo for maintenance of our communi-cations, but they would, not have the power to order the removal of British troops from Egypt.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Draft Treaty of alliance between Great Britainand Egypt  (Paper CP.-267 (27))subject to -(I) verbal amendments InAnnexe 1  (a) and (d)to be settled betweenthe Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs andSarwat Pasha;- and -(11) the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairsinforming Sarwat Pashathat Clause VII does not contemplate the removal,at any time, of british forces from Egypt.(b) To recommend the adoption of theDraft Treaty to the Governments ofHis Majesty&apos;s Dominions,(c) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to inform SarwatPasha that, subject to the concur-rence of the Dominions, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is prepared to go forward with the Treaty.(The following Ministers asked that theirdissent from the above Conclusions shouldbe placed on record:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary.The Secretary of State for War).7.
3.    The Cabinet were asked by the Chairmanof the Naval Programme Committee  (Lord Birkenhead)to decide a point which had arisen at the Meetingof the Committee on the previous day.     The Commit-tee were agreed that, on grounds of urgency, adecision should be taken to lay down one Cruiserin the financial year 1927-28, but were not agreedwhether the Cruiser should belong to the &quot;A&quot; Class(10,000 tons carrying eight 8-inch guns) or &quot;B&quot;Class (7,500 tons, carrying six 8-Inch guns).The difference in cost was about  230,000.After a discussion the Cabinet agreed  That the Cruiser Programme for 1927should be limited to one Cruiser,and (by a majority) that this Cruisershould&apos;be of the &quot;B&quot; Class.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.November 11, 1927.[he naval construction programme.(previous reference:Cabinet 49(27),  Con-clusion 5(b).)
