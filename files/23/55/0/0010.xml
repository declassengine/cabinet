armament firms.(previous reference:E!.C. 34 (21)Minute 1.)2-    The Prime Minister informed his colleagues that his attention had been drawn to the diffioul-ties of certain armament firms and the risk thatthey might be driven out of business and their resources might no longer be available to theGovernment in an emergency.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should bereferred to a Cabinet committee composed as follows:-The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty(or representative) ,The President of the Board of Trade..-2

The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that on the previous day hehad had his first business conversation withSarwat Pasha.    He had impressed upon Sarwat thedesirability that the relations of Great, Britainand Egypt should be placed on a friendly basis,undisturbed by crises from time to time, and hehad asked him to consider carefully whether itwould not be possible to come to some arrangement;for example, they might begin by regularising theposition of the Egyptian Army.    It was too early as yet to say what the results of the oonversa-tions would be.
REDUCTION and limitation OPNAVAL ARMAMENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(27), Oon-clusion 8.)4r$. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary (Paper CP.-193 (27)) covering thefollowing documents in regard to the proceedingsof the Armaments Conference at Geneva on thesubject of Reduction and Limitation of naval armaments:-An Extract from the Minutes of the228th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence (Appendix i):Copies of telegrams dated July 5,1927, from the &quot;British delegation at Geneva (C.I.D,Paper   No.814-B):Cruisers:    Summary of proceedings at Washington (CI.D. Paper No.815-B):A copy of a Telegram dated July 7,1927, to the British delegation at Geneva (C.I.D. Paper No. 816-B)(Appendix Ii):A Memorandum by Lord Beatty onCruisers (C I.D. Paper No. 818-B):Copies of Telegrams dated July 6thand 7th, 1927,&apos;from the british delegation at Geneva (C.I.D. PaperNo. 819-B).Two Memoranda recording conversations withthe United States Ambassador on July 8thand 11th, together with a letter to the&apos;Ambassador on the subject of the naval conference at Geneva, circulated by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Paper CP.-196 (27) (Appendix III).No comment was made on the telegrams sent to geneva as the result of the 228th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained to the Cabinet that after an interview with the United States Ambassador on July 8th(as recorded in Paper CP.-196 (27), No. l), thePrime Minister had invited him to meet Lord Balfourand Lord Beatty at 6-30 on the^evening of July 8th.After that meeting he had sent a letter to Mr.Houghton (Paper C.P.-196 (27), No.2).   After a
further meeting with the Prime Minister, lord balfour and Lord Beatty, on Monday, July 11th,Sir Austen Chamberlain had had a further conversa-tion with the United States Ambassador, recorded in Paper CP.-196 (27) No. 3).    The result of these conversations had been the following suggestion to the United States Government:-&quot;Instead of endeavouring to fixmaxiBum overhead tonnage for alltime based on theoretical needs and embracing far larger construc-tion than an?/ of the Powers now hadin contemplation, a solution shouldbe sought on lines of an agreement as to the total in each class beyond which each party could not go up to1936, viz., the date of the expira-tion of the Washington Treaty,before which the whole subject must obviously be again considered&quot;.that sir Austen Chamberlain had offered7, if the UnitedStates Government approved this suggestion andwould issue instructions to Mr Gibson (the UnitedStates representative at the Geneva Conference)to seek a solution on these lines, the BritishGovernment would send similar instructions to.Mr Bridgeman.In the course of the disoussion the question was raised as to whether, by agreeing at Geneva tothe total number of cruisers beyond which each party would not go up to 1936, the Cabinet would &apos;.not become committed to a programme of cruiserconstruction beyond that to which they were atpresent committed.    Reference was made to theMinutes of the Cabinet on July 22, 1925 (Cabinet39 (25), Conclusion 3), from which it was estab-lished that the programme at present approved bythe Cabinet did not go beyond the year 1931-32.
Inquiry was also made as to whether thefigures of 70 cruisers and 600,000 tons, whichhad been referred to in the course of the proceed-in gs at Geneva, related to the programme ofcruiser construction approved by the Cabinet in1925 or to some later programme contemplated bythe Admiralty-Doubts were expressed aa to whether, inthe deplorable atmosphere created in the UnitedStates of America by the American Press, theproposals in Paper C.P--196 (27) (Appendix III) ,quoted above,   were likely to produce permanentagreement, and stress was laid on the importanceof adhering to the Cabinet&apos;s original intentionto keep the cruisers divided into two categories,namely, the large 10,000-ton 8-inch gun cruiseron which the Washington ratio of 5-5-3 could beaccepted, and the smaller class of cruiser on which no limitation was placed.It was suggested that all these questions should be re-examined by the Committee of ImperialDefence.Attention was also drawn to the fact that no public use had yet been made of the statementdrawn up by the Committee of Imperial Defence(C.I.D. Paper No. 816-B (Appendix II) , and theCabinet were informed that public opinion In thiscountry was exceedingly ill-informed as to thepolicy of the British Government.    The cabinet were told that the Plenary Meeting, at which thestatement vould probably have &quot;been publicly used by the First Lord of the-Admiraltj- had, for various reasons, been postponed from day to day.
The general view of the Cabinet, was in favourof publishing it in London as soon as possible,if no objection was raised by the Delegation atGeneva.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To take note of the telegrams sentto Geneva as the result of the 228thMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, Minute 2, Conclusions (b)and (c), and CI.D. Paper N0.8I6-B(Appendix II):(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send atelegram to the British delegation at Geneva asking if they had any objection to the publication ofthe statement in Appendix II tothese Minutes:(c) That the Committee of ImperialDefence should meet at once toexamine the latest proposals foran agreement on the question of reduction and limitation of cruisers at Geneva and to reportto the Cabinet on the subjectgenerally, including the effectof these proposals on the cruiserprogramme accepted in principle by the Cabinet on July 22nd, 1925(Cabinet 39 (25), Conclusion 3and CP.-342 (25)).2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,I July 13, 1927.
