EGYPT. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(Previous informed the Cabinet that he had resumed conversa-Ref reference e:Cabinet 52       tions with Sarwat Pasha on the previous Monday.   He(27), Con-cliision 11.)   had begun by saying that he had been rather disappointment -pointed at Sarwat&apos;s first thoughts on his own draft.But before discussing these he v/ould like to knowwhether there was any prospect that, if he and Sarwatreached agreement,  Sarwat could secure acceptanceof its terms by Egypt.    If there were no suchprospect,  Sir Austen Chamberlain thought that itwould be useless and inadvisable to attempt any revision of the draft at this moment.   Sarwat had said that the prospect was, he thought, ratherimproved by Zaghloul&apos;s death. Zaghloul had to someextent been a prisoner of his own Party, and could probably not have helped nuch in securing the accept-ance of a Treaty even if he had desired to do so.On the whole,  therefore,  Sarwat thought the situationrather easier.   He had spoken about the matter ingeneral terms to see of his colleagues and certain important people in Egypt, but with no details, andhe called Sir Austen&apos;s attention to the fact thatthere had been no leakage of information either Inregard to his own draft Treaty or to Sir Austen&apos;scounter draft.    Sarwat expressed himself as confident that if he could reach agreement with Sir austen chamberlain he could carry his colleagues in theCabinet, and, if given time, he thought he would beable to gat it accepted by the Legislature.   He had,however, no powers to sign a Treaty without obtaining the approval of the Egyptian Cabinet.   Sir Austen. . Chamberlain had said that he was in the same    .:position, could not sign a Treaty until he had
secured the agreement of his colleagues and laid it before Parliament.As regards the draft Treaty,- Sir austen chamberlain had made it clear that it was Impossiblefor him to fix a date for removing the troops from cairo.   He could not go beyond a promise to re-examinethe question after ten years, and he had made it clearthat unless by that time the British Government had seen reason to change its view the status quo must continue.   As regards the Sudan, the status quo antewas impossible, and no promise could be given as toa change in its status in the future.   We could not go back on the situation which had followed from&quot;Mr Ramsay MacDonald*s warning to the Egyptians andthe subsequent events leading up to the murder ofSir Lee Stack.    Sarwat, in consequence, had been willing to leave out all mention of the Sudan.Sir Austen had replied that the condominium, asillustrated by the flying of the two Flags, could continue so long as Egypt paid the subsidy.    Insome matters Sir Austen had thought It might bepossible to meet Sarwat, either by omitting particu-lar word3 from the draft Treaty or by giving explana-tions.   He had arranged for discussions betweenSarwat, Sir Cecil Hurst and Mr Murray, in regard todetails and the form of the Treaty which Sarwatmight be able to accept.    That was the presentsituation.    As soon as he had received reports ofthe above conversations the Secretary of state proposed to discuss the matter first with his department and Lord Lloyd, and then to report tothe,&quot;Cabinet Committee.
PORTUGAL 2. The Cabinet had&quot;-&quot;before then, a Note by theThe Anglo- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper C.P.-Portuguese ,Alliance..        255 (27)) covering a Memorandum by the Foreign(Previous Office on the subject of the Anglo-PortugueseReference:Cabinet S3 Alliance, in regard to the question whether the(27), Con-clusion 3.) time has come to re-consider oxir Treaty obligationsP. with Portugal.

Cabinet the names of the Chairman and members of the Commission, whohad been agreed to by Lord Peel, Lord Winterton and himself, and who had acoepte d to serve.    The names of the- representatives of the Labour Party, Lord BIrken-head added, had been approved by the Leader of that party.The Cabinet were given to understand that thePrime Minister had communicated with the Chief Whipon this subject with a view to the necessary Parlia-mentary time being given for the passage of the
legislation, and that the Chief &apos;-&apos;hip had notifiedthe Secretary that morning that he did not wish tobe summoned to the Cabinet in this connection.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary of State for india as set forth above.
SUPPLY and sale OPINTOXICATINGLIQUOR.(Prey! cms reference:Cabinet 11(26),  Con-cTusion 3.)4.   The Gabinet had before them, a Memorandum bythe Pome Secretary (Paper CP,-252 (27)) giving thepresent position in regard to the law relating tothe sale and supply of intoxicating liquor,  and suggesting the appointment of a Royal Commission(if possible, non-partisan) to inquire into thewhole field of&apos; licensing legislation.After some discussion the Cabinet adjournedthe question, in order that the Home Secretary mightobtain further information upon certain aspects ofthe question.
THE REPORT  of the CROWNPROCEEDINGSdOMMITTBB.(previous reference srenc e:Cabinet 24(27), Oon-conclusion 5.)5.

EXPORT OPAERONAUTICALMATERIAL TORUSSIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 30( 27 )    C on-obusion 2.)6.    The Secretary of State for Air consulted theCabinet in regard to an application from a British.armaments firm to build fifty &quot;Gorcock&quot; fighteraeroplanes for the Government of Soviet Russia,This was a type of machine which the Air ministry had rejected.   The machines would be &quot;fighters&quot; andnot &quot;bombers&quot;.    Their range was limited to 100 miles,and they were therefore of defensive rather thanoffensive value, and could form no danger to theBritish Empire either in Afghanistan or elsewhere.The order would take two years to carry out.    Ifrelations should become strained in the intervalmeans could be found for holding up the order.Spare parts, of course, would be obtained in Great -Britain. The Air Staff considered that the fulfilment of this order ought to be sanctioned.The Cabinet agreed that the aboveorder should be sanctioned.
2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,November 2, 1927.-9-TRADE OUTLOOK. 7. The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that, at his usual monthly meeting withhis Advisory Council, the reports of British trade had been rather less discouraging than at recentprevious meetings.
