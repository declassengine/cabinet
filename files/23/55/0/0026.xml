19   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (Paper O^P,-278 (27)) in whichhe proposed that, at the earliest date at whichParliamentary arrangements permitted, resolutionsshould be moved in both Houses for an Addresspraying for the appointment of the two additional judges in the Kingfs Bench Division allowed underthe Judicature Act^ 1910 (now Section 11 of theSupreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act,1925).    The number of puisne Judges of the King&apos;bench Division had again fallen to 15, and a reso-lution for an Address was necessary to authorisethe appointment of two Judges in order to restore the number to 17.    Even with 17 puisne Judgesthere was but scanty,  if any, margin to discharge the current business of the Courts.    The opera-tions of the Supreme Court of Judicature and itsoffices as a whole showed a surplus of revenueover expenditure, even including the salaries ofthe Judges, and in the view of the Lord chancellor the first destination of this surplus should beto afford to litigants as prompt justice as could-reasonably be attained.The Cabinet agreed  .(a) To authorise the Lord Chancellor toarrange that a resolution should be moved&apos; in both Houses of parliament for an Address praying, for theappointment of two additional judges in the EingTs B^nch Division:(b) That every effort should be made totake.the resolution before Christmas.

THE ROYALCOMMISSIONON MININGSUBSIDENCE.(previous reference;Cabinet 18(23), Con-elusion 3(b) .)3.    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (paper c.P.-269 (27)) on the subject of the Report ofthe Royal Oormxission on Mining -Subsidence (Cmd..2899).    In his Memorandum the President of theBoard of Trade stated that it was desirable that consideration should be given to the various recommendations contained In the Report, and,as several Departments -were concerned, he sug-gested that an Inter-Departmental Committeeshould be set up, under the Chairmanship of theSecretary for Mines, consisting Of representa-tives 0&quot;* the Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department, theMinistry of Health, the fcines Department, theScottish Office, and also the Home Office ifthe ^ome Secretary considered this desirable.The Cabinet agreed  That an Inte&apos;---Depart mental Committee,under the Chairmanship of theSecretary for Mines, consisting ofrepresentatives of -The Lord Chancellor&apos;s Department,The Ministry of TTealth,The Mines Department,The Scottish Office -should be set up with the following terms of Reference:-&quot;To consider the recommendations contained in. the second and final report of the Royal Commissionon Mining Subsidence and to advisewhat action, should be taken&quot;.
0 1 f*o lbTHE CONSTTTU-- 4. The Cabinet had before tham a MemorandumTION OPBRITISH by the Acting Secretary of State for the ColoniesGUIANA.(Paper G.P.-270 (27)) on the subject of the need of a new Constitution in the Colony of british guiana and the necessity of early legislation on the subject by the Imperial Government,.   TheMemorandum contained the draft of a Bill to make provision for the Government of British Guianaand its Dependencies, the introduction of whichthe Acting Secretary of State for the Colonieshoped the Cabinet would authorise at a very earlydate in 1928 so that the Royal Assent might beobtained not later than the Easter recess.The Acting Secretary of State for theColonies explained to the Cabinet that successiveColonial Secretaries for many years past hadrealised that the Constitution of British Guianawas one of the worst in the Empire.    It dated fromthe Capitulations, when the territory was taken over fror the Dutch in the Napoleonic Wars.The machinery of government provided no effectivecontinuity either of financial or development -policy.   The Legislature was corrupt, and the.indebtedness  of the Colony was steadily increas-ing.    Governors had repeatedly pressed that something should be done, and the recent Parlia-mentary Co&quot; mission had reported that progress was impossible without Constitutional change.The legal advisers of the Colonial Office were&quot;of opinion that such charge could only be broughtabout by an Imperial Act.    It was therefore proposed to ask Parliament to grant powers whichwould place British Guiana on the same basis asthe Gold Coast and oth^r Colonies.    Opposition.
was to be expected from the elected members ofthe existing native Government in British Guiana.Speaking from personal experience of the Colony,the First Commissioner of Works and the Attorney-General strongly supported the proposed change.The Cabinet agreed -To authorise the introduction next session of a Bill to make provisionfor the Government of British Guianaand its Dependencieson the lines ofthe dra^t Bill set out at the end of paper C.P.-270 (27).- $h
5. At the suggestion of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs the Cabinet took advantageof the presence of the Acting Secretary of Statefor the Colonies  to hear a short statement ofthe position of the negotiations which had been going on with King Feisal and his Ministers.The Acting Secretary of State for theColonies, having acknowledged the very great assistance he had received in the conduct ofthe negotiations from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs in the absence of theSecretary of State for the Colonies, stated that two very important points had been raised inthe conversations.   King Feisal and his Ministerswished to move further than His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were willing in the direction of greater freedom from the advice given through our High Commissioner.   We had urged that curadvice was essential in view of our rssponsibllitto the League of Nations and to the world.   Wewere held responsible for what went on in Iraq.Our relations, while they were defined in theform of a Treaty, were nevertheless regarded asin the nature of a Mandate, and, that being so,we could not evade our responsibility but mustoffer advice and insist on its being taken.The second important point related to defence.We had been trying to arrange a formula with king Faisal which would be acceptable to theIraq Government, on the one hand, and, on theother, would neither disturb the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer nor raise opposition in the british parliament.   The main issue revolved round theannouncement we had made that next year Iraq
crust take full responsibility ibi lit;,  in principle for external and internal defence.    The result ofour declaration had- &quot;been that Feisal had deter-mined on a policy of conscription and the raising of a large army.   This step had been very unpopu-lar am one the Kurds,        the tribes of theEuphrates, and others, but Feisal insisted that conscription was essential if ha were to beresponsible for defence.   The Cabinet would realise that, until Iraq became a member of theLeague of Nations and we were released from ourmandatory position and the conditions in regardto minorities were fulfilled, we should beregarded by the world as responsible for the external defence of Iraq.    As long as the british air Force was there,  any external aggression against Iraq would be certain to involve that force.    Negotiations were proceeding with king feisal with, a view to discovering a formula which,would define our respective responsibilities ona satisfactory basis.The Chancellor of the Exchequer emphasized theimportance of not committing the British Covern-roent to the defence of Iraq.In view of possibledangers, for example, from Turkey and Russia,which could not now be foreseen, we should takecare not to undertake obligations which we mightbe quite unable to discharge.In the course of the discussion it was explained that all Departments concerned, includ-ing the Treasury, were acting in close so-operation,and before any final decision was reached thesubject would again come before the Cabinet,
