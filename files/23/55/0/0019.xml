gGYPT.previous reference:Cabinet 48(27), Con-elusion 2. )1. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a short summary of his negotia-tions with Sarwat Pasha.    After the Meeting ofthe Cabinet on July 28th (Cabinet.45 (27), Con-clusion 2) he had communicated the draft Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of Alliance and Friendship, inthe form accepted by the Cabinet,, to Sarwat, whohad taken the matter very1 seriously withoutexpressing any approval of the draft.    This had given Sir Austen Chamberlain an opportunity to tellSar*.?rat Pasha that the Cabinet had approved thedraft Treaty In the form in which he had handedit to him, but not in any other form.    He had also been able to explain to Sarwat that thesituation was not a particularly easy one, and to emphasize that there were many people., includingstrong supporters of the Government (as illustrated by the attitude of the &quot;Morning Post&quot;) who wouldbe glad to see a breakdown of the present negatia-tions, in the hope that this would lead, sooner or later, to incidents in Egypt resulting in the disappearance of th- present Constitution and parliament.    Sir Austen Chamberlain was satisfiedthat Sarwat personally wished to make an Agreement,though he had said that he could not accept thedraft Treaty in Its present form.    Sarwat had,however, expressed his intention of returning inOctober to discuss the matter further. &apos; News hadhow been received of the death of Zagloul.    Itwas-difficult as yet to forecast the effect ofthis on the policy of the Wafd.A suggestion was made that Lord Lloyd shouldbe. invited to attend a Meeting of the Cabinet and tt-1-
express his views &quot;before his departure for. egypt in the autumn.    The Prime minister r said that itwould be premature to take a decision on thispoint at present.    It would be considered inOctober in the light of the situation then exist-ing, when Sarwat Pasha might have returned toLondon and the effects of the death of Zagloulcould better be estimated.
CHINA-Reduction ofBritish Forcesin the FarH&amp;St.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(27) , Oon-conclusion 3.)2.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (Paper 0. P. -225 (27)) covering a Note by the General Staffon the reduction of British forces in the far east.    In this Note the General Staff expressedthe vie-   that neither the security of Wei-hai-Y/einor the withdrawal of the Marine Battalion affects the recommendations previously put forward, and asked authority to withdraw 5 Infantry Battalions,one Field Artillery Brigade, and such portions of the Divisional troops, Transport Company andother adnrinistrative services,as are not requiredfor domestic purposes.    They also requestedauthority to reduce and re-organise staffsconsequent on the proposed reduction of the Forceand to use the S.S.  &quot;HEKE^INIUS&quot; for the conversanceof the troops which are to be withdrawn.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had always felt some doubts as towhether the force originally sent to China was notexcessive, but the Government had acted on military advice which they could hardly haverejected.   He was far from satisfied that the risk to which        Shanghai was in future likely to be exposed was liimited to mob violence.    The tide ofwar was always likely to flow towards Shanghaiowing to its value from a revenue point of view.The risk of one (Siinese army pursuing another to shangai, which had led to the despatch of the shanghai Defence Force, was still present, and itwas necessury that the garrison should be large enough to hold the perimeter of the internationalsettlement and at the same time to deal with mob  .
violence.    He could only accept the proposals ofthe Secretary of State for War on the understandingthat the force regaining at Shanghai was regarded by the military authorities as sufficient for bothpurposes.    He would prefer that the Company it was proposed to maintain for the present at Wei-hai-Weishould be drawn from Shanghai rather than fromPeking or Tientsin, where he would prefer thatthe Battalions should remain intact, but he was prepared to accept the proposal of the Secretaryof State for War to leave the matter to the GeneralOfficer Commanding in China.The First Lord of the Admiralty pressed forthe withdrawal of the Battalion   of Royal Marinesin China, as the absence of these men had seriouslydislocated the training and drafting arrangements of this Corps.After discussion the Cabinet agreedCa) That the proposals of the Secretaryof State for War for the withdrawal from China of 5 Infantry Battalions,1 Field Artillery Brigade , and suchportions of the Divisional troops,transport company and other admlnis-trative services as are not requiredfor domestic purposes,- as well as for a consequential reduction andre-organisation of the Staffs, shouldbe approved, subject to the under-standing that no troops would betaken from Shanghai before the middleof. October without prior replacement:(b) That, having regard to the changed situation in China and more particu-larly to the disappearance, for thepresent,- at an;/ rate, of any imminentprobability of the occupation ofTientsin and Peking by the nationalist forces,- the pronosal of the Secretaryof State for&apos;War that the S. S.   &quot;HSFMINIUS&quot;should be used for the conveyance ofthe troops to be withdrawn should be approved, notwithstanding that thiswould leave only one transport    (viz.the S.S. .nASSAYE&quot; , capable of trans-port jng approxiiately one Battalion-   at a time) immediately available forthe transport of troops from one part of China to another:
(c) That, for similar reasons, theBritish Battalion now at Wei-hai-Weishould he withdrawn, and that thegarrison should, for the present, &quot;belimited to a slnc-le Company of infantry.    The question of which of the Battalions now in China should supply this Company shouldbe left to        General Duncan:(d) That the First Lord of the admiralty should have authority to arrangefor the inmediate withdrawal of halfthe Battalion of Royal MariES nowin China, and for the withdrawal ofthe second half Battalion towardsthe end of the year.    If the FirstLord should find that the withdrawalof the Battalion in two sectionsis impracticable, he should refer to the Prime Minister or ActingPrime Minister, who should decide the question with such of hiscolleagues as might be available:(e) That, in view of the statement madein the House of Commons by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs(with the authority of the Admiralty)on July 13, 1927, that&quot;provided circumstances remain as at present, it is intendedto maintain a substantialforce&quot;at Hankow during thewinter ya Cruiser should be maintained atthat port during the period of lowriver on the Yarigtse in preference to the plan suggested by the Chiefof the Naval Staff (in order to avoidimmobilising a Cruiser) for providingprotection at Hankow, by me axis of destroyers and Gunboats, with a landing-pa. rty kept normally on boardhulks:(f) That     the First Lord of the admiralty should draw the attention of theNaval Conmand-r-in-Chief, ChinaStation, to telegram No. 513, ofAugust 23rd, from the Secretaryof &quot;State for Foreign Affairs tothe British Minister at Peking, andshould direct Admiral Sir ReginaldTyrwhitt to communicate to Sir miles lampson his views on the proposals contained therein for the enlistment of a special International police force organised and equipped on military &quot;lines and administered% ^---;---Parliamentary Debates.

fllUA. 3.    The Cabinet had before them Memoranda bythe Foreign Office (Paper CP. 226 (27)), theitish Treasury (Paper CP. 227 (27)) and the Office of^cessionskorks (Paper CP. 228 (27)) on the subject of Crown Leases in British Concessions in China;previousjferenee : together with a Memorandum circulated by theMnet 17ji), Con- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Paper CP.ision 3 ).15 (27)) explaining the rights of British subjects in China (a) in Treaty ports, and (b) in Conces-sions.The view taken by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs was that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should grant perpetual titles tothe Crown Leasees of Tientsin before the conclusionof the Agreement there.      The Treasury and theOffice of works took a different view and considered that the ease had not been establised for a complete sacrifice of the Britishtaxpayers&apos;  interest in the Concessions.      the interested Ministers proposed andThe Cabinet agreed ; That the Secretary of State forScotland should be invited toarbitrate between the views ofthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,  on the one hand,  and theChancellor of the Exchequer andthe Firkt Commissioner of Workson.the other.
4.    The Cabinet had before them a memorandum bythe War Office,  prepared on the instructions ofthe Secretary of State for War, on the subject ofthe reduction of the ,&amp;armies of Occupation on the rhine  (Paper CP.  224 (27)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that at the Locarno Confer-ence no formal decision had been taken in regardto the reduction of the armies of occupation, but . Briand had intimated that the natural results-&apos;rould follow from the adoption of the Locarnopolicy.      In the course of one of the conversationsthat had taken place outside the formal Conferenceat Locarno,  one of the German representatives had asked that the evacuation of the Cologne area should not result in an increase in the allied forces in the other occupied areas.      M. Eriandhad observed that no reasonable person could contemplate such an eventuality.      l&quot;n the  .December following the Locarno Conference theConference of Ambassadors in Paris had addressed a letter to the German Government in which theyhad undertaken that there should be a  &apos;sensible&apos;reduction in the troops of occupation with special regard to the hardships of billeting and accommodation&quot;, and had promised that the garrison of the occupied territory should approach&quot;normal figures,&quot;:.      The German had wished to interpret &quot;normal&quot; figures as implying a garrisonnot exceeding what Germany had maintained inthe occupied&apos;areas before the War, but, in viewof the totally different circumstances, sir austen.Chamberlain had felt unable to accept this view.     At present, however, the numbers ofthe armies of occupation in the Rhine land werein excess, not of the total numbers in the occupied
territories before the withdrawal from Cologne,but (by some 2,000 men) of the numberspreviously maintained in the areas still occupied;that is to say, the French had not reduced their numbers in the second and third areas sufficiently to compensate for the numbers brought into these areas by the British and Belgians from the fit st(Cologne) area.      It had not been possible to makemuch progress with this question during the last meeting of the Council of the League of Nations,owing to 1:1. Briand rs serious indisposition.Subsequently       Poincare had made two speecheswhich aid not advance matters.      The French Govern-ment had then stated that the minimum number towhich they were prepared to reduce the garrisonwas 60,000, as compared with the present garrison of approximately 70,000.      They proposed themselvesto reduce their army of 56,500 by 5,000,  the.remaining 5,000 coming from the comparatively.small British and 3elgian contingents of 7,300 and,300 respectively.      Sir ^usten Chamberlainhad then expressed the strongest disappointmentto M. Briand at this meagre proposal..    A reply hadbeen received to the effect that i-i. Briand was much distressed, but that he had encountered thegreatest difficulty with the French Cabinet andthat he was about to approach his  colleagues again on the subject.      Sir Austen Chamberlain felt that,unless a total reduction of at least 10,000 men could be made    the Allies would not have kept faithwith&quot; the Germans.The Cabinet were informed that the FrenchGovernment regarded their army of occupation not..
Bolely as a sanction for the enforcement of theTreaty, hut still more from the point of view of security.    They apprehended the danger of attack by the Germans, and in that eventuality consid-ered a French army of 50,000 men as the minimumessential to hold the bridgeheads pending the arrival of a number of Army Corps from france to secure the position.After some further discussion, both onthe question of the reduction in the AlliedArmy 0*- Occupation, the proper incidence of thereduction between the three Powers, and the consequential financial adjustments between theWar Office Votes and the Treasury, the cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send thefollowing telegram to the british ambassador in Paris:-a&quot;Bis Majesty&apos;s Government areof opinion that a reduction of10,000 in the combined armies ofoccupation is the least that can .be held to be a fulfilment of theundertaking given by the Ambassadors1Conference and they are glad to note that the French Government accepts the possibility of suoh a reductionin principle.His Majesty&quot; s Government areprepared to make in the small british force of 7,300 a reductionin proportion to the total reduc-tion of 10,000 provided that theFrench and Belgian Goverriiiehtswill make the same proportionatereduction in their armies ofoccupation..The present numbers as presentedb-. the French beingFrance 56,500Great Britain 7,300Belgium ; 6,300the execution of this policy wouldrequire a reduction of
8,050 In the French force900 in the Belgian1,050 in the British.His :vlajestjr&apos;s Government earnestlyhope that this proposal will beaccepted by the French and belgian governments.11(b) That, if the French Governmentcould not be induced to accept this proposal, the respectiveshares of any smaller reductionsagreed to should at any rate beproportionate to the size of the basic numbers:(c) That the question of the domesticincidence of the cost of anyreductions should be considered in connection with the Army ulsti-mates, and that the presentdiscussion should be regardedas without prejudice to thisquestion.
THE naval construction programme.(previous reference cabinet 48(27), Con-elusion l(e).)5. After a statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer, in the course of which Mr Churchillemphasized the intention announced by the Japaneserepresentative   at the Geneva Conference not to lay down any Cruisers additional&apos;to theirannounced programme before 1936, and the backwardposition of the United States of America in regardto Cruiser construction, and a short discussion,the Cabinet agreed  (a) That a Cabinet Committee should beset up within the next few weeks to review the- programme of naval construction in the light of thesituation disclosed at the recentGeneva Conference on Reduction and limitation of Naval Armaments, notwith a view to an alteration in thegeneral policy already announced to Parliament, but in order toascertain what re-adjustments shouldbe made in that policy in the presentand prospective situation:(b) That the measures to be taken inregard to H.M. S. DORSETSHIRE (onthe construction of which as an*An Class Cruiser commitmentsamounting to some hundreds of thousands of pounds have been entered Into   and with whichimportant questions of dockyardlabour are connected) should bediscussed and, if possible, settled by the First Lord of the admiralty and the Chancellor of the Exchequer.In the event of their being unableto reach agreement, the question should be referred to the cabinet for decision.
MENIAN 6.    The Secretary of State for ForeignFUG-EES ,Affairs drew attention to proposals made byDr. Nansen for the settlement of Armenianrefugees on land being irrigated by the soviet republic of Erivan -hieh had formed thesubject of correspondence between the ForeignOffice and the Treasury.      Sir- Austen Chamberlainemphasised that the Powers had not behavedwell towards the Armenian refugees, andrecalled that the Prime nini- ter, when in opposition, had joined with Lord Oxford inan appeal on the subject to Mr. RamsayxitacDonald, who was at the time PrimeMinister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who hadnot received warning  that the subject  was tobe raised, undertook to study the question and to communicate with the Foreign Secretary.%itehall Gardens, 8 .W.1.!5th.
