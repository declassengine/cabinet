REDUCTION and limitation OPNAVAL ARMAMENTS.The GenevaOonferenoe.(PreviousEeferenoe:Cabinet 46(27).)The Cabinet had before then; the following telegrams:-Nos.  218, 219, 223, 224, 225 and226 L. N8 , from the British Delega-tion at Geneva:Nos. 367, 370 and 371 from Washington;No.  359 to Washington.All these telegrams are reproduced in Appendix I.There was general agreement that the telegram sent by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to Washington (No. 359 - appendix i, No. 8) provided an admirable statement of theBritish attitude towards the question of Limitationof Armaments, and should be used by the british delegation at Geneva in their final statement inPlenary Session in the event of a breakdown ofthe Conference.Attention was directed first to telegramNo. 219 (Appendix I, No.2) containing the text of a political clause suggested by Mr Dulles, of .the American Delegation, providing that if any .Contracting Power was dissatisfied with the utilisation by any other Contracting Power of itstonnage allocation, the former Power should havethe right to summon a Conference of the parties tothe Treaty, and that,if no agreement was reached at such a Conference, any of the contractingparties could terminate the Convention.    Therewas general agreement that this clause wasaltogether unacceptable.-Attention was then directed to an alterna-tive draft to Mr Dulles1 clause, submitted by theBritish Delegation in telegram No. 224 L. N.(Appendix I, No.4).
The First Sea Lord, in reply to a question,stated that even this modification of the Dullesformula would be open to the objection that, if at any point the United States decided to call anew Conference and to embark on&quot; a programme of8,000-ton 8&quot; Cruisers, any British 6&quot; gun Cruisersbuilt in the interval would become obsolete, sothat the money spent on them would have been to agreat extent wasted.    In reply to a question as towhether he supported the important statement madeby his predecessor (Lord Beatty) to the Cabinet onJuly 26th, Sir Charles Madden replied in the affirmative.In the course of the afternoon session theFirst Sea Lord communicated to the Cabinet thetelegraphic correspondence with Rear-Admiral Poundwhich is reproduced In Appendix II.     He explainedthat the effeot of the American Admiral Jones&apos;suggestion that the 120,000 tons allotted to theUnited States of America in the British proposals should be expended partly in 10,000-ton ships andpartly in smaller ships oarrying 8&quot; guns would only add one or at most two ships to the Americantotal. The telegram sent by Sir Charles Madden(Appendix II, No.2) met with general approval,and the Secretary of Ftate for Foreign Affairs atonce sent a telegram to the British Delegation atGeneva informing them of this.Attention&quot;was next directed to telegram No.226L.N.  (Appendix I, No.6) containing the text of anew pscflLposal made by the Japanese Delegation intheir anxiety to avoid a breakdown of the Confer-ence.   After long deliberation, a modificationof the Japanese proposal was suggested as a basis
9 T* t?for consideration.    The Cabinet felt that thematter was one of such far-reaching importance thatthe Admiralty ought to be given time to form a considered opinion on this new proposal, whichwould be communicated to the Cabinet before they took their deoision.    It was therefore decidedthat , unless the Americans had already rejected the Japanese suggestion without making any counter-proposal, the British Delegation should be instrucir-ed to ask for an adjournment of the Plenary Sessionarranged for the following day at Geneva.Instructions to the British Delegation in oase the americans had already rejected the Japaneseproposal were approved (See conclusion (a) below).The decisions of the Cabinet were as follows:-(a) To approve telegram No- 359 to washington (Appendix I, No. 9) con-taining an exposition, prepared b:/&quot;the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, of the British case at the geneva Conference in regard toReduction and Limitation of naval armaments:(b) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should at oncenotify the British Delegation atGeneva that the Cabinet fullyapproves the First Sea Lord&apos;telegram in reply to Admiral Pound&apos;telegram No. 58 (Appendix II, No. (2)):(c) That the Secretary should oirculatethe proposed modification of theJapanese proposal (Geneva telegramNo.  226 L. N. ), which was drawn up during the meeting of the Cabinet(Appendix III):(d) That the First Sea Lord should beprepared to give the Cabinet a considered opinion on the suggestedmodification of the Japanese proposalat a meeting of the Cabinet to be heldat;&apos;  12 Noon on the following day:(e) That, in order to gain time for the deliberate consideration by the&apos;  Admiralty and the Cabinet of thefar-reaching questions at issue,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should send the following telegram to the British delegation at Geneva:-
August 3, 1927.&quot;Dulles5 formula is, of course,impossible, and even your modifica-tion of it would leave us in thisdilemma that we should meanwhilebe spending large sums on 6&quot; guncruisers which would at once becomeobsolete if at any point Americadecided to call new conference andembark on programme of 0,000 ton 8&quot;cruisers.New Japanese proposal is not altoge-ther dear (e. g. authorised programmeneeds definition), but we are most anxious to act with Japan and toprevent the conference breaking up without any agreement.    We are, therefore,considering what further definitionand modification would render Japaneseproposal possible of acceptance by us,but we require further time for this study.    Cabinet will meet again tomorrowand send you its considered opinion.If, therefore, Americans are preparedto accept new Japanese proposal asbasis of discussion, you should askfor adjournment of plenary session.If,.on the other hand, the Americansrefuse the new Japanese suggestion as a basis for further discussion and make no counter-proposal, you shouldformally make the following proposal.BEGINS.    Even if there is, for thepresent, no apparent prospect of coming to a complete agreement about smallcruisers we think it would be most fortunate if the conference were to separate without arriving at some inter-national arrangements tending to economy.A large measure of agreement has alreadybeen reached with regard to 10,000-toncruisers, flotilla leaders, destroyers and submarines.    It seems clear to HisMajesty&apos;s Government that a similaragreement might easily be reached withregard to battleships.    These results are not all that had been hoped for; .but they are of great value, and itwould be an international misfortuneif they were lost on the present occasion.His Majesty&quot; s Government, sooner than. .    see the conference wholly fail, wouldbe prepared to sign an agreement evenif it embodied only the points on whichprovisional agreement has already beenreached by the three Powers..  E DS.If this again is refused, the cabinet would wish you in plenary session tomake -in suitably modified language oaseset out in my No.359 to Washingtonrepeated to Geneva No.142,as well as tomake full use of the other material withwhich they have supplied, you.&quot;Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1, .  . . -
IMMEDIATE.Following from First Lord.My Immediately following telegram gives text of documents piblished by Americans.      It is a clause whichDulles invented some time ago but which we have neverencouraged.     They produced it again at meeting of delegateson Thursday last when we said that It would be unacceptable;it was however seriously discussed.     Certain papers herehave reproduced it as an agreed clause.     We have taken steps to contradict that.Line I propose to take with press who are showingconsiderable interest is that clause is obviouslyIntended to form a means by which we could agree to eightinch gun in smaller class of cruiser and is therefore not in accordance with our instructions, that It is unsatisfactory inasmuch as It leaves whole position inregard to cruisers In state of uncertainty and would form. a constant encouragement to friction.APPENDIX    I.From   SWITZERLAND.Decypher.

Begins:-&quot;In the event that prior to December 31st, 1936, anyone contracting Power shall consider tonnage allocationin cruiser class has been utilised by any other contract-ing Power in a manner to call for an adjustment of total tonnage allocation of that class such High ContractingParties may at any time subsequent to January 31st, 1931,and upon six months prior notice, convoke a meeting ofPowers Parties to the present treat:/ with a view to ascertaining whether such an adjustment can be made by mutual agreement.     In the event that no agreement Isreached at such a Conference any of the High ContractingParties may give notice of desire to terminate thepresent convention and this notification shall be effective within one year after receipt thereof by other parties to the treaty.     In such an event treaty shallterminate with regard to all Parties thereto&quot;.     Ends.Decode.    His Majesty&apos;s Consul.

IMMEDIATE.Following from First Lord,This telegram replaces my telegram No, 220.My immediately follovfing following telegram contains an alternative to D clause - my telegram No,   219, whichwe should like you to consider.     It is put forward as apossible way of meeting American claim for freedom toarm. cruisers with eight inch guns while preserving to us the right to put an end to agreement if they do so.     Itdoes not therefore involve agreement to eight inch gun.Moreover It imposes on Americans the onus of definitelyasking to raise standard of cruiser guns If they determineon taking that course.     We cannot say whether it wouldbe acceptable to Americans.     Even if it were not Itwould form, good answer to D clause out of which they aremaking capital.-ill-Decypher.

In the event that no agreement Is reached at such a conference any of the highcontracting parties may give notice of his desire to terminate present convention and this notification shallbe effective within one year after receipt thereof byother high contracting parties.     In such an event treaty shall terminate with regard to all high contracting partiesNote:- By articles S and T are meant provisions in/
in treaty permitting a limited number of cruisers of10,000 tons and allowing maintenance of York, Hawkins,Omaha and Furutaka classes with compensating American8 inch cruisers.This article would be completed by a declaration in final act to the effect that whole treaty mustbe regarded as in the nature of a modus Vivendi andmust not be quoted as an admission of principleswhether with regard to total tonnage or calibre of guns or any point referred to In ministerial declarationof July 2j5th.

L.N.STATE *&quot; Following from Mr. Bridgeman.Japanese came to us this morning with proposal con-tained in my Immediately following telegram.     They dis-played great anxiety about danger of a breakdown of theconference.     They had shown plan to Gibson but had got no definite answer though they had been promised one by5 p.m. to-day.Their proposal appears to be a return to old programmeplanned without total tonnage in cruisers and without any reference to limitation of gun till 1931.One and two read together mean that apart from (?12)large cruisers we should be at liberty to go on with ourauthorised programme merely substituting B. cruiserB for A.throughout.Four according to Japanese explanation means that weshould reach agreement on aa many points as possible andthat failing agreement on any points it should be postponedto another conference to be held not later than 1931.Asked about capital ships they said that they agreed with us as to the reduction of size and some extension of life.We said that we were not authorised to agree to their proposal but would, report it to His MajestyTs Government and ask for instructions.     If Americans accept it we feel that.   . Japanese in view of their desire to avoid breakdown wo\ildbe seriously hurt at our refusal.      Plan however means avery long postponement.Six- inch gun (? armament) we should prefer solutionmentioned in my telegrams Nos, 223 and 224.

I asked him if he had heard from Geneva of any suggestion of atemporary agreement in the form of a naval holiday up to1931 such as that mentioned in telegram to Sunday&apos;s &quot;new york. Times&quot; to which he referred yesterday.     He said, no.I ventured to remark that I regretted this, as idea hadappealed to me.     He at once said &quot;it did to me too&quot; herepeated emphatically that United States Government couldnot give way oh gun question and that unless Eis Majesty&apos;sGovernment would recede from their position, which he didnot now expect, there was no hope of a regular agreement.
But an arrangement that would enable us to tide overtill 1931 would be worth trying for as situation might have changed altogether by then.&quot;He promised to let me know about any further developments in Geneva.Addressed to Foreign Office No. 367.Repeated to Geneva.

I told him only yesterday that it seemed to us that  (grp. omd.)s had come to conference with cut and driedproposals in a &quot;take it or lea (,e it&quot;  (gr,omd.) a frame of mind from which they had not moved and I added thatthis did not seem to me to be the way to conduct conferences,which are oalled for discussion and not merely to acceptcertain unalterable proposals.    He replied that had.United States government known that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were going to ask for more than 450,000 tonsof auxiliary craft, which United States government believedhad been agreed at -Yashington,  they would never have issuedinvitation to conference.    To this I replied that it wasa pity that this wds not made clear before invitationwas issued.    I have naturally repeatedly and again thismorning emphasis^ the difference of our needs in cruisers-   xi - /on
on account of difference in geographical political andeconomic circumstances of Great Britain and United States,but it would of ocurse have been useful if I could havebeen informed at the beginning of the British proposals and reasons for them as explained, for instanoe,  in first Lord&apos;e and Lord Jolliooe&apos;8 speeches at last plenarysitting.The Secretary of State is certainly aware of alloffers made by His Majesty&apos;s Government and I have nodoubt that these have been duly communicated to state department by Mr, Gibson.    In any case nearly every move in conference has received publicity in the press.  (R ends)I have no expectations of inducing him&apos;to proposeadjournment unless explanatory epeeohes at final meetingare given up.    In these circumstances as you think thatan adjournment will deceive no one and will not affect -the United States building programme and also do notInstruot me to make any ocmmunioation to Secretary ofState In the sense of your telegram, I merely proposeto tell him tomorrow that you feel that an explanation of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government during theconference, is due to the conference and to Great Britainand other countries of the British Empire.Addressed  to Foreign Office-Nos. 370 and 371.Repeated to Geneva,
(W.7226/61/98.)To UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.Code telegram to Sir E. Howard (Washington).Foreign Office.      2nd August, 1927. 4.15 p,m.No. 559.        (R).Important.Your telegram No.362 (July 30th) and Mr.Chilton&apos;sunnumbered telegram of July 29th,    (Conversation withAssistant Secretary of State).Proposal to adjourn seems to me an expedientwhich will not deceive anyone or affect immediatebuilding programme of United States.      I therefore see no object in proposing it, but if the United Statesput it forward, we could of course accept It after our delegation had had a fair opportunity of explain-ing our proposals as a whole and the reasons why wecannot accept the terms which United States delegationhave sought to dictate to Japanese and ourselves.We have made repeated efforts at  compromise.There has been no response from side of United States.Read again statement made by Chairman of House NavalAppropriation Committee on January 4th referred toin my telegram No.326.     Where has there been through-out whole conference any recognition by American delegation of special position and.special needs ofBritish Empire thus clearly stated by Mr. French?American argument  (as far as they have consented to argue) appears to be as follows.     We claim equal-   -   tonnage with you.     As we do not need small cruisers withHxiii-
six Inch guns for commerce protection such as BritishEmpire does, we shall use our tonnage to build only bigcruisers with biggest permissible gun such as are theproper adjuncts of fighting fleets and incomparablysuperior to your commerce protectors.     We do not needthese in such numbers for security and their constructionwill not promote economy but prestige demands that we buildto parity of tonnage irrespective of need, security orfighting strength.Against this Great Britain accepts President&apos;stwin principles viz, restriction of armament and cost while preserving security.     If America claims to build equal numbers in face of admittedly unequalneeds we have no intention or wish to quarrel with her and we have been prepared to make an agreement upto 1936 which would leave her full liberty to do sothough we are not prepared to admit as an immutableprinciple that parity of numbers where the needs anddangers to be met are quite unequal can result in real equality of sea power.Further whilst a large part of our tonnage mustbe employed on commerce protection we cannot admitby treaty that America (claiming an equal tonnage on grounds of parity without having any real need for it)should use her surplus tonnage to build a greatlysuperior fleet of large heavy gunned cruisers.We have offered the Washington parity incruisers of 10,000 tons and eight inch guns.     America has at most two built and six building.     We have fourteenand have offered to scrap two if America will be content with the figures -12-12-8.     Her experts claimed 25 in a written memorandum which almost bore the character of an ultimatum.     This Is not parity, still less is itrestriction of armaments or cost.Restriction of total tonnage without restriction of
types and classes is meaningless,     It has been by developmentof new types (dreadnought, super-dreadnought, etc.) thatimmense increase of fighting power and cost have come In thepast.     We proposed limits in each class as the surest wayof restricting both armaments and cost.     The americans have insisted on higher limits in every class.     Up to thepresent they have refused even to discuss further limitati onpf size and guns of capital ships.     They have refusedto limit use of eight inch guns.     In provisional agreement on minor classes flotilla leaders, destroyers and submarinesthey have insisted in every case on higher individuallimit than we had proposed.Does the State Department know these facts or hasMr. Kellogg been left as completely in ignorance of them as hewas of the demand of the Americans in the Experts Committeefor twenty-five cruisers of 10,000 tons with eight inch guns?You must realise the strength of our position and therepeated efforts that we have made at conciliation whilst the American delegation has made no advance and everyoneof its proposals has meant greater armaments and more expense.It would be a great mistake to suppose that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recalled the British delegation for consultation because we thought them too unyielding.     Our anxiety was of quite adifferent kind.Confidential,     If the conference breaks down, as now seems certain owing to American intransigeance, I do not anticipate any early change In our present programme of construction whatever the future may have In store for us.Repeated to Geneva No.142, Tokyo No.174, Paris No.193(by bag) and Rome No.212,
APPENDIX Ii.(1) Telegram from Admiral pound to First Sea Lord.50.    Personal for C.N.S*   At the Meeting yesterday-Sunday at which i/ir. Gibson communicated information contained in delegation&apos;s telegram 217, Admiral Jonesasked whether it was intended in paragraph 6 of theBritish proposals communicated in delegation telegram212 that British Empire and U*S.A. should be limitedto 12 ships or whether it wao permissible for the120,000 tons to be expended partly in ships of 10,000smallertons and partly in/ships oarryihg 8-inch guns.     Hewas informed that it was intended that the British Empireand United States should have ma^mum of 12 ships.    Onsupposition that America accepts main principles ofBritish proposals including 6-inch gun, would there be any objection to their having say 8 10,000 cruisers and 5 repeat 5 8,000 ton crmsers instead of 12 10,000ton cruisers.Above question is independent of what 8-inch cruisers they might be allowed in compensation for YORKand HAWKINS....(2) First Sea Lord to Admiral Pound..Your 58.    On the important assumption that Americaaccepts main principles of British proposals including6,000 ton Cruiser and 6&quot; gun I should be prepared to concede that U.S.A. might use the 120,000 tons inthe way . suggested. 1st S.L.
(3 ) Admiral Pound to Fix st Sea Lord.60. First Lord requests you will confirm Cabinet have approved of contents of your telegram 46....(4) First Sea Lord to Admiral Pound.Your 60.      Proposal was not submitted to Cabinetview of the form in which it arrived.      View ofCabinet is now being ascertained and will becommunic ated.
APPENDIX    III.DRAFT TELEGRAM TO GENEVA,FOR CONSIDERATION AT AMEETING OF THE CABINETTO BE HELD ON THURSDAY,AUGUST 4, 1927, at 12 Noon.The Cabinet have considered whether a temporarymodus Vivendi is possible on the basis of the Japaneseproposal whioh would not involve the final abandonment of the principle of the 6&quot; gun, on the eventualadoption of which we still think any real reductionof armaments depends.    The conditions of any suchcompromise dearly are that -1.    It should not last beyond 1931.    ThisIs already provided for in the Japaneseproposal.2.    We should retain the right to completeour existing programme of construction,as approved &quot;by the Cabinet.    It mustbe made clear, therefore, that &quot;authorisedprogramme&quot; bears this meaning.3,    Number of small 8&quot; gun Cruisers must belimited as a separate class.    For thisreason, and also because we cannot admitpossibility of the United States building8&quot; gun Cruisers against our existing 6&quot; ,wording of first paragraph of, Article 3must be modified somewhat as follows:-, &quot;United States to undertake that,at no period belore December 31,1931, her auxiliary naval strengthshall exceed that of British empire in any class of ship defined inthis Agreement&quot;,and Agreement must contain a provisiondefining the class of small 8&quot; gunCruiser &quot;as well as 10,000*-ton 8&quot; class and 6&quot; class.    The definition of thesmall 8&quot; gun Cruiser olass should beon lines approximately similar to &quot;YORK&quot;.I.     On the above basis we do not see any useful purpose would be served by including second paragraph -
of Article 3, and we think this should be omitted.We cannot accept Article 4.    On the contraryjin return for, and as a condition of, this greatandj in our opinion, most unhappy, though in thecircumstances inevitable, concession to theAmerioan demand for Cruisers of large tonnage and heavy calibre of gun, we must ask that americans will oonsent to include in modus Vivendi points inregard to smaller auxiliary vessels (destroyers and Submarines) on which substantial agreement hasalready been reached, and also will consent to limit Capital Ships as proposed by us.The Agreement should be concluded by adeclaration as in the last paragraph of yourtelegram No. 224 L. N.Whitehall Gardens, S.W. 1,August 3, 1927.
