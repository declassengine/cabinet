Government of Russia, such a claim would very likely succeed in the Eritish Courts,   Thewhole of these funds had been supplied by Britishtaxpayers for the purpose of enabling the ImperialRussian Government to carry on the War,    Theyformed part of the assets of the former RussianGovernment, and it was essential that they shouldnot be allowed to fall into Soviet hands, - he asked for the appointment of a Cabinet Committeeto consider what action should be taken.The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(in the Ghcir),The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for India,The President of the Board of Trade,The Attorney-General  bnonld meet to consider the questionof the balances of the former RussianGove.rnm.erj1;., and, in addition, toadvise the&apos;Cabinet as to whether thoSoviet Government, which had been recognised as the de jure.
