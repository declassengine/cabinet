lo   In regard to the request made in theHouse of Commons on the previous day for additional material in connection with the severance of diplomatic relations with SovietRussia, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs informed the Cabinet that in the courseof the forthcoming Debate he proposed to saythat the Government were in possession of alarge mass of material illustrating unfriendlyactivities of Soviet Russia, but that they didnot propose to produce any additional secret information beyond a few documents which he intended to publish before the Debate, and thatthey based their claim to approval of theirpolicy on documents already published.In regard to the general question he proposed to recall the history of the TradingAgreement:    the various protests made against it, for example, Mr Lloyd George&apos;s protestSix -JKvenvt-kswithin felvo &apos;wcmhc of the conclusion of theAgreement, against its violation in many respects;Lord CurzonTs protest of 1923;    his own protestof last February.   He intended to point out that within five weeks of the last protest theSoviet Government were engaged in their oldpractices.    In reply to the suggestion that before breaking off the Government ought tohave discussed the matter further with theSoviet representative, he proposed to point to the futility of discussions after so many protests, and to quote     in
particular the falsehoods of the SovietGovernment in regard to Borodin.     He wouldcharge the Soviet Government with hostileinstructions to their Minister-In Peking, andwith the maintenance of schools of anti-british propaganda at Moscow and Tashkend.      he proposed also to mention the hostility shown to the Leagues of Nations at the recentEconomic Conference at Geneva, as well as their hostility to the Locarno policy.      Inall this he would &quot;base himself on materialalready produced.     Sir Austen Chamberlainproposed also to decline to say how theinformation came in the government&apos;s possession.The Cabinet approved the line which theForeign Secretary proposed to take, and suggested that there would be advantages in not closing the door too definitely tofurther possible disclosures at some future date.
2.    The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the financial aspects of the retentionof the Indian Mixed Brigade of the ShanghaiDefence Force.      In the case of the Britishportion of that Force the cost, apart fromincidental expenses, is only the difference of maintaining them in Shanghai instead ofat their normal stations.      In the case ofthe Indian Mixed Brigade, however, the whole burden falls upon the British tax-payer,and their cost is three or four times as great-as that of the British troopsoThe Cabinet agreed:-(a) That three of the ships whichhad brought to the Far East thelast British Brigade of the shanghai Expeditionary Forceand had not, ye^ started their-homeward voyage,  should be retainedat Hong-Kong for a week or, ifnecessary, longer, in case therapidly changing events in China should render possible thewithdrawal of the Indian MixedBrigadeo(b) That the Cabinet Committee on China(for details See Cabinet 37 (25),Conclusion 2), should meet beforethe next meeting of the Cabinet to.consider (in consultation withthe Chiefs of Staff as required),the following points:-(1) The possible withdrawal ofthe Indian Mixed Brigade;(ii) The effect of recent develop-ments on the Government&apos;policy in regard to Pekingand Tientsin.
REDUCTION and limitation OP&quot;NAVAL ARMA-MENTS.The forthdoroingConference atGeneva.(previous reference:Cabinet SO(37), Con-clusion 3.)3.   The Cabinet had before them draftprovisional Minutes of the 337th Meeting ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence, held onMay 20, 1927, in regard to the forthcoming conference at Geneva with representatives ofthe Governments of the United States of Americaand Japan on the subject of Naval Disarmament.For reasons of secrecy, the particulars of theAdmiralty&apos;s proposals were not printed withthese provisional Minutes (Paper C.P.-159 (37))The First Lord of the Admiralty gave theCabinet full particulars of the Admiralty&apos;sproposals.A short discussion took place in regardto the use of torpedoes from aircraft and the related question of the size of torpedoes,which had been discussed at the recent meetings at Geneva of the League of Nations PreparatoryCommission for the Reduction and Limitation ofArmaments.    The question was shown to be rathercomplicated, and there was general agreement that it would be desirable^ if possible, to omit discussions on the question of the size of torpedoes and their use from aircraft at the&quot;forthcoming Conference.The Cabinet approved the following recommendations of the Committee of ImperialDefence:-(a) The adoption of the Admiralty&apos;sproposals as the basis of theBritish Delegation&apos;s negotia-tions at the forthcoming conference at Geneva, and thatthe British Delegates should begiven a reasonable latitude inregard to details.(b) That the Dominion representatives should be invited to attend a    -
preliminary Conference in london to be held during the week immedi-ately preceding the date fixed forthe Conference at Geneva.-5-y
4.  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby tiie Minister of Health urging that the SecondReading of the Audit (Local Authorities) Billshould be passed this Session, and that theSecond Reading should be taken before Whitsuntide(Paper Ct.Po-160 (27) ) .The Prime Minister stated that he had arranged to discuss with the Chief Whip, the same afternoon the whole of the Parliamentary, pro-gramme,, including the arrangements for the Autumn-Pending this enquiry he could give no positiveundertaking, but he promised to do his best tosecure a Second Reading of the Audit (LocalAuthorities) Bill before Whitsuntide.
