The Home Secretary, as a natter of urgency,brought to the notice of his colleagues thedifficulties he had encountered over the Landlordaxjd Tenant Bill in Grand Committee.    He had met with considerable opposition from a group of conservative Members, but they had offered to cease from all further obstruction if he wouldomit Clause 5 of the Bill, which gives the tribuna.the right, in certain circumstances, to grant a tenant a new lease for suoii period as ix may deemproper, instead of compensation for loss.Sir William Joynson-Hlcks therefore wished toknow whether-sr the Cabinet was willing to omit thisClause.After careful consideration oho Cabinetagroed  That it would &quot;be a mistake to surrender Clause 5 of the landlord and Texoant bill, for which there isconsiderable public support, owingto the opposition of a small group of Members , and that if the HomeSecretary was unable to carry theClause in Committee it should bere-introduced in the Report stage of the Bill.      The Home secretary was authorised, if he thought fit,to warn the opponents of the clause of the Government1 s intention totake the vie&apos;, of the House of commons on this Clause.

After consultation with theGovernor of the Bank of England and a Directorof Basing Brothers &amp; Co. they had. come to theconclusion tnat any proposal to transfer the&quot;balances to the Exchequer (however Justified inequity) must be abandoned, and that the only practical way of preventing the Soviet government from obtaining the balances was the immediate introduction of a Bill on the lines of a. draftwhioh he handed round to the Cabinet.The Cabinet was advised that if, for any reason, it vas impracticable to secure thepassage of this legislation into lav?, it wouldbe necessary to consider further a proposal -madeby the Lord Chancellor to obtain delay by ,setting up a tribunal for- the investigation ofthe various claims on the Russian balances.The Prime Minister thought there was no alternative but to introduce a-rd pass the Bill,even if it involved extending the present Sessionby one - day.The Cabinet agreed  That the Chancellor of the exchequer should introduce the Russian Govem-ment Funds (Transfer Restriction)Bill, 1927, in the House of Commons,with a view to its &quot;passage into lawduring the present Session.

They agreed  That the Minister of Agricultureand l?ish3ries should approach theLondon County Council in order toascertain whether they would be willing to purchase at least a portion of the Albany Street Estatewith a view to carrying out a housing scheme there, and that, inthe event of their being willingto do so, It would be justifiable ,if necessary, to accept a lowerprice than could be obtained inthe open market.
CHINA..(previous reference:Cabinet 36(27), Con-elusion 1.)9*   The Cabinet took note of the following conclusions by the Cabinet Committee on Chinaat the meeting on June 16th, 1927 (Paper C.P.-180 (27)):-(a) REDUCTION OP CRUISERS ON THEm STA^im-To approve the admiralty sproposals for permanent .and temporary reductions of Cruiserson the China Station involving the withdrawal of two Cruisers,one during September and October,and the second during November,Deoember, January and February.(b) WBI-HAI-WAI.That, in present circumstances,it was unnecessary to maintainmore than one Battalion atWel-hai-Wei for defensive purposes.Withdrawal ofthe IndianMixed Brigade.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(27) , Con-elusion 3. )The Secretary of State for War reminded the Cabinet that on Ma;/ 31st. it had been decidedthat no troops should be withdrawn from China asthe Southern troops were advancing north rapidly and the occupation of Peking by the Nationalistsappeared imminent.    Since then there had been a.check In this advance and various changes hadtaken place in the situation.    For example,there had been an accession of strength to theforeign forces in China since May 31st., the main items of which were:-Fr ano eAmericaJapan900.2,800 and 12 aeroplanes2,000 (Tsingtau).For the above reasons the Chief of the Impeii-alGeneral&quot; Staff considered that there was a surplusof British troops, ana recommended to commencethe&apos;withdrawal of the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade
which would at all times admit of ourreinforcing North China with one Brigade, ifnecessaryo     A reinforcement in North Chinaof a eecond Brigade would also be availableuntil such time as It was decided to withdraw the 13th Infantry Brigade, provided theposition in Shanghai remained unchangedeThe withdrawal of the 20th Indian infantry brigade would mean a saving of about 62,500 a monthoThe Secretary of State for Air askedfor authority to withdraw a Squadron of theRoyal Air Force from China, as it was nowredundant and there were no adequate facilitiesfor flying practiceoSubject to the agreement of the naval commander-in-Chief, the Cabinet agreed -(a) To authorise the Secretary ofState for War to arrange forthe withdrawal of the 20thIndian Infantry Erigade from china s(b) To authorise the Secretary ofState for Air to arrange forthe withdrawal of one squadron of the Royal Air Force from china.
1 f. i101REDUCTION and limitation OPARMA3.-JSMDS.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(27), Con-clusion 3a)10. The Lord President of the Council broughtto the attention of his colleagues evidence inthe official telegrams from the United States ofAmerica and in the Press to show that american public opinion was determined to accept nothingless than a basis of parity with this countryfor all units of naval strength.    If? as he believed, it were the policy of the government not to oppose parity, Lord Balfour thought itwas essential to remove all irils understanding bya public announcement to this effect.The question was discussed by the cabinet at some length.Sir William Tyrrell, in the absence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, drew theattention of the Cabinet to a rather crypticcoiinflunioation from the United States ChargedJAffaires in London supporting Lord Balfourlscontention, and to telegrams Nos. 297 arid &apos;298from Sir E. Howard commenting thereon, to theeffect that the United States Government feelthey can only continue the Conference on an agreed basis of parity for all units, and thatif this were conceded he could give the American secretary of State explanations as to othernatters connected with the Conference, which hecould not do usefully without some such assurance,In the course of the discussion attention was drawn to the following extract from the revised Minutes, pi the 227th Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on the subject:- &apos;
&quot;Mr BRIDGSMaNsaid that in thesecircumstances we should have to ask the other Powers to state frankly whatthey wanted.SIR AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN expressed theopinion that the United States wouldnot in any case accept a limit whichwas less than ours.    They might statethat there was no probability of theirbuilding up to their limit, but he didnot think it would be safe to rely onany such statement.Mr BRIDGSMAN remarked that the admiralty would not take a grave view if theUnited States built up to their limit.The Admiralty must, however, resist a limitation by total tonnage.......Comment was uade to the effect that atelegram sent on the previous evening by theChief of the Naval Staff to the Delegation ofHis Majesty^ Government in Great Britain atGeneva, in regard to cruiser ratio (which was read to the Cabinet by the Assistant Chief of therkval Staff) appeared to be at variance with thelast-quoted remarks of the First Lord.The Cabinet, however, were asked not toadopt the principle of parity of naval strength in so man?/ words, as this was contrary to previouspolicy and was believed to be strongly opposed bythe Admiralty.The Cabinet asresd  That the Permanent Under-Secretaryof State, Foreign Office, should send a telegram to the Gelegationof His Majesty&apos;s Government inGreat Britain at Geneva, based onthe following formula proposed bythe Lord President of the Council:-
&quot;For diplomatic reasons we thinkit most desirable to say publiclyand at once what we believe tobe your view, namely, that,while we mean to build cruisers up toour needs, we lay down no condi-tions limiting cruisers to a smaller number.   Do you see any objection?&quot;whit ehal1 Gardens, S.W.1,June 29, 1927.
