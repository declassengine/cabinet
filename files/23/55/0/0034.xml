1. The Cabinet had before them a Note by LordBirkerihead covering a IKeport on Cruisers by theNaval Programme Committee, of which he was Chairman(Paper C.P.-305 (27))% together with, a Memorandumby the First Lord of the Admiralty on the same subject (Paper CP.-325 (2V)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer, while notadmitting that, from the point of view of naval strength, a case had been made out for laying downany Cruisers in 1927 or 1928, or that from thepoint of view of maintaining the Dockyards morethan one Cruiser was justified in 1937 and one in1928, nevertheless was willing to submit to thesettlement proposed in the Committee&apos;s Report.In regard to 1929 he considered that if two cruisers were commenced in 1928, two would, suffice for 1929, and beyond this he could not commit himself.    On the other hand, he did not press foran alteration at this stage of the three Cruisersprovided for in the White Paper of 1925, though he reserved his right to raise the question, Ifnecessary, when the Estimates for 1929-30 werebeing considered.   Mr Churchill agreed with thefollowing statement in the Memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (Paper CP.-325 (27)):-&quot;If the American programme of 25 &apos;A&apos;Class Cruisers at the rate of 5 ayear, is to be. carried out, all the cruisers we build In 1928-29 oughtto be of the same Class&quot;.If the Admiralty should decide in favour of &quot;B&quot;Class instead of &quot;A.&quot; Class Cruisers, he wouldprobably find it necessary to put the TreasuryView on record in a letter to the Admiralty, acopy of which should be placed on the. Cabinet file,
to the effect that the decision had been takenby the Admiralty on their own responsibility andthat the Treasury had not placed financialobstacles in the way of building &quot;A&quot; Class Crrcia ftra*As regards the Sloops asked for by the First I-:ijdof the Admiralty, he proposed that this should beleft to the First lord and himself to consider Inconnection with the Navy Estimates.The First Lord of the Admiralty also acceptedthe Report, though with reluctance,ardthanked theChancellor of the Exchequer for his conciliatoryspirit.    He attached importance to the maintenanceof three Cruisers in the programme for 1929, whichwas/ consistent with the attitude he had taken tap atGeneva, but recognised that the Chancellor of theExchequer would always have the right to raise thequestion in the light of new circumstances.   Thepassage from his Memorandum which the Chancellorof the Exchequer had quoted (reproduced above)&apos;was based on technical considerations, and he wished to know whether, from a political point ofview, the course proposed was considered desirable,,If both the Cruisers for 1928 were to be of the&quot;A&quot; Class type, the gesture of dropping the &quot;A&quot;Class Cruiser from the 1927 programme would not look very effective, nor would this course be consistent with the idea, thrown out at Geneva,of our marking time until the Americans caught usup. in &quot;A&quot; Class Cruisers.In the course of the discussion the question was raised as to what was our policy in regardto the United States of America:    was it our ...intention to leave there out of account in calculateing our own naval programme, or did we intend totake their programme into account in calculating
o-ur own needs?    Opinion differed somewhat as towhether, in the long run, it was desirable to havea Naval Agreement with the United States or not,but there was a consensus of opinion that theUnited States of America h.ad much leeway to make up in the matter of Cruisers, that for the nextfew years we could afford to ignore their programme,and that fcr the moment there was no prospect ofa Naval Agreement with the United States of America.The decisions of the Cabinet were as follows:-(a) To approve generally the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee (Paper CCP.-50b&quot; (37)),  subject to the following:-(b) The programme for 1928-89 should provide for 2 Cruisers (as comparedwith 3 in the White Paper) :(c) The question of whether these Cruisersshould be Class &quot;A&quot; or Class &quot;B&quot;should be reserved for the presentin order that all f&amp;cbors bearing onthe situation might-; be weighed beforethe Cruisers are laid down:(d) In any public announcement In regardto the programme for 1928-29 it shouldbe stated that 8 Cruisers would be built, but that the actual design wasnot yet settled.    In any case theexpenditure in the year 1928-29 wouldnot be affected:(e) The programme for 1929-30, as setforth in the White Paper of 1925(via,,, 1 Class &quot;A&quot; and 2 Class &quot;Bn^Cruisers) should remain unaltered; butthis, of course, would not preventthe Chancellor of the Exchequer orany other Minister from bringing thematter up for discussion:(f) That at the present time the Covern-menfs policy ehould be to take nonotice in public of the building pro-gramme of the ,United States of America:(g) That the question of the replacement of Sloops should be discussed betweenthe First Lord of the Admiralty andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer inconnection with the preparation ofthe Navy Estimates 1928-29.The Prime Minister thanked Laird Birkenhead&apos;cabinet Committee, as well as the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Lord of the Admiralty, forthe great efforts they had made to reach a settlement.
LEASEHOLD 2.

Trie Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (Papor C.P.-324 (27)) covering a Report of a   Departmental Committee on rhe Shops(Early Closing) Acts, 1920 and 1921.In his Memorandum, the Home Secretary explainedthat the Committee adhered generally to the presentcompulsory closing hours   8 p.m. on days otherthan Saturday, and 9 p*m. on Saturday (thou.gh itwould give the Local Authority power to substituteanother day for Saturday as the late nightK-butproposed a number of modifications in detail of the e ex i s ti ng arran g em e nt s .The advice 0f the Home Secretary wasthat, in view of the agreement reached by theCommittee, its recommendations should be accepted.He ashed for authority for the immediate prepara-tion of a Bill with a view to its being introduced in the early part of next Session,The Cabinet agreed  That the Rome Secretary should beauthorised to prepare a Bill

The Cabinet had a short discussion in regardto the business of the next Session of Parliament.,The Prime Minister iriade a statement in regardto the Parliamentary position.    It was generallyadmitted that any Autumn Session in the next yearmust be a very short one.    It was calculated that,,making the usual allowance for financial business and the passage of the Budget, only 22 days wouldbe available for legislation up to August 1st.One or two minor Bills of an urgent, character, suchas the new Judges required by the Lord Chancellor,had to be provided for, which reduced the amountof time available to 18 days. The Government wouldbe obliged to introduce Bills inregard to the Franchise and the Reform of theHouse of Lords.   This would leave very little, ifany, time available for other measures.   The frameMinister asked members of the Cabinet to weighthese considerations in proposing legislationwhen they re-assembled.In the course of the discussion the Lord privy seal, as Leader of the House of Lords, emphasizedthe intolerable and almost scandalous conditionsin which the House of Lords was compelled to doits business at the end&apos;of a long Session,    Thetime allowed obliged then: to pass measures which&apos;gave them no chancs of&quot; carrying out their functionas a-revising Chamber, and few of the members had any idea as to the details of the measures theywere expected to pass.The suggestion was made that a good deal ofParliamentary time was wasted in dealing withSupplementary Estimates, and that perhaps a more

3500REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE OF THE COMMITTEE OF  IMPERIALDEFENCE ON THE INDIANISATION OF THE INDIAN ARMY.(As Amended and Approved by the Cabinet.)AT the request of the Secretary of State for India, the Cabinet, at a meeting-held on the 23rd November, 1927 (Cabinet 57 (27), Conclusion 14), agreed to recom-mend to the Prime Minister that a Sub-Committee of the Committee of ImperialDefence should be set up to examine and report on the proposals recently receivedfrom the Government of India relating to the Indianisation of the Indian Army.2.   Accordingly our Sub-Committee was set up, composed as follows :  The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Balfour, KG, O.M., Lord President of theCouncil (Chairman).The Rt. Hon. W. S. Churchill, OH., M.P., Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Rt. Hon. Sir John Gilmour, Bt., D.S.O., M.P., Secretary of State forScotland (representing the Secretary of State for War).The Rt. Hon. the Earl of Birkenhead, Secretary of State for India.The Rt. Hon. Sir Samuel Hoare, Bt., G.B.E., C.M.G., M.P., Secretary ofState for Air.The Rt. Hon. Viscount Peel, G.B.E., First Commissioner of Works.3. Field-Marshal Sir Claud Jacob, Secretary, Military Department, IndiaOffice, General Sir George Milne, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and Air Vice-Marshal Sir Philip Game, Air Member for Personnel, were invited to take part inour deliberations. In addition, the Secretary of State for India laid before us theviews of his Council.4. In order that the proposals of the Government of India, and our conclusions in regard to them, may be the more readily understood, we set out in the following paragraphs a brief historical summary.5. Prior to 1918 Indians were not eligible to hold the King&apos;s Commission inHis Majesty&apos;s Land Forces. In that year, however, in recognition of the part takenby Indians in the Great War, this commission was,&apos; for the first time, declared opento them.6. The following passage in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report on constitutional reforms, which was published in 1918, is relevant: &quot; There remains one item, the importance of which, in the eyes of India,out weighs, all others.   British commissions have for the first time been grantedto Indian officers.....   The services of the Indian Army in the war and thegreat increase in its size make it necessary that a considerable number ofcommissions should now be given.&quot;7. With a view to providing Indian candidates with the necessary militarytraining, a cadet school,* with accommodation for 50 cadets, was established atIndore, in India, and, in addition, ten vacancies a year were allotted to Indians atthe Royal Military College, Sandhurst. But no definite policy was formulated atthat time as to the ultimate employment of Indians who graduated at these establishments.8.   In 1921 the Legislative Assembly adopted the following resolutions  t(a.) &quot; That the King Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to allarms of His Majesty&apos;s military, naval and air forces in India and the ancillary services and the auxiliary forces; that every encouragementshould be given to Indians including the educated middle classes subject to the prescribed standards of fitness, to enter the commissionedranks of the Army. . . . .&quot;* This sehoul was- ouly an expedient to meet the special needs of ihe war, and it was closed afterone year&apos;8 existence.f Resolution 7 of March 28, 1921.[16921] b 2
(6.) &quot; That not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;9. In 1921 and 1922 the Government of India submitted various recommenda-tions for extending Indianisation in the Army. These were examined by a Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, whose Report* on the wholequestion of Indian Military requirements was approved by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin January 1923. For convenience of reference, that portion of the Report which deals with Indianisation is reproduced as Appendix A.10. Special attention is invited to the conclusion contained in paragraph130 (a) :-&quot; 130 (a.) A start should be made at once so as to give Indians a fairopportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in everyway. Accordingly, eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should be selected, to beofficered by Indians, as now suggested by the Government of India.&quot;11. The scheme contemplated in the above conclusion to which we shall here-after refer as &quot; the eight-unit Scheme &quot; was described! in the Legislative Assemblyby the late Lord Rawlinson in the following words: &quot; The Government consider that a start should be made at once so as to giveIndians a fair opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way. Accordingly it has been decided that eight unitsof cavalry or infantry be selected to be officered by Indians. This scheme willbe put into force immediately. The eight units to be wholly Indianised will be mainly infantry units, but there will be a proportion of cavalry. They will be chosen judiciously so as to include as many representative types as possible ofIndian battalions and cavalry regiments of the Indian Army. Indian Officersholding commissions in the Indian Army will be gradually transferred toIndianising units so as to fill up the appointments for which they are qualifiedby their rank and by their length of service, and the process of Indianising these units will then continue uninterruptedly as the officers gain seniority and fitnessin other respects, which will qualify them for the senior posts.....   There isone other point, however, which it is necessary for me to explain. It is that,simultaneously with the Indianisation of these selected eight units, Indians whoqualify for the King&apos;s Commission will continue, as at present, to be posted to.... the other units of the Indian- Army; The number of Indian cadets now sent to^Sandhurst each year, if all pass out successfully, is more, than sufficient&apos; to replace the normal wastage in the eight units alone.&quot;12. The scheme was put into operation forthwith. It is to be noted that it made no difference to the pace at which the number of officers receiving the King&apos;commission was increased; there was no advance upon the ten vacancies originallyallotted at Sandhurst; and Indians were still ineligible to be employed as King&apos;sCommissioned Officers in the artillery or engineers of the Indian Army, or in theair force.13.   In July:): 1924, the Government of India made recommendations for (a) the admission of Indians to the Royal Air Force and to Indian units of artillery and engineers; and(b) an increase from ten to sixteen in the number of vacancies at Sandhurst.But before a reply had been sent to these recommendations, the Secretary of Statereceived the proposal of the Government of India to appoint the Committee, whichwas eventually known as the Indian Sandhurst Committee. The correspondencerelating to the appointment of this Committee is attached as Appendix (B).14. The Report $ of the Indian Sandhurst Committee . was published in&quot;November 1926. The Government of India, after consultation with the Secretaryof State, prefaced this Report with a foreword, in which they indicated that it* C.T.D. Paper No. 130-D. f On the 17th February, 1923.j Despatch dated 24th July, 1924. g 0.1.U. Paper No. 155-D.
X Telegram No. 1473 S of 18th July, 1927.might be necessary to explore other lines of increasing Indianisation than thosewhich had hitherto been followed. They also stated that the Report would be used&quot;as a starting point for discussion with His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;15.   With the Indian Sandhurst Report itself, it is unnecessary for us to deal,since the Government of India have not accepted its main recommendations whichthey describe:! as &quot;insufficiently considered and in consequence ill-founded.&quot; But,acting on the statements published in their foreword, they have now submitted theproposals which form the subject of our enquiry. These are set out in full in theirtelegram of the 18th July, as supplemented by their despatch of the 13th October.The relevant correspondence is attached as Appendix (C).16. Before proceeding to discuss their proposals in detail we desire.to draw attention to certain fundamental aspects of the situation. In the first place, it isnecessary to recognise that, whatever the arguments against the Indianisation of theArmy and they are manifold and powerful we are deeply, in fact, inextricably,committed to this policy by our decision in 1923, at all events, to the extent of givingIndians &quot;a fair opportunity of proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way.&quot; The experiment is still under trial in the eight units; and itcannot be said that it has failed, and must be abandoned.17. In the second place, there are definite grounds against leaving matters where they now stand. The Indian Sandhurst Committee was appointed with theconcurrence of the Secretary of State; their Report has been published and discussed with the full knowledge that it involves reopening the question of Indianisation;and the foreword of the Government of India contains a clear promise, which has since been endorsed by the Secretary of State in the House of Lords, that the report will be used as a starting point for discussions with His Majesty&apos;s Government.18. Moreover, apart from political considerations, we have learned that weare within measurable distance of the time when the output of Indian cadets fromSandhurst will exceed the requirements of the eight units, as at present organised.At no distant date, therefore, we must either cease gradually or wholly to sendIndians to Sandhurst (which would have a disastrous effect on Indian opinion), ordistribute the cadets over the rest of the Indian Army (which would have a disaterous efect on British recruitment, and possibly on efficiency).. 19Div Were^ar^t^ieiJiat^e^-contijigency as particularly objectionable, since wehave beenioljd that there.&apos;is already an alarfning and growing,&apos; shortage of ^Britishcandidates of the right stamp for commissions in the Indian Army. There are many explanations for this shortage, but the most important of these is, we under-stand, the reluctance of parents to send their sons to serve under Indians, or live their lives with Indians as messmates.20. Something, therefore, must be done; and the view put before us by theSecretary of State for India, after full examination in his Department, is that theGovernment of India &quot;have succeeded, on the whole, in dealing comprehensively,and on lines of safety, with a situation which, owing to the necessities of the case,has hitherto been treated partially, and which will inevitably present us not only with immediate embarrassments, but even with some positive elements of danger,unless its anomalies can be corrected.&quot;   With that view we agree.21. Turning now to the details of the recommendations put forward by theGovernment of India, these may be summarised as follows : (1.) The ultimate goal of Indianisation should be in the creation of a self-contained Dominion Army, in which the Commissioned officer will hold aKing&apos;s (India) commission, and Units will be organised on the model ofBritish Battalions with homogeneous officer establishments, instead of two distinct types of commissions.&quot;(2.) The issue of King&apos;s Commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst shouldbe continued for the present.
s(3.) The &quot;Eight Units &quot; system should be maintained, and the number shouldhereafter be expanded as may be necessary.(4.) Indians who enter Sandhurst in future should be posted to Indianisingunits (a) in vacancies of British Officers until such vacancies are no longeravailable; (b) thereafter, in place of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.(5.) The vacancies for direct commissions through Sandhurst should beincreased to 20 per annum, and five further vacancies should be givenannually to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers who pass through Sandhurst.(6.) Eight annual vacancies at Woolwich should be given to Indians. Thosewho pass out from Woolwich should receive King&apos;s Commissions, as nowgranted to Indians passing out from Sandhurst.(7.) Two annual vacancies at Cranwell should be given to Indians. The formof commission to be given to Indians who pass out from Cranwell shouldbe reserved for further consideration.(8.) The question of the establishment of an Indian Military College should be postponed until Sandhurst is no longer capable of absorbing IndianCadets in the numbers forthcoming.(9.) An overseas element should be created in the existing pay of Indian army officers, and Indians entering Sandhurst under the new system should beineligible for this element.(10.) Scholarships should be instituted to enable Indian boys to meet theexpenses of education at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell.(11.) The official guardian at Sandhurst should be a serving officer.(12.) Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesserefficiency of completely Indianised units should be made good either byadditional British troops or by additional Indian troops with british officers.We will discuss the above proposals seriatim&apos;.22.   Recommendation No. 1. The first step should be the organisation of the units-selected for Indianisation on the model of British battalions, withhomogeneous officer establishments, instead of two distinct types of .Commissions.    The Commissioned Officers in these units should hold aKing&apos;s (India) Commission,utizit  ju c*seci us:  z-ii. &apos;cij viii-isrjj &quot;n )ip.nr .-.F--i sintw rvi yf !1.w. o.,, y ; j.It shouldibejremembered thatbhe ayste-m.on.-which, the [indian army is at.presentorganised is a hybrid, as is inevitable when native troops are commanded by alien )officers, and for linguistic and other reasons the contact between the junior officersand the rank and file cannot be nearly so close as that between the British subalternand his men in a.British Unit. The gap in the Indian Army is filled by a class ofmen known as Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers, who act as intermediates betweenthe King&apos;s commissioned officers and the rank and file. These are selected bypromotion from the ranks, and hold a position above that of a Warrant Officer in aBritish regiment, but below that of the King&apos;s commissioned officer. In proportion as Indians take the place of British in the King&apos;s commissioned ranks of a section ofthe Indian Army, the necessity for maintaining this intermediate class of officerdisappears. If the nucleus of an Indian National Army is ever to be developed, it is essential that the junior officers should maintain the same kind of close contact with their men as is expected of a British subaltern in a British unit.The proposal of the Government of India to eliminate the Viceroy&apos;s Commissionedofficer from Indianising units therefore appears logical. It has the additionaladvantage that it widens the scope of Indianisation without necessitating anincrease in the eight units, at any rate, for some time to come. In these circumstances we see no objection to an announcement that the Government&apos;s policy is to give better opportunities for the advancement of Indian Officers in the development of a force within the Indian Army officered by Indians, provided that it is definitelyrequired that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment. We also agree that, the units in which the experiment ofIndianisihg is to be tried should be organised on the model of British Battalions withhomogeneous officer establishment instead of two distinct types of Commissions.
23.   Recommendation No. 2. The issue of King&apos;a Commissions to Indianstrained at Sandhurst should be continued for the present.At present Indians passing out of Sandhurst are given exactly the same form of commission as other cadets, namely, the King&apos;s Commission in His Majesty&apos;s land forces, which carries power of command over all personnel, whether British orIndian, in those Forces. The commissions granted to Dominion officers, on the otherhand, carry power of command only in the Dominion Forces. We. agree with theGovernment of India that, under their present proposals, India ought to be put onthe same footing in this respect as the Dominions. We consider, however, that itwould be proper to make the change now, when the number of Indians already holdingthe full King&apos;s Commission is still small. Consideration of the new form of commis-sion will involve a large, number of technical points; and we, therefore, suggestthat it should be examined by the Secretary of State for India, in consultation withthe Secretaries of State for&apos;War and Air, and that their recommendations shouldbe reported to the Committee of Imperial Defence.24. Recommendation No. 3. The eight-units system should be maintained, andthe number should hereafter be expanded as necessary.We fully agree indeed we consider it essential that the general principle underlying the &quot; eight-units system &quot; should be maintained, since we should neverrecommend assent to any measure which involved experimenting with the indian army as a whole. In our view this principle affords the only practical means ofisolating the experiment, and thus of arriving in course of time at an accurate estimate of its results. And it has the added advantage that it will secure theposition of British Officers entering the Indian Army. It may thus serve to cure thealarming shortage of British candidates of the right type, to which we have already referred in paragraph 19. We would stipulate, however, that any decision as to theexpansion of the &quot;eight-units system&quot; must be reserved until further experiencelias been gained.25. Recommendation No. 4. Indians who enter Sandhurst in future shouldbe posted to Indianising units (a) in vacancies of British officers until such vacancies are no longer available; (b) thereafter in place ofViceroy&apos;s Commissioned officers.This recommendation is a natural corollary to our previous recommendations,and we agree with it in principle. We consider that the details can best be settled bythe&apos; Secretary M--State for -India-in&apos; consultation with;;the!Governmentio Tndia.:..26. Recommendation No. 5. The vacancies for direct commissions throughSandhurst should be increased to 20 per annum; and five furthervacancies should be given to Viceroy&apos;s Commissioned officers who pass through Sandhurst.We have been informed that Sandhurst could absorb Indians up to a maximum of 25 per annum without serious risk of prejudicing its essential characteristics;and that the Army Council would be prepared to accept up to that number. Atthe same time, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff told us that Sandhurst isalready carrying a residuum of cadets, which tends to lower the standard of the Collegeas a whole, and that methods of raising the educational standard of British entrantsare being seriously considered. We are impressed by the force of these arguments;and we consider it essential that Indian candidates should be required to pass thesame standard of admission as British candidates, and should not, as hitherto, beadmitted on a separate and lower standard. We hold equally strongly that theBritish standard of proficiency at Sandhurst should be insisted on for Indians; and,in any event, it must be clearly understood that the Army Council have the rightwith Indian, as with British; cadets to remove without question any cadet who iscpnsidered unfitted to become an officer. In that connection, we desire to draw-attention to the disastrous effect that would be, created, if an unduly large proportionof Indians admitted to Sandhurst were removed for inefficiency. We suggest thatthe necessity of obviating this risk by the maintenance of a proper standard of selection, should ba impressed on the Government of India.
27. Recommendation No. 6. Eight annual vacancies at Woolwich should begiven to Indians. Those who puss out from Woolwich should receiveKing&apos;s Commissions, as now granted to Indians passing out fromSandhurst.In principle there is no objection to the admission of a limited number of indians to Woolwich, provided that the British standard of admission to, and proficiency at,Woolwich, is rigidly insisted on. Thus, an Indian would only be eligible for appointment to an Indian Service engineer or artillery unit, if his place on thepassing out list would have qualified him for the Royal Engineers or Royal Artillery,had he been a British cadet. In practice, however, we consider it indispensablethat a satisfactory scheme for the eventual employment of Indians who have passedout successfully, should be settled in advance. The Government of India havesuggested that Indian officers who have so passed out should be absorbed into IndianMountain Batteries and Sapper and Miner Companies (which are integral parts ofthe Indian Army), and that certain of these Units should be earmarked forIndianisation, as has been done in the case of the Cavalry and Infantry. Thissuggestion appears to us to rely too much upon the belief that Indians will not succeed in passing out of Woolwich in any appreciable numbers. However well founded this belief may be, it appears essential that the position should belra]i.faH^e(L4fai^ that-the,;position *should^belsafeguarded, and that we should, in no circumstances, be confronted with thenecessity of posting Indians to British Units. The Government of India&apos;s proposal,as it stands, does not contain the necessary safeguard. In our opinion, this couldbe supplied by requiring that, if and when the number of promising candidates forWoolwich should be found to exceed present expectations, the number of admissionsshould be regulated strictly in proportion to the rate at which Indian officers can besafely absorbed into Indian Mountain Batteries, and Sapper and Miner Companies.We recommend that the Government of India should be asked to submit their estimate of the rate at which Indianisation can safely be allowed to proceed in thoseUnits, and that the number of vacancies at Woolwich should be limited accordingly,as occasion may require.Indian Mountain Batteries are at present commanded by British Service officers,who are not in the same position as Indian Army officers, and could not be ordered to serve in a Battery that had been earmarked for Indianisation. It would appearnecessary, therefore, that the Government of India should ask for volunteers fromthe British Service, on terms to be arranged, to maintain the officer establishment ofsuch Batteries.We are unable,,in the time at our disposal, to commit ourselves in.any way withregard to any particular scheme. At this stage, therefore, we record&quot; our view thatwe see no objection on principle to the admission of Indians to Woolwich, providedthat a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual employment in Indian Serviceunits. We understand that, on that condition, the Army Council would be preparedto accept Indians at Woolwich up to a maximum of six a year. Until, however, adefinite scheme has been agreed upon, it would be premature to come to any decision as to the number to be admitted annually; and we recommend that any announcement on the subject should be confined to a statement of the principle that Indians will beregarded as eligible for admission to Woolwich as soon as a satisfactory scheme fortheir subsequent employment in Indian Service units has been completed.As-regards the form of commission to be granted to Indians who pass out of woolwich, our recommendation in paragraph 23 is applicable.28. Recommendation No. 7. Two annual vacancies at Crantvell should begiven to Indians. The form of commission to Indians who pass out fromCranwell should be reserved, for further consideration.We consider that there is no objection in principle to the admission of indians to Cranwell, and we have been told that the Air Council would accept them providedthat the British standard of admission and proficiency is insisted on. But here again it must first be settled how. successful cadets are to be employed; and in this instance the special difficulty arises, that there are no. Indian Air Force Unitscorresponding in any way with the Cavalry, Artillery, Engineer and Infantry Unitsof the Indian Army.   The Government of India proposed to overcome this difficulty
by the adoption of the scheme drawn up by the Air Officer Commanding in India,which is described in the enclosure to their Despatch. We found ourselves unableto agree to this scheme, since it contemplates the maintenance for some 14 yearsof mixed Air Units, in which British officers and other ranks would, at one stageor another, have to serve under Indian officers. At our request the Secretary ofState for India asked the Government of India by telegraph to amplify their proposals in such a way as to guarantee suitable employment to Indians who passout of Cranwell, without the necessity of posting them for an indefinite period toBritish Service Units, an arrangement which the Government of India themselvesrecognise as impossible. The Viceroy, in his reply, has suggested an alternative scheme, the essence of which is the recognition of the necessity of gradually creatingan entirely Indian Air Organisation for the reception of any Indian officers whosucceed in passing out of Cranwell.We are unable, in the short time at our disposal, to commit ourselves in anyway with regard to this particular scheme, but we are satisfied that the ground ofour objections to the original proposal has been realised in India, and that it is not impossible to devise ways and means of meeting them. At this stage, therefore, werecord our view that we see no objection, on principle, to the admission of indians to Cranwell, on the conditions we have stated. The matter should, in our opinion,be further explored by the Secretary of State for India, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Air and the Government of India.We are informed that, on the conditions stated, the Air Council would beprepared, in due course, to accept Indian cadets at Cranwell. Until,however, a definite scheme can be worked out on the lines we haveadvocated, we consider it would be premature to come to any decision as to thenumber of Indians to be admitted annually to Cranwell; and we recommend thatany announcement on the subject should be confined to a statement of the principlethat Indians will be regarded as eligible for admission as soon as a satisfactory-scheme for their subsequent employment in an Indian air unit has been completed.29. Recommendation No. 8. The question of the establishment of an indian military College should be postponed until Sandhurst is no longercapable of absorbing Indian cadets in the numbers forthcoming.Considerable difficulty has been experienced in filling even the limited numberof vacancies at present offered at Sandhurst. Up to date, out of 243 candidateswho have presented themselves for these vacancies, 97 have been admitted; 25 ofthese are still in residence, but of the remaining 72, only 51 have been commisioned. In view of India&apos;s inability to fill satisfactorily even the limited number of vacancies at present offered, we agree that no good purpose would be served in existing circumstances by the establishment of an Indian Military College.30. Recommendation No. 9. An overseas element should be created in theexisting pay of the Indian Army, and Indians entering Sandhurst underthe new system should be ineligible for this element.We understand that the principle of differential rates of pay has already been largely acted upon in the Civil Services in India. The proposal to apply it to theArmy, therefore, appears reasonable and proper.31. ^Recommendation No. 10. Scholarships should be instituted to enableIndian boys to meet the expenses of education at Sandhurst, woolwich and Cranwell.Field-Marshal Sir Claud Jacob told us that when he was President of the selection Board in India, out of an average of 25 candidates who presented them-selves each year for commissions, he had had great difficulty in passing five assuitable. He also told us that the cost of educating an Indian youth at Sandhurstwas remarkably high, and that the Government of India would have to paypractically the whole of these expenses if they wished to attract the best class of fighting man. We are impressed by this evidence; and we are, therefore, in full agreement with the proposal to institute scholarships as a means of improving boththe quality and the quantity of candidates. Nothing which might widen the field of suitable candidates should be left undone.[16921] c
32. Recommendation No. 11. The official guardian at Sandhurst should be aserving officer.We consider that the question of the position of the official guardian atSandhurst should be settled by the Secretary of State in consultation with theGovernment of India.33. Recommendation No. 12. Any deficiency in the forces available for thedefence of India due to lesser efficiency of completely Indianised unitsshotild be made good either by additional British troops or by additionalIndian troops with British officers.We are in full agreement with this proposal, which is a necessary corollary tothe experiment of Indianisation.34. In conclusion, we do not wish either the Cabinet or the Committee ofImperial Defence to be under any illusion as to the effect of the policy under discussion on the efficiency of the Indian Army. Our expert military advisers made it clear to us that, in their opinion, it would not be safe, at any rate unless and until the experiment proved successful, to rely either in actual warfare or even for themaintenance of law and order, on units in which the British element is within sight of disappearing. Consequently, a portion of the Indian Forces is being deliberatelyexposed to the risk of a progressive deterioration in the standard of efficiency,without any corresponding economy, at a moment when disarmament and economyare the order of the day, and when as revealed by the enquiries of the Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on the Defence of India -themilitary resources of India require considerable readjustment to enable them to fulfil the possible defensive needs of the country. But we are inextricably committed,and on grounds of policy and expediency we cannot leave matters where they nowstand. In these circumstances, we consider that the proposals of the Governmentof India are probably the most innocuous that can be devised. We do not for onemoment believe that, by adopting them, we shall satisfy Indian aspirations. But weshall be keeping the ground fully occupied, and we shall be able to reply with truthfor many years to come that we are doing our best to meet Indian susceptibilities.35. Summary of Recommendations.(1.) We see no objection to an announcement that the Governments policy is togive better opportunities for the advancement of Indian Officers in the developmentof a force within the Indian Army officered by Indians, provided that it is definitelyrequired that the process is strictly contingent on the success achieved in the various stages of the experiment. The units in which the experiment of Indianising is tobe tried should be organised on the model of British Battalions with homogeneousofficer establishment instead of two distinct types of Commissions (paragraph 22).(2.) The form of commission to be granted in future to Indian Officers shouldbe analogous in respect of power of command to that granted to officers in the self-governing Dominions. The details should be further examined by the Secretaries ofState for War, Air and India, whose recommendations should be reported to theCommittee of Imperial Defence (paragraph 23).(3.) It is essential that the principle underlying the &quot;eight-units system&quot;should be maintained. Any decision as to its expansion must be reserved until further experience has been gained (paragraph 24).(4.) Indians who enter Sandhurst in future should be posted to Indianisingunits (a) in place of British Officers until such vacancies are no longer available; and(b) thereafter, in place of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers (paragraph 25)(5.) We see no objection to an announcement that vacancies at Sandhurst willbe made available to Indians up to a maximum of 25 per annum, provided that theBritish standard of proficiency is insisted on for Indians at all three stages, viz., forpassing into Sandhurst, for retention at the College, and for passing out. Thenecessity of maintaining a proper standard of selection should be impressed on theGovernment of India (paragraph 26).(6.) We see no objection in principle to declaring Indians eligible for admission to Woolwich, provided that a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual
employment. Pending this, we think it premature to record any conclusion as tothe number of vacancies to be reserved annually. The British standard should be insisted on in exactly the same way as for Sandhurst (paragraph 27).(7.) We see no objection in principle to declaring Indians eligible for admission to Cranwell, provided that a suitable scheme can be devised for their eventual employ-ment otherwise than in British Service Air Units. Pending this we think itpremature to record any. conclusion as to the number of vacancies to be reservedannually. Here again, the British standard must be applied throughout(paragraph 28).(8.) No good purpose would be served in existing circumstances by the establish-ment of an Indian Military College (paragraph 29).(9.) The principle of creating an overseas element in the existing pay of theIndian Army, on the precedent already existing in the Indian civil services, is ingeneral accordance with the remainder of our conclusions (paragraph 30).(10.) The success of the scheme would be furthered by the institution of scholar-ships to enable Indian boys to meet the expenses of education at Sandhurst, woolwich and Cranwell. Nothing which might widen the field of suitable candidates, shouldbe left undone (paragraph 31).(Ill) The question of the position of the official guardian at Sandhurst shouldbe settled by the Secretary of State for India in consultation with the Government ofIndia (paragraph 32).(12.) Any deficiency in the forces available for the defence of India due to lesserefficiency of completely Indianised Units should be made good either by additionalBritish troops or by additional Indian troops and British officers.o
APPENDIX (A).Extract from the Report of the Sue-Committee on Indian military requirements [C.I.D. Paper No. 130 D].******(27) Indianisation of the Indian Array.117. Ou the 28th March 1921 the Indian Legislative Assembly passed thefollowing resolutions : &quot;(a) That the king-Emperor&apos;s Indian subjects should be freely admitted to allarms of His Majesty&apos;s Military, Naval and Air B^orces in India, and the ancillary Services and the Auxiliary Forces. That every encouragementshould be given to Indians, iucluding the educated middle-classes, subjectto the prescribed standard of fitness, to enter the commissioned ranks of theArmy   ...&quot; (b) That not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with.&quot;These resolutions were accepted by the Government of India.118. In para. 40 of their Report, Lord Rawlinsoiis Committee recommended thatthe Indianisation of the Indian Army should proceed by the following method : &quot;(a) A gradual and prudent reduction of British units in the Army in India.&quot; (b) The gradual Indianisation of the commissioned and other appointmentsnow held in the Indian Army by British personnel, and the rendering ofIndia more and more self-supporting as regards all arms and services,&quot;110. Section (24) of this Report deals with (a). As regards (6), Lord Rawliuson&apos;sCommittee recommended that 25 percent, of the vacancies for Indian Army cadetshipsat Sandhurst should immediately be thrown open to Indian youths, and that thatpercentage should be increased by 2\ per cent, annually, so that in 10 years&apos; time theproportion of British ami Indians entering the commissioned ranks of the indian army would be equal. That Committee further recommended that commissions inthe Ancillary Services with separate Indian cadres, such as the Supply and TransportCorps and the Indian Ordnance Department, should be thrown open to Indians, andalso that Indians should be admitted to commissioned rank in the Indian artillery and Indian Sappers and Miners.120. The Government of India made no specific recommendation in regard to thisportion of the Report of Lord Rawlinson&apos;s Committee.121. In their Despatch No. 74 of September 1921 the Government of India have asked that:  -(1) a limited number of suitable Indian lads may be sent home for training inthe Royal Air Force, with a view to their obtaining commissions as officersin the Royal Air Force for service in India ;v (2) a limited number of suitable Indian candidates should be admitted each yearinto Woolwich with a view to their obtaining commissions in such unitsas the Indian Pack Artillery, the Sappers and Miners and Military works services;(3) the number of cadetships at Sandhurst annually for Indians should heincreased from 10 to 12 or 13, this latter number being 25 per cent, of thenumber of commissions granted at present annually to the Indian Army.122. We have also had before us a scheme for Indianisation, the essential feature of which was that a Dominion Force should gradually be formed in India. It was proposed that that Force should be initiated by the formation of one complete militaryunit, such as a brigade of all arms, with ancillary services outside the establishmentof the Indian Army. It was proposed that further units should be raised as soon asthe success of- the experiment was assured, and that the strength of the ImperialArmy should be reduced pari passu with the increase of the Dominion Army.[1(59.21] d
The scheme provided for the officering of the whole Dominion Force by Indiansholding Dominion commissions, but a few British officers were to be allotted to unitsof the Dominion Force on formation for the purposes of organisation and training.123. The Secretary of State for India referred that scheme to the Government, ofIndia for their observations. The Government of India rejected the scheme on thegrounds that it would establish a formation surplus to the minimum military requirements of India which the country could not afford, and that it would be unlitfor service in the field. They further expressed the opinion that Indian sentimentwould not accept such a scheme as an earnest of our intention to ludianise the Army.124. The Government of India accordingly submitted another scheme, dated the11th January 1922, prepared by a Committee of military officers in India, which provided for the complete Indiauisation of the Indian Army (excluding-Gurkhas) in three stages of 14 years each commencing from 11J25, with the proviso that the second and third periods might be curtailed if the first period proved successful. The mainfeature of the scheme was the complete Indianisation of one-third of the units of theIndian Army in each period by posting Indian officers at the rate of two a year to each infantry, pioneer and cavalry regiment in displacement of one British and oneViceroy&apos;s commissioned Indian officer. These Indian officers, who would hold King&apos;commissions in His Majesty&apos;s Indian Land Forces, were, to bo obtained both fromthose Indian officers now holding Viceroy&apos;s commissions and from cadets from a newmilitary college to be opened in India on the lines of Sandhurst.125. Under the scheme the annual entry of Indian officers would be about 110during the first 14 years&apos; period, and 250 during the second period ; while the totalnumber of officers ultimately required would be 6,864.No evidence has been laid before us to lead us to believe anything approachingthat number of suitable candidates will be forthcoming. Under the system initiatedduring the war of - granting King&apos;s Commissions to Indian cadets the supply of candidates is not sufficient to fill the small number of vacancies 10 per annum reserved for them. Nor have the selected Indian candidates shown themselvescapable of attaining the educational and other standards required from Britishcadets, over whom they are given preferential treatment by being admitted toSandhurst on passing a simpler examination.126. The security of India from clangers without and within depends ultimatelyupon the efficiency and loyalty of the Indian Army. In the past the Indian army has proved itself to be a highly efficient and trustworthy instrument for war. Itssplendid record is mainly due to the ability and devotion to duty of its British officers,and to their extraordinary capacity for gaining the respect and affection of their men.We believe that the continued loyalty and efficiency of the Indian Army are, for thepresent, dependent upon the maintenance of the present proportion of British officers.This view appears to be shared by the Viceroy, who, in a telegram, No. 22, dated the7th January 1922, stated that, so long as the present proportion of British officers andthe existing composition of regiments are retained, he had every confidence in the loyalty of the Indian Army.127. The scheme for Tndianisation put forward by the Government of India, and referred to in para. 124, is irreconcilable with that view. It aims at the totalelimination of British officers from the Indian Army. We are unable to understandhow the Government of India and their military advisers have been able to satisfy themselves that so revolutionary a change can prudently be introduced at the presenttime. His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot take such a risk, nor does it appear that itcan-ever be prudent to announce a programme requiring, even in the eyes of itssupporters, 30 or 40 years for its execution. Much might happen in so long a period to negative or change the conclusions so announced.128. Nor is the present moment well chosen for the announcement of so great achange. India is passing through a difficult period of transition. Public opinion isrestless, and the measure of support, upon which Government can count is doubtful.At such a time when the authority of Government is widely challenged, and seditionis openly preached, special caution is.necessary in all that relates to the armed forces which are the ultimate basis of the authority of the King-Emperor&apos;s Government, andof the safety of life and maintenance of order.

Debate in the Legislative Assembly on19th February on resolution regarding establishment of a military college in India.II. Late Lord Rawlinsoii&apos;s speech, vide pages 1951 to 1953 of the Official Report ofthe Assembly debates dated 4th March 1925. III. Undertaking given by sir alexander Muddiman on 14th March, vide page 2402 of Assembly debates.2. After discussion in Council on 7th April last, we decided that a Committee,including Indian members of the Legislature, should be appointed to investigate andreport: (a) by what means it is possible to improve upon the present supplyof Indian candidates for the King&apos;s Commission, both in regard to number and.quality ; (b) whether it is not desirable and practicable to establish a military collegein India to train Indian officers for the commissioned ranks of the Indian Army;(c) if the answer to (b) is in the affirmative, how soon should the scheme be initiatedand what steps should be taken to carry it out ? (d) whether, if a military college is established in India, it should supersede or be supplemented by Sandhurst andWoolwich as far as the training of Indian officers is concerned.3. We have decided to. appoint Committee because, as stated in our telegram of24th January, we see certain advantage to be gained in having implications of an indian Sandhurst carefully and exhaustively explored. We think enquiries of theCommittee, if properly directed, should have valuable educative effect on Indianpublic, opinion, and we are also of opinion, that full investigation of the important question of military education and training of Indians is necessary in order toprovide us with material which will be indispensable in considering any further phase of Army Indianisation. Further, we have been informed on previous occasions thatHis Majestys Government were willing to consider any proposal we might make forStraining Indian officers in India rather than at Sandhurst. References to this subjectwill be found in your telegrams 675, dated 14th February 1922,807, dated 22ndFebruary 1922, and also in your telegram 828, dated 5th April 1918.4. You will observe that the terms of reference to the Committee are not so wideas those recommended  in  the - resolution  adopted   by Legislative Assembly on19th February 1925.   In our opinion, the larger question of accelerating the pace-of Indianisation in the A.rmy is not one which Could properly be entrusted to the investigation of a Committee such as we have decided to appoint.   We may explain,[16921] d 2129. The Indian claim has been that, as promised in Queen Victoria&apos;s Proclamation,there should be no racial discrimination against Indians. To this claim full assent isgiven; but that promise did not mean, and must not be interpreted to mean, thatIndians are to be selected without regard to their fitness for the posts which they are called upon to fill. Until the capacity of India to supply a sufficient number of trained and suitable candidates has been approved, it would be extremely rash to embark on any large experiment or to pledge the future.Conclusions.130. (a) A start should be made at once so as to give Indians a fair opportunityof proving that units officered by Indians will be efficient in every way. Accordingly,eight units of Cavalry or Infantry should be selected, to be officered by Indians as now suggested by the Government of India.(b) The proposal of the Government of India that a military college should beestablished in India for the training of Indian cadets destined for service in the indian army, in view of the admittedly unsatisfactory results of the experiment of admittingIndian cadets to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, without previous training,is concurred in.
in tliis connection, that the scope of the first term of reference laid down is merelyascertainment of the means by which we can obtain competitors of better quality andin larger numbers for existing vacancies.5. We have now decided upon composition of the proposed Committee. It willhe presided over by Lieut.-Geueral Sir A. Skeen, Chief of the General Staff. Itwill include the Army Secretary and, in addition to the members of the Legislature,two representatives of the yeoman class who make service in the Army theirprofession, both these representatives having sons at Sandhurst at the present moment.6. As regards the procedure, we think it very desirable that at an early stage ofthe enquiry the Committee should be invited to select three or four of its members,who should proceed to England in order to see for themselves not only Sandhurst,Woolwich and other technical military training colleges, but also every part of themachinery which goes to the making of a British Army olhcer that is to say, theyshould visit certain selected preparatory schools and public schools. Perhaps itmight be advantageous for deputation to visit some military training institutionson the Continent also. Deputation would be accompanied by a carefully selectedmilitary officer. Matter is of so much importance that we have thought it advisable to acquaint you fully with what we propose to do. In particular, we wish toascertain definitely whether you will undertake to secure facilities which thedeputation to England would require.7. Cost of the proposed enquiry will be reported to you as soon as possible.Amount has not yet been exactly estimated. It will be considerable, but notprohibitive.8. We request reply by telegraph as soon as possible. We have not yet made any announcement on the subject, apart from undertaking given by Home member in Legislative Assembly, and we are anxious to summon the preliminary meeting ofthe Committee immediately before the August session of the Legislative Assembly.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, Army Department, dated 7th July 1925.1849. Army Department. Your telegram of the 16th May, No. 305. I have noted with interest debate in Legislative Assembly on 19th February and recogniseadvantage to be gained as stated in your para. 3 by appointment of Committee withwhich you have now decided to proceed. I agree, moreover, that institution of suchenquiry is a development which His Majesty&apos;s Government have already in the past been prepared to contemplate. Difficulties experienced in successive years inobtaining suitable recruits for Sandhurst have rendered enquiry under first term ofreference especially desirable, if not, indeed, inevitable ; and I agree that opportunitycan now usefully be taken to examine alternative methods of training under second term.As regards latter, please see suggestion made in my telegram dated 19th -Tune, No. 1696.I note your explanation of scope of first term of reference, though it remains to beseen how far Committee can deal effectually with second term without at the sametime approaching wider issues than those you have sought to define. In view of this possibility and of the bearing which in any event Committee&apos;s&apos; findings must have on existing system of recruitment of Indian officers, I propose to defer reply to yourconfidential Army Department Despatch of the 24th July 1924, No. 33, until I canconsider it in conjunction with Committee&apos;s report and your recommendations thereon.I will endeavour to secure facilities as requested in your para. 6 and willcommunicate again. Presumably suggested deputation will not arrive before October,when institutions will be in full working order.I am telegraphing separately as regards announcement in reply to your telegramof the 5th June, No. 348.APPENDIX (C).Correspondence relating to the Recent Proposals op the Governmentof India.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 18th July 1927.1473 S. Army Department. Indian Sandhurst Committee Report. We havenow completed our deliberations on main aspects of Report. Following are our provisional conclusions.
2. Although. Committee clearly exceeded intention of their terms of reference bylaying down programme for progressive increase in the number of Kmg&apos;s Commissionsfor Indians up to 1952, and although their demands appear to us insufficientlyconsidered and in consequence ill-founded, we Avelcome the opportunity afforded bythe Report of formulating&apos; definite policy in regard to Indianisation. The existing10 annual vacancies at Sandhurst were granted during the war, with no clear ideahow the officers would be disposed of. Similarly, recommendations of our predecessorsin 1921 and 1922 merely aimed at granting so many commissions to Indians withoutany reorganisation of units or formations in whicli they would serve.&quot; The eight-units scheme has merits of clearly defining area of experiment, but here againorganisation is the same as that of British officered units, which we think unsuitable.Committee recommend indiscriminate admission of Indians, in annually increasing numbers, into all units equally with British officers. It is probable that this would affect adversely supply of British officers for the Indian Army, which committee itself considers essential to efficiency. Moreover, it is also possible that War office would feel that such action might even prejudice recruitment to the British service.We should be glad to be informed of considered views of His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton.these points, which are obviously of the first importance. In any case we cannotassent to incurring possible loss of efficiency entailed by a measure which involvesexperimenting with the Indian Army as a whole. But the salient objection tothe Connnittee&apos;s proposal is that it is merely a time-table, which depends on anunascertained supply of entrants of unproved quality and seems to contemplate no definite goal.3. We consider that the time has come to acknowledge and announce publicly that the ultimate goal of Indianisation is the creation of a self-contained DominionArmy, in which the commissioned officer will hold a King&apos;s (India) Commission and units will be organised on the model of British battalions with homogeneous officerestablishments instead of two distinct types of commissions.4. We are unanimous that announcement of the main policy should be made assoon as possible. Some members were disposed to press the view that, from thedate of the announcement of the policy, new entrants to Sandhurst should be eligiblefor the Dominion type of commission only, with consequential reductions of pay, andon being commissioned should replace the Vicei&apos;oy&apos;s commissioned officers as platoonand troop leaders. Others of us, including the Commander-in-Chief, fear that if these changes were to come into operation simultaneously from the date of the announcementof policy and before the concessional measures suggested below had taken practical effect, proposals would be condemned as retrograde, candidates would be discouraged by the diminished prospects from offering themselves for commissions, whole scheme would be prejudiced and might even be wrecked at the outset. It was alsostrongly urged that it would create a difficult and undesirable situation betweenIndian and British cadets serving side by side at Sandhurst and going to join theIndian Army together if both realised that, on joining the Indian Army, the formerwould receive subordinate commission.In deference to these views we recommend that the issue of King&apos;s commissions to Indians trained at Sandhurst should be continued until the nucleus of a Dominionforce can be created, on the understanding that the change to a Dominion basis isnot indefinitely postponed and that progress in this direction will be the subject of periodical review. We recommend that Indians who enter Sandhurst in future shoiildbe posted to Indianising units either in vacancies of British officers or in those ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers as required, with a view to accelerating the conversionof the units into British or Dominion pattern.5. We contemplate, therefore, that Indians receiving King&apos;s commissions should in future be posted to the smallest number of units, not less than eight, that is capableof absorbing them, and in practice, therefore, it may be taken that our proposals are a continuance of principle of eight-units scheme. We consider that it mustbe recognised from the beginning that completely Indianised units of cavalry,infantry and pioneers may prove less efficient than British officered units, and, if so,that when time comes the resulting deficiency in the forces available for the defenceof India must be made good,&apos; either by additional British troops or by additionalIndian.troops with British officers.6. In 1921 the then Government of India accepted a Resolution of the assembly that no less than 25 per cent, of King&apos;s Commissions granted every year should begiven to Indians to start with, and supported (sic) the proposal to His Majesty&apos;s
Government, who, however, were unable to approve it. The Assembly was so informed in July 1923. The Committee has expressed strong views againstcontinuing the restrictions to number of vacancies originally allotted in 1918 on theground that such,narrow numbers afford too scanty inducement to material to come forward. We think there is force in this contention, and are also of opinion that theexisting numbers are insufficient to give initial effect to policy which we ourselves now recommended. We should accordingly propose to increase the vacancies for directcommissions through Sandhurst to 20, and to give five commissions annually, throughSandhurst also, to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers on the lines of commissions now given to rankers in the British service. Shortage in the 20 vacancies might be made good by increasing the number of commissions granted to Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers up to a maximum of 10 in any one&apos;year. We would permit no lowering of standard in the entrance examination. Further, we propose that Committee&apos;recommendation of eight annual vacancies at Woolwich and two at Cranwell beaccepted, on condition stipulated by Committee that Indian bombs^s shall be required topass the same entrance test as British boys. Indian entrants to artillery could beattached to mountain batteries on being commissioned, with a view to eventualformation of separate Dominion artillery units. The question of creating Indianartillery, other than mountain batteries, must be reserved for later consideration.Similarly, engineer officers would serve with sapper and miner companies, militaryengineering services and signal companies. Indians commissioned from Cranwellwould be attached to units of the Royal Air Force in India until such time as an indian Air Force is instituted under scheme which has been put forward by the air officer Commanding. We reserve for further consideration type of commission to begranted to Indians in Indian Air Force.7. We are unanimous that, on grounds of military efficiency and economy, thequestion of the establishment of an Indian Military College should be postponed until Sandhurst is no longer capable of absorbing Indian cadets in the numbersforthcoming. We think that in future as many as possible of the first officers of theDominion Army should have received their military education with British cadets atSandhurst.We make no proposal for increasing the number of vacancies at Sandhurst beyond25, since we anticipate that it will be some years before we regularly obtain that number, and until we have had experience of the result of extending the numbersit would be useless to make further recommendations. If the requisite material isfound to be forthcoming, we should contemplate gradual expansion of numbers wehave given, and we should be glad to learn in due course the maximum number of indians which Army and Air Councils would be prepared to admit annually toSandhurst, Woolwich and Cranwell in the future.8. In view of our inability to recommend immediate institution of IndianSandhurst, we realise that many of the best types of candidates may be lost to thearmy through the extra charges imposed on parents by the cost of sending their sonsto England. We propose, with reference to recommendation (24) in Appendix 1 ofEeport, to institute scholarships to enable Indian boys to meet the expenses ofeducation at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell. The maximum amount admissiblewould be based on the difference between this cost and assumed cost of education atan Indian Military College. Subject to this maximum, Commander-in-Chief shouldhave full discretion to regulate the amount of scholarships according to the pecuniarycircumstances of individual cadets.* 9. As regards pay, we think that an overseas element should be created in existing pay of Indian Army officers, and that Indians entering Sandhurst under new system should be ineligible for this element,10. We recommend also that the official guardian of Indians at Sandhurst shouldbe a serving officer, who would be very carefully selected.11. Resolutions on the subject of the Committee&apos;s Report have been tabled in theAssembly and Council of State. A pledge was given in the Assembly last sessionthat there would he. full opportunity for discussion of the Report before the final decisions were taken. It would be convenient for us if, in meeting the resolutions, wecould announce the main features of the scheme which we have outlined in this telegramas our provisional conclusions and invite the Bouse to express its opinion. Weshould be careful to explain that our proposals had not yet been sanctioned by HisMajesty&apos;s Government, with whom the final decision lies. After debate in theAssembly we would propose to address you by despatch dealing fully with the whole
question. If you consider that disclosure of any. of our proposals, even on this understanding, might prove embarrassing to His Majesty&apos;s Government, we would do our best to say nothing under that particular head. But it would help us considerably in meeting inevitable criticism to be able to announce the following: namely, the reservation of 25 vacancies annually at Sandhurst, S at Woolwich and 2 at(&quot;ranwell; the grant of scholarships a&quot;nd the appointment of a specially selectedofficer on the active list as official guardian to Indian cadets in England.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 19th July 1927.1939. - Army Department. Your telegram of 18th July, 1473 S. Indian sandhurst committee Report. Do you intend Woolwich and Cranwell cadets to get King&apos;commissions for the present or Dominion Commissions from the beginning? Pleasereply urgently.Telegram from Secretary of State to Viceroy, dated 29th July 1927.2099. Army Department. Your telegram of the 18th July, No. 1473 S. IndianSandhurst Committee Report. It has not been possible in the time available before the rising of Parliament to obtain the opinion of the Committee of Imperial Defence on your proposals, and I should not be justified in assuming that War Office and the AirMinistry will not oppose the policy of a self-contained Dominion Army as the xdtimategoal of Indianisation. In these circumstances its announcement by you, howevemuch guarded by an explanation that it was provisional and that the final decisiorlay with His Majesty&apos;s Government, could not but lead to difficulties. In some quarters the announcement would almost certainly be taken to be the consideredpolicy of Government and there would be risk of charges of breach of faith ; and inany case the disclosure of differences between your Government and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment on so important a matter would be embarrassing.I regret, therefore, that I cannot agree to the announcement of the policy which you propose.The question remains whether it would still be possible to announce yourprovisional views on points of detail mentioned in the last paragraph of your telegram.An announcement of 25 vacancies at Sandhurst would be misleading, for it would naturally be taken as implying the replacement of 15 more&apos; British officers a yearby Indians, wheieas your actual intention, as I understand it, was to utilise theadditional 15 Sandhurst cadets to replace officers with the Viceroy&apos;s Commission.As regards the Woolwich and Cranwell cadetships the indications are that WarOffice and Air Ministry are as strongly opposed as ever to the grant of King&apos;commissions, and the announcement you propose, in advance of a Cabinet decision in support of it, would be only less embarrassing than an announcement on the major question of Army organisation. An announcement of the two minor questions that remain would, you will agree, serve no purpose.I regret, therefore, that I must ask you to make no statement at all of your viewson the questions arising out of the Indian Sandhurst Report. I recognise that this may expose your Government to criticism in the Assembly; but there has been no time for adequate consideration by His Majesty&apos;s Government of the large questions raised by the Report, and the undertaking to the Assembly did not go beyond a promise that an opportunity for discussion would be given when the Government ofIndia, after consiritation with His Majesty&apos;s Government, were in a position to informthe Assembly.Telegram from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India, dated20th August 1927.1762 S. Your telegram of the 19th July, 1989. Type of commission for woolwich and Cranwell cadets. Our recommendation is that Indians passing out of Cranwellshould not be granted full Eing&apos;s Commission, but exact form of commission to begiven-to- them will be reserved for further consideration. Indians passing out of woolwich should have precisely same type of commission as Indians passing outof Sandhurst, for the reason that they will be as much members of the Indian army as Indians who come from Sandhurst.
Despatch No. 38, from Viceroy, Army Department, to Secretary of State for India,dated 13th October 1927.Indian Sandhurst Committees Report.My Lord,In paragraph 11 of our Army Department telegram No. 1473 S., datedthe 18th July, we stated our intention of addressing Your Lordship by despatchon the whole subject of the Indian Sandhurst Committee&apos;s Report after the debate inthe Simla session of the Legislative Assembly. A Resolution was moved in theLegislative Assembly urging the immediate adoption of the recommendations inthe Report. The debates on the Resolution took place on the 25th August andthe 13th September, and there was a debate on a similar Resolution in the Councilof State on the 31st August. We invite Your Lordship&apos;s attention to theseproceedings.2. Lord Reading&apos;s Government informed Your Lordship at the time of theappointment of the Committee that the scope of the first term of reference to theCommittee was merely the ascertainment of means by which the Government of india could obtain for existing vacancies competitors of better quality and in larger numbers. They observed that the larger question of accelerating the pace ofIndianisation in the Army was, in their opinion, not one which could profitably beentrusted to the investigation of the Committee. Your Lordship, in your telegramNo. 1849, dated 7th July 1925, noted this explanation of the first term of reference,but added that it remained to be seen how far the Committee would deal effectuallywith the second term (whether it is desirable and. practicable to establish a MilitaryCollege in India) without at the same time approaching wider issues. It must beadmitted that the Committee have addressed themselves principally to acceleratedIndiauisation, and have relegated the question of the improvement of the quality of candidates more or less to the background. Their primary recommendation is that asubstantial and progressive scheme for the Indianisation of the Indian Army beadopted without delay. This scheme is set forth in Appendix II, and its main features are summarised in paragraph 21 of the Report. xAccelerated Indianisationof the commissioned ranks of the Army was part of the policy advocated in theLegislative Assembly Resolution which led to the appointment of the Indian sandhurst committee. Although it was deliberately left out of the terms of reference to theCommittee for the reasons given above, the Committee, in their proceedings, appearto have concentrated more and more upon it, and there is no doubt that the public for a considerable time past have supposed that the object of the appointment of theCommittee was to consider further measures of Inclianisatiou. Speaking in theLegislative Assembly on the 13th September last, Mr. Jinnah, a member ofthe Committee, said: &quot;The policy was and I do not want the House to forget it  to accelerate the Inclianisation of the officer ranks of the Army in India. Thosewere, inter alia, the tgrms of reference to the Committee.&quot; The argument which theCommittee used to justify their embarking on a wider problem than was specificallyreferred to them will be found in paragraph 20 of the Report. It is, briefly, that solong as vacancies available for Indian candidates are limited to ten a year with no prospect of increase, it would be useless to adopt other measures for the improvementof the supply of candidates.3. We did not think it desirable to stress the fact that the recommendations of theCommittee had gone beyond what the Government of India intended. Looking backon the event, it seems to us inevitable that this should have happened. If theCommittee had not amplified the first term of reference, they would have raised thequestion of further Indianisation, as Your Lordship foresaw, on the second. It wouldhave been idle to propound a scheme for a military college with an annual outturn often officers only--a point which did not escape the Committee (paragraph 44).The Committee, in a note to paragraph 6 of their Report, quoted the Resolution,accepted by Government in the Legislative Assembly on the 28th March 1921, to theeffect that not less than 25 per cent, of the King&apos;s commissions granted every year. should be given to His Majesty&apos;s Indian subjects to start with. They must also havebeen aware of the fact stated in paragraph 6 of our telegram that the Government ofIndia recommended this proposal to the Secretary of State. They doubtless felt thatthey were justified in putting forward a policy which the Government of India hadformally adopted in 1921, but had so far done nothing to carry out. Moreover, the language of the foreword with which we published the Report implied that we
acquiesced in the course taken by the Committee, and that we were prepared to dealwith the Report as a scheme for progressive Indianisation. Finally, as we informedYour Lordship in paragraph 6 of &quot;our telegram of the 18th July 1927, an increase ofIndianisation is necessary to the scheme which we ourselves propose. accordingly the Commander-in-Chief, speaking in the Legislative Assembly, accepted theconclusion of the Committee on this point, and made it clear that the government intended to deal with the Report on those lines. There was, and is still,&apos; someapprehension, accentuated by the delay in publishing the Report, by the fact that itwas thought necessary to prefix a foreword to it, and by the decision not to publish the report of the Sub-Committee which visited Europe and America, that Governmentwould welcome an excuse to evade, or at any rate postpone, action on the Report. Ifwe had lent further colour to this idea by emphasising in the course of the debatesthat the Committee had exceeded their terms of reference and ought not to have dealtwith accelerated Indianisation, we should only have excited greater hostility, at thetime, and weakened our subsequent position, when our proposals become public.4. Having, however-, recommended a policy of increased Indianisation, theCommittee could not, without palpably exceeding their terms of reference, advisein detail on the method of carrying it into effect. They therefore contented them-selves with condemning the present eight-unit system as an invidious form ofsegregation, and recommending that Indian officers should be eligible, as previously,for admission into all units of cavalry, infantry and pioneers. We regard this verdicton the principle of the eight-unit scheme as unreal. There is nothing invidious in apolicy of Indianisation by units. The Indian officers who are posted to the units inquestion are serving, and will serve for many years to come, with British officers, meeting as equals in the mess and in their sports and games, and, as was stated both by Britishand Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers in their evidence before the Committee, living-together on the friendliest terms. To call such a state of affairs segregation seems tous absurd ; and we have formed the impression that those Indian officers who usedsuch expressions in their evidence before the Committee were not altogetherunprompted. One of them, for instance, mentioned that he had taken the word&quot; segregation &quot; from a newspaper. We should have expected young Indian officers to welcome a scheme that entrusts to them whole battalions to make their own, whileassuring them of the control and guidance of British officers until they reach theseniority requisite for command. The real objection to the eight-unit scheme in itspresent form is not that it is invidious in character, but that it is too narrow in scope.On the other hand, the proposal to draft young Indian officers together with british officers into all units would not only dissipate the experiment over the wholearmy, but also indefinitely postpone its results. If the Committee&apos;s recommendations were accepted and candidates were forthcoming in the numbers laid down by them,it would follow that by 1952 half the officers of the Indian Army would be Indiansserving with approximately equal numbers of British officers in each unit. Battalionswould be neither British-officered nor Indianised ; and the Government of India ofthat time would be little, if at all, nearer than we are now to answering the questionwhether Indian officers can undertake without aid the leadership and command oflarge bodies of troops. If, however, we retain the system of the eight units, thoseunits should be officered entirely by Indians some years before 1952.5. While we therefore accept the Committee&apos;s recommendation for increasing thenumber of King&apos;s commissions to be granted to Indians, we consider it essential to frame a policy which will both define the goal of Indianisation to be ultimatelyreached, and provide in detail the method of reaching it. Our aim, if we can obtainsufficient officer material, is the eventual creation of a &quot;Dominion&quot; army, that is, anarmy manned and officered throughout by Indians, and comprising all arms in whichIndians desire to serve and to bear commissioned rank. It is through the creationof such a force that India can fulfil her aspirations and ultimately undertake theresponsibility for any part qf her own defence by land. We do not attempt to forecast at this stage to what extent the &quot;Dominion&quot; army will in time replaceeither British troops or British-officered Indian troops. We feel, however, that anyfurther expansion of Indianisation in the Indian Army should follow the general principle of the eight-units scheme, i.e. that Indian officers must be trained by, and in association with, British officers in units set aside for the purpose, with the object ofassuming in due course the command of such units, and thereafter, if the experimentsucceeds, rising to higher command in Indianised forces.[16921] e
6. We have recommended increasing the vacancies for direct commissions throughSandhurst to 20 as proposed by the Committee, and giving five commissions annually,through Sandhurst also, to young officers holding the Viceroy&apos;s Commission. We donot suggest any programme for increasing these numbers until we have full experienceof the results of the initial step. As stated in para. 3 of our telegram of the 18th .1 uly,we propose that the officer establishment of Indianised units should eventually be assimilated to that of British battalions, and that Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers should gradually disappear from them. In reaching this conclusion, we wereinfluenced by several considerations. In the first place, where Indian troops areto be officered by Indians there should be no need for a link between officers and mensuch as is provided by the existing class of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers; andit is clearly desirable that an Indian officer in an Indian regiment, like the british officer in a British regiment, should learn his work in that close association withthe men which is involved by the leadership of a troop or platoon. Secondly, aconsiderable proportion of the candidates for the King&apos;s commission will always besupplied by what are for convenience called the &quot;martial&quot; races, from whom theexisting personnel of the Indian Army are drawn. The Committee, it is true,recommend that, in selecting candidates for commissions, preference for soldiers&apos; sonsshould in future become the exception rather than the rule ; and they quote a high authority in the present Governor of the Punjab to the effect that this preference should not be made a fixed item in the policy of selection. We anticipate, however,that whether a preference for families with military connections be shown in selectionor not, as a matter of fact the bulk of the candidates will still come from these&quot;martial&quot; classes. Sir Malcolm Hailey himself said no more than that he would-always be prepared to admit a proportion of men from the professional classes,provided that candidates came forward with the necessary qualifications, and withthe appearance of having the temperament necessary to make good officers. we need not emphasise the futility of perpetuating superior and subordinate types of commission, where both types are held by officers of the same classes and evenfamilies. On the other hand, there are indications of uneasiness among the classesto which we have referred, and to which the majority of Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers belong, at the prospect of a large influx of Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers with no military traditions and no previous connection with the army. The relationsbetween officers of this kind and the old-fashioned Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officerwithin units are likely to be difficult ; friction and consequent inefficiency may ensue.Whichever class of King&apos;s commissioned officer prevails, therefore, the ViceroyVcommissioned officer should be eliminated from a completely Indianised force.7. We found some difficulty in deciding on the most suitable time for-bringing theofficer establishments of Indianising units into conformity with the British pattern.There are two possible courses. The first, to which some of us were inclined,is to continue posting Indian officers in replacement of British officers alone,until such time as the number of fndian cadets approaches the maximum thatSandhurst could accommodate. The reconstruction of officer establishments on theBritish pattern would then follow naturally upon the establishment of a militarycollege in India. In order to absorb the increased entry of Indian officers, it wouldbe necessary to begin adding to. the number of Indianising units earlier than.itwould be if the British pattern were adopted at once. This would be done byear-marking for Indianisation, as occasion required, battalions in regiments or groupsthat did not already contain an Indianising battalion. The great advantage of thiscourse is that it involves a minimum of dislocation. The eight units would be expanded, within strictly defined limits, exactly in proportion as more Indian officersbecame available. At the same time, the sentimental demand that the status and functions of the Indian officer should be in all respects similar to those of the british officer in the Indian Army would remain satisfied until the moment when a more practical aspiration, namely, an Indian Military College, had become a reality. Themain objection to the plan is that it would multiply the number of Indian officers with the ordinary King&apos;s Commission indefinitely, since we cannot foretell when the/full quota that Sandhurst can accommodate will be exceeded ; and so long as Indiansjoin the Army with the same status as British officers it would be difficult, for thereasons given in para. 4 of our telegram,, to confer on them a different form of commission. Those of us who favoured postponement of the reconstruction of officerestablishments were, however, agreed that this&apos; change should be announced, as a development to take place later, at the same time as the other decisions on the
Committee&apos;s Report,. After much deliberation, we concluded that the longer wepostponed the actual change, the greater would be its difficulty, and that thereconstruction should begin as soon as the opening of the 25 vacancies produces a supply of Indian officers ready for posting to Indian Army units, over and above what is necessary to replace British officers in the eight units. This will not takeplace before October 1931 at the earliest. Our final recommendation is, therefore,to appoint Indians to specified units, in the manner described in paras. 1-and 5 of our telegram, until a continuous supply of good material is available in greater numbersthan Sandhurst can take. At that point the Government of India would be facedwith the obligation to establish a military college in India. In the meantime, weshoiild contemplate continuing to post Indians to specified units in place of british officers, so long as such vacancies can be made available. There is, of course, no intention of appointing- Indians to be Squadron or Company Commanders until theyhave the requisite seniority. If and when such vacancies are no longer available, weshould propose to post Indians to the units in vacancies created by the transfer ofViceroy&apos;s commissioned officers.8. A scheme by which Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers are merely substitutedfor Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers appears at first sight to constitute no advance inIndianisation, but rather to deprive Indians to some extent of the opportunities whichthey already possess, and our proposals will almost certainly be criticised in this sense. The argument is, however, theoretical and political rather than practical, and ought not, in our opinion, to deter candidates who have a military career at heart.To the cadet himself it makes no difference in his prospects of promotion whether hebegins his career as a platoon leader or a company officer. In either case he willbe promoted to the command of a company at the same stage in his service, i.e. after about 16 or 17 years. To meet political criticism it can be pointed out that whilethe proposal admittedly does not add to the total number of Indians holdingcommissions of one type or the other in the Indian Army, it more &quot;than doubles thenumber of King&apos;s Commissions available to Indians.We have carefully considered whether the closing of Viceroy&apos;s commissions inIndianising units will have a harmful effect on recruitment. We think this most unlikely. The rank and file will still be eligible for Viceroy&apos;s commissions in other,non-indianising, units of the same regiment or group, while our proposals for grantingKing&apos;s Commissions to selected Viceroy&apos;s commissioned officers will greatly improve the prospects of this class of officer as a whole.9. We have recommended that, for the present, Indian officers recruited underthe new conditions should continue to receive the same type of commission as british officers, and the same rates of pay, less an overseas element which will not be grantedto Indians who enter Sandhurst after the inauguration of our proposals. We havenot yet elaborated details under either of these heads. We are unanimously ofopinion, however, that the type of commission should be a King&apos;s Commission,limited, like the King&apos;s Commission in the Royal Indian Marine and in the proposed new Indian Navy, to the force in which it is granted.10. We now turn to the question of the admission of Indians to Woolwich andCranwell for service in the Artillery, Engineers and Air Force. We have already informed Your Lordship that we recommend acceptance of the Committee&apos;s proposal that eight vacancies should be available annually at Woolwich and two at Cranwellto Indians, on the condition that Indian candidates should be required to pass thesame entrance tests as British boys. The Committee have not made it clear how they intend that Indians graduating from these colleges should be employed on their return to India. It might be inferred from para. 22 of the Report that they meantsuch officers to be employed in British service units, an arrangement which we recognise to be impossible. We have, however, in the Indian Mountain Batteries an organisation into which Indian officers passing out of Woolwich can.be absorbed. Ifthey are forthcoming, it will probably be necessary to set apart a battery, and later on batteries, for Indianisation, in the same way as units of the cavalry and infantry.We wish to emphasise that Indian Mountain Batteries are integral parts of the indian army, and that Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers in these batteries must be giventhe same status in all respects as Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers fromSandhurst. The same considerations apply to Indians who pass out of Wooiwich asEngineer officers, and are employed in Sapper and Miner battalions. Here also itwill probably be necessary to earmark certain units for Indianisation. A further[16921] e
and useful opportunity for the employment of Indian Engineer officers will be offered by the Military Engineering- Services. We endorse the Committee&apos;s recommendation that Indians should lie eligible to serve in India in the Signal Corps, in which againit would probably be found expedient to establish a separate Indianisiug unit as soonas a sufficient number of Indian King&apos;s commissioned officers becomes available. Asregards Cranwell and the employment of Indians in an Air Force, we have little to add to a memorandum on this subject by Air Vice-Marshal Sir W. G. H. Salmond,Commanding Royal &quot;Air Force in India, a copy of which we enclose. &apos; The creation ofan Indian Air Force will necessitate some legislation, there being at present no IndianAir Force Act. This matter does not, however, require instant decision, as sometime will elapse before any Indian cadet may be expected to pass out of Cranwell.For the same reason the exact form of commission to be granted to Indian Air force officers may be left for later consideration as recommended in our telegram No. 1762 S,dated the 28th August 1927. We trust that your Lordship will impress upon theArmy and Air Councils the importance of rendering Indian cadets eligible for admission to Woolwich and Cranwell to the limited extent proposed. Although wedo not anticipate a large number of candidates for these vacancies, the mere fact of opening the two colleges to Indians will gratify Indian public opinion and remove along-standing grievance.11. The Committee have not touched upon the employment of Indian officers in ancillary units and departments such as the Indian Army Service Corps, Indian ArmyOrdnance Corps, Army Remount Department, Military Farms Department, &amp;c, orin the Cantonments Department, the Survey of India, the Foreign and PoliticalDepartment, and other civil departments into which Indian Army officers are permitted to transfer. We consider that Indians should be eligible, if qualified, to serve in anyof these departments. There are, as your Lordship is aware, Indian King&apos;scommissioned officers already serving in the Foreign and Political Department.12. The Committee have severely criticised the present methods of selection ofIndian candidates for Sandhurst in para. 14 of the Report. While we are not convincedthat the Ararious official stages to which the Committee refer have the effect ofdeterring suitable candidates, we are prepared to adopt the recommendationsnumbered (x) and (xi) in Appendix I of the Report, in so far as they are applicableto candidates for Sandhurst. We do not think that the local advisory committeessuggested in recommendation (xiii) would serve a useful purpose. their recommendations would have no authority, and as soon as they found, as they might,that their views were disregarded by candidates or over-ruled by the selectingauthority, they would cease to function with enthusiasm or efficiency. Indeed, it isdifficult to see what inducement could be offered to non-officials to serve on such committees at all. In practice, the submission of applications direct to a centralauthority will probably not eliminate the local officials through whom applicationsmust now be sent. The central authority will in most cases require the opinion ofthese local officials as well as that of the authorities of the school or college in whichthe candidate was educated. We are, however, in agreement with the Committeethat District Officers and Commissioners should not retain the power to reject a candidate&apos;s application themselves.We have no objection to the minor recommendation of the Committee in para. 27of the Report, that a non-official Indian gentleman nominated by the Viceroy should sit on the Board that conducts the interview test.13/ We entirely concur with the Committee&apos;s observations in paras. 11 and 24 ofthe Report on the defects of the educational system in India, and the necessity for animprovement before a steady flow of first-class candidates can be expected. The loweducational standard of candidates who at present offer themselves for Sandhurst iswell known and has become a source of growing anxiety. We are doubtful whetherthe recommendation of the Sub-Committee quoted in para. 24, namely, that theimportance of the matter should be brought to the notice of the educationalauthorities and their co-operation enlisted, will in itself have very much effect.Reform in this respect can only be achieved by public opinion and. effort. The. quality of candidates for the existing vacancies shows at present no signs of improving, and the selection authorities are confronted with the dilemma of eithereaving vacancies unfilled or of sending to Sandhurst boys who have but little chanceof passing out, and so enhancing the already high percentage of failure referred toIn para. 9 of the &quot;Report.   We hope that the measures adopted as the result of the
Committee&apos;s recommendations will improve the situation, and we think that there isforce in the contention that the present supply is adversely restricted by the small number of vacancies offered. At the same time we are not sanguine that the wholeof the vacancies which we propose to declare can be regularly filled from now onwards by candidates with a reasonable prospect of passing out of Sandhurst. Itis, however, possible that the methods of publicity proposed in para. 26 of the report may help to discover good material, and we intend to follow the recommendations inthat paragraph.14. The Committee mentioned the expense of Sandhurst as one of the factors which deters suitable candidates from coming forward. We agree with their viewthat the expenditure involved is beyond the capacity of the average Indian parentbelonging to the middle classes. We have proposed as a remedy, in para. 8 of our telegram of the 18th July 1927, the institution of Government grants proportionate tothe pecuniary needs of individual cadets, to enable them to meet the expenses ofeducation at Sandhurst, Woolwich or Cranwell. This Avill relieve youug indian officers who pass out of Sandhurst of a heavy financial handicap at the outset oftheir service, and those who fail of a dead loss which further embitters theirdisappointment. It will incidentally counteract the only valid argument againstcreating an overseas element in the pay of military officers and treating Indians inthis respect in the same way as Indians in the Civil Services.15. We concur generally in the recommendations made by the Committee in para. 34 of the Report for the improvement of the system of guardianship. Wherethe cadet or his parents are in a position to select a personal friend as guardian, we agree that such a person should be appointed, but subject to the approval of theSecretary of State. We agree also that the official guardian appointed to look aftersuch cadets as are unable to find a personal guardian should be selected with theutmost care. He should in our opinion be more directly amenable to control than are tired officer can be, and for this reason we have proposed that the post should be filled by an officer on the active list. In framing this recommendation we haveiguored the personal strictures of the Sub-Committee which visited Sandhurst on thepresent official guardian. Those strictures were obviously biassed, and in any case we are concerned, not with individuals, but with the system.16. We think that the above measures should remove whatever obstacles atpresent exist to prevent Indian youths of the right stamp and inclinations from entering upon a military career. As we have explained in para. 7 of our telegram,we do not wish to set up an Indian military college so long as Sandhurst canaccommodate the annual entry of Indian cadets. The Committee emphasise theimportance of placing the machinery of the Indian Military College on the highestplane of efficiency which India can attain. We do not consider that such a college,if inaugui-ated now, or as early as 1933, the year proposed by the Committee, wouldhe comparable with Sandhurst as a producer of efficient Indian officers, howevergreat the pains that were bestowed upon it. We do not wish to see such a collegeestablished before there is reasonable prospect of its being an institution of thehighest class. This will not occur until Indian officers of proved capacity, themselvesgraduates of Sandhurst, are available to take part, with British officers, in the conductof the Indian college; nor before candidates of the requisite stamp are available in larger numbers than can be accepted by. Sandhurst itself.17. We are in sympathy with the remarks in para. 29 of the Committee&apos;s report about the grant of University Commissions and the inability of Indians at present toenter the Officers&apos; Training Corps at Universities. We have represented this matter on several occasions, and we are aware that your Lordship has supported our representations to the authorities concerned. We hope that the university andmilitary authorities in England may in time be induced to reconsider their decision,and to allow Indian students to become members of the Officers&apos; Training Corps.18. We trust that His Majesty&apos;s Government will give early and sympathetic consideration to our proposals. The problem is one of great complexity and has remained too long unsolved. We have endeavoured to avoid the error of submitting proposals for increased Indianisation without fully estimating the implications ofsuch proposals. Our aim is to design a structure, based on clear principles, whichwill successfully function when complete, and. involve a minimum of risk while it isbeing built up.   As we observed in oar telegram, if Indianisation means a loss of
efficiency, that loss must be made good in other ways. Our Army at its present strength barely suffices for the external and internal defences of the country. Theoutlook on our frontiers is not without anxiety ; in India the communal situation has probably never been more strained. We have received from almost every LocalGovernment a demand for an increase of troops for internal security purposes. TheIndianisation of the officer ranks of the Indian Army manifestly involves a greatexperiment and a great change. We cannot afford to make that experiment with theIndian Army as a whole. By providing for the gradual evolution of a distinctiveIndian-officered force comprising all arms we hope not only to initiate progress uponthe right lines, but also to appeal to the patriotism of Indians of the educated classes,and evoke in them a more widespread and genuine desire to bear arms iu defence oftheir country than can be said to exist at present.We have, &amp;c,(Signed)      W. R. ButnwooD,&amp;c,      &amp;c.Letter from Secretary to Government of India to India Office, dated 10th October 1927.Sir,    &apos;I am directed to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for indian Council, that His Excellency the Viceroy approved the Army Department despatch no. 38, dated the 13th October, before leaving Simla on tour on the 10th October,but the despatch could not be completed for signature by that date. His Excellencydesired this to be conveyed to the India Office, to explain the absence of his signaturefrom the Despatch.I have, &amp;c,G. M. Young.Enclosure to Despatch.Memorandum by the Air Officer Commanding Royal Air Force in India on the Reportof the Indian Sandhurst Committee. -;  :.1. I wish to record the fact that, during thewhole of the proceedings of the Indian sandhurst committee, no evidence, as far&apos; as I know, was called for from the R.A.F. in India. This appearsto be extremely difficult to understand when theReport contains definite recommendations affectingthis Service.2. Terms of reference. The terms of reference of the Committee were framed with a view toenquiring into the further Indianisation of theIndian Army. The substitution of British Officersby Indians in Units outside the Indian Army suchas the British Army in India, was clearly not within the terms of reference. The R.A.F. inIndia is on the same footing as the British Armyin India, consequently the terms of reference did.not include the consideration of Indian Officersbeing trained to substitute British Officers in theR.A.F. in India. On the other hand, in the firstterm of reference, it may be held that the Committeewas entitled to consider the question of the supplyof Indian candidates for the King&apos;s Commission ina unit yet to be formed such as an Indian AirForce Squadron.Assuming that this was the intention, the recom-mendation contained in para. 22 of the report has to be considered. This recommendation statesthat, &quot; the refusal of commissions in the R.A.F.is, in our opinion, singularly indefensible,&quot; &amp;c..This means either (a) that Indians should be corn-missioned in the R.A.F. in India, or (6) that theyshould be commissioned in order that ultimatelythey should form part of an Indian Air Force unit in India.With regard to (a). As already stated, thisproposal is, in my opinion, outside the terms ofreference.   The R.A.F. in India are on the same&apos; footing as the British Army in India; if Indiansweru commissioned in the R.A.F. in India,  they. would be liable to serve in the Royal Air Force inall parts of the world where units of this service were stationed. It would be impracticable to guarantee that they would always remain as officersof R. A.F. units in India; to do so would be creating a precedent never before established. This principle without question would be unacceptable to the air council.As regards (b). This solution involves a policywhich has, hitherto, not been considered. It isdesirable, however, owing to the general trend ofIndianisation, that the question of the ultimateformation of an Indian Air Service should&apos; be explored. In this connection it should be notedthat no general desire to fly has been shown by the three hundred million inhabitants of India.Compare this state of affairs to that in Englandwhen flying became possible in 1907. Not onlydid young men rush to be trained at the variousschools, but they went so far as to do so underassumed names in order that their parents shouldbe kept in ignorance of what they were doing;moreover, they did this at their own expense and before any service outlet for flying had been decided upon. In England, therefore, the background ofthe desire to fly existed from the outset. This,certainly, has not been the case in India. Duringthe Great-War, it is believed four Indians offeredthemselves and were trained for service with theR.A.F., of which one distinguished himself andone was killed in action. It may be contended thatthis reluctance to fly was due to the fact that facilities for flying did not exist in India. Howevertrue this may be, the facilities for flying are now about to be afforded in consequence of the formationof light aeroplane clubs in India under the Directorof Civil Aviation. When Indians, as a result ofthe formation of these clubs, show that they havea desire and capacity to fly, then, in my opinion,it will be time to proceed with the training ofIndian cadets at Cranwell. Such a procedure would have the added advantage that, beforeIndians were sent to undergo an expensive training-
in England, the possibility of their failing atCranwell would be, to a large extent, lessened.This procedure should be welcome by Indianparents as not only safeguarding their financial interests but also preventing subsequent misunder-standing and disappointment.3. The system recommended for the developmentof an Indian Air Force is as follows : Cadets should be selected from those qualifyingat any one of the following educational establish-ments : (a) Dehra Dun,(b) A British Public School,(c) An approved Indian Public School,if and when established. They should be requiredto pass the same examination as British cadetsbefore entering Cranwell. The examination shouldbe competitive. Successful candidates should thenqualify for their &quot; A. &quot; certificate at one of the lightaeroplane clubs in India. The standard of flying-required to obtain this certificate is of an elementarynature and would, in the normal course, require nolonger than four to six months&apos; tuition-. In theevent of failure, the next on the competitive list asa result of the examination should be selected, andso on. The cadets finally selected would then proceed to Cranwell. After graduating&apos; at Cranwell,tbey would be gazetted to a Commission in theIndian Air Force and return to India, where theywould be attached to Regular Royal Air Force squadrons, pending the formation of a unit of theIndian Air Force.4. The type of commission and the status it willconfer in. relation to a King&apos;s Commission orViceroy&apos;s Commission is a matter for subsequentdecision. It is understood that a similar questionis under consideration by Army Headquai&quot;ters, andit seems probable that, whatever solution is reachedregarding commissioned officers in the Indianisedunits in the Army, the same will be suitable for officers of the Indian Air Force.It is clear that Indian officers of the Indian Armyand Indian Air Force should have equivalent status.5. It is considered essential that, as regardsestablishment and organisation, the squadrons ofthe Indian Air Force should conform, as closely as possible, to units of the British Air Force, thusconforming with the policy which has been followed in the case of the Dominion Air Forces in Canada.South Africa and Australia.These squadrons comprise 12 aircraft and a totalof 21 officers (excluding one Medical Officer)and are organised in three sub-formations termedFlights, each consisting of three machines with aFlight Commaader and three pilots. The squadronis commanded by a Squadron Leader (the equivalent in Army Rank is Major). Among these officers,certain arc required to possess specialist qualificationsto perform the duties of Armament Officer, SignalOfficer and Photographic Officer. The trainingreqiured to qualify officers for these functionscannot be carried out by units of the Royal AirForce in India. But there are special schools of instruction in England dealing with each of these subjects, and selected Indian cadets, after qualifyingat Cranwell, will have to undertake the course at these schools before returning to India.6. The squadrons of the Royal Air Force areclassified according to the functions they perform,e.g. Army Co-operation, Fighting, Bombing, &amp;c.After consideration, it is thought that the typemost suitable to the requirements of an Indian AirForce is the Army Co-operation Squadron ; theestablishment and organisation quoted above arethose appertaining to this type.7. The development suggested for the raising ofan Indian Air Force Squadron is as follows: Stage I. Squadron   Leader,   Royal   Air   Force(Commanding Officer).(a.) Squadron H.Q., partly R.A.F., partlyIndian.(b) One Flight, Royal Air Force.(c) One Flight Indian, with R.A.F. FlightCommander.Stage II.  (o) and (5) as in Stage I.(c) Two   Flights   Indian, with   RA.F.Flight Commanders.Stage III.  (a) and (6) as in Stage I.Three Indian Flights -with three IndianFlight Commanders.Stvge IV. Squadron as. Indian unit complete, all british personnel withdrawn.8. The intake of officers at Cranwell proposedby the Skeen Report is two per annum. Thefollowing table shows the period required to formsuch a squadron by stages, assuming entries toCranwell at the rate of 2 and 3 per annumrespectively.Annual Intake.	Period at Cranwell.	Stage I. Years to complete after Cran-vvell.	Stage II. Years to complete.	Stage III. Years to complete.	Stage IV. Years to complete.	Total Years.	Total officers trained in period.	Total wastage.	Available.Cadets. 2 3	2 2	3 2	6 4	9 6	14 10	16           28 12           30		7 7	21 23From the above it will be seen that with anintake of two cadets per annum at Cranwell the squadron can be completed with Indian personnel in 16 years : with an intake of three cadets perannum, completion can be effected in 12 years.[Note. The figure for wastage (7) is .possibly high, huta margin is necessary to allow for failures at Cranwell,resignation and casualties; any credit balance under this heading will be an asset.]Stages III and IV are the important stages, since in Stage III Indian Flight Commanders are appointed and in Stage IV the command of the squadron willbe taken over by an Indian.On an entry of two cadets per annum, pilots willhave had nine years&apos; service by the time Stage IIIis reached ; this period of training should be suffi-cient to produce the required number of officers with the necessary experience to enable them toassume command of a Flight.On an entry of three cadets per annum, they will only have had six years&apos; service.As regards Stage IV, on an entry of three, pilotswill have had : (a) 14 years&apos; service.(6) 5 years as Flight Commander.
On an entry of three, pilots will have had : (a) 10 years&apos; service.(6) 4 years as Flight Commander.It is considered that 14 years&apos; service is theminimum period of service an officer should have before lie is promoted to Squadron Leader. (Theaverage is 17/18 years in the case of the british air Force.) Consequently an annual entry of two to Cranwell appears to be correct.9. Other Ranks-Technical Instruction. It liasnot been found possible even in England with itslarge supply of technical labour to recruit artisanspossessing&apos; the necessary technical ability to justify their direct entry to the R.A.F. units.It has been found necessary to set up special training establishments where recruits undergo a course of training from one to three years accordingto the different trades concerned. In India nosuch specialised training organisation exists. avery high standard of technical training- is essential,and it would be, therefore, useless to minimise the, difficulty of supplying that standard of technical, efficiency in an Indian squadron without which itcannot function.However, it is satisfactory to note that, at theR.A.F. Depot, Karachi, certain Indian technical personnel have attained the necessary standard incertain trades, and it is therefore proposed to en-deavour to utilise this unit for the training of thetechnical personnel required.It is suggested that, as soon as the first entriesof cadets proceed to Cranwell, the complementof personnel to complete the first stage, including an allowance for wastage, should be enlisted andattached to the R.A.F. Depot, India, for insfcruc-tion. This would give them five years&apos; training before the first Flight was formed. Further stageswould be treated in the same way. An instruc-tional staff of British personnel in proportion tothe numbers of Indians under training would haveto be added to the Dep6t for this purpose.10. Finally, I would emphasise the fact thatthe eight squadrons now sanctioned for the RoyalAir Force in this country is a bare minimum. an indian Air Force Squadron cannot, for manyyears,, attain the efficiency of a squadron of theRoyal Force and, therefore, such an increase in air strength in this country can only be looked upon10th May 1927.as additional to, and not in substitution of, theRoyal Air Force in India.11. Summarised, my observations are asfollows: (i) The inclusion of Indian Officers and airmenin British units of the Royal Air Force is impracticable.(ii) If scope is to he provided for Indians toenter the field of military aviation, this can best be accomplished by creating an IndianAir Unit with a cadre of British personnel to train and develop the unit: as the indian officers and airmen gain the necessaryexperience, the British personnel should be gradually withdrawn until the unit becomesentirely Indian.(iii) The unit should be an Army Co-operationsquadron.(iv) Cadets should bo drawn from : Dehra Dun.An English Public School.An approved Indian Public School,(v) The entry to Cranwell should be limitedto two per annum and should be the resultof a competitive examination similar to thatin force for the entry of British cadets intoCranwell. Before proceeding to Cranwell,cadets will be required to pass their &quot; A &quot;certificate at an approved light aeroplaneclub in India.(vi) On passing&apos; out of Cranwell, cadets shouldbe commissioned and should be attached to royal Air Force squadrons in units for aperiod of years.(vii) Technical personnel should be enlisted inIndia as&apos; soon as the first cadets proceed toCranwell and should he trained at theAircraft Depot, Kaiuchi.(viii) The squadron will commence forming as a unit five years after the first cadets proceedto Cranwell. It will do so in four stages,the final stage being arrived at 14 yearsafter the date of formation.(ix) No further squadrons will be formed until further experience has been gained.(x) The addition of an Indian squadron to theair strength in India must be additional tothe present authorised strength of the RoyalAir Force..W.
