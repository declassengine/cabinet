ROAD CONVEYANCEOP PASSENGERSiAND GOODS BYRALfcWAY OOM-PANIES.PreviousReferenoesCabinet 42(27), Oon-.elusion 2.)I. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Minister of Transport on the subject of road Conveyance of Passengers and Goods by-Railway Companies (Paper CP.-200 (27)).The Minister of Transport made a statement to the Cabinet, at the end of whioh he summed up his conclusions and recommendations as setforth in his Memorandum.The Cabinet were reminded that in 1921Sir Eric Geddes, the then Minister of Transport,had appointed a strong Committee to consider this question, and that the result had beenthree separate Reports.   The Cabinet were also ,reminded of the proceedings of a SelectCommittee in regard to the North Western andMidland group of railways, whioh had consideredthe same question in 1922.   A proposal was made that, in view of the highly controversial issues involved, a Royal Commission should be set upto examine the whole subject.    The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the Railway companies would present their Bill in November forconsideration early in 1928, and that any committee of Investigation would require aconsiderable amount of time.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Minister of transport should be authorised to informthe Railway Companies that hecould express no opinion on thequestion of principle until theGovernment had seen the Bill.    Heshould ask the Railway companies to let him have a oopy of the bill as soon as possible, showing the safeguards whioh the Companiesproposed to provide for the pro-tection of the public interest:
zuCb) Thett the Minister of transport should instruct his Departmentto make a study, before thequestion is again considered in the Autumn, of the safeguards which it -is desirable to have introduced in any Bill&quot;:.(c) Tnat the question of principle should be reserved until the text of the Bill was available.-2-
2-The Cabinet had before them a draft ofthe suggested Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of alliance and Friendship, produced by Sarwat Pasha,together with an alternative draft prepared inthe Foreign Offioe and approved by the CabinetCommittee (Paper CP.-214 (27)).The Attorney-General, who had been inconsultation with the Legal Adviser&apos;s Departmentof the Foreign Office, made a verbal report tothe Cabinet in regard to a point on which somemisgivings had been expressed at the meeting- of the Cabinet Committee on the previous evening,namely, as to whether the position of GreatBritain in Egypt would be weakened owing to egypt becoming a member of the League of nations and the provision in Artiole 16 of the draft treaty for the reference of disputes to theLeague.    Sir Douglas Hogg&apos;s detailed reportreassured the Cabinet that the effect of theprovisions in question would be to improve andnot to damage our position, more especiallyowing to the regularisation of the position ofthe British Army in Egypt.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe fact that the Draft Treaty made no provisionfor the protection of minorities, which was included in the third of the four ReservedPoints in the Declaration or February, 1922.It was pointed out, however, that, even so, theBritish Government, under the Agreement, wouldnot be deprived of all power to come to the aid of minorities.    If the minorities were opp*assedto the point where serious trouble might arise,Great Britain could intervene for the protection
of foreigners.    In the last resort, appeal couiu.be made to the League of Nations.    If we were unwilling to make any concessions of this kindit was useless to hope for an Agreement.Attention was also drawn to the extent towhich maladministration and corruption had grown in Egypt as the result of the diminution of British control and guidance in the Adminia-tration. The Cabinet were reminded, however, ofthe first principle Included in the Declarationof February, 1922, which reads as follows:-&quot;The British Protectorate over Egyptis terminated, and Egypt is declared to be an Independent&apos; Sovereign State&quot;.To insist on further British control of theAdministration involved a policy inconsistent with the Declaration and would render any Treatyout of the question.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs to oontinue his negotiations with Sarwat Pasha onthe basis of the suggested Anglo-Egyptian Treat:/ of Alliance aridFriendship attached to C.P.-214 (27),but that no concessions should bemade which were not inoluded inthe Draft Treaty without referenceto the Cabinet:(b) That Article 17 of the Treaty,providing for its duration for aperiod of 15 or 20 years, should be.deleted, and that the Treaty shouldbe made permanent unless and until it was altered by mutual agreement.r
THE OFFER OF 3.    The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum&quot;HILL 60&quot; TOTHE NATION. by the Secretary of State for War (Paper CP.-215 (27)) attaching a copy of a letter fromMr John Calder, oi Messrs Allsopp &amp; Sons, Ltd.,offering to present &quot;Hill 60&quot; to the nation,together with, a draft reply warmly thankingMr Calder for his generous offer to present tothe nation &quot;Kill 60&quot; where so many of thesoldiers of the British Empire lost their lives,and proposing, if   Mr Calder concurred, to ask the Imperial War Graves Commission to acceptthe transfer of the land and in future tomaintain it.The Cabinet approved the draft reply proposed by the Secretaryof State for War.-5-
4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for War (Paper CP.-216 (27)) covering a Note by the Chief of theImperial General Staff in which the reductionof the force in China by 5 Infantry Battalions,one Field Brigade Royal Artillery and someancillary units was recommended.An extract from the Minutes of the 229thMeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence,held on July 18, 1927, -was handed round forconsideration in oonnection with this question,and attention was drawn to the following recommendation of the Committee, which had been based on a statement by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs:-&quot;CHINAm    The situation in china is so uncertain that no reliableforecast can be made as to how-long it may be necessary to retain the Shanghai Defence Force inChina ..... h&apos;The Secretary of State for War asked theCabinet, if they could not sanction his fullproposals, to allow him to withdraw one Battalion,as the War Office would like to send the GuardsBattalion home through Canada.In the course of the discussion   it transpir-ed that no shipping transport could be availablefor the next 2 or 2^- months, and that thewithdrawal would in any event have to be verygradual.; After discussion from the point of view of-the -military, political, financial and shippingconsiderations involved, the Cabinet agreed  
(a) That the Secretary,of State forForeign Affairs should consult theBritish Minister at Peking on thesubject.&apos;and&quot; that if, as the result,he should feel satisfied that areduction could safely be made Inthe Shanghai Defence Force,Sir.Austen Chamberlain should beempowered to authorise the Secretaryof State for War to take the neoes-sary disposition for the withdrawalof troops:(b) That the Secretary of State forWar and the President of the Boardof Trade should collaborate toinform the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs as to the dates atwhich.&quot;it would be possible to with-draw the troops, for use by sir austen Chamberlain in drafting his telegram to Sir Miles Lamp son.&apos;
9 i61THE BASIS OP.AHMY ESTIlVlATSS-.(PreviousP*ef erence:Cabinet 41(27), Con-elusion 8.)5.   The Secretary of State for &quot;war raised asa natter of urgency the question of the Basis&apos;of Army Estimates, which had been discussed onJuly 20th.    He explained that, owing to great pressure on the Cabinet of other&quot;business, andparticularly of the Geneva Conference on naval disarmament, it had not been possible to havethe question discussed at the Committee ofImperial Defence, as decided by the Cabinet.He had, however, concerted a formula with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whichhe proceeded to read to the Cabinet.The Cabinet approved the following formulaas the basis of Army Estimates:-,!     That it should be assumed forthe purpose of the Estimates thatthe British Empire will not been gaged in an European War duringthe next ten years and that theimmediate plans of the Army shouldbe based upon preparedness for an extra-European War.&quot;
MILITARYOONTRIBU-TIONS BYCOLONIALAND OTHERGOVERNMENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 41(27), Con-clusion 4.)6.  The First Commissioner of Works, as chairman of the Committee on Military Contribu-tions from Colonial and other Governments,stated that the Committee had met on the previous evening, and a point had arisen on which he wished to consult the Cabinet.    It had become clear, in the course of the Committee&apos;s discus-sions, that no considerable financial reliefwas likely to be obtained from the proposalsof the Secretary of State for War in CP.-197 (27)Moreover, these proposals, while contemplatingcontributions from Colonies in which militarygarrisons were maintained, some of which were very small and poor (e. g. , Sierra Leone), leftuntouched some much richer Colonies, such as thegroup of remaining West African Colonies.    Therepresentative of the Colonial Office at theCommittee had pointed out that the Coloniesmight be willing to contribute to Imperial -Defence as a whole in cases where they muchdisliked a contribution to the cost of the Army.The question Lord Peel submitted to the Cabinet,therefore, was as to whether the Inquiry ought not to be conducted on much broader lines thanthose included in the present Terms of Reference.The Cabinet agreed  (a) Th&amp;t the Cabinet Committee shouldbe asked to report on their limitedTerms of Reference:(b) That the wider question should beconsidered when that Report came before the Cabinet.
NAVAL POLICY.7.   The Cabinet took note of the following(previous reference:Cabinet 24(25), Con-clusion 3(a)(111). )extract from the Minutes of the 229th. Meetingof the Committee of Imperial Defence, held onJuly 14, 1927, re-affirming a decision by theCabinet on April 2, 1925:-&quot; (a) To report to the Cabinet that,in accordance with the decisionof the Cabinet on the 6th Why,1925 (Cabinet 24 (25), Conclusion3 (a)(iii), the Committee ofImperial Defence have reviewed in the light of the international situation the conclusions in regardto Singapore reached at their 199thMeeting, held on the 2nd April,1925, and reaffirmed at the 215thMeeting on the 22nd April, 1926,and are satisfied that the generalpolicy then laid down is stillsound and should be adhered to. &quot;
