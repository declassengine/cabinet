IHDIAThe StatutoryOommis si on.(PreviousBeferehoe;Cabinet 35(25), Con-conclusion 3.)1. The Secretary of State for India infonaedthe Cabinet that he v/as about to circulate aMemorandum in regard to the nature of the StatutoryCoittXiission to be set up urjder Section 84A of theGovernment of India Act, and the date of itsappointment.    The Prime Minister had promised him.a special day for.the consideration of this import-ant question, and he invited his colleagues to study the matter carefully, as he would requiretheir assistance on a number of questions.-1-
2. The Secretary of State for &apos;,var asked theauthority of the Cabinet to use, for the purposesof the v/ithdrav/al of the Indian Mixed Brigade,.two of the ships which had been retained for- thetransport of the Shanghai Defence Force to otherparts of China as required.    After the withdrawalof these two ships he would still have sufficienttransport to enable three Battalions to be moved from Shanghai to North China, if necessary.    Therewere at present two Battalions at Peking-Tientsin,and two at Wei-hai-Wei.    Consequently, there werefour Battalions within easy reach of Tientsin,as well as three which could be brought up from shanghai.    In the meantime our policy of.refusing to move largo forces to Tientsin and.Peking.had resulted, as we desired * in other- nations1 concen-trating considerable, forces in that region^Attention -as drawn to Sir Miles Lam-pson&apos;s.telegrams IsEos^ 1081 and 1082, of July 4th, inregard, to the withdrawalof troops from China, andto Sir Austen Chamberlain&apos;s reply Ncu 45.6, of July5th,- explaining the policy of the Government, aswell as to Sir Miles Lampson1 s telegract No. 1085,of July -5th* suggesting that larger forces shouldbe concentrated in the Morth.The Secretary of State for War informed theCabinet that he had approved the terns of theannouncement in regard to the withdrawal of theIndian Mixed Brigade before he had seen Sir MilesLamps on&apos; s t e 1 e gr ams o n th e sub j e c t.china-Withdrawal&apos;of tlie IndianMixed Brigade.(previous reference:Cabinet 37(27), Con-conclusion 9(a).)
The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs told the Cabinet that he intended to study the question of the numbers of Britishtroops in North China in the light of Sir miles lampson&apos;s telegram.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forWar should have authority to use,for the withdrawal to India of theIndian Mixed Brigade, two of thereserve of ships retained in theFar East to facilitate thetransfer of forces from one partof China to another.
ADEN.Re lat i o us wit hthe Imam of the yemen.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(27) , Con-clusion 4. )3.  The Cabinet had before them a draft replyto the Imam of the Yemen, prepared by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (Paper C.P.-191 (27)) in place of that submitted by the resident at Aden, which is contained in AnnexureNo. 2 to Paper C. P. -172 (27)).In the course of the discussion it was brought out that our interest in the hinterland oAden was partly strategical and partly due to our obligations to the tribes.The Cabinet were reminded of the followingestimate by the Committee of Chiefs of Staffof the force required to drive the Imam out ofthe Aden Protectorate:-&quot;The force required for the operation is estimated at one Division less 1^Brigades of Field Artillery.    It maybe urged that the size of this force is out of all proportion to theopposition which it is likely to -encounter, but it must be borne inmind, first, tna*- there must &quot;be norisk of an initial setbacm, and secondly, that there would be a longline of&quot;communication to be protected&quot;.From the same Report the following view of theChiefs of Staff was quoted in regard to thestratsgicol importance of the Aden hinterland:-&quot;With regard to this question we desireto record our opinion that, from themilitary point of view, it is necessaryto occupy only such portions of the aden Protectorate as are essential tothe security of the Naval base, andthat any additional commitments are-liable to be a source of militaryemba r r a s si t;e nt&quot;.(CoPo-377 (26), approved by theCommittee of Imperial Defence. and the Cabinet (Cabinet 61 (26),Conclusion 6. )
After considerable discussion, the CabinetH agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should send a comniunicationto the Imam to the following effeot:-&quot;As the Imam has been assured on several occasions, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment do not desire tointerfere in any way with hisindependence in his own terri-tory in the Yemen.    Such warn-ings as were contained in mylast communication to himplainly applied only toreprisals for acts of aggressioncommitted by him in occupyingparts of the territory of tribeswith whom His Majesty&apos;s Governmentare in treaty relations.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government are preparedto renew negotiations with the imam for an &quot;agreement mutuallyrecognising the position and rights of the two parties intheir respective territories and will welcome any plenlpo-tentiary empowered by the Imamto conclude suoh an agreement&quot;.(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should circulate to theCabinet a summary of our obligations to the txibes in the Aden hinterland.s
4. The Cabinet had before then the folio-ringdocuments in regard to future policy in EastAfrica:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (paper cp.-179 (27)):A Report of the Cabinet Coaaaitteecovering a draft announcement inregard to policy in East Africa,which they&quot;recommended should be approved (Paper CP.-190 (27) and appendix):A draft White Paper (Paper CP. -192 (27)).The Cabinet were informed that the object ofthe amendments made in the Report of the CabinetCommittee was to reserve a certain amount of libertof action, which was felt desirable in view of the short time which had been available for the consld-eration of this question.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesexplained that he had not been able to deal&apos;withthe subject until the Governors concerned wereassembled, and this had prevented his bringing thematter before the Cabinet, earlier.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the draft announcement in regard to policy in East Africaattached to the Report of the CabinetCommittee (Paper CP.-190 (27))(Aopendix).
PAKLIAME 131ARYPROCEDURE.House of Lords.(previous reference:Cabinet 7(26), Con-clusion 4.)5. Tine Cabinet had before them the Report of aCabinet Committee on the subject of House of LordsProcedure (Paper C.P. -188 (27)), submitting thefollowing conclusions:-(l) The Committee unanimously agree thatthe conditions in which the House ofLords has to carry out its legislativefunctions at the end of a Session areunsatisfactory ana prejudicial to thepublic interest;   but(2) The Committee make no recommendation as regards the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s pro-posal for the carrying over of Billsfrom one Parliamentary Session toanother.(3) In the opinion of the Committee theonly remedy at present available isthat the Lox-ds should press their claim to have important measures sent up to them in time to allow of their being adequately considered before theend of the Session.(4) With a view to relieving the situationin the House of Lords, the Committeewish to draw the attention of the. Cabinet to the desirability of seour-ing greater expedition in the transaction-tion of business by Standing committees of the House of Commons by some altera-tion of the present quorum rules ofthose Committees.The Cabinet were impressed by the seriousness of the situation revealed by the Cabinet Committee1 sReport, which showed that, owing to the manner inwhich the business was presented to them, the Houseof Lords was prevented from fulfilling its functionas a revising Chamber.With reference to Conclusion (4) above theywere informed that some amelioration of the conductof business by Standing Committees of the House ofCommons had been brought about as it had been foundthat some of the Rules of Procedure of the House ofCommons in regard to Closure could be brought intooperation in these Committees.
The Prime Minister asked those of his colleagues who were principally concerned in legislation to take careful note of the Cabinet Committee1sReport.
THE MIDVvIVSS 6. The Cabinet bad before them a Memorandum byAMD MATERNITYHOMES the Secrets,ry of State for Scotland askinp- that(SC0TLA1D)BILL. the Midwives and Maternity Homes (Scotland) Bill,which was introduced in the House of Commons bya Private Member but which had completed all itsstapes in that House, should be treated in theHouse or Lords as a Government measure (Paper-CP. -185(27)).The Cabinet agreed  That the Mldwives and MaternityHomes (Scotland) Bill should betreated in the House of Lords asa Government measure.
&quot;7. The Oa.bij.first/ had before them a Memorandum bytlie Secretary o: State for Doniinioxi Affairs (paper.A. 152 (27)) covering a draft of the Medical and dentists. Acts Amending Bill, the object of whichis to give erfect to certain agreements between representatives of Great Britain, the Irish FreeState and Northern Ireland as to the registration and control of medical practitioners and dentists,and to validate certain acts done by the DentalBoard.    In his Memorandum Mr Artery ashed approval for the introduction of the Bill with a view to its passage into law during the present Session ofParliament.    He had no objection to its introduotiorIn the House of Lords if this would in any wayfacilitate its progress.The Cabinet afreed  That the Medical and Dentists ActsAmending Bill should be introduced in the House of Lords, but the PrimeMinister stated that, in the great pressure of business, he could not&apos;guarantee that it should be passed through we Commons, particularly if it was opposed.      The Secretaryof State for&apos; Dominion Affairs thought,however, that opposition was very unlikely, and urged the importanceof this non-contentious Bill.
REDUCTION and limitation of armaments.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(27), Con-conclusion 5. )8. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet, elsa matter of urgency, telegrams from the british consul at Geneva, Nos. L.N.152 and L. N.153(Appendix II) in regard to the olimax which hadbeen reached at Geneva on the subject of Cruisers.These telegrams reported that the American Dele ga-tion, who had refused to discuss the question of cruisers on the basis of the British proposals,had produced a written document which they intendedus to regard as their last word.The Chief of the Naval Staff informed theCabinet that he had only seen these telegrams ashort tine before.    On a hasty calculation itappeared that, according to the American proposals,the United States Navy would have in 1936 thirty-sixCruisers mounting 8-inch guns as corn-pared with our fifteen.    These fifteen 8-inoh gunCruisers would leave us only 251,000 tons availablefor other Cruisers, of which 169,000 tons (equiva-lent to 25 or 26 Cruisers) would be of pre-Washingtonconstruction.    This left us only 82,000 tonswherewith to replace 16 Cruisers before 1936.That is to say, in order to reach the numbersindisp ens able for trade protection&apos; we should haveto complete our programme with 5,000-ton Cruisers,which were useless for trade protection in the face of Cruisers with 8-inch guns, and were also quite inadequate to face the weather conditions in thegreat oceans;    in fact, to build them would be awaste of money,    it was difficult to believe thatthe Americans should think we could acoept such proposals.    The attitude of the American Delegation
appeared to be based on the assumption that they had cometo the Conference not to confer but to present us with an ultimatum.    In reply to various questions Lord Beattyexplained that at Washington the Admiralty proposal hadbeen to divide Cruisers into two categories, namely, one class of large Cruisers on which we would accept the ratio of 5-5-3, and a second class of smaller Cruisers on thenumber of which there would be no restrictions.    The;/ had proposed to adopt a similar attitude at the present Confer-ence.    I  the 10,000-ton Cruisers with 8-inch guns were built in accordance with the ratio and with a total limit a-tion of tonnage, unrestricted competition would be avoided.It was the smaller Cruisers on which no restrictions were contemplated, and on these it was proposed to leave each nation to judge for itself.    The Americans at the presenttime had 8 Cruisers pf 10,000 tons with 8-inch guns,building and projected, and 10 of the &quot;OMAHA.&quot; Class mountingtwelve 6-inch guns.    In audition their proposal at.Genevawas to build 11 snips of 7,500 tons, with 8-inch guns,expending the balance of the 400,000 by building a. further17 Cruisers of 10,000 tons with 8-inch guns.    These detailed proposals were not quoted in the telegram received by theForeign Office, but were communicated in a telegram receivedby the Admiralty from the Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff.In reply to questions as to the figure of 600,000 tons, which,according to Press reports, the Admiralty had informed theAmerican Delegation was the approximate tonnage of theBritish Cruiser Programme, Lord Beatty said that theAdmiralty programme was based on the Report ox&apos; LordBirkenhead-&apos; s Committee on Cruisers (Paper CP. -342 (25))which had subsequently been approved by the Cabinet, subjectto some minor adjustments (Cabinet 39 (25), Conclusion .3).Cruisers were required for two purposes:    (l) towork with the Fleet, (2) the        protection of-12-
sea eoaoinioutions.    The first os&amp;Q&amp;vy was practically a fixed number in regard to whicha ratio with other nations could be accepted.The figure for the second category was determinednot so much b.y a comparison of the number of shipspossessed by other Powers (though this, of course,had to be considered) as by the length of the lineof communications to be guarded, which was themain factor.    In reply to a suggestion that the americans might veil argue that the;/ also had aconsiderable foreign trade with all parts of theworld which they hoped would be increased, andthat they considered it important to provide sufficient Cruisers for its protection, Lord Beatt;ypointed out that America was self-contained,whereas Great Britain was absolutely dependenton oversea trade for the necessities of existence;that, with the exception of the Philippines, allthe American territories were connected by land,whereas the British Empire was only connected &quot;by in the course ,of the discussion attention was drawn to tne line adopted by Lord Balrour and hiscolleagues at the Washington Conference in regardto. Cruisers, which had been very similar to. that    now adopted by the Admiralty, as well as to Lord    jIBalfour!s speech, at the Second Plenary Meetingiof the Washington Conference, in which he had1iemphasized the British dependence on sea ooimnni-cations.Tne general view of the Cabinet was in favourof the Admiralty opinion that we should agree to
the Washington ratio of 5-5-3 in respecting.ru to the10.000-ton olass of Oruiser&apos; with 8-inch guns,hut that for the smaller classes we should not.agree to a limit.    On these classes our attitudeshould be that if the United States of Americathought it worth while for the protection oftheir communications (which were relativelyunimportant as compared with our own) it wasnecessary to build a large number of Cruisers,wo should not stand in their way, but that we musthave as many as we deem necessary for our own security.    Any emphasis on the 600,000 tonsaggregate of our Cruiser Programme was deprecated.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That tne Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send tothe First Lord of the Admiraltyan interim reply (Appendix III)to his tele rams Nos. 152 and153, in order to gain time for(b) a second telegram containing fullinstr actions , &quot;which the lord president of the Council was askedto draft in consultation with theChler of the Naval Staff, and approval for which was remitted to the Prime Minister and thoseof his colleagues invited to themeeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the following day.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,July 6, 1927.
Draft Announcement as amended by CommitteeHis Majesty&apos;a Government consider (have-deeidea)as a result of discussions between the Secretary ofState for the Colonies and the Representatives of the territories in British Central and East Africa whoattended the recent Colonial Conference, that some formof closer union between the territories of Central and eastern Africa appears (is-new) desirable, moreparticularly In regard to the development of transport and communications, customs tariffs and customsadministration, scientific research and defence.     Theyhave therefore authorised the Secretary of State to send to Africa a special commission with the following termsof reference :-1. To make recommendations as to (hew) whether,either by federation,08ry other form of closer union,more effective co-operation between the differentGovernments in Central and Eastern Africa may besocured, more particularly in regard to thedevelopment of transport and communications,customs tariffs and customs administration,scientific research and defence.2. To consider which territories could either now or at some future time be brought within any suchcloser union, and, In particular, how best togive effect to Article 10 of the mandate forTanganyika Territory, which provides that themandatory may constitute the territory Into a customs, fiscal and administrative union orfederation with the -adjacent territories under its own sovereignty or control, provided alwaysthat the measures adopted to that end do notinfringe the provisions of the mandate.3. To make recommendations in regard to possiblechanges In the powers and composition of thevarious Legislative Councils of the severalterritories (a) as the result of the establishmentof any Federal Council or other common authorityj(b) so as to associate more closely in the responsibilities and trusteeship of Government the immigrant communities domiciled In the country;and (c) so as ultimately to secure more directrepresentation of native interests in accordancewith (4) below.4. To suggest how the Dual Policy recommended by theConference of East African Governors (i.e., thecomplementary development of native and non-nativecommunities) can best be progressively applied inthe political as well a3 the economic sphere.5. To make recommendations as to what improvements maybe required In internal communications betweenthe various territories so as to facilitate theworking of federation or closer union.6. To report more particularly on the financial aspectsof any proposals which they may make under any ofthe above headings.
In making the declaration of policy involved insetting up a Commission with these terms of reference,His Majestyrs Government wish to make it clear that theyadhere to the underlying principles of the White paper of 1923 entitled &quot;Indians in Kenya&quot;  (Cmd. Paper, 1922),both in regard to the political status and other rightspf British Indians resident in East Africa, and also asregards the Imperial duty of safeguarding the interestsand progress of the native population as trustees fortheir welfare until such time as they can take part more fully in their own Government and in the common affairs of all races inhabiting the territories.     At the sametime they wish to place on record their viow that, while these responsibilities of trusteeship must for some considerable time rest mainly on the agents of theImperial Government, they desire to associate more closely in this high and honourable task those who, as colonistsor residents, have identified their interests with the prosperity of the country.

(Grp. omtd..)in my immediately following telegram.In view of importance of result already obtained in respectof other classes of vessels, we can hardly believe americans will faoe onus of breaking conference over crxiiser issue in theteeth of our case as it can be stated.In view of position now reached there is to be a privatemeeting of principal delegates followed by a meeting of executivecommittee or of plenary conference or both.    In any case i assume you will not wish mo to depart materially from instructionapproved by Cabinet.    Broad line I should take would be toattack. American demand for large number of 10,000 ton class and retention of 0 inch guns and draw comparison with our own proposals which are designed to reduce and limit offensivecapacity.
AI-IENDIX II.fb)From   SWITZERLAND.Decode.    His Majesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva).July 5th, 192 7.D.    7,20 p.m.      July 5th, 1927.R.    9.00 a.m.      July 6th, 1927.No.  153.    L. of N.    (R).My immediately preceding telegram.&quot;Position of United States delegation is thatwe cannot discuss cruiser tonnages in excess of400/000 tons for period ending December 31st 1936.That during that period we would require fullliberty of action to build 10,000 ton cruisers up toa total of 250,000 tons recognising at the same timefull rights of other powers to build cruisers ofoimilar characteristics up to tonnage^ in accordancewith principles of Washington treaty.That we have no intention or desire to replaceten oruisere of Omaha class carrying 6&quot; guns during that period except in the case of loss of one ormore of those units.That in an effort to meet British view pointregarding a limitation in number of large cruiserswe are willing for this period and without prejudice to future action to limit our further constructionwithin a total tonnage limitation of 400,000 tovessels of a smaller tonnage to be agreed upon.We do not see any reason for limiting calibreof guns in smaller class of cruisers to anythingdifferent from that in larger class.
tfe believe that each power should have fullliberty in design and armament of a smaller class of cruisers should such a class be adopted for the period in question.This statement of janierican policy should beoonstrued as our maximum effort to meet British viewpoint.V/e greatly prefer that within a total tonnagelimitation and within characteristics of cruisersprovided for in the vVashington treaty each powerenjoy full liberty of action.ne invite attention to the faot that our original proposal was for a total tonnage   limitation incruiser class of between 250,000 and 300,000 tons.We still ardently desire that total tonnage limitationof cruisers to be agreed upon shall be very much lower than 400,000 as we believe that an agreement on such a figure would be an extre ely useful service to the cause of limitation.    If it is found possibleto agree upon a figure materially lower than400,000 tons American requirements regarding cruisers of larger class could be revised downwards.Any limitation on basis of a cruiser tonnage inexcess of 400,000 tons we regard as so Ineffective a limitation as not to justify the conclusion of atreaty at this time.&quot;
APPENDIX III.To     SWITZERLAND.Cypher telegram to Mr. London (Geneva)Foreign Office, July 6th, 1927.    1.45 p.m.No. 99.STATE.Following from Prime Minister for Mr. Bridgeman:-Your telegrams Hos. 152 and 153 receivedpreliminary consideration by Cabinet this morning.We regard the situation disclosed by you as very grave and it is clear that our position must be carefully reviewed and very carefully stated. .I shall send you full instructions as early as possible.     CI.D, will meet tomorrow and further meeting of Cabinet will be held if necessary same afternoon.    Meanwhile you should take no finaldecision but ask if necessary for an adjournment of discussion in order that you may consult your government.
