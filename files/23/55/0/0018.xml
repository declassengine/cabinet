1.  The Cabinet had before them a draft telegram to Geneva (Paper CP.-219 (27)) cirou-lated as the result of the Meetings on theprevious day, and on which the First Sea lord had been asked to hold himself in readiness toexpress the Admiralty views.Shortly before the Meeting, however, atelegram had been received from the british delegation at Geneva (No. 228, of August 4th)which made it clear that the United states delegation had rejected the latest Japaneseproposal.    It was, therefore, unnecessary to pursue consideration of Paper CP.-219 (27) indetail.    The Cabinet, however, felt that theAdmiralty1s views on the Japanese proposal asamended at the meeting rn the previous day(Cabinet 47 (27), Appendix III) ought to beplaced on record.    A copy of Sir Charles Madden&apos;sMemorandum on the amended proposal Is attached in Appendix I. It was not discussed, for thereason above stated.The First Sea Lord also communicated thefollowing telegram, dated August 4th, which hehad received that morning from Admiral Pound:-&apos; &quot;Your telegram No. 48.    Meeting ofthe delegates was held at 2200Wednesday and Americans then made it clear that they could not enter-tain Japanese proposals unless we accept limitation of 400 thousand tons repeat 400 thousand tons forcruisers.    Americans were informedthat we could not agree to this.One of two things must now result.A. Inolusion in &quot;treaty of pointstentatively agreed upon by technical committee.   .B. No treaty.    It is most unlikely America will ,agree to-   A. 11The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet Washington Tele pram No. 372,
anawhioh lie had just received,/which indicated,inter alia, that the British Ambassador, in an interview with the American Secretary of State, had made effective use of the material sent to him,and contained a hint that the United States ofAmerica would be willing to continue negotiationsafter the Plenary Meeting at Geneva if the british delegation should so desire.Sir Austen Chamberlain also read a telegramhe had sent to the Prime Minister (who was about to meet the American General Dawes in Canada) andto the Dominions to keep them abreast of the latest developments.Consideration was given to the question as towhether an announcement should be made to theeffect that we have no intention of increasing our programme of naval construction owing to the breakdown of the Conference.The following formula was suggested for use by Ministers speaking on the subject on publicplatformst-&quot; Notwithstanding the failure ofGeneva Conference we still desireto study a polioy of moderationin naval construction&quot;.Some discussion followed as to our futureprogramme of naval construction.    The suggestion was made that, in the event of America entering ona large programme of cruiser construction, itmight be advisable for us (in order to allay the idea of a building race) to ooase laying downany new oruisers for a year or two, while Americawas reducing our existing lead in this type of vessel.    The whole question was felt to require futher investigation.
As the result of these discussions the cabinet decided  (a) That no further instructions shouldbe sent to the British delegation at Geneva:(b) That the Lord President .of the Counciland the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who had arranged to make public speeches in the immediate future , should have authority, while expressing deep regret at the failure of the Conference, toindicate in disoreet language that no-one ought to suppose that it must leadto a competition in naval construction,which was the last thing that theGovernment desired:(c) That the Admiralty and Treasury should prepare material for a Cabinet Inquiryin the Autumn into the question of thefuture programme of naval construction,In the light of the programmes offoreign Powers and other relevant circumstances-stances arising out of the Geneva Oon-ference.
EGYPT. 2. The. Secretary of State for Foreign Affairse Conversa- asked permission to mention a point whioh he hadons withiwat. - overlooked when the draft Anglo-Egyptian Treatyof Alliance and Friendship was brought before thereviousjeference: Cabinet.    In Article 5 of the draft Treaty provisionabinet 4527), Con- was made that, after a period of ten years from thejlusion 2.)coming Into force of the Treaty, the contractingparties should re-consider the question of the localities in whioh the British forces are to be stationed.    This had been in accordance with therecommendations of the Cabinet Committee, but theCommittee had also agreed that the Secretary ofState should be authorised to reduce the period to seven years, on the understanding that he put upct77// y/e?dec/ onlya strong fight before making this concession^inthe last resort.    Sir Austen Chamberlain asked theCabinet to oonfirai this reoommendaticn of theCabinet Committee.The Cabinet approved the abovere commendation.
3. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs raised as a matter of urgency the question ofthe reduction of the British Forces in China, andthe connected question of the circumstances inwhich the use of force in China would he justifiedSir Austen Chamberlain Informed the Cabinetthat he had received from the Secretary of Statefor War a proposal that two Battalions and oneBattery should be withdrawn, the first movestaking place within B3 days of the order being given, provided (as the Secretary of State for Warexplained to the Cabinet) that the S.S. HERMINIUSwas available.It was pointed out that this possible earlywithdrawal of troops was not consistent with theinformation given to the Cabinet when the question was last discussed, namely, that no shippingtransport would be available for 2-2.1? months.The Seoretary of State for Foreign affairs stated that he had not yet received from theSecretary of State for War   and the Presidentof the Board of Trade the details as to proposeddates of withdrawal, etc. , which he required asthe basis of his telegram to Sir Miles Lampson(See the Conclusions referred to in the margin).In the meantime, as Sir Miles Lampson in recent telegrams had more than once referred to thepossible use of force, he proposed to send him an instruction in regard to the circumstances in -which the employment of force in China oould becontemplated.    Sir Austen-A?toft ofthese instructions, which met with general approval.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the instructions read tothem by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, notifying to SirMiles&quot;Lampson the circumstances andlimiting conditions in which the useof armed forces in China mieht becontemplated (Appendix II):&quot;(b) That the Secretary of State for War,in consultation as necessary with thePresident of the Board of Trade,should hasten the supply to theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs of information on which Sir austen chamberlain would base his telegram to the British Minister at Pekingconsulting him as to the withdrawalof troopsT   The Seoxetary of Statefor War was asked to furnish full particulars as to the units it was proposed to move, the dates at whichmovements would begin, the ships inwhioh they would be transported, andthe military reasons (includingconsiderations as to the moral ofthe troops, etc) in support oftheir withdrawal.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.w.1,August 4, 1927.
APPENDIX I.Memorandum by Pirst Sea Lord presented to Cabinet 4th August,,.1927.ANALYSIS OP THE JAPANESE PROPOSALS.GENEVA COHERENCE.The Japanese proposals,  (Geneva telegram No. 226), as amended by the Cabinet, definitely commit us to a programme of 8&quot; gun ships and do, I consider, involve the abandonment of the 6&quot; gun, theyshow a situation in 1931, 1936 and 1940 wholly favourable to theIKS.A., who, with a moderate Cruiser building programme, can equalour number of 8 inoh gun Cruisers in 1931, or at any subsequent datedesired by them, so they seoure parity in 1931 or later with littleeffort.I2.     The U.S.A. further seek to impose on us a total Cruiser limit of 400,000 tons (see Admiral Pound&apos;a telegram No.  61 of 4.8.27),and this is the only oondition on whioh they will consider theJapanese plan.With this tonnage we can build twelve 10,000 ton and &apos;]thirty-five 8,000 ton Cruisers, a total of 47 ships instead ofthe 70 required.3.      The acceptance of the Japanese plan carries out exactly thewishes of the U.S.A. Delegates, i.e. to force us to adopt the 8&quot;gun type, while so limiting the Cruiser total tonnage,  that weshall have an insufficient number of Cruisers to protect ourcommerce.4.      The plan under consideration may, if adopted, last for manyyears, and will placo Great Britain in a position of inferiorityto the United States on the High Seas, and I would much prefer a return to the Cabinet terms which were published in the presson 29th July, and which were the Governmenfs instructions toour delegates.
The Sea Lords are unanimous in supporting mo in theabove reoommendation, and In agreeing with me that the situation arising if the Japanese proposals, even as revised by theCabinet, are adopted, will seriously injure our Sea Power andwill place on future Boards of Admiralty and Cabinets a task which will be financially impossible to meet.5.     It is realised that the 8&quot; gun ship may be forced on us by the building programmes of other Powers, but we should leaveour hands free to deal with suoh a situation as our means andour requirements necessitate,6.     The Board have maintained the following principles whichhave not been controverted,   fnote (d) is a Cabinet amendedfigure with which the late Board dissented).(a) That we need a minimum of 70^Cruiser8 for security.(b) That any total tonnage agreement must recognise this jfact and be adapted to it.(c) That if 8&quot; Cruisers are to be established as thesmaller type, we must build alj- 8&quot; ships in future to replace our older 6&quot; ships aa they reaoh the age limit.fd)    That the 5:5:3*25 ratio endangers our security.7.     Attaohed is a statement of the probable number of cruisers of all types, which Great Britain, United States of Americaand Japan may have in 1931 - 1940.C.

The result of this Geneva economy Committee will therefore be that at the dictation of the U.S.A. we will be faced by a building programme such as wehave not before contemplated - if our communications are to be secured.But British Tonnage in 1940 if we have 70 ships will be:-12   10,000 tons 120,000 tons50     0.000 ton3 464.000 tonsships       70 584,000 tons in Cruisersalone;    but our total cruiser tonnage allowed by U.S.A.is to &quot;be 400,000 tons.     We can therefore only build55   0,000 ton Cruisers and a total of 47 ships insteadof the 7JC necessary and half the number (144) whichin 1914 was found to bo inadequate to our needs.The U.S.A. will thus have achieved their objectof reducing our cruiser numbers below those requiredto safeguard our sea communications.4th August 1927.\
APPENDIX IITo CHINA.Cypher telegram to Sir M. Lampson (Wei-hai-wei).Foreign Office, 4th August, 1927.    7.00 p.m.No.2.In view of last paragraph of your telegram Ho.1156 and some earlier telegrams I think that It may beof use to you that I should state the attitude of HisMajestyfs Government with regard to the threat or useof force in China for the attainment of political endsas distinct from the protection of lifeaThe decision of His Majestyfs Government to despatch the defence force to Shanghai was based solely on the urgent need for the protection of that greatcommunity.     The military advisers of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment tvere and are definitely opposed to a dis-semlnation of such forces as are available and HisMajesty&apos;s Government were obliged to recognise that similar armed protection by troops could not be affordedat all points where British settlements existed or british interests were involved.     For the protection ofPeking and Tientsin they have always felt that the mainreliance must be placed on Powers which took a lesserpart In the defence of Shanghai whilst special Instruc-tions were Issued dealing with possible eventualitiesat Canton.      It may be necessary from time to time to revise these instructions or to consider afreshparticular cases, but in all cases hitherto the protec-tion of life has been the primary and dominating consideration in the mind of His Majesty&apos;s Government.
China is in a state of anarchy produced byrevolution and civil wars.     Such periods of anarchyhave been a recurrent feature of Chinese history andthey last long.     If, therefore, force be used, it isdifficult to set any limit to its employment either intime or spaoe;   and even if momentarily successful, Itmay amongst a people with so long a memory leave behind it a resentment which makes future friendly relationsstill more difficult.     His Majestyfs Government do notabsolutely exclude from consideration the use of force for other purposes, but they hold that such use of force and therefore any threat of its use can be justi-fied only by the most urgent necessity or the most con-clusive advantages.     They sympathise with your contentions-tion that in China the only practicable policy is oneof firmness and justice.     Such a policy implies, however,that where force is threatened it must be more than a mere threat and must proceed from a settled resolve totake active measures of coercion if the threat of them is not sufficient.His Majesty&apos;s Government could c^Uy contemplate the use of coercive measures if the following essentialconditions wre fulfilled.1.     The end in view must be indisputably attain-able by the measures proposed, and the execution ofthese measures must lie within the military means-2-
available,  i.e.,  such of His Majesty &apos;s military and naval forces as are at any time available for service in China.2.     The force to be employed must be commensurate with the purpose which it is desired to achieve..     this condition applies equally to the exertion demanded ofHis Majesty!s forces and to the injury or loss in-flicted on the Chinese.3.     There must be reasonable assurance that themeasures to be taken will prove effective, within areasonable period, that they will not involve the lockup of the forces for an indefinite time and that theywill not lead to further and unknown commitments.I should add that His MajestyTs Government wouldrequire very strong arguments to induce them to embark on a policy based on coercive action without the active co-operation or at least the open support and approvalof other interested Powers,, notably Japan and theUnited States of America.The result of recent instances of proposed unitedcoercive action have shown how little support HisMajesty &apos;s Government could expect to receive from other-interested Powers in the adoption, for any purpose otherthan that of protection of actual life, of such a lineof action.It is true that your United States and Japanesecolleagues have at times led you to believe that their governments might be induced to accept their own views
in regard to the practicability and efficacy of a showof force for political purposes in China.      Butyour United States colleague has had frankly to avowthat his government do not accept his recommendations,,and the Japanese Minister is clearly equally out oftouch with the views held by the government in Tokyo.It is therefore fairly clear that His i.aajesty&apos;s Govern-ment could not count on the support of either of these governments, in whose countries any policy of an activeor aggressive nature would be most unpopular.     As memberof the League of Nations, moreover, His majesty&apos;sGovernment must themselves take into careful consMera-tion their own obligations and responsibilities to theLeague, as well as the general growing tendency in therest of the world to condemn the exercise of methods of violence in international relationships.From the above it will appear that howeverjustifiable and even sound may be in principle a policy in-volving threat or use of force in China in certaincircumstances outside the elemental necessity of pro-tec ting British life there, it is becoming, more and moreclear that in practice such a policy must be discardedas a practicable and effective means of defending Britishtreaty rights and established interests in that country,or of bringing the Chinese to see. reason.Nothing in the above telegram is to be interpreted as modifying the instructions sent to the Commander-In-Chief on iviay 12th and referred to in your telegram No.921A of June 7th.Please- repeat to Peking.
