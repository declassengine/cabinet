John Gretton, M.P.,to the Prime Minister, in regard to the urgent need for substantial economy.in public expend!-ture, both national and local, during theforthcoming financial year (Paper C.P.-317 (27)).The Chancellor of the Exchequer took this occasion to make a full statement to the Cabineton the financial outlook as affecting the budget of 1928-9 so far as this could at present before seen.   He indicated a probable gap betweenrevenue and expenditure as at present estimated by the Departments, which would have to be filled.   After explaining the limitations onthe possibilities of additional taxation of a relatively uncontentious character, and emphasised- .sizing the importance of not increasing theIncome Tax, he outlined a concerted scheme of economies, spread over a number of Departments,some of which are already agreed to, in wholeor in part,  and others of which he hoped wouldbe realised.   He undertook to circulate particu-lars of these economies (which he gave to theCabinet in full)  in a short Memorandum to hiscolleagues.    He paid a special tribute to theefforts made by the Secretary of State for air and the Chief of the Air Staff for their co-operation in the reduction of expenditure.In the course of the discussion a proposal was made that during the coming financial yeara /meeting should be held of the Chairmen of theFinance Committees of Local Authorities, to be
addressed by the Prime Minister, with a viewto obtaining some reduction in local expenditurewith the possibility of deriving therefrom somerelief in national expenditure.General satisfaction was expressed at thesuccess of the Minister of Pensions in his efforts to reduce expenditure without anyinjustice to war pensioners and with the minimum of friction.The Cabinet expressed their appreciationthat they had been informed of the serious diffi-culties in the financial situation while thereis still time to cope with them and to avoid the evil consequences.After further discussion, the cabinet agreed  (a) That, in the present politicalsituation, it is out of thequestion to contemplate anIncrease in Income Tax for thefinancial year 1928-9, and that&quot;every possible effort must be madeto achieve the economies requiredto balance the Budget either bythe measures proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer or inother ways:(b) To take note that the Chancellorof the Exchequer will circulatesome particulars of his proposals:       i -(c) That the Prime Minister should reply to Colonel Gretton to theeffect that the Government fullyrealise the importance of avoidingadditional expenditure and curtail-ing existing expenditure to theutmost realiseable extent, and areresolutely facing the problem.2,  Ahit shall Gardens,  S.W.1.December 15, 1927.
