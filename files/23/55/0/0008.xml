IRAQ.^Bntry into theLeague of Nations(previous reference:Cabinet 7(27), Con-elusion 1(c).)1. The Cabinet had before them  A Memorandum by trie Secretary ofState for the Colonies (paper cp.-173 (27)) circulating a despatch which he had addressedto the High Commissioner of Iraqon January 4th last, and the reply,dated March 24th, received from theHigh Commissioner, on the subjectof &quot;the entry ox Iraq into the Leagtof Nations:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (Paper- CP. -178 (27)) recommending that, a pro-pronouncement should be made to theeffect that, if all goes well inIraq in the interval, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will be prepared to supportan application by Iraq for membership of the League in 1932, viz., thesecond of the dates contemplated inthe 1926 Treaty:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of- the duchy of Lancaster (Paper CP.-182 (27))urging that there is no necessity to postpone supporting the entry of Iraqinto the Leayue &quot;beyond 1928.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsadvised the Cabinet that we should be in a falseposition vis-a-vis the League of Nations if, so soon after (under great pressure from the League)we had undertaken certain responsibilities towardsIraq, we were to come to the League with a proposal that Iraq should at once be admitted as a member.He thought that the League would feel that we hadnot fulfilled our responsibilities, as well as some apprehension as to the new responsibilitiesinvolved to the League itself by the entry of Iraq.The objections likely to be felt by the French-Government were an additional argument against theirmaediate application by Iraq for membership of
The Cabinet agreed --To approve generally the proposal of the Secretary of State for theColonies in Paper CP.-178 (27),as summarised above, and toauthorise the Secretary of state to send to the High Commissionerfor Iraq the draft telegram attachedto CP.-178 (27), subject to thefollowing alterations:-The omission of the words in square brackets on page 4:The substitution for the phrase&quot;provided all goes well in the interval&quot;, at the foot of page 5,and for the phrase &quot;provided present rate of progress in Iraq is main-tained&quot;, on page 4, of the words&quot;provided all goes well in the interval and the present rate of progress in Iraq is maintained&quot;.
2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed his colleagues that Sarwat Pasha, afterobjecting to a sentence in a draft speech prepared in the Foreign Office for the King to make at hisbanquet to the King of Egypt, had objected to asecond draft which Sir Austen Chamberlain had himself prepared.    The passage in question referredto the King&apos;s interest in the prosperity of Egypt,to which Great Britain had contributed in the past,and expressed the hope for similar co-operation(subsequently altered to &quot;those close and friendly relations&quot;) in the future.    After Sarwat Pasha hadObjected to this second draft, which had been specially modified to facilitate its acceptance.Sir Austen had felt it necessary to send the&apos;Permanent U-uisr-Secretary of State to the EgyptianMinister to say that if the words now proposed couldnot be accepted it would b^ impossible for the king to make a speech at all, and that without some suchphrase the visit of the Kins would appear to haveno object.    British public opinion would   not tolerate such an emasculated speech as the EgyptianMinister had suggested.
3. The Cabinet had under consideration thefollowing notices in regard to the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on the subjectof House of Lords Reform:-Notices of Motions.90. Mr. Ramsay MacDonald.91, Mr. Clynes.92. Mr. Snowden.93, Mr. Lees Smith -Government and the House of Lords, - That this house regrets that the Government has put forward a scheme for fundamental changes in the House ofLords vThich gerrymanders the constitution in theinterests of the Conservative party, deprives theHouse of Commons of that control over finance whiclit has possessed for generations, entrenches theHouse of Lords, on a hereditary basis, more firmlyagainst the peoplers will than for centuries past,and, In defiance of every precedent of moderntimes, robs the electDrs of power to deal withthe House of Lords; and this House declares thatIt will be an outrage on the constitution to force such proposals through Parliament withouta mandate from the people.As Amendments to Mr. Ramsay HacDonald1s Motion(Government and the House of Lords):-Lieutenant-Colonel Spender-Clay, -Captain Wallace, -Mr* Buchan, -Mr. Duff Cooper, -Major Glyn, mr.. Robert Hudson, -Line 1, leave out all after &quot;House&quot;, and add&quot;appreciates, the heavy responsibility which is placed upon Mr. Speaker in giving Iris certificatewith regard to Money Bills, and hopes that theGovernment will take the necessary steps to amend the Parliament Act in thatxrespect, and further,whilst agreeing that it Is desirable to improve the machinery of the Second Chamber forpreserving the ultimate authority in legislation to the considered judgment of the people, is bfopinion that no amendment of the constitution orpowers of the House of Lords is practicable unless and until some form of general agreement is achieved.&quot;
Notices of notions (continued).Captain Eden, -Ilr. OrNeill, -Mr. Luriley, -Major Sir Granville 7/heler, -Lieutenant-Colonel Angus McDonnel, -Mr. Stuart, -Line 1, leave ou.t all after &quot;House&quot;, and add &quot;whilstapproving the purpose of the Government, in fulfilment of the declared intention of previous administrationsto amend the Parliament Act in such a way as toimprove the machinery for the definition of a Money bill and to ensure that the electoape    shall he consulted indisputes between the two Houses involving fundamentalconstitutional issues, is of opinion that, beforechanging the composition of the Second Chamber ormodifying the prerogative of the Crown, every endeavourshould first be made to arrive at an agreed policyin order to enable such reform, to be carried out with every promise of permanence.&quot;Captain Bourne, -Sir Alfred Enox, -Kr. Balfotir, -Sir Robert Sanders, -Sir Evelyn Cecil, -Major Idndersley, -Line 1, leave out all after &quot;House&quot;, and add&quot;congratulates the Government for submittingtentative proposals for the reform of the House ofLords, thereby carrying oi.rt the terns of the pledgecontained in the Preamble to The Parliament Act, 1911^&quot;The Prime Minister informed his colleagues thathe proposed to meet the Vote of Censure directly .and not to encourage any of the amendments.    he himself vrould speak after Mr Ramsay MacDonald, anathe Chancellor of the Exchequer would wind upthe Debate.   He proposed to show, by comparisonwith the studies of this Question by Mr LloydGeorge1s Coalition Government, that the present government had devoted a great deal of time and thought to this question, and to add that theGovernment welcomed criticisms arid would take them into careful consideration when the subject
as considered again in the Autumn.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the -line which the PrimeMinister proposed to take:(b) That j in order to meet the criticism that the proposals of the government as outlined in the House of lords would render it impossible to over-ride a decision of the House ofLords on Constitutional, questions,the Prime Minister should statethat when these proposals came tobe put into a formal shape they would include a provision that* as to any bill for altering the pwers and constitution of the House of Lordsjthe Parliament Act should not operateexcept on condition that steps shouldbe taken to ascertain the opinion ofthe country before the third passingof the Bill by the House of Commons.
4.   The Cabinet, had &quot;before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies(Paper CP.-172 (27)) in regard to relationswith the Imam of the Yemen.    In this memorandum it was reported that the Resident at Aden, inaccordance with the Cabinet1 s decision, had issued a warning to the Iiram of the Yemen inregard to his occupation of parts of the aden protectorate.   The Imam had offered to send aplenipotentiary to Aden to negotiate an agreement.The Resident at Aden had proposed to reply thatthis offer can be accepted only on condition thatthe Imam undertakes to evacuate the Protectorate.The Admiralty and War Office were reported in theMemorandum to support the Resident&apos;s view.    TheForeign Office favoured a compromise by whichthe Imam would obtain qualified recognition ofhis claims in respect of the outlying portions of the Protectorate in return for the abandonment of any claim to Aden itself and its immediateneighbourhood.    The Air Ministry recommended thatthe reply to the Imam should be so worded as toleave room for compromise on the basis of a qualified recognition of the Imam&apos;s claim inrespeot of the outlying portions of the Protector-ate.    The Secretary of State for the Coloniessupported the view of the Resident,In the oourse of the discussion it becamaevident that the Cabinet were not at presentprepared to insist, as an indispensable conditionof conversations with the Imam1 s representative,at Aden, that the Imam should undertake to
withdraw from the areas within the aden protectorate boundary which are now occupiedby his troops.The Secretary of State for theColonies undertook to prepare, forconsJd eration at the next meet-ir.-of the Cabinet, a   fresh draxtreply to the Imam in place of thatsubmitted by the Residenx at Aden,which is contained in A)., ^exure No. 2to CP.-172 (27).
REDUCTION and limitation OFARMAMENTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 57(27) , Con-clusion 10).5.    The Cabinet had before them, a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer recording his view on the question discussed at the Cabinet meeting referred to in the margin, relating to the demand of the United States Delegation at Geneva forparity in Cruisers (Paper CP.-189 (27)).    Thisview was to the effect that we ought not to letourselves be netted in a scheme of parity with theUnited States in Cruisers and other Auxiliaries,since there can be no parity between&apos;a Power whoseNavy is Its life and a Power whose Navy is only forprestige.The events in relation to this question since it was last discussed at the Cabinet were asfollows:On June 29th, the Prime Minister, acting inthe absence of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, had sent a tele grain to Mr London atGeneva (No. 89) in accoidance with the cabinet decision, namely, that&quot;For diplomatic reasons we think It most desirable to say publicly andat once what we believe to be theline on &quot;-vhich you are working,namely, that whole we mean to buildCruisers up to our needs we lay downno conditions limiting America1 sCruisers to a smaller number&quot;.On June 30th- the British Delegation to the naval conference had replied (telegram No. 144) to theeffect that before the receipt of the above-mentiontelegram Mr bridgeman had emphasized the point toMr Gibson, the senior United States&apos;representative and that the First Lord had also given an Interviewon similar lines&apos; to a representative of the
Associated Press of America with a view to thecorrection of the erroneous impression created bytendencious messages to American journals.    this telegram had continued as follows:--&quot;Although, therefore, a correct state-ment of our attitude should now appear in American Press, you will no doubtconsider it desirable that Sir 3.Howardshould make formal communication toState Department (perhaps orally wouldfee best)&apos; to the effect that we haveno intention or desire to questionAmerican claim to parity.    We should prefer it to be in general termsapplicable to present Conferencerather than in the form of admission that parity was definitely concededat Washington as regards all types of vessels&quot;&quot;.The British Delegation1 s telegram went on tosuggest that Sir 3. Howard should urge on theUnited States Government in general terms thedesirability of securing the substantial successof the Conference, and made some suggestions inparticular in regard to the Capital Ship question.On July 1st. the Prime Minister had authorised theForeign Office to send a further telegram (No. 318to Washington, not yet circulated) carrying out theFirst Lord&apos;s proposal quoted above.    In the after--noon of the same day, however, owing to representa-tions by the Admiralty, the Prime Minister had instructed the. Foreign Office to send a further telegram (No. 319, not yet circulated) suspendingNo. 318.    The Prime Minister had been informed thatin any event the American Secretary of State wouldnot be in Washington until today, so that no realloss of time was involved by the delay.    To this telegram Sir E0 Howard had Replied on July 2nd(Sir E. Howard, &apos;Nd. 303) stating that he had suspended
action on No. 318 but that he felt now it would be useful for him to go to Yvashington and endeavour tofind out the attitude of the United States Govern-ment on the Capital Ship question.The question before the Cabinet was as towhat communication, if any, should now be sentthrough Sir E. Howard to the United States Govern-mentaAdmiral of the Fleet Earl Beatty informed the Cabinet that, while Capital Ships were import anfrom the point of view of economy,(and he thoughtit would be difficult for the United States Delega-tion to avoid meeting us half-way in that matter)the really urgent question was that of Cruisers.He was inclined to think that the First Lord^statement at Geneva had been misinterpreted.    his information was that Mr Bridgeman had said that we did not dispute the American claim to parity aslaid down in the Washington Treaty.    That, however,only referred to the Battle Fleet and did not applyto Cruisers required for the protection of trade.The impression seemed to have been formed that -Mr Bridgeman had said that he was willing toaccept parity in all classes.(NOTE. It was pointed out, however,that Mr Bridgeman1 s language in his telegram of June 30th, No. 144, was&apos; most &quot;precise..   He had said that the telegram sent to him as the resultof the discussion at the. Cabinet onthe 29th June (the first telegramquoted above) gave &quot;the lines onWhich we have been w or king&quot; , andhe had^ proposed that Sir E. Howardshould make a formal communication to the State Department &quot;to theeffect that we have no intentionor desire to question Americanclain to parity&quot;.)

Lord beatty  recalled that at the moeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on may 20th. he had explained exactly what had happened at Washington.On that occasion the   Officers of the United Statesand Japanese Navies, after hearing his explanations,had agreed that our position in the matter of cruisers was more difficult than theirs.    At thesane meeting Lord Beatt:/ had said that, in view ofthe need for economy, the Admiralty were preparedto consider parity in regard to Cruisers of the10,000 tons category, &quot;out that they still adhered&apos; to the view that it was undesirable to limit the cruisers necessar,y for the protection of sea commu-nications and trade.    The Admiralty&apos;s proposal hadbeen that, if by stating the numbers required itwas possible to obtain the compensation resultingfrom agreement, in other categories of naval vessels,they would be prepared do state the number of cruisers they required, and why, but only on theunderstanding that the other nations at the Confer-&apos;ence agreed also to say how many Cruisers they required and Why they required them.    This procedure would put the representatives of the United states in a difficulty, as it would be hard for them tojustify-, on strategical grounds, anything like thesame numbers as we required.    Now the Americans had drawn a red herring across the trail,by means of thopowerful Press Agencies that were present at Geneva,in order to lead us into a trap.    He suggested thatat the present juncture the less said the better.Lord Beatty then quoted a/telegram of June 30thfrom the &quot;&quot;British Delegation-at Geneva (Mr London, Np.143) as - follows:
&quot;From conversations with Americanswe know definitely that they willinsist on claiming equality with us.    We have already informedAmericans we cannot object to thisstandpoint, but it is absolutelycertain that if Americans persistin this olaim Japanese will put their figure up to something inthe neighbourhood of 50.    Thislooks as if comprehensive agreement on Cruiser question 1 .&apos;ill be impos-sible.    If, in spite of out efforts,this proves to be the case, we pro-pose that endeavours should be madeto reach an agreement on basis of limitation of numbers of 8-inch cruisers with maximum displacementof 10,000 tons, leaving each nationfree to build to their requirements in smaller Cruisers   ith a lowermaximuiii tonnage and smaller guns&quot;.In these circumstances Lord Beatty thought it was quite possible that to send a telegram to Sir B.Howard might do actual harm, and he urged thatat the present moment it would be better to take no action at all at Washington.    In reply to thesuggestion that Mr Bridgaman, In telegram No. 144from Geneva, had asked for such action, he pointedout that the First Lord had only said &quot;Yon will,no doubt, oonsider it desirable&quot;, and he thoughtthat the First Lord would not be disturbed if notelegram was sent at this moment.In the course of the discussion it was pointedout that, now that the principle of parity had beenconceded^, a great difficulty was likely to arise in regard to the number of - Cruisers.    The Admiraltyinsisted that 70 Cruisers vrere essential for theprotection of the sea-borne oc;amunicatxo.cs and trade of the British Empire.    If America aooepted this figure it would involve a great increase in Cruiserconstruction, and the Americans would say that theConference had only resulted in increased armaments.
Whiteha11 Ga gardens,  S.W.1.July 4th,  1927.On the other hand, if the British total of cruisers was reduced, the Admiralty could not guarantee the protection of trade routes.Moreover, if America insisted on building 70Cruisers,  Japan would demand 50, in which event the Admiralty would require more than 70 BritishCruisers.      It was also pointed out that, by securing parity,  the American Navy reallyobtained a great superiority,  since BritishCruisers had to be spread for the protection ofour world-wide communications, whereas theAmerican Cruisers could be concentrated atany point.The Prime Minister summed up that itappeared desirable to instruct Sir E. Hov ardto use the same language to the American secretary of State as Mr.  Bridgeman had used at Geneva.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs prepared a fresh draftembodying the conclusions of theCabinet, which was approved.

APPENDIX. 1    1To   UNITED STATES Off AMERICA.Code telegram to Sir E. Howard (Manchester Mass)Foreign Office, 4tb July, 1927.. 4.50 p.in.No.  322  (R).xxxxxxxxxxIMPORTANT.Navel Conference.Please confirm to tbo United States government statement made by Mr. Bridgeman and Lord Cecil toMr. Gibson at Geneva that while we must build cruisers upto our needs, we lay down no conditions of limitingAmerican oruisers to a smaller number.You will bear in mind that in our view the washington treaty established the principle of parity for battleshipsbut did not include cruisers in its scope.You should also express the strong hope that UnitedStates government will withdraw any objection to thequestion of capital ships being discussed at Geneva.Par from being an attempt at undermining or weakeningWashington agreement,  sole object of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment is to extend that agreement and their proposals are so adjusted as to oause no disturbance whatever ofoapital ship balance especially at Washington.    I leave it to your discretion to decide whether you should do this in a note or orally.       JI entirely agree that it is how unnecessary for you to seek an explanation of Mr. Kellogg1s telegram toMr. Stirling.Repeated to Geneva No. 94. &apos; *
