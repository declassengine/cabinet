THE PROROGATIONOP PARLIAMENT.Trie Efng&apos; sSpeech.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 62(27),  Con-clusion 2.)1. The attention of the Cabinet was drawn tothe inclusion,in the fifth paragraph of the KingfaSpeech, of the word &quot;aggressive&quot;,before the words&quot;naval strength&quot;, and it was suggested that thisterm might be liable to misinterpretation.After a short discussion, the Cabinet agreed(a) That the term &quot;in aggressive naval strength&quot;, at the end of Paragraph5 of the King&apos;s Speech, should be altered to &quot;in naval strengths andc cave&quot;.(b) That His Majesty should be askedto initial this alteration in theoriginal Speech.
2.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that, though the telegrams from the High Commissioner in Egypt reportinghis conversations with Sarwat Pasha as regards theTreaty were not very satisfactory,  he had reasonto believe that Sarwat Pasha was doing his utmost to carry the Treaty.     -There was evidence of a division of opinion in the Wafd, and it was ofcourse on Sarwat&apos;s success in winning overa considerable section of it that ultimate successdepended.      He assured the Cabinet that no substantial alteration would be made in theTreaty.
THE EUROPEANSITUATION.(Prevl previous reference:Cabinet 61( 6), Con-elusion 2.)5.    Tbe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the general Europeansituation was better than at any time since thepresent Government came into office.-S-
CHINA. 4.    Trie Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the situation in China(previous previous reference: was still one of complete confusion.    It appeared,Cabinet 61(.27), Con- however,  that a heavy blow bad recently been dealtelusion 11.)to the activities of the Communists in the southern part of China.-4-
5.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that Abyssinia was one of thecountries with which our relations were least satis-factory.      No progress had been made towards agreement about the construction of the Lake Tsana d.am.    a difficulty had. arisen with Abyssinia owing to thefact that a member of the British Legation had mention-ed at a private dinner-party that slaves could, stillbe ourchased in Abvssinia.    This had been repeatedat a meeting, at which it had been assumed that noreporters were present, by the Anglican Bishop ofthese regions, and had caused offence to Raz Taffari,and in deference to Abyssinian susceptibilities theSecretary in euestion had been allowed to proceed on leave on the understanding that when he returned the incident would be considered closed.    His Majesty&apos;minister, however, now reported it seemed likely that Raz Taffari would put a slight on the said, memberof the British Legation by omitting him from invita-tions to official functions,  and&apos;so forth.     .Sir AustenCha-sberlain proposed to instruct His  Majesty&apos;s&apos; minister that such conduct would, give a new character to the &quot;incident,  and that he should, inform the Empress thatthe British Government may have to submit to the Leagueof Nations the  justification for the statement endraise the question whether Abyssinia has fulfilled her obligations as a member of the League in regard tothe suppression of slavery.    Either simultaneously with or alternatively to this action the british minister would be recalled on leave.Having heard the reasons for which this action-was  proposed (which related to the position of the-,late British Minister in Abyssinia),  the Cabinet,approved, this proposal.
6. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained to the Cabinet certain difficulties inregard to the relations between Great Britain andthe United States of America, which were partly dueto the approach of the Presidential Election.   TheBritish M4m4-e*-e* proposed that, at a Dinner onJanuary 10th, he sho\fld make a statement combattingfalse allegations current in America as to an increasein the elevation of heavy guns in British capital ships.   Sir Austen Chamberlain felt, however, thatit would be much better for the British ambassador to avoid public controversy on matters of this kind,which could better be dealt with at home/, /h^i^-^i^This view met with general acceptance bythe Cabinet,   Sor^e stress was laid on the difficul-ties of reaching a really friendly footing, with theUnited States of America.    It was pointed out thatin the case of the Irish settlement, the abandonment of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, several of theprovisions of the Washington Conventions, and thefunding of the debt, it had been supposed that asettlement would make towards more friendly relations;but the concessions we had made on all these pointshad led to no result.    This, it was suggested, oughtto be borne in mind in connection with the questionof belligerent rights at sea.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the question of belligerent rights at sea was under investigation by a Sub-Committee ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence and was distinct :from the matters to which he had referred.
THE landlord and TENANTBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet.   52(27), Con-elusion 1.)7.    The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet thatthe House of Lords had introduced amendments in the landlord and Tenant Bill in regard to (i)  theTribunal,  (ii) contracting out, and (iii) the depri-vation of the right to compensation of a tenant whohad become a &quot;statutory tenant&quot; under the provisionsof the Rent Restrictions Act.    Sir William Joynson-Hicks thought that the House of Commons could be induced to accept the amendments introduced by theHouse of Lords on the two former points, but he was more doubtful about the third.   He asked for a certaindiscretion from the Cabinet in regard to this thirdIn the course of the discussion the HomeSecretary was asked to do his titmost to secure theadoption of the amendments proposed by the Houseof Lords, including the third amendment, the conces-sion in regard to which had led to a conciliatory attitude on the part of the opponents of the measureon several other points.The At to mey-G general    al asked the Fom-s Secretary,in consultation with his advisers,  to make quite sure that the amendments introduced in the House ofLords on the first two points would be held by theCourts to carry out their intention.The Home Secretary undertook to do his best to carry out the Cabinet&apos;s wishes,and was given a discretion to accept an alteration of the House of Lordsamendment on the third point if absolutely. unavoidab le.
GREYHOUND 8.   The Force Secretary informed the Cabinet thatRACING.he was about to receive a Deputation in oppositionto Greyhound Racing.   He read the draft of his proposed reply, which included the following points:-That the Government must be sure of their groundbefore interfering with any sport;    that the questionof juvenile betting would be dealt with at an earlydate:    and that the whole question of greyhound racing would have to be most carefully consideredby His Ma j es t y&apos;s G ov ernment.The trend of the opinion expressed in thediscussion was opposed to the new development ofgreyhound racing on account of the great incentiveit gave to gambling and consequential evils.    It was felt that at a time when the Government had imposed a Betting Tax, it was very important, on moralgrounds, not to give any encouragement or stimulus to the habit of betting.
NEXT MEET TNG 9 .    The Cabinet agreed  OP THE CABINET.That a Special Meeting should be heldton THURSDAY, DECEMBER 2,2nd, AT THEHOUSE OP COMMONS, at 11-30 ft.tr-., forthe consideration of the NAVAL CON-reconstruotion PRO GRAINS and any other questions outstanding from thepresent Mseting.
100 The Cabinet had before them the SeoondReport of the Cabinet Committee on Beam wireless and Cable Services (Paper CP--316 (27)) 9 theConclusions of which are as followst%) That the Representatives ef HisMajesty*s Government in Great britain should be informed that, of all thealternative proposals which HisMajesty&apos; a Government have ao far oon-Qldered in regard to the competition between the cable and wireless services,the one which they would prefer is theproposal for securing a working agree-ment, between the cable an4 wirelessinterests, oi) the general lines indi-Gated In paragraphs 18-21 of thisreport,(ii) That it would not seem desirable thatthe Conference itself should enter into any negotiations with the cable and wireless interests, and the terms ofreference did not contemplate this;at the same time, it should be explained to the Representatives of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain and to anyDominion Government or the GovernmentOf India which may enquire that theterms of reference do not preclude the hearing of evidence or the reception of suggestions from any cable and wireless bodies concerned.(iii) That ife during the course of the workof the Conference, it should appearpossible that a settlement on the linesof a working agreement might be reached,the Representatives of His Majesty&apos;aGovernment in Great Britain should beauthorised, provided the Representativesof the other Governments concur and aresimilarly authorised, to agree to nego-tiations with the commercial interests. concerned with a view to finding a basisof agreement ad referendum to theGovernments.   Such negotiations mightbe entrusted to a single independentperson unconnected with any of theGovernments.(iv) That every effort should be made tosecure that there should be no reductionof the existing cable rates pending some decision.(v) That it is very desirable that the Con-ference should meet as soon as possible,after the beginning, of January in viewof the fact that certain of the Repre-sentatives of the Dominions are already in this country and others will arrivebefore the end of the year.
That, in the meantime, an Inter-departmental Committee, composed ofrepresentatives of -The Treasury,The Post Office,The Dominions Office,The Colonial Office,The India Office,The War Office,The Admiralty,The Air Ministry,should he appointed to prepare documentsfor the use of the Imperial WirelessConference and briefs for the use of theRepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;a Govern-ment in Great Britain at the Conference,but should not, of course, negotiate inany way with the cable and wirelessinterests.    Such Inter-departmentalCommittee should continue in beingduring&apos;the Conference and be availableto prepare any further information required by the Conference or the british representatives.In a covering Note Sir John Gilmour, theChairman of the Committee, requested that theCabinet should determine the question of the .representation of His Majesty^ Government inGreat Britain at the forthcoming Conference withrepresentatives of the Dominion   and Indian Govern-ments .The Cabinet agreed -(a) To approve the Report of the CabinetCommittee, the Conclusions of whichare set forth above:(b) That the British Government should berepresented $$i the Secretary of Statefor Scotland,/eubject to the consentof the Dominions, should be theChairman of the Conference, and theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury:(c) That the Acting Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs should do his best to induce the Dominions to agree,to&quot; the above, and themselves to berepresented by only one delegate apiece.
IHDIANISATIONOF THE indian army.(previous previous reference:Cabinet 57(27), Con-c Ins ion 14.)11.    The Cabinet had before them the Report of aSub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence(Paper C.P.-320 (27))  on the subject of the Indian-isatiOn of the Indian Army.    The Gabinet were ashedto deal with this Report without awaiting the comments of the Committee of Imperial Defence, asthe Sub-Committee&apos;s Report had not been ready forconsideration at the meeting of that Committee onDecember 19th.From the discussion which took place,  it transpired that real agreement had not been reached by the Sub-Committee.   At one meeting, for example,at which the Secretary of State for India had been unable to be present, it had been decided to modify the proposal that the goal of Indianisation shouldbe the establishment of a Dominion Army in India.At the following meeting, at which the only cabinet ministers present were the Secretary of State forIndia and the Secretary of State for War, thisdecision had been reversed.In view of this difference of opinion, theCabinet felt that they could not usefully pursue the matter in the absence of the Secretary of Statefor India, who was indisposed.The Parliamentary -Under-Secretary of Stateinformed the Cabinet that an undertaking had beengiven to the effect that a statement would be-mads on the subject at the opening of the IndianLegislature towards.the end of January.    It was important that the matter should be settled before that occasion.The Prime Minister asked the Cabinet to decide,in the circumstances, that the question should be&apos;
postponed until the Secretary of State for india could be present, and that the subject should beconsidered either on the following day or, if LordBirkenhead was not sufficiently &quot;recovered,  at thefirst Meeting in the New Year,
IRISHLOYALISTS.(previous reference:Cabinet 59(27), Con-conclusion 6.)13. The Cabinet had before their the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on the Claims of IrishLoyalists (Paper 0.P..-319 (27)) . &apos;The following recommendations were made tothe Cabinet by the Chairman (the Chancellor of theExchequer) and the Attorney-General:-(i) The Sumner scale should be appliedto the assessments recommended bythe Wood-Renton Committee;(ii) An immediate announcement should bemade of the Government&apos;s decision;(iii) In order to relieve cases of hardshipas far as possible, the dominions office should be authorised to makeimmediate payment on the above scale in all cases in which the Committeehave completed their investigations,and to make advances on the Committee&apos;recommendation where necessary inother cases&apos;;(lv) An additional sum of  25,000 shouldbe placed at the disposal of theDominions Office, to supplement theSumner scale in cases of exceptionalhardship on the recommendation ofthe Wood-Renton Committee.The Lord Privy Seal and the President of theBoard of Education had recorded their dissent fromthese Conclusions.In the course of the discussion the PrimeMinister read an extract from a letter from Mr Ameryto Sir Alexander Wood-Ren ton (Appendix) from whichit was clear that the Government did not bindthemselves to accept the recommendations of theWood-Renton Committee; . and that if their recom-mendatlons exceeded  400,000 the Government would itself make the necessary adjustment. ; v ,The Cabinet
Cabinet.The Cabinet agreed - (a)  (By a majority) -c approve the recom-mendations of the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Attorney-general in Paper CP.-319 (27), as set forthab ove:&apos; (b) That the Lord Privy Seal should pre-pare a statement to read in the Houseof Lords, which should include the extract in the Appendix from Mr Amery&apos;sletter, and should add that, in viewof the nature of the Wood-Renton Report,the Government had decided to raisethe amount from  400,000 to  625,000.
o 9(3^EXPORT OPAERONAUTICALMATERIAL TORUSSIA.(previous reference:Cabinet 53(27), Con-clusion 6,)13. The Secretary of State for Air consulted the Cabinet as to whether he should permit MessrsViokers to accept an order frovt &quot;Arcos&quot; for certainaeroplanes for civilian use.   These aircraft werein fact identical with bombers without the Serviceappliances, and could be used either for passenger-carrying or for carrying troops or bombs.    The AirStaff were disposed not to refuse the order.   Thenew factors, as compared with orders previouslysanctioned by the Cabinet, were that the machinescould be used as bombers and- were fitted with aNapier &quot;Lion&quot; engine.    This engine was obsolescentinsomuch as it had recently been replaced by an improved type, but it would be the first case ofthe export of a Napier &quot;Lion&quot; engine to Russia,It was suggested to the Cabinet that.theorder was probably not bona fide but was for thepurpose of bringing down prices in other countries.The Cabinet agreed.  That the Secretary of State for air should not allow the order to beaccepted.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,
CABINET 6 5 (87).  CONCLUSION 12.A P P E N D I X.EXTRACT FROM A. LETTER FROM Mr AMERY. TOSIR ALEXANDER WOOD-RE NT ON,,  DATED 17 thSEPTEMBER.   1926.&quot;You will see from the Committee&apos;s Report thattheir view is that, in dealing with this poet-Truceproblem, the Government shotild abandon (without altoge-ther losing sight of) the legal standard by referenceto which the Compensation (Ireland) Commission worked,and should have primary regard to the degree of hardshipinvolved in each individual case, whether or not suchhardship would formerly have entitled the sufferer to compensation.    The Government, however., have no means ofknowing, until the work of the Committee is completedor nearly completed, what is the extent of the hardshipwith which they will have to deal, and they have not felt justified in committing the British taxpayer toan indefinite liability.   They propose,; therefore, thatthe function of the Committee should be (as indeed theDunedin Report recommends) not to make awards, as&apos; theCompensation Commission in effect did, but to advise theGovernment:    and the Government by no means bind them-selves to act on that advice.    We shall have in our mindsa limit of expenditure beyond which we are not preparedto go&apos;,    and if the total of the Committee&apos;s recommends-tions (which of course will not be published,  at anyrate at the time they are made) exceeds this amount,  theGovernment will find it necessary to adjust the payments made in each individual case accordingly.This will involve that no payment will be made until the Committee has so far c on pie ted its task as toenable a fairly close estimate to be made of their totalrecommendations:    but it would of course be open to theCommittee to recommend in individual cases, where theneed is urgent, that an advance should be made to thesuf ferer.For your own private information I may say thatthe Cabinet has decided that  400,000 is the absolutemaximum which can be provided to meet the recommendationsof the Committee, and it hopes that this figure may notbe reached.    In the first instance we propose to ask parliament to vote  150,000 during the current, financialyear&quot;.

DECEMBER 22nd..1927.The accompanying revised, copy of the King^sSpeech on the Prorogation of Parliament, with the fifthparagraph altered as proposed &quot;by the Cabinet at their meeting today, is circulated in substitution for the copy issued on the 20th instant.(Sgd.) M.P.A. HAN KEYSecretary to the Cabinet.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 21st, 1927.
The King&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.December 22, 1927.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,I HAVE followed with constant interest the journeys of My Sons, the prince of Wales and Prince George, to Canada, and also of My Son and Daughter-in-Law, the Duke and Duchess of York, to New Zealand, Australia and other partsof My Dominions. I rejoice in their return, and I have learned from themwith deep satisfaction of the loyal and enthusiastic welcome which they invariablyexperienced throughout their journeys.It gave Me particular pleasure in the course of the summer to receive in Mycapital the President of the French Republic accompanied by the French Ministerfor Foreign Affairs. The visit gave fresh evidence of the cordial relations sohappily established between My Government and the Government of the republic and afforded My people a welcome opportunity of demonstrating&apos; their affectionfor France in the persons of these two eminent statesmen.The visit of the King of Egypt was a source of gratification to Me andafforded an opportunity for a full exchange of views between the EgyptianPrime Minister and My Foreign Secretary. The frank and friendly nature ofthese conversations was in itself of good augury for the future and it is My hopethat their outcome may prove of lasting benefit to both countries.I have watched with profound sympathy and satisfaction the steady growth in influence of the League of Nations and the increasing&quot; part which it plays incomposing international differences and preserving peace. The recent meeting ofthe Council at Geneva marked a further stage in this progress. My Governmentwill continue to base its policy on loyal co-operation with the League.A Conference with representatives of the United States of America and japan was held at Geneva, at which the delegates of My Government putforward proposals for the future limitation of armaments, which if acceptedwould have led to substantial reductions in naval strengths and costs.I regret that though much community of view was revealed, it was notpossible to reach a general agreement. But in spite of this temporary failure,My Government have no intention of embarking upon an increase of their navalbuilding programme, which is based upon a considered view of the defensiveneeds of My wide-spread Empire.A Conference, attended by Governors or other senior officials representingtwenty-six Colonies, Protectorates and Mandated Territories, assembled in may to exchange views on proposals of common interest to the Colonial Empire. Thisyeaf- has also been marked by important Inter-Imperial Conferences in Londondealing with education and agricultural research. I am confident of the great value of such meetings, not only in the results achieved and the recommendations made, but also in bringing together, in a spirit of comradeship and mutual assistance, those who are engaged in similar work in widely separated parts of MyDominions. &quot;My Government having decided that the time is ripe for the initiation of the inquiry into the working of the system of government in India for which the law- provides, I have, with the concurrence of both your Houses, issued a Commissionto seven of your number who will shortly embark upon their momentous task. I earnestly trust that their labours may be crowned with success, and that from theircounsels may,emerge a system of government which shall give contentment to the peoples of India and strengthen the bonds that unite My Empire.(16956)
A new treaty between Myself and His Majesty the King of Iraq, to replace the existing treaties between us, has been signed by Our respective representatives.The text of this treaty has been laid before you.During the past year Agreements have, been concluded with the Greek andSerb-Croat-Slovene Governments providing for the settlement of their respectivewar debts to this country. The terms of the Agreements have been presented toParliament, and, as in previous cases, they give effect to the policy adopted by my government to limit the claims on our Allies to such amounts as, together withour Reparation Receipts, will cover the obligations My Government has itself tomeet in respect of War Debts. I note with satisfaction..that funding agreements have now been signed in respect of all the Allied War Debts to this country,except that of Russia.Members op the House of Commons,I thank you for the provision you have made for the public service.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,My Ministers continue to watch closely the state of employment which,though showing welcome signs of improvement in some parts of the country,still gives cause for anxiety in others. To facilitate the transfer of labour fromindustries with restricted opportunities for employment and in particular thecoal-mining industry, a Board is to be appointed to recommend the executive action to be taken by the Departments concerned. My Ministers look with confidence for co-operation from all who can assist in this work both at home and overseas. &apos;A Bill has been passed placing the system of insurance against unemploymentupon an improved permanent basis.Striking progress has been made during the past year in providing housing accommodation for the people and the number of new houses completed inEngland and Wales since the Armistice now exceeds one million.During the past year a greater number of new houses have been completed inScotland than in any previous year. Substantial progress is also being made withthe clearance of insanitary areas and the rehousing of displaced tenants.A Bill has been passed to declare and amend the law with regard to TradeDisputes and Trade Unions.I have given My assent to the Landlord and Tenant Bill, the provisions ofwhich will secure to certain classes of tenants compensation for the loss of good-will attaching to their premises and for unexhausted improvements, and will effectother desirable alterations in the law.A Bill has been passed which it is hoped will materially assist thedevelopment of the British Cinematograph Film Industry.A Bill has also been passed providing for the reorganisation of certain legalservices and the amendment in certain respects of the law relating to SheriffCourt business in Scotland.It is My earnest prayer that the blessing of Almighty God may rest upon allyour past and coining labours.
