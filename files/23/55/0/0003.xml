The Cabinet had before them a draft statement for Parliament on the subject of the search of premises at 49, Moorgatej, on i^ay 12th.which had been prepared by a Cabinet committee under the Chairmanship of the Lord Chancellor,and which was handed round at the beginning ofthe meeting.The Lord Chancellor suggested the followingre-draft of a passage in the penultimate para-graph of the draft statement&quot;Other documents were found onthe premises, but it is unneces-sary to describe them as the documents already referred tosufficiently prove the existence&quot;,etcoLord Cave then read an additional draft paragraph to the statement based on the assumption thatthe Russia:^ Trade Delegation was to be expelled,and a short Note regarding the proceedings ofthe.Committee.      In this Note it was pointedout that the complicity of the Soviet diplomatic mission at Chesham House with the propagandistactivities of 49,. Moor-gate,  could not be completely substantiated from the documentsseized at the latter establishment, and thatthis could only be done by using secret documents of a class which it is not usual to quote inpublished- statements-.Three main points before the Cabinet were;-(1) Should the statement of facts inregard to the search, prepared by theCabinet Committee, be used as thebasis of the announcement inParliament?(2) Sltould the , Russian Trade Agreement     .be cancelled sand the&apos; Russian Trade &apos; v .Delegation expelled,-and shouldArcos be closed? 7c -  -
(3) Should the Soviet diplomatic mission be expelled and theBritish Mission at Moscowrecalled? - a course involvingpublication of some of the secret documents already referred to.In regard to the first point the cabinet approved the draft statement prepared by theCommittee (subject to the small amendment pro--posed by the Lord Chancellor) as the basis ofthe announcement in Par1lamentoIn regard to the second point there was generalagreement that the Russian Trade Agreement shouldbe terminated and that the Russian Trade Delega-tion and all individuals in Arcos known to been gaged in propaganda work should be expelledoIt was not considered desirable, however, thatthe trading activities of Arcos (a british company whose capital is owned by the SovietGovernment) should be brought to an end byBritish Government action, as it was desirablethat- trade with Russia should continue on thesame basis as it is conducted in the United Statesof America and other countries which have noTrade Agreement with the Soviet.-.In regard to the third point there&apos;was generalagreement that, insomuch as the Soviet Governmenthad been engaged in illicit interference in theinternal affairs of this country through theRussian Trade Delegation and arcos, it would beimpossible to allow a third agency, namely, the diplomatic Mission, to remain, more especially as, from overwhelming secret evidence ofunquestionable authenticity, the Mission had also been engaged in interference in the affairs of this c dun try * .. ,
In regard to the use of certain secretdocuments, the following extracts were read to the Cabinet from a Cabinet Conclusion ofMay 2, 1323 (Cabinet 23  (23), Conclusion 2),when the Cabinet had been faced with a somewhat similar situation:-,r(a) That the advantages of basing the published British case on actualextracts from the despatcheswhich had passed between theSoviet Government and its agents,outweighed the disadvantages ofthe possible disclosure of the secret source from which thesedespatches had been obatined,more especially as this was actually known to the russian soviet Government:(b) That the actual source of this information should not be disclosed in Parliament.&quot;Extracts were also read from a Memorandum sent,as the result of the above decisions, by thelate ^arquess Curzon of Kedleston to M. Chicheriincluding quotations in inverted commas fromdespatches which had passed between the SovietGovernment and its representatives  (cmd* 1869,NooS)..The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read to the Cabinet a number of documentsselected from the large mass of secret informa-tion which had come into the possession ofHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and indicated certain of these which he considered might bepublished without injury to His iviajesty^servicesc      Sir Austen Chamberlain also informed the Cabinet that though he would still have preferred, from the point of view
of foreign policy, to avoid a rupture of relations If that had been possible, thesituation was no longer the same as when theCabinet last discussed the matter, and the ill effects, if any, on the general Europeansituation would now be much less.      He had considered and described to the Cabinet theonly alternatives which had been suggested to hiiru     He was not able to recommend either of these alternatives and was quite preparedfor a rupture If the Cabinet decided to approvepublication of that portion of the secret information which he thought suitable forthe purpose.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the Russian Trade Agreement of1921 should be terminated;    that theSoviet Diplomatic Mission, as wellas the Russian Trade Delegation,should be expelled from this country;and that the British diplomatic mission should be withdrawn from -Moscow:(b) That all Russians in Ar-ccs known tobe engaged in Illicit Interference inthe Internal affairs of this country should be required to leave thecountry, but that trade with russia should be permitted to continue asin the United States of America andother countries which have no trade agreement with Soviet Russia:(c) That the draft Statement prepared bythe Cabinet Committee, amended as- proposed by the Lord Chancellor,should forai the basis of the announce-ment to W, made in Parliament on tuesday,,   aay 24th;,  and that theannouncement should be completed by.   the inclusion of additional material to be furnished by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs, the finaldrafting of the Statement as a wholebeing left to the Prime Minister,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and the Home Secretary.

Circulated to the Cabinet, by direction o.t[This Document is the Property of His Britannic MajestyV Government.]RUSSIA.[May 26, 1927. confidential.Section 1.[N 2426/209/38]No. 1.Sir Austen Chamberlain to M. Rosengolz.Sir,Foreign Office, May 26, 1927.THE recent examination by the police of the premises of &quot; Arcos &quot; limited and of the Russian Trade Delegation has conclusively proved that both militaryespionage and subversive activities throughout the British Empire were direeteaand carried out from 49, Moorgate. No ostensible differentiation of rooms or dutieswas observed as between the members of the Trade Delegation and the employees of &quot; Arcos,&quot; and it has been shown that both these organisations have been involvedin anti-British espionage and propaganda.2. But the matter does not end there. Your Government and you will recognise the messages which were read by the Prime Minister to the House of Commons lastTuesday. I would remind you that your own telegram, in which you request material to enable you to support a political campaign in this country against His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, was despatched within a few weeks of the warning conveyed to your government in my note to you of the 23rd February last, adducing specific instances of anti-British propaganda and requesting its cessation.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government had hoped that the Soviet Government wouldtake that opportunity, given them in accordance with the provisions of article 13of the Trade Agreement, of &quot; furnishing an explanation or remedying the default.&quot;They did neither; on the contrary, the hostility of the Soviet Government, togetherwith the subversive propaganda carried on by their associates, the RussianCommunist party and the Third International, in the United Kingdom itself andin British overseas territories, has continued unchecked, to culminate in the abuse of diplomatic privilege revealed by your attempt to interfere in the domestic affairs of this country.4.   There I warned you in my note of the 23rd February last, limits to the patience of His Majesty&apos;s Government and of public opinion here, and theselimits have now been reached. In view of the facts stated above, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in Great Britain must now regard themselves, in accordance with theprovisions of paragraph 3 of article 13 of the Trade Agreement of the 16th March,1921, as free from the obligations of that agreement. The&apos; privileges conferred onM. Khinchuk and his assistants in accordance with the agreement are accordinglyterminated, and I have to request their departure from this country.5. His Majesty&apos;s Government, while compelled to take this step for the reasonsstated above, do not wish to interfere with the ordinary course of legitimate Anglo-Russian trade, and will therefore place no obstacles in the way of genuine commercebetween the two countries. They will raise no objection to the continuance of the legitimate commercial operations of &quot; Arcos &quot; Limited in the same conditions asthose applicable to other trading organisations in this country, and with this objectthey are prepared to allow a reasonable number of the Russian employees of thecompany, whose names will be communicated to you, to remain in this country,provided that they comply with the law of the land and confine their activities tolegitimate commerce. But His Majesty&apos;s Government cannot suffer the existencehere of a privileged organisation which, under the guise of peaceful trading, carrieson espionage and intrigues against the country in which it is established.6. Finally, His Majesty&apos;s Government have decided that they can no longermaintain diplomatic relations with a Government which permits and encouragessuch a state of things as has been disclosed. The existing relations between the twoGovernments are hereby suspended, and I have to request that you will withdrawyourself and your staff from this country within the course of the next ten days. Iam instructing His Majesty&apos;s representative at Moscow to leave Russia with his staff, and should be glad if you would request your Government to afford to him, toMr. Preston at Leningrad and to Mr. Paton at Vladivostok, the necessary facilities.for the departure of themselves and their assistants.[130 cc-1]
7.   Suitable arrangements, the details of which will be communicated to you indue course, will be made for the departure from this country of yourself and yourstaff and of the Russian members of the Trade Delegation.. .  :. I have, &amp;c.AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN.
SEARCH OF PREMISES AT 49t MOORQATE.QIC MAY 12 th. 1937.For many months the Police, in collaboration with the military authorities, have been investigating the activities of a group of secret agents engaged inendeavouring to obtain highly confidential documents relating to the Armed Forces of Great Britain.    from information received and evidence obtained in the courseof these investigations it became increasingly difficultto resist the conclusion that the agents were working *nbehalf o^ the Soviet Government and that they obtainedtheir instructions from members of the Russian trade delegation, working at Soviet House, why arranged forthe conveyance to Moscow of photographs or copies ofthe documents obtained.These suspicions were confirmed when, early thi3year, a British subject employed in the Air Force&apos; wasconvicted of stealing two such documents as have been described.    The documents were recovered and the lndivid-ual is now undergoing imprisonment.The secret organisation on behalf of which he had obtained the documents is known-and its connection witha similar Russian organisation has been established.A further document of an official and highlyconfidential character, so marked, was recently foundto be missing, and from information secured, and supported by documentary evidence, it became clearthat this document had been conveyed to
49 Moorgate and -there reproduced: &quot;by-- means of a phcto-static apparatus, th:;; character and location of which-were-described,Upwn this information -application was made to the magistrate for a Warrant for the search of the premises.,which was granted and executed on the 12th Instant.Armed with knowledge of the above facts, certainPolice Officers, specially detailed, went, immediatelyafter effecting their entry, straight to the Photostatroom and to the room        occupied by the Cipher Clerk,Anton Miller, who was known to be one of the persons inti-mately concerned In the activities of the secret agents.The subterranean photostat room answered^-exactlyto the description previously given to the Police.The man in charge of this room, Robert Kolingor Kaulin, who was found at work, is described in a document discovered amengst the secret staff records in another room.    This document, which1is in Russian, dated23rd December, 1926, and signed by Jilinsky, who, untilhis return to Russia the other day, combined the dutiesof head of the Staff Allotment Department of the russian trade Delegation with those of principal espionageand secret prppjig-anda agent- for Europe, is addressedto the Manager of the Secret Section and consists of a recommendation *f Keling for the post he now holds,together with a history of his past activities.   Itestates that Koling was previously engaged in carryingon illegal Communist agitation as a member of the RedTrade Union of Sailors, and indicates that in this capacity he was concerned in the-conveyance of secretcommunications abroad and now discharges, arn^ng other duties, that of carrier of the diplomatic post between -/*** \Chesham House and Soviet House.   It finally states thathe was recommended by three persons known to us to bein control &apos; ef the secret.
espionage groups previously referred to.     This man&apos;squalifloation for continued employment under the russian trade Delegation thus consisted in the fact that he hadbeen engaged in illegal activities.In the possession of Koling were found a numberof closed envelopes addressed with the names of well-known Communist individuals and organisations in thiscountry and America,     These envelopes contained informa-tion and directions from the Red International of LabourUnions to the Communist organisations in this country and america, including the National Minority Movement, all of themost recent date, and a comparison of these letters with the list of addresses to which I shall refer later shows that theoffice of Arcos and the Trade Delegation has been habituallyused as a clearing-house for subversive correspondence ofthis nature.     Among the subjects dealt with in this correspondence are Ccsranunist seamen s Clubs, the Hands OffChina Campaign, Anti-Trade Union Bill agitation, thedistribution of Communist propaganda, and industrialaffairs in America&apos;,In Koling&apos;s possession also were found a number ofprinted application forms for membership of the nationalMinority Movement, which had been filled wp by seamen whohad been canvassed for that purpose in Russian ports and whose applications, together with their membershipsubscriptions, were in process of transmission through this Russian Official channel to the National MinorityMovement.     Turther interesting light is thrown upon thisparticular phase of Soviet activity by a letter dated3rd November, 1926, &quot;addressed to Jilinsky and describingarrangements made for the training of Communist agitatorson Arcos ships with a view to the subsequent dissominaw&quot;tion by them of subversive propaganda among the crews of British ships.     The letter.is a long &quot;one, and I will   -give only the following extract:-
&quot;I consider the only solution to lie inmaking these ships of o\irs a &quot;base fortraining politically conscious seamen,who, after preliminary training, could&quot;be sent to other British ships.Instruction could be given-by such seamenas cannot obtain employment for Communisticagitation on any British ship.      The choice of men should be carefully made, prefer-ence being given to negroes, Hindoosand other oppressed nationalities, butit would of course be necessary to investigate to what extent such material would prove appropriate for future work.As soon as a seaman is taken on he shouldbe trained and then made to go and workamongst British sailors.      This has beenthe practice I have sa far followed and my preliminary results were apparentduring the seamen&apos;s strike when those. who had passed through our schooloccupied the most prominent positions.&quot;The room occupied by Anton Miller wasadjoining that of ti. iChinchuk,  the Chief of theTrade Delegation.      It had no handle tn the outside of the door, ingress being obtained solely&quot;by means of a key.      On arrival the policefound that the door was locked and there wasa light in the room.      Demand was made for admission, whereupon the door was unlocked. /Anton itliller himself with one other man anda woman were found in occupation.      Miller was engaged in hurriedly burning papers, some ofwhich appeared to have been taken from an open despatch box on the table in front of him.On the police attempting to take possessionof this despatch box a struggle ensued.      Millerresisted and in the course of the struggle a paper fell from-his pocket.      This document was found to consist of a list of secret cover
addresses,  or,  according to trie document,&quot;Illegal&quot; addresses, for communication withthe Communist parties in the U.S.A., i/iexico,South America,  Canada, Australia, Hew Zealand,and South Africa.Other documents were found on the premisesbut it is unnecessary to describe them, as the documents already referred to sufficientlyprove the existence under the direct controlof the Soviet authorities of a regular-system whereby documents of a subversive charactefrom various organisations in Russia wereconveyed secretly to various persons engagedin Communist activity In this country and elsewhere.In conclusion it may be pointed out thatthe evidence now In the hands of the authoritiesproves that:-1.      Both military espionage and subversive activities throughout the BritishEmpire and North and South Americawere directed and carried out from49, Moorgate.2,     No effective differentiation of roomsor duties was observed as between themembers of the Trade Delegation andthe employees of Arcos, and both these organisations have been involvedin anti-British espionage and propaganda.
The Soviet Government cermet escape responsibility forthe actions of the Trade Delegation and the abuse of thefacilities afforded to it.     But tiie matter does not restthere-    It would in any case be difficult to believe that whilst one organ of the Soviet Government, nemely the trade delegation, was thus breaking the solemn undertakings onthe faith of which it was received, the other organ ofthat Government in this country, namely the Soviet mission and the Government itself, - vre not parties to these,proceedings.    But the case against them dees not depend upon inference.The &quot;Trade Agreement provided inter alia &quot;that each party refrains from hostile action or undertakings againstthe others and from conducting outside of its own bordersany official propaganda direct or Indirect against the institutions of the British Empire or the Russian soviet republic respectively&quot;.     His MajestyTs Government have on several occasions found it necessary to draw the attentionof the Soviet Authorities to the breach of this engagementby Soviet emissaries in China.    These have always beendenied.On February 1st last, Monsieur Rosengclz, theSoviet Charge d1 Affaires in this? country, informed hisGovernment that it was essential to give a short explanatory-ation to the Press saying that Borodin was not a soviet representative and was not even in the service of theSoviet Government,   but that he was a private citizenin the service of the Chinese Government and that theSoviet Government were not answercLie for his actions;-6-
and this message was followed up three days laterby another one stating that an announcement ofBo rod in rs recent visit to Moscow, where he received instructions, hi-d been previouslypublished, and that, if possible,  it would he desirable to contradict ihis.    On.  February 3rd.Monsieur Rosengolz published a statement in the&quot;Dsily Telegraph&quot; to the effect tnat &quot;Borodin iss private individual who is not and never hss beenin the service of the Soviet Government&quot;, end thrt&quot;in view of the fact that Monsieur Borodin has norelation whatever with the Soviet Government,  itis therefore self-evident that the Soviet Govem-ment can in no way be held responsible for hisactions and speeches&quot;.      On February 11th sir robert Hodgson made enquiries of Monsieur -Litvlnoff himself regarding Borodin, to whichMonsieur Litvinoff replied that he did not  nowmuch about Borodin except that he was a RussianCommunist and had been a frlsn-a of Sun-Yat-Sen,and that, as for the allegation that Borodin wasa representative of the Soviet Government, thatwas without foundation, and that the SovietGovernment had no kind of connection with him orresponsibility for him.      Yet there is in the possession of His majesty&apos;s Government a telegram&quot;dated November 12th last year from the Commissar-fat for Foreign Affairs to the Soviet represent-ative in Peking in the following terms:
&quot;I herewith communicate  departments decision&quot;for your execution.(1) Until a Soviet representativeis appointed to Peking ComradeBorodin is to take his ordersdirect from Moscow.(2) The Far Eastern Bureau to beinformed that all its decisions and measures regarding questions*f the general policy of theKuomintang in China and of militarypolitical -work must be agreed cnwith Comrade Borodin.In the event of differences of^ pinion arising on these questionsthey must be referred to Moscow for investigation.     Borodin and theFar Eastern Bureau must keep Moscowrsrepresentatives in Peking informed &quot;*fall their decisions and moves withregard to these questions(3) Comrade Borodinfs appointment as official Soviet representative in Cant**n is considered inadvisable.Borodin is to remain (in charge) ofthe work in the provinces underCanton rule, and an officialrepresentative to the Canton Governmentis to be appointed.&quot;The denials of any responsibility forBorodin1 s actions made by the Soviet Charge7d&apos;Affaires here and by Monsieur Litvinoff in moscow were therefore untrue and were made only in the hope of deceiving H.M. Governmentand the British public while under their cloakBorodin was in fact carrying on his anti-foreign and anti-British activities as the authorisedagent of the Soviet Government and by their orders.Nrr have these illegitimate activitiesbeen confined to China.     There has come into&apos;the possession of H.M.&apos; Government a telegramfrom the Soviet Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires in london to&quot;the Commissariat for Foreign Affairs,
Moscow dated April 1st last,  I.e. seme five weeks after the solemn warning conveyed inour Note of February 23rd.      It is in thefollowing terms&quot;Copy to Berlin for Tomsky.&quot;One of the principal obstacles for&quot;conducting a campaign of protest against&quot;British violence in China is the appalling&quot;supply of information and the way in&quot;which the wide labour circles are misled.&quot;It is necessary :&quot;(1) To send by telegraph the officialreports of the Nationalist Govern-ment on events at Nankin.      Inparticular facts which deny theinformation about Nankin given byChamberlain in Parliament or 30thMarch, copies to be sent to &quot;the I.L. P.and.the  TDaily Herald&apos;.&quot;(2) A message of the Shanghai UnitedTrades Unions addressed to thePresident of the General Council,Hicks describing the situation and inparticular pointing cut that,, as a- result rf the British bombardment ofNankin,  a large number of members of trades Unions lost their JLives.      Ifpossible - It would be desirable t(*cite a number of Instances, emphasising the fact of British repressionsagainst Chinese Trades Unions andtheir members.      It is desirable to lay stress on the  and to call upon British Trade Unionc te help theChinese labour movement.&quot;(3) Would it not be possible to make useIn a favourable way of the encounterbetween the Commander cf the torpedo boat &apos;Woodcock&apos; and the Chinese -7-at Changsha.      Both in England andwith us there Is wily very vagueInformation on this subject.&quot;(4) I shall wire subsequently on the best way of organising the supply ofInf crmaticr;.
The House will observe that the soviet representative was soliciting information forthe purposes of a political oampaign in thiscountry and giving the substance of the messageswhich he desired to see retransmitted as news from china.Finally, on April 13th the Soviet Charged1Affaires telegraphed to the Cemmissariat for-Foreign Affairs, Mrsoow:-&quot;I very much doubt the possibility&quot;of a raid on our Embassy.    I would^ however,&quot;oonsider it a very useful measure of precau-rttion to suspend for a time the forwarding by&quot;p*st of documents of friends,  &quot;neighbours1&quot;and  so forth from London to Moscow and&quot;vice versa.    Telegraph your decision&quot;immediately.    In the telegram sent in reply&quot;it is desirable to mention that the instruc-&quot;tions emanate from the institutions concerned.1&quot;It is unnecessary to speculate as to thecharacter cf tha diDouments about which he showedsuch anxiety.His Majesty1s Government, as the House knows,from their repeated declarations have not been -unaware of the active hostility of the SovietGovernment elsewhere or of the Illicit activitiesof their representatives here.    In face of thosebreaohes of the Trade Agreement and of internationalcomity. His Majesty^ Government have shown apatience and forbearance which is probably withouta parallel In international relations.   As lateas last February they renewed in the most solemnform their protest and warning.    It is clear that neither have had any effeot.    Diplomatic relationswhan thus deliberately and systematically abused are themselves a danger to peace and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have therefore decided that unless the
House expresses its disapproval on Thursday,they will terminate the Trade Agreement, requirethe withdrawal of the Trade Delegation and SovietMission.from London and recall the British mission from Moscow.The legitimate use of Arcos is unafftcted by these decisions and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsre prepared, whilst terminating the privilegesconferred by Articles 4, 5. and 6 of the trade agreement, to make all arrangements necessaryfor ordinary trade facilities between the twocountries.-24th May,  19?, 7.-11-
