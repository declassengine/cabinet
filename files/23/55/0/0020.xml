2 0 *c1173 BALKANS.previous reference:Cabinet 28(25)    Con-clusion 2,))4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsalluded to the recent revival of troubles of theold type in the Balkans, as illustrated by theincursion into the Serb-Groat-Slovene State and greece of bands emanating from Bulgaria.Fortunately both the Serb-Groat-Slovenes andthe Bulgarians -were acting with wisdom andmoderation, and there was reason to hope thatthe trouble would not. extend.EGYPT.&apos; previous reference:Cabinet 49(27), Con-elusion 1.)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the position in regard to theEgyptian negotiations remained as it was when helast discussed the question with the Cabinet.He expected a visit from Sarwat Pasha in thecourse of October.    He did not anticipate thatSarwat could accept the draft Anglo-Egyptian -Treaty of Alliance and Friendship in full, but het ho tight the conversations had produced a detente.in our relations with Egypt from which there might perhaps emerge some formula as a stepping-stone .towards better relations.   Sir Austen Chamberlainsaid he had. received a message from King Fuad tothe effect&apos; that he intended to back Sarwat Pashain endeavouring to come to some agreement.-a-
ICANADA. 6, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsopossd Visit informed the Cabinet that he had recently learnedGovernor-ineral to the from Washington of a visit to be paid In DecemberIted StatesiAmerica. by the Governor-General of Canada to Washington,where he was to stay at the Canadian Legation.Sir Same&apos; Howard had reported that, according to information he had received from the canadian minister, Lord Willingdon would be officiallyreceived as the Head of a State.The Cabinet were informed that not onlyhad no intimation been sent to His Majesty&apos;government but that Lord Willingdon had not, upto the present time, mentioned the matter to theKing, notwithstanding that under the terms of theGovernor-General&apos;s Warrant he was not allowed toleave Canada without Hi9 lsajesty&apos;s permission.This was the more surprising because as recently as August 3rd Lord Willingdon had informed theKing that he had been asked to make a number- ofspeeches to American Clubs and other organisa-tions but had declined, for reasons which he had communicated to the King and which His Majestyhad approved.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, while there should be noquestion of interfering with the/proposed visit of the Governor-General, it was important toobtain from Lord Willingdon astatement of the present positionof the question and how he had cometo undertake so important a mission^which could not fail to interestHis Majesty&apos;s Government, withoutany preliminary consultation between the British and canadian government&apos;s;    and,more particularly,why any move in the matter had beenmade without obtaining the permission.of the King: &apos;(b) That, subject to consultation withthe Permanent Secretary of theDominions Office, the best way-S-
of obtaining this information would be for the. Prime Ministerto send, a private telegram onthe subject to the Governor-General .-4-

Mr Bridgemanrecalled that the ships had been sent out inorder to bring rapidly to China a motile landing,party for use in emergency, since when largemilitary reinforcements had arrived.   TheAdmiralty had already withdrawn 500 Marinesamd hoped in the near future to withdraw theremaining 500, but, if necessary, they wouldrather retain 500 Marines than keep the FirstCruiser Squadron in the Far East.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should send atelegram to the British minister in Peking to the effect that he presumed that the Naval commander-in-Chief had kept the British-Minister informed as to what was proposed, and that he confirmed the Commander-in-chief&apos;s view.He should add that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment proposed to sanction the withdrawal:(b) That, pending the receipt of a reply from Sir Miles Lampson, no announcement should be made in thePress as to the withdrawal of theFirst Cruiser Squadron.

This dis-persal of staff does not make for efficient administration,and it is suggested that if&quot;the proposal of the CityCorporation is favourablyentertained,  the opportunity should be taken to put the headquarters staff under one(c) That^rf tha/frorkjaf re-hpusir^wa^^arri^a out/by the/CityWorks
