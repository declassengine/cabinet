APPENDIX,I.-COMBINED STAFF APPRECIATION ON TURKISH SITUATION&quot;NOVEMBER 9th.  19 22,-At a meeting in the First Sea Lord&apos;s Room at theAdmiralty, of the Chief of the Naval Staff, Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, and Chief of the Air Staff,this Thursday afternoon, the Combined Staff consideredthe Turkish situation on the basis of the policy laiddown by the late Government, and from which no instruc-tions to depart have been received, namely to hold GALLIPOLI at all costs and tohold CHANAK so long as this could bedone without undue military risk, andthat the maintenance of control of the deep water separating. Asia and europe was a British cardinal interest0It was necessary for the Combined Staff to consider thisquestion under..two headings -A. Assuming a state of war.B. Assuming the position asit actually is today.-In the event of A (a state of war), it was considered essential,.to avoid military disaster, that constantinople and ISMID should be evacuated, the troops from these posi-tions reinforcing GALLIPOLI and chanak.CHANAK should certainly be held&apos;until the last possible moment without causing military, disaster.    This is important in order to enable the DARDANELLES to be used for(i) Supply purposes for the. troops inGAILIPOLI,(ii)  Offensive operations against theTurkish troops attempting to crossfrom ASIA into EUROPE,(ill) Assisting in the protection of theBULA1R lines from the Sea of Mar-oraend.For the purposes of B,- that is assuming the positionremains for the present as it is today, it is important that General Haringiton should be informed that, if he is . *unable to proclaim &quot;a State of Siege in CONSTANTINOPLE &apos;without withdrawing for reinforcing purposes from CHANAK,then no state of siege is to be declared, since withdrawal from CHANAK endangers our lines of communication.It is pointed out by the Combined Staff that their appreciation is based on action by Great Britain alone,and that the recommendations they rake will be materiallymodified if French and Italian co-operation is assured.In this connection the report of General Burnett-Stuart,who is returning from PARIS after interviewing the french military authorities, will be available tomorrow, Friday,when the Combined Staff propose to inwt -and re-consid-r thesituation c-1- Attention, . .
Attention is sailed to Telegram No.. 2666 of general harington to War Office of 8.10.22.   This telegram is a clear and definite statement as to the policy to be pur-sued t and the Combined Staff consider that a telegram should be sent to the General Officer Commanding Constan-tinopHe calling his  attention to his telegram No.2666and rf;-affirming that it is the policy to be adopted infrhrc event of war.If the is approved., then Telegram No, 91440 from theWar Office to General Harington dated 31.10.22, should be cancelled as th-- policy outlined in it is in contravention of the above.(Signed) BFATTY.
