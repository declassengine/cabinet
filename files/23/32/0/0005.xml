Both Ministers being members of theCabinet are fully empowered to act on behalf of theGovernment and have expressed, their readiness to receive a deputation.    If their answer is deemed unsatisfactoryit can be challenged in the constitutional manner and place, namely, by raising the question In Parliament.In these circumstances the Prime Minister is unable to depart from the decision already communicated to you., andhe again suggests that you should place yourselves in communication with the Ministers concerned.I am to add that the Prime Minister is fully conscious of the hardships which the present economic situationinflicts on large numbers of men and women throughoutthe country, and the Government is addressing itself tothe consideration of every possible remedial measure.&quot;Yours truly,(Sd.)

buckingham  palaceMemorandum.ByLord Stamfordham.There have &quot;been recent examples of cabinet ministers referring in public correspondence and speech to proceedings in the Cabinet without having previouslyreceived sanction to do so from the Sovereign.According to the Press report on the....10th. November, Mr. Winston Churchill in publishedcorrespondence quoted what was done in the Cabinet onFriday, 15th. September, regarding the decision arrivedat to inform the Dominions of the situation and that lord Curzon was present and agreed to this decision.Lord Curzon in reply stated that Mr. Churchill omittedthat at the Meeting of the Cabinet held immediately afterthe appearance of his, Mr. Churchillfs manifesto, he
2.vigorously protested both against the manner of itsappearance and its contents.&quot;The Times&quot; of October 30th. quoted a speech of Sir A. Griffith-Boscawen, stating that he tenderedhis resignation as Minister of Agriculture before the break up of the late Government, because certain proposals he had made to assist agriculture, and urged as of pressing importance,were turned down.    He did not,however, persist in resigning because he saw that abig political crisis was at hand.Such disclosures seem to contravene the privy Counsellor^ oath, unless the respective ministers had previously received through the Prime Minister theSovereigns sanction to make them.   But when these statements were made Mr. Lloyd George was no longer
3.Prime Minister and, therefore, oould not have dealtwith the matter:   and indeed the contravention was not of any Cabinet rule but of the Privy Counsellors&apos;soath.For this reason would it not be advisable to ask the President of the Council to point outgenerally that the divulging, without permission ofthe Sovereign, of proceedings in Cabinet is an infringement of the oath taken by them as PrivyCounsellors.16th. November, 1922.
buckingham  palace.Private &amp; Confidential. 11th. November, 1922.Dear Waterhouse,The King notices that in the unfortunatecommunications to the Press made by Lord Curzonand Mr. Winston Churchill references are made by both parties to proceedings in the Cabinet.According to the Press Report on the 10th.instant, Mr. Winston Churchill quotes what was done in the Cabinet on Friday, September 15th.,their decision among other things that the dominions were to be informed of the situation and that lord curzon was present and agreed to all the decision taken.    Lord Curzon on his part states that Mr.Churchill omitted to mention that at the meeting ofthe Cabinet immediately after the appearance of
the manifesto, he vigorously protested both againstthe manner of its appearance and its contents.But surely the time honoured rule hasbeen that Ministers cannot make statements involving a reference to proceedings in the Cabinet withoutthe sanction of the Sovereign ?If you refer to Hansard of the 22nd. March,1922, page 462, you will see a question was raisedby Mr. R. McNeill and answered by Mr. Chamberlain.ToddTs &quot;Parliamentary Government inEngland&quot;, Vol. II, Page 8 and 9 states: -&quot;Upon their first introduction into the privy Council, Ministers are invariably sworn tosecrecy, hence they are not at liberty henceforth todivulge conversations or proceedings in council,or to reveal to others any confidential communications
Lieutenant-Colonel R. Waterhouse,-   - C cB., C .M .G.,10 Downing Street.&quot;they may have had either with the Sovereign or with a colleague in office   without express permissionfrom the Crown&quot;.Yours very truly,
