APPENDIXSAOBSTAT EIR3&amp;HN(Irish   Free   State).BAILS at CLIATB(Dublin),16th, December, 1922.The Right Hon. A. Bonar Law,Prime Minister,10 Downing Street,I o n d o n.Dear Prime Minister,As you are doubtless, aware, the immediate legislation which we hope to get through Parliament ,includes an Amnesty Bill to give legsp effect (sofar as that may now be necessary) to the undertaking -given by the.late General Collins with regard toBritish Military, engaged in Ireland during the period   -r.prior to the Truce,*Ve had hoped that this Bill would be regardedas non-contentious, but we find&apos; that the case of the&apos;Gonnaught Rangers and other prisoners - whose names aregiven on enclosed schedule^- now held by your Government,is occupying the public mind very considerably and: alsothe minds of many members of .our Parliament.vire have reason to believe that the question-of these prisoners will be raised when the -amnesty Billis brought forward, and that it will be urged thatwhile wo propose complete amnesty for British Militaryin Ireland, the British Government, by its continued detention of the prisoners referred to above, havegranted only a partial amnesty to our nationals.The passage of the Bill will be considerablyfacilitated and much undesirable comment avoided if your Government could find it possible to permit theimmediate release of these prisoners.V7e would, therefore,  earnestly request you to give this matter your consideration.Very truly yours,(Signed) Gosgrave.Not reproduced.
18th December 1982.Dear Mr. Cosgr ave ,i have your letter of the 16th and will see thatthe subject about which you write receives,  as quickly aspossible, the attention of the Government.     we have a Cabinetto-morrow, but unfortunate!^&quot; the Secretary for War has beenabroad and is only returning to-right,  and in any case i donot think it would be possible to ask fer a deoision on aquestion so difficult and Important without more time.i am afraid, therefore, that ft will not be possible for- me to give you a definite reply until next week..   This imuch regret.Yours very truly,(Sgd)    A.B0NAR 2UW.
