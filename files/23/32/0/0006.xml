Representative on. the-reparations commission) statements of the present situation in regardto German Reparations,, as set forth, generally irv-Memarajxda.^circulated by the Foreign Office I CP.-4344, CP,-4345and CP.-4348) ,  the Cabinet approved the ,proposals of thePrime Minister as to the attitude to be adopted by theChancellor of the Exchequer and himself at the forthcomingconversations with the Prime Ministers of Prance, belgium and Italy,  as summarised below:-       ,(a) That every effort should be made to induceNL poincare&apos; to state his proposals in regardto reparations..   After hearing these proposals the discussion would probably be adjourned togive time for their consideration.    If their examination was found likely to require somuch, time as to prolong the London eonversa-tiers unduly, the British reply should be postponed to a further meeting tc be held&apos;in Paris later in-the month.(b) In. this latter event an undertaking shouldbe given to Sft. poincare&apos;that, if his proposals were not found to provide an acceptable basis for discussion, the British Government would put forward their own counter-proposals in anattempt to reach a real settlement.    Thesecounter-proposals should be the subject offurther consideration by the Cabinet,  andmust in any event be presented to the FrenchGovernment before any possible breakdown inr        the negotiations.j(c) A proposal for an Allied Conference on Re-  -reparations at Brussels Cfcould not be rejectedabsolutely, but any proposal to place thequestion of Inter-Allied Debts on the agenda of the proposed Conference should be refused,as at this Conference Great Britain would be/ the only large creditor country among a largenumber of debtor States .    It should be pointedout that the question&quot; of Inter-Allied -Debtsis one on which agreement should be obtained,in the first instance, by the States repre-sented at the London conversations.    Everyeffort should be made, if the question is raised, to induce M. Poincare to table his proposals,^which would be submitted to theCabinet befor-  a final decision was taken.&apos; ;3. Members of the Cabinet were, asked to hold themselvesin readiness during Saturday and Sunday, December 9thand 10th,  for a Cabinet Meeting at short notice,, if requiredIn the course.of the Conversations,

A P P E N D I X.SWITZERLAND.Decypher.    Lord Curzon (Lausanne) .December 5th,- 1922.D. 3.4-5 a.m,    December 6th, 1922.R. 8.30 a.m.   December 6th, 1922.No. 80.Secret.Second Turkish delegate Riza Nur Bey called, thismorning to renew private conversation which he had begunyesterday.     After many (? protestations of) friendly inten-tions en both sides his case bailed down to this that turkey would meet us on every point, conclude satisfactory treaty and even break with Soviet, if only we would give themVilayet of Mosul.      Grounds, upon vhich he based this requestwere four in number  :-1. Ethnic, which I sharply contested.2. Historical, i.e., long connection with Turkey.3, Economic i;.c., necessity for future economic life of Turkey in Asia.4. National pact i.e., absolute  and unalterable refusal of Angora to conclude any treaty that does not embrace Mosul,I combatted whole of these points, and declined to-yield upon any mere.Colonial Office argument has led me to think that Mosul&apos;cannot be given away without loss of Baghdad nor Baghdadwithout loss of Irak and collapse of Irak Kingdom, nor-collapse of Arabs without return of Turks and final defeat ofBritish policy in the East.      I also wonder somewhat how farTurks demand for Mobul was really genuine, hou far it might beinspired by hope of thus wresting formal victory for Turkey in asia; or again whether It might not be subtle device of Turks,perhaps instigated by Russia to be able to say to the world later on &quot;we offered to make peace with allies and&apos;notably, with Great- 1 -&apos; Britain/
Britain, we were willing to meet them on every point provided only we recovered Mosul, but for the sake of Mosul and its oil Britain flouted us and refused peace to the World."

 This afternoon idea occurred to me that it might perhaps be possible ostensibly and partially to meet Turkish wishes by offering them Kurdish part of Mosul Vilayet following line of mountains and including Keui Sandjak Rowanduz and Suleimaniek, while retaining for Irak Amadia for the sake of Assyrian Christians Mosul town Erbil Kirpa and whole of plain country inhabited by Arabs, Jaffer Pasha to whom I submitted proposal was quite favourable, while pleading strongly against by surrender of plain country.

 Please ask Colonial Office to send out Young if he is sufficiently recovered, or failing him Bullard who has great local knowledge, and to favour me with their views on above suggestion. It is not intended to exclude Turkish participation in Mosul oil on lines already under examination.   

SUGGESTED   AMENDED   DRAFT.Your telegram No. 68.     The Chiefs of the Naval,Military and Air Staffs are so decidedly opposed toconceding to Turkey the right to fortify the Straitsthat the Committee of Imperial Defence feel unable torecommend endorsement of the proposal of your Naval andMilitary Advisers as it stands.On the other hand, the Admiralty consider that theright of free passage for warships is the most important point to concentrate upon.     If that right is conceded in the Treaty, it can be kept alive from the outset by us and could only be interfered with by a definitely hostileact on the part of Turkey,     If to secure this some concession as regards demilitarisation becomes inevitable,it should be made only as regards the Asiatic side,Gallipoli Peninsula and the European Shore of the Bosphorusremaining demilitarised as part of the general policy ofdemilitarising the Frontiers of Turkey in Europe.
