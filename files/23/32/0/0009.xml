(a) To approve the general principles of the. .&quot;Plan for General Settlement of Rep&amp;ra-tion and European Inter-allied Debts&quot;laid before them by the Prime Minister(Paper C.P.-4376), leaving discretion tothe Prime Minister and. the President ofthe Board of Trade to make such altera-tions in detail as they might deem neoes-sary in the course of the negotiations atthe forthcoming meeting in Paris on thesubject of Reparations by Germany:(b) That, from the point Of view of the presentation of the plan to  the FrenchGovernment, it would be useful to intro-duce into the above plan.   some, words toshow that France would obtain from the proceeds of the loan to be raised duringthe proposed moratorium, some advantage to meet a part of the expenditure incurred on the reconstruction Of the devastated areasprovided that this could be effected without serious detriment to ourselves and withoutantagonising Belgium and Italy.    The qu.es-tion of introducing a. clause to this effect was left to the Prime Minister and thePresident of the Board of Trade in consult-ation with Sir John Bradbury and Mr Nierceyer,of the Treasury;(c) That if in the course of the negotiations the Prime Minister thought it advisable,he should be at liberty,  in order toaccentuate the generosity of tie  scheme from a public point of view, to table theproposals with the omission of the frag$afcfcipnthat France should transfer to Great Britain-the first Series German Bonds to be receivedby France in -respect of the Belgian War Debt:
(d) That the plan should not immediately hepresented to the French Government, hutthat full discretion should be left tothe Prime Minister and President of theBoard of Trade as to the right moment forits presentation:(e) That,, in the event of insistence by theFrench Government on &quot;Gages produotivesthe Prime Minister and President of ;theBoard of Trade should be at liberty toagree to proposals, which were not serious-ly mischievous-,  even though they were not likely to prove productive.    It was con*-sidered preferable in this event that the enforcement of such pledges should beleft to the French:(f) In the event of a fixed determination onthe part of the French Government to takeindependent coercive action against Germany,and a refusal to discuss any reasonableproposals, the Cabinet agreed with thecourse proposed by the Priire Minister-,namely,  that he should state that largequestions were raised, such as the futureparticipation of the British Governmentin the Conference of Ambassadors and inthe Reparation Commission, and theretention of a British garrison on the rhine - cpastions  on which it would benecessary for&apos;him to consult  the Cabinet-.
THE TURKISP S,      The Cabinet took note, with satisfaction,  that peace CCN-FERBKfCE. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had arranged to leave Lausanne in order to meet the Prime Minister atPrevious Paris on Monday next,  January 1, 1923.Reference:Cabinet 71(22),  Con-clusion 1,) ..-3-
THE SITUATION     3. The attention of the Cabinet, was drawn to  the with-AT C0NS1AN-TIN0P1E. drawal from Constantinople to Malta, - for - Chr is tmas , ofthe Naval O.M-mai der-in-Chief in the Mediterranean with a(Previous large part of the Fleet, Notwithstanding the difficultReference:Cabinet 69      situation at Lausanne and the serious results which might(22), Ccn-clusion 5.)    follow at Constantinople on a rupture of the Peace pegotia^tions,        this step had apparently been taken without consultation with the Foreign Office and War Office.In the absence of the First Lord of the Admiralty thequestion was not discussed, but the Prime Minister under-took to communicate with the First Lord of the admiralty on the subject.
IRELAND -The ConnaughtRangers.(previous reference:Cabinet 71(22)  Con-elusion 9.)4.

If Mr Cougravecould not undertake that the passage ofthe Amnesty Bill would be secured withoutthe release of Mr Dowling,  the emissaryshould make it dear that the whole subject would come up again for consideration:That, in the event of Mr Cosgrave being unable to undertake the passage of the amnesty Bill without the delays permitted by the Irish Constitution unless Mr Dowlingwas also released, the whole question shouldbe re-examined by the Cabinet .    Should theCabinet discuss this question while thePrime Minister was still absent in Paris,they were asked to bear in. mind the strongview of the Prime Minister that in the last resort Mr Dowling should also be released,rather than run the risk of losing the amnesty Blperiod ingive riseIreland:.1 or of holding it up for acircumstances calculated toto further disturbances inThat, in the event of the release of theroutineers of the Connaught Rangers, it-should be made clear in any announcement on the subject that the Xing was taking this action on the advice of his ministers and not of the Army Council.
