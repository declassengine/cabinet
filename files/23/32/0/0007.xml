After hearing from the Prime Minister an accountof the Conversations which, he and the Chancellor of the(Previous Exchequer had held on the two previous days with the PrimeReference,-Cabinet 69-,    Ministers and Representatives of Prance, Italy and Belgium(22), Con-elusion 2.)    (as set forth in detail in the British Secretary&apos;s Notes -I.C.P.-254, I.0.P.-255 and I.0.P.-256)  as well as of a subsequent formal talk between the Prime Minister and M,Poincare on the previous evening, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That, in view of the --inability of the french president of the Council to enter&apos;into any arrangement which did not include the ocou-pat ion of Essen and the. Ruhr, and in viewof the importance of not giving to the Turksduring the- Lausanne Conference any impression of a breach in Allied unity, the b-st course for the moment was to adopt the arrangementagreed to between the Prime Minister and&apos;-M-r&quot;Poincaro as set forth in the following draftformula:-&quot;The Allied Prime Ministers have carefully examined the present position of the Repara-tio-ns problem, as well as the cognate questionof the inter-Allied debts.A plan for an interim, arrangement in regard-f, to Reparations, submitted by the German Chan-cellor, v/as also considered and was unanimouslyfound to be unsatisfactory.It is not possible, in the time available,for the Allied Prime Ministers to arrive atdefinite conclusions on the momentous issues involved.In the circumstances, it was decided to adjourn ,the present meeting of the Allied PrimeMinisters, but to arrange for their re-assembly in Paris on the &quot;4th of January.
(b) That, in announcing the above arrangement to Parliament,  the Prime Minister should intimate that the questions of Reparationsand Inter-Allied Debts were being further,considered, and that the British governmenth oped to be in a position to present pro-posals for a complete settlement at the Parismeeting in January.    In view of the inaccuratereports in the newspapers, the Prime minister should also make it clear what the british proposals were.(c) That the proposal contained in the german note of December 9th (l.C .P.-256, Appendix I),was inacceptable in its present form and,  invie&quot;r of the attitude of the Allied Prime-Ministers,  could not be used as a basis forcoxmter-proposals .    The possibility neednot be excluded that before the JanuaryConference the Germans themselves might present revised proposals of a more accept--able c bar a c t - - r.

APPENDIX.SAORSTAT EI.REA3TM(IRI^R EREB STATE) crPRESIDENT 1S OFFICE,Baile Atria Cliath,(DUBLIN).9th December, 19220Dear Prime Mini s t er,I desire to invite your attention to a graveaspect of the bringing of Ireland into the Billfor removing the embargo on the importation of canadian Store Cattle *3 and to put it to you thatthe imposition of statutory restrictions on theimportation cf Irish cattle to Great Britain shouldbe deferred at least until the Irish Ministryof Agriculture has had an opportunity of discussing the case with the British Ministry, as has beenafforded to the Canadian Ministry in respect of cattle from that DominioneThat aspect Isj that in the first week offthe existence of the Free State Great Britain,will appear as directing against Ireland&apos;principal industry a new and permanent disability,not only without previous intimation, but contraryto what we were led to expectsI would draw your attention to the fact thatwhen the Conference between your Ministry ofAgriculture and the Canadian Representativescommenced,  the Irish Agricultural Departmentimmediately raised the question of Ireland&apos;sbeing consulted with regard to the proposed new regulations,.      Your Ministry of Agriculturereplied, in a letter dated 2nd November, that thenegotiations which had been taking place with theCanadian Government related to the conditions under which Canadian cattle might be admitted intoGreat  Britain and&quot; that , therefore. It was notpossible to make the Irish Government a partyto these negotiations.      It now appears from afurther letter from your Ministry, dated Oth   .instant, that Irish cattle are being includedin the ..EiIl as a result of a stipulation madeby the Canadian Government that restrictionssimilar to those imposed on Canadian cattle shouldbe placed on all other imported cattle0      these facts make it very difficult for me to combatthe view which prevails here that Ireland is notbeing treated fairly in this matterc./Finally
Finally,, the step is entirely unnecessary&apos;as a measure- for protecting live stock in GreatBritain from any danger of disease being spreadthrough the agency of Irish cattlei:your Agricui--tural Ministry having already as regards, Irishcattle, the powers for this purpose which it isnow sought to stereotype from departmental ordersInto statutory form by means of the Bills,I refrain from going into details.     Myobject is to- bring to your attention the larger and graver aspects which I have indicated above,.I would ask you to give it your, most earnestattention.Yours very truly,,.(Signed)   W..T.
