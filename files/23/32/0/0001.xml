ANNEX IV.

FOREIGN AFFAIRS.

Summary of Statement made to the Cabinet by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, November 1, 1922.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS stated that all he could do in the time at his disposal was to summarise the more important aspects of the situation.

 So fair as Papers were concerned, he had already circulated to the Cabinet an account of his meetings in Paris which resulted in the Mudania Conference. He had also given instructions that an account was to be circulated of his more important meeting at the end of September, at which the decision had been reached that a Conference should take place and as to the Powers to take part therein. If his colleagues would read these, it would give them a better idea of the temperament and psychology of the principal ? concerned than anything he could sat on the present occasion.

 The Cabinet would remember that on those two occasions he himself had gone to Paris at a critical point in order to try and reach a peaceful settlement of a situation which was on the verge of war. The solutions reached had given general satisfaction. It was true that concessions had been made to the Turks, but this had been inevitable in the circumstances, and they had been essential in order to preserve the solidarity of the Allies.




Buring the past the whole basis of Ma resignpolicy* in whteh ha had had the backing of Wm late Cabinetfehad been that tsnly fey standing with Staonfte and Italy w&amp;S it possible to reach a settlement of tbe Eastern situation.He did not ssean by this that other Powers had &apos;m% h&amp;mconsulted in regard to then? interests, but that the mainessential for semiring peace was for the three Bowers to stand together.   At no stage had he departed from -this principle.   Moreover, his policy throughout had been opanand above-board *   He regretted it was not possible to say the same for the Allies *   The difficulties had arisen notfmm any lack of frankness/en our part, but from the eon**sistent refusal of the Allies to co-operate whele-hsartedly.In this connection he referred to the lack of candour dii**played by the French Government i*t&apos;regard to the activitiesof Mm franhlin-Beulllon.   Italy, he regretted to say, had.proved equally unreliable?   in fact, he felt rather relievedthat &apos;-he won id not again have to deal with the italian governments which had lately been in office and that hewas faced with a new combination which he was disposed tothink, contrary to. the views held in seise parts of the press,might result in honest government in Italy *The two Conferences to which he had already alluded had resulted, first, in the preliminary arrangements for a peace Conference, and, secondly, in the Nfedania Agreement.The object of the Beaca Conference was to revise theTreaty of Sevres.   St had been arranged to meet at kaueanneon November 13th, but he felt &quot;na. doubt that this date wouldhave to be postponed.   The Klection^in tbis country wouldnot be complete, and it was doubtful if the Italian Govern-ment vronld be prepared to send plenipotentiaries so soon.Moreover, it was almost certain that the Turks would raisepreliminary difficulties that could net be settled before-8-
Havener 15th .   Finally, a reply had net yet been receivesto the imitation sent to the Soviet $ovarmant to attendthat part- of the Canfaysnea relating to the  readers of theStraits. Bf^hably, therefore, the Conference would not beheld until early in December.   t*ausenne had the advantage   -of being in a country which was neutral in the War.   It wascentral, a*s* bainn on the line of the Orient Fxpres8^jp!tpossessed good aeconsiaodation, and the Peace between turkey and Italy sowe years ago had been arranged there.   that point, therefore, might be taken as settled.It was proposed to divide the Conference into two stages.At the first stage of the Conference a Treaty of Peace wouldha drawn up,   The mreaty of Sevres had been drawn up atLondon and San Remo by the Great Powers, including Japan *The. Treaty had than bean handed to the ^irks, who had been invited to adopt it,   Finally., it had been signed not only  *by the Powers that had negotiated it, hut by a number of allies, many ef whoss had only been nominally belligerentswith Turkey, including s-aeh States as Poland and Portugal,Out of these Allies it had now been decided that Rouaaniaand Ju 0-3iss,viu Should be invited to join the first stage of the Conference for drawing up the Treaty of Peace,Bulgaria had also been asked to send representatives toLausanne, not as members of the Conference, but to state the case of Bulgaria in regard to access to the Aegeanthrough Dadaa^ateh.During that first stage of the Conference the Treaty of sevres would be gone through point by point, revising it as necessary,   It would be a prolonged, difficult and very anxious business.At the next stage world come the question of the Straits,The reason for taking this at a separate stage was that itconcerned also other Powers which had not been belligerents.
For Ms reason it had fceen decided to invite to ttiie partof the Conference representatives of Soviet Btiesia, with her affiliated States, the tfferaine and Georgia, the fesawof which contained the important port of Odessa and thelatter Batum.   These states had bean invited enly to thesecond part of the Conference, and not to the first part to draw up the Treaty of Peace,   He anticipated that aConvention would probably he drawn tip for dealing withthe Straits as supplementary to the main Treaty.of Peace*He could not exaggerate his estimate of the difficultieswhich he would have to face at J&amp;ttsanne *   He would be facedwith a victorious Turkey, utterly unscrupulous, which would raise questions of the most troublesome description *   Pofexample, under the -Treaty of Sevres Was tern Thrace had. beanattributed to Greece, and it was inconceivable that itshould be returned *   He could not doubt, however, that theTurks would demand Western ^hraee^ and posfihly they mightbe backed up in this by the French and the Italians,   he gathered trom the frets that the Turks were likely to insist on the return of $oaul, which was part of the Mesopotamia^Mandate and was confirmed, to Iraq by a treaty with king feisal.   Again, on the question of Capidilations he raustexpect a hitter struggle.   The Turbs were standing out forequality, whereas no European could live and do busi^SS inCcnstanttnople without the Capitulations, or at least sosa&amp;of the French Government to support the abolition of theS apt tula tions would be Modified, owing to the insistenceof the Freneb -Inhabitants of Constantinople.   Nevertheless,there would be strong opposition fross the Turks,   Anotherdifficult:? was that the Constantinople Government stillexisted, though It was worthless and invertebrate,   This wastribunal.   He thought that the first inclination
the de jure Government, but the position had gradually grown up that the Angers Government had become the de  facto Government. It only awaited its entry into Constantinople to obtain the keys of power. Consequently, difficulties must be anticipated here. What would be the attitude of the different Powers? France hitherto had been in the pocket of the Turks, but the French Ambassador had seen him on the previous day and bad told him that the Kemalists were becoming more and more ?. It was in fact intolerable that the Angora Government should dictate the terms of peace. The  French support of the Turks had been based on the fact that France was jealous of our position and prestige in the Moslem world. Her attitude marked the design of France to become the protector of the Moslems in the East. There were, no doubt, other considerations. He thought, however, that France was gradually veering in our direction. As regards the attitude of Italy, in. view of the change of Government he could make no forecast. Japan was usually quietly and unostentatiously with Great Britain. Roumania was actuated largely by the fear of losing Bessarabia. Jugo-Slavia was influenced by the fact that she depended on France for her armaments, but otherwise was in sympathy with us.  From the Soviet Government he anticipated nothing but hostility. The late Prime Minister had worked indefatigably and sincerely to reach an agreement with Soviet Russia: first by means of a Trade Agreement, then through, the Genoa Conference, and lastly through the Hague conference. Nevertheless, he believed the Soviet Government still to be in a position of special and inveterate hostility towards the British Empire. Their representatives  would oppose us strongly at Lausanne. The goal of Russia had always been Constantinople. This ambition had not been changed by the alteration in the system of government.
and the Bolsheviks were Communists with wide Imperial aspirations. Any other solution of the problem of the Straits than a Russian solution would be inconsistent with Soviet dreams. Consequently, at Lausanne the Soviet representatives would oppose us. What they desired was a Black Sea which was closed when Russia was weak, so that no other Fleet could penetrate to the Black Sea, and open when she was strong and could send her own Fleet out. Thus this part of the problem bristled with difficulties

 What Great desired was an honourable peace with Turkey and an end of the long quarrel which had existed.

In spite of the immense difficulties, he did not think that in the last resort this result was impossible. He wanted to convince the Turks that we were willing to be their friends. The Turks bad lost the War, ? of their Empire had been shorn off, but they were back in Asia and Europe, and we would like to be friends with them again. He would like to bring about a break between Turkey and her Soviet Allies.

He thought that no Power would be asked to would sign the Treaty in regard to the Straits unless it had been recognised de jure, and that Soviet Russia would probably be ? to sign when she was so recognised. But this was a matter which would require consideration with the Allies.

 As regards the representation of the Dominions and India at the Conference, he thought the Government should be largely be guided by the course adopted in negotiating the Treaty of Sevres. Although the Dominions and India had not taken part in the Conference, the Treaty had been signed by their representatives.  When he desired was that the Dominions and India would allow hits to represent them, and he could assure them that he would keep their interests constantly to the fore. Their presence in the Council Chamber was
9 1I-J JS.extremely difficult to arrange, and when he had proposedIt to M, Feinsaa?^ the latter had insisted that in that event Tunis, Algeria and Morocco would also have to herepresented *   He was in communication with the ColonialOffice on this suh$eet.*   The question of attaching asIndian, representative to the British Delegation., if pressed by the Secretary of State for 3Mi&amp;* would require carefuliconsideration, as the Dominions would ask for correspond!^tfe&amp;tment .Turning now to the general ISnropeen situation, andreferring first to Prance9 Lord Curson said that Just ashe desired to obtain an agreement with Turkey, so he wanted to clear up the whole - situation with Trance, It was diffi-cult to say who was. to blame for the present situation.It was ,4sllaem^ undoubtedly^by the attitude and personal-^ity of the Prench President of the Ceunell,The late Prime Minister of $real Britain had dominatedthe scene at the various Conferences/net only owing to his great expertenee, but also wing to his eleverneee,  HisAvery success in negotiation had rankled more and more withthe French.   At every Conference his personality had proved a great strength, but in the internet!onaj. sphere hissuccess had thus resulted in a weakness *Among other quest!one of foreign policy were those relating to Germany,, and more particularly Reparations,as well as the question of Inter-Allied Debts.   Thesematters were too big to enter into at the moment.   He felt^however, that we arast come to some arrangement with Prancein regard to all these questions,   The French Governmenthad also made great difficulties In regard to Tangier, aswell as Tunis and some minor matters.   These difficulties were net due merely to the explosive temper of M. Point?ar^
but to the inherent perfidy and insincerity of French policy,Thus the French had protested against our entering into any arrangement with Soviet Russia, yet any day&apos; he ewpwctad to^*^hear that they had concluded such, an arrangement themselves.They had protested against the      jure recognition of Moscow,and yet they might J^S^As^ it themselves.   M. Boincare&quot; wasa elever, hard, rigid, metallic lawyer.   am far his po-ssl-tiOn was firm he did not know,   what he would like to do,however, was to clear the board of our foreign difficulties with Prance in regard to Europe *   He would, however, begin in the East, an;!, if agreement could be reached there he might indicate that this was a prelude to clearing the whole; board,and progress might be- made.There would arise also the situation in regard to Germany,$his. country was prostrate, and its position was indescrib-Aable.   This was- largely Germany&apos;s own fault, and resulted/partly from the fall of the Mark, for which the Ommm Oov-emssent was largely responsible.   In Prance this countrywa&amp; regarded as too friendly towards Germany.   The germans had taken advantage of this and had behaved badly, particn-larly in regard, to disarmament-a   Whether some new orientationof policy towards Germany was necessary he did, not yet hnew.&apos;&apos;As regards the United States of America, lord Balfour had done a wonderful work at Washington.   This, however, hadbeen &amp;agjgapi*&amp;ted. to some extent by the so-called **Balfou&apos;rSfote&quot; *   fie himself^had not been in the Foreign Office atthe time, but he felt it was sS^remely unwise.   nothing could exceed the finish and style of the Hote, btxt its effect$had been deplorable.The late Chancellor of the Exchequer had intended to goto America to clear up the question of the funding of. the debt, and he understood that the present Chancellor of the-8-
Exchequer, or 9ome other powers 1 representative, waashortly to go to America,   Meanwhile, the American ambassador in London said that the qttestion could easily be settled.according to Mr Harvey, to reaVo.ee the obligation to aminimum, and thia would be accepted by Congress,   He did not know precisely what this meant.   If the Chancellor of thef%se&apos;hequar would care to see the American Ambassador^, either with him or without him, he would be very glad&apos; to arrangeit.Reverting to the Hear East Conference, Lord Our son saidthat the late Cabinet had decided that he himself was torepresent the British Government there.   Pach- country wasto have two plenipotentiariest who, of course, would bavepower to take decisions and sign Conventions reached *   his idea was to take as his colleague Sir Horace Pumbold, theHigh Commissioner in Constantinople, \He understood that Prance intended, to appoint two ^inis^tors.   At one time he had apprehended that M, Franklin-Bouillon would be appointed, and, in view of his mischievousactivities at the Mudania Conference, he had sent word bythe British Ambassador in Paris asking M,. Poincare not toappoint him.   The French President of the Council had agreedthat he would not do so.   To his great surprise, four days later he had seen in the Press a letter from SS,/Pranklin**Bouillon declining an invitation$atlenAto represent France, on theground that this would not be appreciated in Croat Britain!He himself proposed to go to Lausanne to start the Con-conferenee.   He doubted, however, if the Cabinet would Wish himto remain there the whole time, and his idea was to leavethe second plenipotentiary in charge, and perhaps thePermanent Under-Seen etary would be sent there during theAs we had agreed to pay the debt, America would-be prepared,
Committee staple f the Conference.   He himself would haveto be present at every important&apos; stage.Xn regard to the rsmcrar that the Sultan of Turkey wasto be aebed to abdicate Ms temporal power, retaining theposition of Caliph, he felt some doubt.   If the rumourSwiCfi-^proved true it would be highly satisfactory,      it would deprive the ssal contents In India of their whole case against us in regard to Turkey.As regards the Freedom of the Straits, he intended to circulate a Paper to the Cabinet.* * * .Whitehall Gardens, 3.W.I.November 1, 19S3,-*1CK
