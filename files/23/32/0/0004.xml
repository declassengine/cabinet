^f;(1) CANADA.APPSNDIX   II.The Domini ons and The LausanneG conference,,.Replies to Telegrams from DominionPri&quot;me Mini ster sT(Approved hy the Cabinet on 16th November, 1922, Cabinet 67 (22)Secrete     Following from Prime Minister for yourPrime Minister begins,     I brought your message of October 31st as to Lausanne Conferencebefore Cabinet today.-.     We fully understandthat it is desire.of Canadian Government thatany treaty with Turkey which may result fromConference should be submitted to canadian parliament for approval before His kaiestyis advised to ratify it-.It is our most earnest desire that you should be kept fully Informed of the developmentof the Conference, and we shall endeavour to send you full details.
(2) UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.Secret.. -Following from Prime Minister for your PrimeMinister begins:- I brought your message of October 51st asto Lausanne Conference before Cabinet today.Our- Impression Is that Poincare^s reference to Tunis andMorocco- was due to- his desire a few weeks ag6 to be able to citeviews of Mohammedan communities under French protection insupport of a pro Turkish policy.     Subsequent events haveevidently modified this desire to some extent, and our presentview is that it would be best net to raise at present general question referred to at end of your message.As- t-0 first part of your message, any Treaty resulting from.Lausanne Conference will of course re-plage Treaty of Sevres and,untii it comes into- force,, a state of&quot; war between the British&apos;Empire and Turkey will technically continue.-     The Treaty must therefore be binding, on the whole Empire when ratified,-     it remains to be seen whether there will be Successful issue toLausanne Conference but if there is we should much prefer that any new Treaty should follow Earls precedent- and Include signatures onbehalf of  all the Dominions.-     If other&apos; Dominions sign, arguments against non-s1gnature on behalf of Union of South Africa given in MiLloyd Georg.ers message of December- 1st, 1921 In relation teWashington Conference  apply with at least equal force..It- Is our- most earnest desire that you should be kept fully informed of the development of the Conference and we shall &quot;-endeavour to send you full details *     Ends rx   NOTE&apos;.    The relevant passage- in. Mr.- Lloyd George %&apos;s message of December 21s&apos;t-, 1921 Is as follows- f-The lack of a Union plenipotentiary raises a serious difficulty for the British Empire Delegation.- 2 &apos;-- The/
The Union as a part of the British Empire would presumably be bound by the signature of the British Empire Delegation as a whole in the absence of a representative to sign or withhold his signature on behalf of the Union unless some special provision were inserted to the affect that the Union was not bound but would adhere later by notification of its own Government if it thought fit. Mr. Balfour telegraphs with regard to this as follows:- "Any such provision especially in any agreement for limitation of armaments would seem very undesirable. Only convenient course is to issue full powers on behalf of South Africa to one of the other delegates. General Smuts does not seem to approve of this, but any other method of dealing with the subject will land us in such difficulties that I hope he may be inclined to withdraw his objection. If this is for any reason impossible please let me know what alternative procedure you desire adopted. Above represents view of British Empire Delegations."

 This request from all the representatives of the Empire on the spot you will feel, I am sure, carries great weight. If we begin to suggest special provisions in the agreement for ourselves other Powers may do the same, thus possibly endangering the whole agreement. Therefore, I hope that you will find it possible that one of the existing delegates at Washington should be appointed as plenipotentiary for the Union.

  
The(3) AUSTRALIA. Secret.Following from Prime Ministerfor your prime Minister begins:I brought your message of November 2ndbefore Cabinet today.     we recognise theforce of your criticism and also feel to thefullest extent the great danger to what we regard as the greatest of all considerations.,namely the unity of the British Empire, which,would be involved in the adoption of a foreignpolicy which would as you point out affect thewhole Empire but which, either through theabsence of representatives of the dominions or from any other cause, would not command the full support and approval of the Empireas a w^ole.In this case the crisis arosesuddenly, and an immediate conferenceseemed the only hope of avoiding conflict.If it were possible we would most warmlywelcome your assistance and thet of therepresentatives of the other Dominionsat Lausanne&apos;       As this is impossible wecan think of no better method of dealingwith the situation than that of keepingyou fully irformed of the difficulties as they arise at the Conference
I 0The -Foreign Secretary is to have a preliminarymeet i hg wi th M. Po ino ar e&apos; o n S atur day and we propose to send you a full account after that meeting of the situation and prospects.   other information will bo regularly forwarded to you asthe Conference continues.    This will keep you as fully informed&apos;as possible of the whole situation.I most earnestly hope that this course of action will noet with your approval.     Ends.
