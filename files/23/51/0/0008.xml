1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of thequestion of Mosul and Iraq.    In addition to the papers which had been before them at their previous meeting.&apos; the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had circulated the conclusions of the advisoryOpinion of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague on the questions  submitted tothern by the Resolution of the Council of the Leagueof Nations, dated September 19, 1925 (Paper C.P.-494 (g5)), and a despatch from the British ambassador at Constantinople to the Seoretary of State (No.840,dated November 11, 1925J  (Paper C.F.-495 (.25)).The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read a summery, prepared by Sir Cecil Eurst, of theOpinion of the Permanent Court of InternationalJustice at The Hague, leading to the conclusionsquoted in.CP,-494 (.25).   He and the Prime Ministertold the Cabinet of conversations they had had with sir Eric Drummond, the Secretary-General of theLeague of Nations.The trend of the Cabinefs discussion was toreveal a general agreement that nothing should besaid at the present time to encourage the Councilof the League of Nations to make a decision involving the partition of Iraq, but that, in accordance withthe terms of the announcement made in Parliament onMay 3, 1923, by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(Mr Baldwin) on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr 3ona;Law), the liability (both military and financial)pf the British Government after the termination ofthe present Treaty in 1928 should be. as light aspoas.it le.
The Cabinet agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composedaa follows --The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs    (in the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for theColonies,The Secretary of State for India,The Secretary of State for Air,The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLane aster  should meet to frame the declarationsto be made to the Council of th/eLeague of Nations and to the Houseof Commons, respectively, in regardto oxrr policy in Iraq.(A Meeting, has been arranged for Friday,November 27th^ at  5 p.m., in the Room,of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, Foreign Office.-a-
2. The Minister of Health, raised, as a matterof urgency, a question whioh had arisen during theParliamentary discussions on the Rating and ValuationPill.   After a preliminary consultation with theMinister of Health, who had made it clear/that no special contribution could be made by the Exchequereither now or in the futuire, the agricultural committee of the House of Commons had passed aresolution by 27 votes to 3 asking for facilitiesfor an amendment to the effect that relief should begiven to Agriculture by redxicing the rating on farm buildings.    The Minister of Health proposed that thematter should be linked up with the rating ofmachinery, and that, as already arranged in thelatter case, the question of a 75 per cent, rebate onthe rating of agricultural buildings should be leftto a free vote of the House of Commons.   before this vote took place he proposed to point out thatthe result would be to throw an extra rate,  averaging2d. In the  , and reaching 6d. in the   in some areas, on to other forms of property, and to make it quite clear that no Exchequer contribution would be forthcoming either now or in the future.The Minister of Health was asked to bear inmind, in miaking his statement, that . In the South ofEngland, at any rate, farm buildings were not provided by the tenant.Subject to the above, the Cabinet agreed  ^hat the question should be treated, asproposed by the Minister of Health, asanalogous to the rating of machinery,and should be left to a free vote ofthe House of Commons.
3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by theChancellor of the Exchequer covering the Conclu-sions of the Standing Committee on Expenditurerespecting the Provisional Estimates of the Boardof Education for 1926-27, together with an agreed statement (Paper N.E.-15) showing the manner inwhich effect will be given to the proposed roduc-tiona, and also the draft circular which it isproposed to Issue forthwith to Local EducationAuthorities (Paper CP.-487 (25)).The President of the Board of Educationmade the reservation that the reduction he had agreed to was about  50,000 less than that shownin the Minutes of&quot; the Standing Committee on Expendi-ture and reprodxiced below.    This discrepancy didnot affect the terms of the circular, and he was willing to leave the matter for further discussionwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on the under-standing that it was essential to provide a poolsufficient to allow of the special treatment of areas which had recently accepted the BurnhamAward on teachers&apos;  salaries.The Cabinet agreed, -subject to the above  (a) In accordance with the recommenda-tions of the Standing Committee on expenditure,  to approve the proposals contained in N.E.-15 for the reduc-tion of the Provisional Estimates ofthe Board of Education for 1926-27by, a sum, of  934,000, making these estimates  40,882,845:(b) To authorise the -$resident of the.Eoard of Education to issue the draftcircular to Local Authorities, the revised form of which is attachedto these Conclusions (Appendix),( See also Conclusion 4( c) .)

Government unemploy-ment relief schemes should be closed down but that there shouldhe no repudiation of commitmentsalready undertaken,(li)  That in pursuance of this policy the Unemployment Grants Committeeshould be instructed forthwith to withhold approval of any new schemes(either on the loan or the wagesbasis)  submitted to them-; by LocalAuthorities or Public utility undertakings .Provided that nothing in this general instruction should preventLord St. Davids1  Committee(1)  from approving any schemes already under considerationby that Committee and inwhich the progress has beensuch as to give their promotersreasonable expectation thatthe schemes would ultimately be sanctioned&quot;,&apos;   and(.2) from, the exercise of thediscreti.cn respecting futureexceptional.cases mentionedin (IV) below.(iii) To- take note that the decision in(il) above.will give a saving onthe Unemployment Gran ta Votes of 300,000 in&quot;1925-27. with substan-tially;larger savings in subsequent years
(iv)  To defer for the present thequ estion o f what arrangement swill he necessary to deal with,exceptional applications forGovernment assistance for reliefschemes in specially necessitousareas.    Pending a final decisionon this question Lord. St. David&apos; sCommittee to have discretion torefer exceptional cases fromspecially distressed localities -to the Treasury and Ministry ofLabour for favourable considers-tion That the Minister of Labour shouldbe authorised to announce the changeof policy in Parliament, stating, ofcourse,  that special consideration should be given to necessitous areas.The Minister of Labour was also askedto make it clear that the economies in regard to -Unemployment expenditurenow announced would be compensated,so far as Unemployment is concerned,by the measures for opening upin other directions, including,for example, the lifting of the embargo on foreign loans.That Ministers placed in the positionof the Ministers of Fdiieation andlabour, who might have to announce inParliament in advance of the general programme of economy particular econom-ies affecting their respective Depart-tnents, should have authority to 3tatethat these economies were part of ageneral review of all expenditure,that they were only announced now inadvance of the general statement forthe reason that this was essential ifthey were to take effect in the coming financial year&apos;,    and that later onthey would be included in the announce-roent of the Government&apos; s general schemeof economy.

11, The Cabinet bad before, them correspondence between the Secretary of the Cabinet, and theSecretary of the Irish Boundary Commission (Papers-CP.-486- (-25)  and CP,-489 (25) on the subject ofa -meeting on Tuesday, November 24th, between theIrish Boundary Commission and representatives ofthe Governments concerned, which the Irish FreeState Government had felt unable to attend owing tothe resignation of Dr, MacNeill from the IrishBoundary Comm.is.slon,The. Secretary of State for the Colonies read to. the Cabinet two letters addressed by the IrishBoundary Commission to the Irish Free State Governmentcopies of which had been received during the Meeting(Paper CP.-497 (25)),  .The Cabinet ware Informed that the IrishBoundary Commission had invited representatives bothof the British and Irish Free State Governments toattend a joint meeting on Thursday, November 26th,  atwhich the map and the nature of the Award would hecommunicated by the Commissioners simultaneously tothe British and the Irish Free State Governments.The Cabinet agreed -     -That the Seoretary of State for theColonies and the Home Secretary (ifsufficiently recovered from his kinds-position) shoiild meet the Commissiononly if they had learned that repre-Rdntatives of the Irish Free StateGovernment would be present :- but thatif they learned that the Irish FreeState Government, would not send repre-sentafives, they: should send a writteneommunic-ation to the Commission Inform-ing them that in the absence of theother party they thought.- it inexpedient to. attend, and inviting the Commissionto.send a written communication, to both governments.&quot;The drafting of this communicationwas left to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies -in consultation with theLor d Ch a no ell or,
Circular to Local Education Authorities. Circular 1371.25tli November, 1925.All communications should be addressedto The Secretary!BOARD OF EDUCATION,Whitehall,London, S.W.I.The Board have been considering then- probable estimates for the yeai- 1926-27, and they wish to ask. tlie co-operation ofLocal Authorities in meeting the situation which has arisen.It will be the Boards duty to repeat for next year the attempt made this year to estimate closely the money necessary. for educational services, and on this basis the Board have cometo the conclusion that, if they were to provide for expenditure by Local Education Authorities on new services without asking-Authorities to make any counterbalancing economies, their estimates, even after effecting certain economies in their ownadministration, would reach the figure of  41,781,414, or 1,136,760 in excess of their estimate for ordinary services forthe current year and .- 1,063,800 in excess of : their actual expenditure on such services in the last completed year 1924-25.The President of the Board has decided that in the present state of the national finances, he would not be justified in makingso large a demand upon the taxpayer. He is, moreover, con-vinced that if the Nation is to be able to finance new projects-designed to provide additional facilities for Higher education and to improve the instruction of the older children inElementary Schools, it is essential that a clear understandingshould be reached as to the amount of expenditure which public funds will be called upon to bear for the administration andmaintenance of existing services.The Board have attempted to review the factors governing therecent growth in local expenditure on education and thepossibility of economies. It is observed that the expenditure of authorities in 1924-25 shows a total increase, as compared with1923-24, of about  1,400,000, and that only a relatively small part of this appears to be attributable to the provision of newfacilities. The increase of expenditure on Administration, bothElementary and Higher, and on &quot; other &quot; expenses ofElementary Education, is alone responsible for no less than 730,000 of this increase. It would appear that this expenditureon existing services offers a field for economies, and this fieldis extended by the reduction in the cost of salaries resulting fromthe Burnham Award. To these factors must bo added theprospect of economies resulting from reorganisation of schools,the gradual fall in loan charges, and the further administrative economies which may be expected to result from a simplificationof the relations between the Board and Local Authorities.
Having regard to these facts and to the decision reached byH.M. Government that, in the existing state of the national finances, it is- necessary to place a limit upon the demands to bemade upon the Exchequer in the year 1926-27, the Board havedecided that they can reasonably, and without detriment to thedevelopment of essential educational services, limit their grant to Local Education Authorities as indicated below and askLocal Authorities, in this national emergency, to makecorresponding economies. This limitation will still leave theBoard&apos;s Estimates at a substantially higher figure than in thepresent year.While the grants which can be provided on this basis appear tothe Board to be reasonable and to leave scope for the developmentof essential services, the Board cannot contemplate a returnto the system of restrictions and controls associated withCircular 1190. They are themselves undertaking administrative economies involving the immediate reduction of the estimates for the Board&apos;s own administration to the 1923-24 level, and they believe that an3&apos; attempt to impose detailed restrictions on expen-diture would not only be incompatible with the spirit of the times,but would also entail a further complication of administration,instead of the simplification they desire to see. They therefore propose to adopt a policy of block grants and to ask Parliamentto pass the necessary legislation for this purpose.In accordance with these considerations a block grant will befixed for each Authority on the basis set out in the appendix to this Circular. The grant so fixed.will be guaranteed to each authority as a minimum for not less than three years from 1stApril, 1926, and will be paid in full, subject only to such con-ditions of grant as are indicated in the penultimate paragraph ofthis Circular. The benefit of any economies made by the Autho-rity will thus accrue to it in full. The grants will, of course, be adjusted in the year 1928-29 and subsequent years to carry outthe provisions of Section 9 of the Teachers&apos; SuperannuationAct, 1925.While the occasion for the introduction of this system is thepresent financial situation, the Board are convinced thata change in the grant system is essential if Local Authoritiesare to be enabled to exercise their own judgment in the developt-ment of education, if that development- is to be steady and con-tinuous, and if administration is to be put on an efficient andeconomic basis. They had hoped to introduce a change of systemgradually through the programme procedure, and they believe thatthis procedure may still be used to assist the change, but circum-stances have compelled them to accelerate their decision, and the alteration in the grant system must of course affect the basis uponwhich Authorities have been considering their programmes.It is obvious that this change necessitates a correspondingchange in the system of Regulations, etc., under which theBoard&apos;s relations with Authorities have hitherto been carried on,
Hud tho Board have in fact been engaged for some months past ina reconsideration of the Code, Building and other Regulations.They would desire that in future their Regulations should be confined to those minimum requirements which may properly be prescribed as actual conditions of grant : that outside these actualconditions of grant the Board&apos;s action should generally take theform of advice given for the consideration of Authorities : and thatsuch advice should be directed&quot;rather to the maintenance and improvement of the general standard of education, than to an investigation into the details of educational administration.The board-drecogmse that changes of this far-reaching character-must form the subject of consultation and discussion withAuthorities, and they will welcome the advice of Authorities onthe contents of this Circular, and in particular on any point whereah alteration in the existing requirements of the Board would,in their opinion, assist administrative economies.A l&apos;1&apos;KXDIX.Basis of Chants.(1) A sum equal to the grunt payable for 192&apos;J-2.&quot;i on elementary education, less one per cent. This sum will l)e sufficient to provide ingeneral for the payment of grant at the usual percentage on the salariespayable under the Burnham Award for the number of teachers employedon the 31st March, 3925, and the Hoard will make special provision iomeet the case of areas where the adoption of the Burnham Scales sincothat date entails an increase in tho cost.of salaries.(2) A sum equal to the grant payable for 1924-25 on Higher Etlv**&apos;.l&apos;&apos;0,1Jafter deduction of any sum paid in that year in respect) of expenditureon non-Local Education Authority Schools, sinco disal&apos;..w*.J ior grant onthe score of duplication, and in respect of the super-grant on free places,since discontinued. This assumes an expenditure by Authorities of about 000,1100 in excess of expenditure in 1023-24.These sums will lie reduced by(it) &quot;AOs. for each child on the register on 31st March, lf)2o, underthe age of five years;(6) a sum apportioned to each Authority, for higher education inrespect of the super-grant to Local Education Authority training colleges;
(c) a sum: similarly apportioned in respect of half the cost of aidnow being given by the Hoard to clay students at Training colleges and University Training Departments. and to&apos; students in training for the teaching profession&apos; at Universities.note-f-The deduction under (u) is proposed on the ground that nationalfunds are at present bearing an undue proportion of the expenditure in-volved iit&apos; the ftill-fcimo attendance- at school of very young children. TheHoard are not,, indeed, to bo understood as pronouncing a general opinion in regard-to the admission of children, under the age of compulsory school attendance, a question which must depend largely on local social con-difions. It isa matter for consideration, however, whether the practiceof part-time attendance of children up to&apos; tho age of about six. might notbe extended, in which case considerable savings might ho effected..The deduction-, under (b) carries out&apos; the recommendation madeby the Departmental Committee ou the Training.of Teachers. - The blockgrants to local education authorities maintaining training colleges..willbo reduced by the amount of the existing grant in respect of thosecolleges and a soparate grant will ho made&apos; to them as recommendedby the Departmental Committee. - -  .The deduction under (c) is proposed on tho ground that direct grants in aid of individual students (apart from &apos;St&apos;ate scholarships) should properly be a matter for local administration. The Board will be glad to discuss with Authorities tho manner in which such grants should be administered in future.The sums dealt with under (b) and (c) will amount to about  193,000.It is proposed to apportion this sum among Authorities for higher education ou a basis which will take account of the elementary school population and the rateable value of the whole area on which the rate for higher education is levied.
