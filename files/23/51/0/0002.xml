1. The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Air, containing&apos; someparticulars of the present position in regard tothe development of a scheme for Air Force expansionfor home defence, in which it was proposed that aCabinet Committee should be appointed to survey thepre s ent p os ition (Papei C. P.-421 (25)).The suggestion was made that , as the Committee -on Economy was about to review the situation as awhole, the decision as to what Committee should Inthe first instance oonsider the Memorandum of theSecretary of State for Air should be reserved for themoment.    In support of this view it was pointed outthat the question of some arrangement with Prance forthe mutual &quot;slowing dovm of air programmes could not be explored in the absence of the Foreign Secretary.The suggestion was also made that, if an inquirywas to take place , it could not be confined to theAir Force expansion scheme but must be wider in scope.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the consideration of the Air Forceexpansion scheme and cognate questions should be reserved for a short time,pending the preliminary discussions ofthe Cabinet Comixdttee on Economy.(b) That the Secretary of the Cornrattee ofImperial Defence should undertake thepreparation of material bearing on the strategical aspects of this question.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Attorney-General, setting forth the presentposition of the law in regard to sedition andstrikes under two branches, viz-   -(i) The power of the State to punish(Previous or prevent the preaching of revolu-:Reference: tionary doctrine &quot;^hich might preventCabinet 47 any chance of a peaceful settlement,(25), Con-elusion 2(e).) and(ii) The limits within which a general strike in support of the miners&apos;demand s is pe rmis s ible.(Paper 0.P.-420 (25).)The Cabinet agreed  That the proposals in the Attorney-General&apos; s Memorandum should bereferred to the following CommitteeThe Lord Chancellor (in the Chair) ,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for India,The Attorney-General,The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,and that the Committee should also consider the possible strengtheningoi&apos; the Public Meetings Act.
THE ARREST OF 2A.    The At to may-General- informed the CabinetCOMMUNISTthat he had been, advised by the Director of public prosecutions that evidence was available to justifythe arrest and prosecution of&apos;nine of the leadingBritish Cora-unists on a charge of sedition, andthat in his opinion a prosecution was likely to result In convictions.   After careful consideration the Attorney-General had reached the conclusionthat arrests should be made forthwith..   Before taking a final decision, however, he wished to consult theCabinet as to whether there were any factors in thenational or industrial situation which rendered a prosecution undesirable.The Cabinet, while recognising thv; consti-tutional responsibilitios of the Attorney-General,took the view that.there w^re no objections whichshould stand In the way of a prosecution.The Secretary was instruc tsd-not to circulate the Minute.-In regard tothis decision until after thearrests had been made.-SA-
3- Oruri^uming&apos;of thequestion of the rates of-pay of new exit-rants to theFighting Services, the Cabinet hod before them,(previous reference&apos; besides the Memorandum by the Secretary of StateCabinet 4.7(25) 5 Con- for War circulated before the previous Meetingelusion 3. )(Paper CP. -415 (25)), a Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Air, urging that exact relativitybetween the three Services was impracticable andhad been recognised to be so by the Cabinet Committee(Paper CP.-425 (25)),In the course of the discussion it becameelear that the question was -highly technical in character and involved a.close investigation of matters of detail.The Cabinet were also informed that only two members of the Cabinet Committee had been availablewhen the question was considered,,The suggestion was made that if different rates of pay were offered by the   i&amp;wa   services for what was virtually the same class of service,at least a different nomenclature for -chat service should be adopted.The Cabinet were informed that the matter was one of great urgency, as the announcement oftx;e revised War Office rat.es of pay was held uppending^ Its settlement, and the dally enlistment ofmen on ihe old rates was extravagant *iThe Cabinet agreed  (a) That the question of whether the WarOffice should make the increases Iniheir rates of pay for tradesmen onthe lines proposed by the Secretary6f State (Paper CP. -415 (25)) shouldbe referred back to the Cabinet Com-mittee, who should confer the same afternoon (notvrithstanding the factthat the Chairman^ of the Committeewas not available) with the Secretaryof State for War on the subject andshould be authorised to take a finaldecision;
(b) That the three Service departments should, as soon as possible, forwardtheir proposals in regard to ratesof retired pay to the Treasury, who should, if they deemed it necessary,refer them to the Cabinet Committee.-4-
4-  The Cabinet had. before them a Memorandum bythe First Lord of the Admiralty covering a letter dated -September 16, 1925, - to the Prime-Minister,and Memoranda, on the . subject, of the closing ofBosyth and Pembroke Dockyards in the interests of economy (Paper CP.-422 (25))., together with aMemorandum on the strategical aspects of the same question, which had been, circulated to the Committeeof Imperial Defence (CI.D.  Paper No.l39-A.).From the point of view of economy, the FirstLord&apos;s proposals, commended themselves to the Cabinet,but it was felt that a decision cculd not be taken until the strategical aspects of the closing ofRosyth and Pembroke had been considered by theOommitfoe of Imperial Defence.The question was therefore reservedfor further consideration when theReport of the Committee of ImperialDefence is- available.
IMTERNAT ro MLLABOUR ORGAN-.ISATION. -ratification of certainConventions.(previous references:Cabinet. 19(25), Con-   .elusion 12,and Cabinet7 (25), Con-clusion 4.)5. The Cabinet &quot;had before them a&apos; Memorandum bythe- Minister of Labour proposing... the. ratification of the following Conventions, effect to which has.already been given by the passing of the MerchantShipping (International Labour Conventions) Aot:-. Unemployment Indemnity;   Employment of Young persons as Trimmers or Stokers;   Medical Examination of YoungPersons (Paper C.P.-423 (25)).&apos;The Cabinet agreed  That the Ministry of Labour shouldinitiate negotiations with a view- to* securing&apos;the- ratification of thethree above Conventions by.Prenohj German and Dutchbut that, even if they were unable tosecure such ratification, they shouldbe empowered to arrange for ratifica-tion by His Majestyls &quot;Government.
6. The CatnLne t&quot; had&quot; &quot;before.. them -a-- Memo randum bythe President of the Board of Trade, first, in regardto an application from the Worsted Industry for theimposition of a Duty under the Safeguarding ofIndustries Procedure, in reference to which thePresident of the Board of Trade stated that he was satisfied that a prima facie case had been made out for an inquiry;   and, second, pointing out that theCabinet would have to decide whether a Finance Billshould be passed in the Autumn Session dealing; withthe Duties already approved and any others which may-be sanctioned (Paper C.P.-417 (25)).The Cabinet were reminded that a considerablenumber of olaims for the application of the Safe-guarding of Industries Proceduro were now underconsideration.    It was suggested that if a very largenumber of applications were granted, the effect wouldbe   tantamount&apos;  to the piecemeal imposition of ageneral tariff end might even amount to a violation of the Prime Ministo^s pledge;    and that theapplication of the Safeguarding of Industriesif grantedProcedure to the Worsted Industry/would result inthe imposition of dutieo on so large a scale as to constitute an important step In this direction.A discussion took place as to whether thepolioy of the Safeguarding of Industries procedure was intended to be limited to discriminating dutiesagainst particular nations or for the protection ofparticular industries if neoess&amp;ry by general duties imposed against all nations.As regards the proposed Finance Bill, It waspointed out that this would require a considerableamount of Parliamentary time, possibly as much as
seven or eight full days, but the Cabinet were notasked to take a decision on this point.The Cabinet concurred with tho Presidentof the Board of T-rade that a priraa faciecase had been made out for an enquiry into tbo Worsted Industry under the safeguarding of Industries procedure.
7.   A short cUs cue a Ion of a preliminary charactertook pls.ce in regard to the situation in Iraq.Ehb Cabinet were informed that the Turjfcshfid e force of about 13,000 infantry and 5,000cavalry clone to the frontier and within stridingQistonad of Mosul;The Cabin at roeoomsod that an early dioouesionof this question wd.c necessary, but they preferred to await the report of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff.They therefore agreed  To postpone the question untilTuesday,  October 20th, or suchday as the friuo Minister mightfis for b special Meeting toconsider this question only.
8. Apart from the special Meet lug to consider thequestion of Iraq, the Cabinet agreed to meet regularlyhenceforward, as usual, on Wednesdays.2 V/h it eh el 1 Gar deii s , S.  * 1. ,October 10, 1925.
