UJNIST 1. The Home Seoretary informed the Cabinet thatflGTS .Mr Clynes and two of his colleagues of the Labourfioua Party had waited upon him as a deputation in order;renc e:met 53 to request the transfer of the Communist prisonersj Con-jion40) to the first division.   After careful considerationhe had come to the conclusion that this request couldnot be conceded.    Sir William Johnson-Hicks read the terms of a draft letter communicating thi3 deci-sion to Mr Clynes.The Cabinet agreed  To concur in the decision of theHome Secretary and, subject to a minor amendment which the HomeSecretary accepted, to approve the terms of the letter conveyingthe decision to Mr Clynes..1-
IRISH 2. The Home Secretary drew attention to the at I ON.understanding which had bean reached in the courseoaedew of of the reoent Irish negotiations that the cases ofioners&apos;ancea, prisoners convicted in Northern Ireland in respectof offences during the period of disturbance iniousrence: Ireland should be reviewed by fha British Government,inet 57) Con- whose decision in each oase would be accepted by theion 2.)Government of Northern Ireland.   In view of the factthat political considerations were involved whichdifferentiated these cases from the normal exerciseof the Prerogative, he asked that the matter mightbe removed from the responsibility of the HomeSecretary and that two or three members of theCabinet might be appointed to deal with these cases.The Secretary for Scotland informed the Cabinetthat some of these persons were imprisoned in Scotlandand that he was in the same position as the HomeSecre tary.Some doubt having been expressed as to whetherit was desirable to admit the distinction betweenpolitical and oth^r prisoners in the exercise ofthe Prerogative, the Cabinet agreed  That the Earl of Birkenhead shouldbe asked to review the cases inquestion and to advise the Cabinet.
NORTHERNIRELAND.ReportedSfutinyof Special&apos;Constabulary.3. The Ho me Secretary was asked for informationas to the Press reports of mutinous conduct on themembero ofpart of/the Special Constabulary in Northern Ireland.At a later stage of the Meeting the HomeSeoretary received a message from, the Hone Officeto the effect that a cipher telegram was .on its way from Northern Ireland, but that from, a telephone message it appeared that the matter was not onewhich was causing the Government of NorthernIreland very serious anxiety.-3-
4, The Minister of Labour gave the Cabinet someaccount of a labour dispute which had arisen between a Graft Union and the National Union of Railwaymen,as the result of which the National Union of Railway-men had tendered notices to withdraw the services ofrailway shopmen on the Great Central section of theLondon and North Eastern Railway and the Cheshirelines on Saturday, December 19th.   After consultingrepresentatives of all the Unions concerned he had decided to give notice the same afternoon of his intention to 8 db  up a Court of Inquiry under Part ii of the Industrial Co\irts Act, and to announce the names of the members of the Court later.    This stepmight be criticised as a concession to the NationalUnion of Railwaymen^s threat of a stoppage, but sir arthur Steel-maitland satisfied the Cabinet that ifthe Court was not set up now, one would in all probability have to be set up in less favourable circumstanceslater on.The Cabinet concurred in the decisionof the Minister of Labour.
5. Arising out of the discussion on the railway situation, attention was drawn to the failure tosettle the Wireless Operators&apos;  strike, and it wassuggested that the appointment of a Court in regardto the railway dispute would lead to a demand for aCourt of Inquiry into this dispute also.The Cabinet were informed that, in the circum-stances, the President of the Board of Trade wasallowing ships to proceed to sea without wireless telegraphy operators and without prosecuting theowners, as was strictly his duty under the law.This procedure could not.be continued indefinitely,and the question was raised as to whether tnereshould not be a Court of Inquiry in this case also.The Cabinet were informed that the general principles considered requisite to justify theappointment of a Court of Inquiry were:-(i)  Cases of a threat of.a strike ofa paralysing character:(ii) Cases where the facts were not clear.In other cases It was considered desirable to avoid a Court of Inquiry, if possible,  as otherwise theparties concerned in disputes, instead of trying tosettle their differences, would merely manoeuvre forposition before a Court of Inquiry.In these circumstarc es the Minister of Labourthought.it desr-irrs-b-le to appoint a Coxirt of inquiry into the dispute of wireless operators.The  Cabinet agreed -That the question of the wirelessoperators&apos;  strike should be further considered at their next Meeting.
1( Militarytuation.Ireviouseference:abi.net 57125), Con-conclusion 4(a))6- The Cabinet had before them the following documents in regard to the Military Situation, inIraq  A Report by the Sub-Committee of theChiefs of Staff (Paper CP.-519(25)),together with their previous Reportof October 14th, 1925,  (C.I.D.

(Paper CP.-529(25)).Lord Cecil of Chelwood, who had just returned from Geneva, gave the Cabinet an account of the proceed-ings of the Council of the League in regard to Iraq,and he read the terms of a telegram on this subject which he had just received from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, at Geneva (Appendix) .Satisfaction was expressed by members of theCabinet at the intention stated at the end of the telegram by the Secretary of State&apos;for Foreign Affairs,if he deemed it advisable, to make, on the announcementof the League&apos;s decision,  a statement as to our anxiety to come to a friendly arrangement with the Turks.Lord Cecil also mentioned that General Laidoner,who, as Chairman of the League of Nations Commission,had just returned from the Iraq boundary, had statedhis conviction that he had not the slightest impression of any intention on the part of the Turks to attack
Mosul..   Lord Cecil himself had formed a similarimpression at Geneva.In the course of the discussion which followed,attention was drawn to a despatch from Sir R.Lindsay- to Sir Austen Chamberlain, dated December 2, 1925,and more particularly to Sir R. Lindaayrs view thatthe &quot;Turks were in earnest and not bluffing&quot;(P,0.    B 7513/2386/44).The Cabinet were informed that after their meeting on December 3rd the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs had given a serious warning to theTurkish Ambassador in regard to the grave consequences to Turkey of an aggression following the A^ard ofthe Council of the League of Nations (See F,0.E 7485/32/65) .   &quot;While there was reason to believethat the gist of this warning must have been conveyed to the Turkish Government as the Turkish ForeignMinister had proceeded from Geneva to Paris, where he had seen the Turkish Ambassadors in London and paris, and similar warnings had been given by theFrench Government to the Turkish Ambassador in Paris,nevertheless the Cabinet were informed that theTurkish Ambassador could not be relied upon to have passed the warning on to Angora direct.Sir William Tyrrell undertook toascertain whether the british ambassador at Constantinople hadtaken any steps to repeat the warning at Constantinople, orotherwise to pass it on to Angora,and, in the contrary event,  to instruct him to take appropriate action with this object, in view.In regard to the militairy situation theCabinet were assured that in no circumstances was itintended by the Committee of Imperial Defence thatBritish men-of-war should entar the Dardanellesand Sea of Marmora unless the Turks had first
attacked in the Mosul arsa, and that any operation which might be forced on ua by a Turkish aggressionwould be carried out under the auspices of theLeague,, by its direction or with its sanction, andwith at least the formal aid and assistance ofmembers of the League other than Great Britain.The G:\binet agreed  (a) That it was unnecessary at the moment to take any decision in regard to therecommendations of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the subject ofthe military situation in Iraq:(b) That all copies of CP. Papers523 (25) and 528 (25), as well asthe draft Minutes of the 207thMeeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence, should be returned to theSecretary, who should confine thedistribution of the two former docu-ments within the narrowest limits:(c) That, as the inquiries of the Committeeof Imperial Defence had been purely ofa precautionary and contingent character,it was unnecessary at the-present stage to make any communication to the dominions in regard to them.

LmjAMENTARY[[jtOCSDURE.Ipse ofbrds.previoustefereno e:Cabinet 32(22), Oon-ulusion 2.;12. The attention of the Cabinet was called tothe unsatisfactory character of the present Parlia-rrentary system, under which the House of Lords,at the end of a Session, was congested with business to such an extent as to render almost impossible theproper exercise of ite functions as a Chamber ofrevision, whereas at the beginning of the Parlia-mentary Session^ when the House of Commons was engaged on finance, the House of Lords had but little to do.The suggestion was made that the time had cometo consider some system of carrying over Bills whichhad passed one House until the following Session.This would enable the House of Lords to busy itself with Bills which had passed the House of Commons atthe previous Session, at a tiros when it would otherwise be comparatively unoccupied.The Prime Minister invited the lord privy Seal to circulate a Memorandumon the subject.
13.   The Cabinet agreed---That it was desirable that the secretary for Scotland shouldhave the status of Secretary ofState, and that, subject to theKing&apos;s assentv the Prime minister should take the necessary stepsto bring this about, includinglegislation, if. necessary, in theforthcoming Session,The Prime Minister informed hisoolleagues that the Secretary /forScotland had waived the questionof any increase in emoluments,&apos;-16-

APPENDIXCopy of a telegram from Mr. Amery^ to Lord Cecil.No.430. dated December 15th. 1925.At a late hour yesterday evening Avenol informed meCouncil had decided to fix definitely on Brussels linesubject however to decision becoming of no effect andquestion opened again if new treaty embodying mandatoryconditions of current treaty is not carried through and ready for submission to League by a certain date.   Heofficially transmitted to me question asking me to statedefinitely within what time His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldbe in a position to submit to Council of League of nations in the same way as was done with present treaty, a new treaty for 25 years embodying clauses in present treaty which Council5s resolution of September 27th 1924 accepted as equivalent to clauses of other A mandates.    I havereplied as follows:wR&apos;r begins:    In answer to question put to me by council I see no difficulty in submission within six months from present date of a new treaty with Irak whioh will continue&apos;mandate responsibility towards League which is embodied incurrent treaty and in League decision of September 27th 1924for 25 years or until such early date as Irak is in theopinion of Council qualified for admission to membership of League.i need not assure Council that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis anxious to arrive at a final settlement of this question at f? earliest, omitted) possible date. ends.Avenol is transmitting verbally our view that weconfidently expect to have treaty ready for March sessionif not before.    The mandatory clauses referred to in
question fall within conditions laid down by Cabinet    130for my guidsnoe nor (? would their) continuance in anew treaty affect policy embodied in military andfinancial agreements of bringing our military expenditureon Irak to an end after terminating present treatyperiod.   As regards 25 years Avenol assures me decision which (grp. undeo.) is drafting will make it clear thatit is a maximum.    Both Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and I regard this as under all the circumstancesa satisfactory solution and one most fully safeguardingliberty of Parliament; in signing declaration we wereprepared to submit  (2 grps. undeo.) but if we judge it advisable Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs willmake on announcement of decision the statement which you suggested as to our anxiety to come to friendlyarrangement with Turks.-CO-
