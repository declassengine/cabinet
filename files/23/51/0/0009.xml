IRISH BOUNDARY COMMISSION.



Previous Reference: Cabinet 54 (25), Conclusion 11.



The Cabinet had before them notes of proceedings of Meetings between the Prime Minister and Representatives of the Irish Free State and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland at Chequers on Saturday, the 28th November 1925, (C.P.500(25)), and Sunday, the 29th, November 1926, (C.P.501 (25)), as well as a copy of a letter from the Chairman of the Irish Boundary Commission to the Prime Minister, dated 28th November, 1925, forwarding a map showing the boundary line as about to be determined by the Commission and an advanced proof of the chapter of the Commission&apos;s Report dealing with the general principles forming the basis of the award which is to be delivered, (circulated with C.P.500(25)). The map referred to above was available for the Cabinet and was passed round at this Meeting.

The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet the following particulars of the proceedings during the last few days.

On Thursday, November 26th, he himself, accompanied by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and some other Ministers, had seen Mr. Cosgrave, the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State. At the end of this meeting Mr. Cosgrave had left for Dublin to consult his Cabinet as to whether they would accept an arrangement based on the existing boundary line. Prior to this Mr. Cosgrave had asked Sir James Craig, the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, to make some concessions in regard to the treatment of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland and to release certain political prisoners. Sir James Craig had not been able to give any satisfaction as regards the concession to Roman Catholics and was only prepared to release a very few prisoners. Before leaving for Dublin Mr. Cosgrave had made it clear that, in

   
 his view, there was no alternative to an arrangement based on the acceptance of the existing boundary.

In compliance with a telegraphic request made by Mr. Cosgrave Minister had, on Saturday, November 28th, seen Mr. O&apos;Higgins, Vice-President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, Mr. McGilligan, Minister of Commerce and Industry, and Mr. O&apos;Byrne, Attorney-General. He, himself, had put to them that the only alternatives were either to accept the award of the Boundary Commission or to adopt the present boundary. The agreed in this and made it clear that in their view there was no prospect of an independent agreement between North South Ireland in regard to the boundary. By Saturday evening the position was that they had elected to stand on the existing boundary if the North would restore complete civic rights to the Roman Catholic minority and release the political prisoners. If they had to accept formally the award of the Boundary Commission they would put it to their people and fulfill the legal obligations under the Treaty though they would not be able to commend it. They might seek to delay or divert action on the physical plane by an appeal to the League of Nations, but the greater probability was that they would be swept out of office. They could see no alternative Government to succeed them which would be prepared to do what they had done, via?, loyally to work the Treaty and their successors would be people of no experience in Government and the result would be chaos in Ireland.

While the Free State Representatives were still at Chequers, Mr. Bourdillon, the Secretary of the Boundary Commission, arrived Bringing with him the documents and maps relating to the award. The Free State Representatives had been unwilling to see the maps, but they offered no objection to the Prime Minister/

  


 accepting the documents. In fact, they had considered this desirable. Consequently, after the Free State Representatives had left, the Prime Minister had received Mr. Bourdillon and had examined the map and documents. He had found that in some respects the map differed from that published in the "Morning Post", and next day he had told the Representatives of the Irish Free State that this was the case.

On Saturday at noon, as arranged before the departure of the Free State Representatives on the previous day, Sir James Craig and the Free State Representatives arrived and joint discussions and private conservation between Sir James Craig and Mr. O&apos;Higgins took place. Discussions between the Prime Minister and Mr. O&apos;Higgins, and the Prime Minister and Sir James Craig, went on until near 6 o&apos;clock. At the opening of the discussion the Prime Minister had conveyed to both parties the following statistical summary of the results of the proposed award of the Boundary Commission --

Summary of Transfers to the Irish Free State.

183,290 acres; 31,319 persons, of whom 27,843 are Roman Catholics and 3,476 of other denominations. 

Summary of Transfer to Northern Ireland.

49.242 acres; 7,594 persons, of whom 2,764 are Roman Catholics and 4,830 of other denominations. The gains of the Irish Free State under the award exceed those of Northern Ireland by 134,048 acres and 23,725 persons. The boundary would be shortened by 51 miles.

The Prime Minister had offered to show the documents and the map he had received from the Commission, but both Sir James Craig and Mr. O&apos;Higgins had, on Sunday also, preferred not to see them. At this point the Prime Minister read a long extract from the Secretary&apos;s Notes of a statement by Mr. O&apos;Higgins explaining the difficulties




 with which the Government of the Irish Free State would be faced by the Commission&apos;s award.

In the afternoon of Sunday, after a talk between Sir James Craig and Mr. O&apos;Higgins, the former came to the Prime Minister and informed him that the was satisfied that what was at the bottom of the whole difficulty was Article 5 of the Irish Treaty in regard to the assumption by the Irish Free State of liability for the service of the public debt of the United Kingdom as existing at the date of the Treaty and towards the payment of War Pensions, etc. Sir James Craig had gathered from Mr. O&apos;Higgins that if that could be waived altogether the Free State might ride the storm and stand on the present boundary. They wanted to have something - some lie-buoy - when the first great wave of opposition rolled over them. The wiping out of Article 5 would do this. De Valera was proclaiming that we had tricked the Irish on Article 12 and that we would trick them again on Article 5, and that we were out to demand Â£19,000,000 a year of tribute from Ireland. After this the Prime Minister had seen Mr. O&apos;Higgins alone himself and had had much the same tale from him.

The Prime Minister had told Mr. O&apos;Higgins that he could hold out no hope of waiving Article 5 of the Irish Treaty, but what he thought it would not be right to refuse that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and two of his colleagues should meet three Representatives of the Irish Free State Government and discuss whether there could be some postponement in the operation of Article 5.



Prime Minister, ? made clear that Article 5 did not ?.



After more coming and going the position had been reduced quite roughly to the following five propositions:-



(1) That the existing boundary should be left undisturbed.

(2) That the rights of the British Government under Clause 5 of the Treaty should be waived; (or) should be waived for a period of x years from date of Treaty.

 


122X M n)(3) That tho two Irish governments should be reoognlsed as. hayingequal rights as regards the navi-gation of Lough Foyle (or) thatDorry should have free-tradingfacilities through Lough Foyle.(4) That the casos of prisoners con-victed in Northern Ireland Inrespect of offences during thoperiod of disturbance should boreviowod by the british Government,whose deoision in eaoh case shallbe accoptod by the Government ofNorthern Ireland.(5) That the administration of Councilof Ireland services in NorthernIreland shall bo transferred to theGovernment of Northern Ireland, andthat Government and the Governmentof Free State shall where necessaryoonsult together in connection with matters of common interest arisingout of the administration of.those services..The precise point on which the Prime Minister wishedto consult the Cabinet was as to whether the Chanoellorof the Exohequer and two of his colleagues should meetthe Representatives of the Irish Froe state to disousswhother the operation of Article 5 of tho Irish treaty should bo waived.Turing tho subsequent discussion a suggestion was made that search should be made in the records of the cabinet office as to passages in the Minutes of tho discussionsleading up to the conclusion of the Irish Treaty, whichshowod how unfair it would bo if the Irish Free. Statedid not assume liability for their share of the war debt and the payment of War Pensions as prescribed in article of the Treaty.    The Cabinet were reminded of the strengthwithof tho case in this respect; of the tenacity /   which thepoint had been pressod by Mr. Lloyd George; of the reactionswhioh would follow in Northern Ireland among the loyalistsof the South, and perhaps dm the Dominions, if the liabilities of the Irish Free State were romitted,and of the politioaldifficulties which would be raised.
After a long discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Chanoollor of the. Exchequer,The lord Privy Seal and the secretary of Stato for India should meet Hepre-sontativeo Of tho Irish Free StateGovernment on the following day witha view to a discussion on Article 5of tho Treaty between Great Britainand Ireland,  (Cmd.1560).(bf That the British Representatives shouldhave no authority to waivo the rightsof the Briti3h Government under Artiole5 of the Treaty, but that they should do their best to reach an agreement on tho basis of a moratorium.   Whilethe British Representatives wore given full discretion to conduct the negotia-tione inthemannor they found moot con-venient, It was suggested that theyshould aim at a moratorium until theyoar 1933.    If pressed as to why thatyear was soleoted they ehould be atliborty to point out that in 1933 theBritish Government would, itself,incur additional obligations und^rtho American Debt settlement,    BUbjoetto there being no waiving of Article 6,tho Chanoollor of the Exchequer and hiso-olloagues were left to make the bestarrangements thoy could gs to the amountof the payment, tar the time and methodof fixing it by arbitration or otherwise.(o) That the arrangements in regard to thoannouncement or possible withholding ofthe Boundary Commission^ award shouldbe reserved until it was known whetherthe throe Governments oould reaoh agree-ment In regard to the Boundary, and thatin the meantime the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs should arrange to notify tho Boundary Commission informallythat it was undesirable they should makeany announcement until the issue of the conferences now proceeding was known.
TING 2.      In view of the visit of Foreign ministers in connection with the Signing of the locarno treaty,  the Cabinet agreed --That the regular weekly Meeting ofthe Cabinet should be held onThursday, December 3rd,  Instead of on Wednesday.      The Prime Ministerwarned his colleagues, however,that a special Meeting might haveto be called in connection withthe Irish negotiations.2,  Whitehall Gardens,  S..W.1.30th November,  1925.
