1, The Secretary of State for India referred to anarticle which had appeared in &quot;The Daily Mail&quot; on theprevious day, October 6th, containing a statement to-the effect that Lord Birkenhead was in complete disagree-ment with the policy announced by the Secretary ofState for the Dominions and Colonies at Geneva.    Heemphasized-that neither directly nor indirectly had he had any communication with any person in the offices of &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;..    If there had been any differences between him and the Colonial Secretary, he would atonce have placed himself in communication with hiscolleague.    There was no foundation of any kind forthe statements referred to.    Lord Birkenhead proposedto write to the Editor to the effect that the articlewas absolutely without warrant, and to enquire on whatauthority the statements were made.    He naturally felt,as all his colleagues must, anxiety in repaid to thesituation in Iraq, and he had the greatest symapathy for the Secretary of State for the Dominions and colonies in the difficulties with which he was faced, as well asadmiration for the way. in which he had handled thequestion.    When the subject came to be discussed at theCabinet he would make his contribution to the discussion,arid that, he hoped, would be of a helpful character.The Home Secretary also drew attention to -a whollyincorrect construction whioh had been placed on a speechhe had made at Liverpool,, and the Prime minister informed the Cabinet that he had received a letter from lord Derby resenting the construction which had beenplaced by a part of the Press on a brief allusion he hadma.de to the question of Iraq on the same occasion.(The question of Iraq is de-^lt with inConclusion 7. )

The Prime Minister explained that his reasonfor sumnjoning this meeting of the Cabinet v.&apos;as to consult his oolleagues as to the general lines of his speech to the 53rd Conference of The National Unionof Conservative and Unionist Associations at Brightonon the following day.As regards Foreign Policy, he proposed to refer to the improved situation in China;    the negotiationsfor a Pactj culminating in the Conference now in pro-press at Locarno;    the Mosul dispute up to and includ-ing the present position of the question &quot;before theLeague of Nations , without attempting to discuss thefuture;   and the internal situation.    In regard to thelatter he hoped to shov,r that the policy of the Govern-ment was to get the whole country behind them in maintaining the essential services of the nation inthe event of a serious stride, and to dispel the idea,,promulgated in certain quarters, that the Governmentwas opposed to the Trade Unions.In the discussion which followed, the HomeSecretary reoapitulated the steps taken to improve the Supply and Transport Organisation, as set forth in a Progress Report (Paper CP.-416 (25)) which hehad circuxated in continuation of an earlier Report(Paper CP.-390 (25)).General Organisation.    The Home Secretary-reported that he had had the assistance of the ChiefCivil Commissioner (the Postmaster-General) and ofthe President of the Board of Education, and hadreceived Valuable suggestions from the Secretary ofState for India.    Owing to the relaxation of the excessive secrecy, considerable improvements had been effected.-a-
Divisional Organisatjon.    In each of the 11divisions into which the country was divided, aHeadquarters had been set up, composed of 8 personswho would be responsible for the various services which the division.    A new whole-time official hadbeen appointed in each.    Arrangements had been madefor the Civil Commissioners (Parliamentary Under-Secretaries) to spend some time in their districts,and meetings had been arranged to take place withinthe next few weeks both of the new permanent officials and of the Under-Secretaries.Sub-Area Organisation.  In addition, there were32 sub-areas, each with its Headquarters.    Pour-fifths of the officers of these sub-area organisations hadalready been appointed, and the remainder would beappointed shortly.officialRecruiting.    Up to the present no ^arrangement shad been irade for recruiting the persons who would carry out the various duties under the general organ-isation.    Various unofficial organisations, however,had been formed for this purpose, including the O.M.S.,the Chambers of Commerce, the Fascisti and the Crusadersand it was understood that the persons who volunteeredunder these unofficial organisations would, in caseof emergency, be at the disposal of the Government.Motor Vehicles.  Mo difficulty was anticipated in regard to the number of motor vehicles available.Drivers would be the principal difficulty, and it wasa question for Cabinet consideration as to whether some, arrangements should be made for training them,since the management of a lorry differed from thatof a private car.Fuel.    The Cabinet were informed that themotstocks of/ fuel were at a high level, the principal

He advertedto the difficulty encountered in tracing the sources of the funds at the disposal of the Communists.The Minister of Labour made a short statement in regard to &apos; the railway situation, -which is dealtwith fully in his Memorandum CP.-412 (25).   -Sa,&quot;He indicated that under existing conditionsIndustrial trouble was not likely to arise,   cabinet and that in any case he did not think that anything in the nature of e critical railway situation need be anticipated until, at theearliest, after iovember.------ ------uvjj.      uj/uuuu       uakein his speech at E right on.(b) Supply arid Transport Organisation.That the question of whether it wasadvisable either to recruit citizensfor the purpose of manning thevarious services under the Supplyana Tr an sport Organisation or to&apos;encourage or permit private ornan-isations to do so at the present stage was one of large, policyrequiring careful consideration bythe Cabinet as soon as all its members were available to take partin the discussion:(c) That, with a view to an early dis-cussion by the Cabinet, those ministers who had been studying this subject should circulate Memoranda.
That at Brighton the Prime minister should limit himself to a statement to the effect that the Governmentfully recognised their obligationto maintain the essential servicesof the country in the event of astrike;    that those, who think theGovernment were unprepared lastAugust were profoundly in error;and that those who bulieve that theGovernment were not prepared tome.intal.ri these services if and whenstrikes should occur are equallymist aken. .Common:, sin.
