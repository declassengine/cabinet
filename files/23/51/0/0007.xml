It has also seemedto us that, before arriving at any final judgment, DominionGovernments would desire the fullest possible informationas to the situation created by the Treaty in relation tothe whole field of foreign policy and defence. ,It would appear to follow that there should be ageneral examination of the whole situation, and we suggestthat such examination could best be deferred until therehas been an opportunity of personal discussion between ministers here end representatives of the Dominions andIndia auch as would he afforded by the next ImperialConference as to the date of whioh we hope to be able tomake proposals in the near future.Secretary of State for foreign.;jn Affairs in speech which ho is making in House of Commons to-day will makestatement on lines indioated in separeto message which follows. *Similar message sent to other prime Ministers.Baldwin.
