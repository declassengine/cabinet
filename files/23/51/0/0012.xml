.1. The Lord Chancellor reported that,  as regardsthe Ireland(Confirmation of Agreement) Bill,  arrange-ments had been made on the assumption that it would pass the House of Lords on December 9th and receivethe Royal Assent on December 10th.    He enquire whether this was desirable,  since it right -conceivablyresult in the British Bill being passed before theIrish Free State Bill.The Prime Minister said that the Bill was to be passed through the Dail today, and consequently hethought the arrangements as regards  the Royal Assentshould stand.

The Cabinet had a -short discussion as to thedate on which Parliament should be asked to re-assembleafter the Recess.   The position was found to be thatif financial business only was to be taken, February9th would be an appropriate date, but that if legisla-tlon was required before Easter the House would haveto meet on February 2nd.The Cabinet were informed that the King had decided to hold a meeting of the Privy Council onWednesday, December 16th, with the object of passing the Prorogation Order, and that it was consequentlyneoessary to take a decision in regard to the dateof the re-assembly of Parliament before the expiration of the present week.The Cabinet agreed - (a) That each Minister, from his respectivestandpoint, should notify the PrimeMinister immediately as to what legis-lation (if any) it was essential topass before Easter:(b) That the Prime Minister should decide the question, in consultation with theChief Whip., after hearing from Ministers,and that he should., if possible., make arrangements for the meeting of Parlia-ment on the later date,  namely,February 9th.The Prime Minister undertook not to overlook a suggestion that,  if necessary,the time of Private Members should betaken before Easter, which could possibly be recouped to them subsequently:(c) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should confirm, a belief he had expressed to the Cabinet that the necessity ofrepealing the&quot;Bowles Act&quot;could be avoidedby arranging that new Customs Dues shoulddate from the day on which a Finance bill was introduced,  instead of from the date on which the Bill received the royal assent, thus enabling Customs Dues tobe collected retrospectively on imported goods and so discouraging dumping.
3.   A Memorandum &quot;by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries in regard to the Tithe Bill was handed round at the outset of the Meeting (Paper CeP.-521(25)).The Lord Privy Seal made a verbal report to theCabinet in regard to a meeting of the Cabinet Committon the  Tithe Bill which had been held the same morninThe Cabinet agreed  (a) That,  in view of the fact that no satisfactory suggestion had beenmade for meeting the admittedtemporary hardship to Universitiesinvolved in the Bill, which wouldnot either destroy the basis of theBill 02* involve a permanent charge onthe Exchequer, the Government spokesmanin the Bouse of Lords should not accept any amendment to the Bill:fb) That the Government spokesman shouldhave authority to remind the House&apos; that the Government had made consid-erable increases in the grants to universities during the previousfinancial year, amounting to an aggregate of  500,000, and to throwout  the suggestion that the possibility should be examined of some arrangementby which the Universities which havethe benefit of the increased government grant might give temporary relief tothe Colleges (in regard to their annualcontributions to the University orotherwise)  during the period in whichthe Colleges will suffer from the effectof the Tithe Bill.(The Lord Privy Seal, as leader of the House of Lords,  informed the Cabinet that this  decision might result in a defeat of theGovernment in the House of Lords.)
4. The Cabinet approved a propoe-al..contained ina Memorandum by the Secretary for Scotland for theappointment of a Royal Commission to consider thewhole law touching the Court of Session in Scotland,including the constitution of the Court and itsprocedure as a Court of first instance, and as the appeal Court from the Sheriff Court (Paper C.P.-515(25)).

The Cabinet had before-them the following documents in regard to Pood Supply in Time of War:-A Note by the Secretary in regardto the proceedings of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on this subject,in which attention was drawn to two points which had been reserved forthe Cabinet by the Committee ofImperial Defence, namely:-(i) Whether legislation shouldbe introduced with a viewto securing more- accurate information in regard to food stocks^    and(ii) Whether, when the Government&apos;policy on Agriculture ieannounced, a statement shouldbe included to the affectthat a subsidy for food supplies is not justified on grounds of Defence Policy:(Paper CP.-4=55 (25) .A Copy of a Letter from the Secretaryof the Board of Trade to the Secretaryof the Committee of Imperial Defencecovering a Memorandum on Stocks of meat in Cold Storage (C.I.D. PaperNo.609-B):A Note by the Secretary of the Commit-tee of Imperial Defence (CI.D. PaperNo .636-B) :A Letter from, the Admiralty to theSecretary of the Committee of ImperialDefence slightly qualifying the opinions expressed at an, earlier date as to their power to deal with thesubmarine menace (C.I.D. Paper No.639-B):An Extract from the Minutes of the204th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence, held on October 29,1925 .The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that the Pood Council were now receivingsatisfactory information in regard to food supplies,and that it might prove unnecessary from their point of view to introduce legislation even inregard to stocks of meat.
1 ^91 J the Cabinet agreed -(a) That the President of the Eoard ofTrade should report early in thenew year to the Cabinet in regardto the extent and usefulness ofthe information then being receivedby the Pood Council, and that inthe meantime a decision.as to legislation on the question offood stocks should remain in abey-ance:(b) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should have authority tomake a discreet statement in regardto food supply in time &quot;of war, inthe course of. which, without sndeav-ouring to reassure public opinibnunduly, .he should point out the relatively small effect which wouldbe exercised on the food supply bycomparatively elaborate and costlymeasures for stimulating wheatproduc tion in this country 8-7-
The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Air Raids Precautions:-A Note by the Secretary in regardto the proceedings of the Committeeof Imperial Defence on Air raids precautions,  in which attention was drawn more particularly to two points which had been reserved bythe Committee of Imperial defence for the Cabinet, namely:-(i)  The question of the education of public opinion:(ii)  The question of whether further investigation should continue as to the possibility of itsbecoming necessary in the con-contingency of war to move the seat of the Government:(Paper CP.-456 (25)) .The Report of a Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence on.Air .Raids Precautions (C.I.D. Paper No.135-A):A Report on the Protection of theCivil Population against Gas Attack(C.I.D. Paper No.134-A) :An Extract from the Minutes of the204th Meeting of the Committee ofImperial Defence, held on October29th, 1925.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to the large volume of the Papers circulated bythe Committee of Imperial Defence in regard to matters of this kind, which seemed to indicatethat, notwithstanding a great diminution of thewar risks to which the British Empire was exposed,the activities of the Committee exceeded the pre-wstandard.The First Commissioner of Works informed theCabinet that the contingency of the removal of the seat of government was one which, if it were to be properly prepared for, would involve considerable expenditure.
In view of the great advance in the pacificationof Europe which has resulted from the conclusion ofthe Locarno Agreements, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the present moment was ill-timedfor undertaking the education of publicopinion in regard to the danger of air raids, and that the policy of the Gov-ernment in this matter was well repre-sented by the following extract fromthe remarks made at the 204 th Meetingof the Committee of Imperial defence by Sir John Anderson, Chairman of theSub-Committee on Air Raids Precautions:-&quot;There were some signs that thepublic were gradually realisingthe significance of air attack.His Committee did not advocatethat any considerable steps should be taken at ones with theobject of creating a wider know-ledge of attack from the air andits unavoidable consequences,  but rather that the process of educa-tion in this respect should be slow and gradual, so as to eliminateas far as possible the chance of creating undue alarm.&quot;For the moment,  the gradual dissemina-tion of knowledge through the inquiriesby Government Departments and Sub-Commit-tees of the Committee of Imperial Defenceinto the different aspects of the air raids question was felt to provide asufficient safeguard in this matter:(b) That the Committee of Imperial defence should keep the question of the education of public opinion under consideration andrevie- it periodically:(c) That the question of moving the seat ofthe Government should remain in abeyancefor the present.
8. Reverting to the Report of the Committeeappointed to consider the application concerningbrooms and brushes under the Safeguarding of Indus-tries Procedure which he had circulated on the 3rdDecember (Paper CP.,-514 (25)), the President of theBoard of Trade informed his colleagues that he pro-posed to print and publish the Report at once, andthat, if asked what course the Government intendedto pursue, he would reply that no action was contem-plated.The Cabinet approved this course.
WAY 9. The Minister of Labour informed the CabinetON.that the conclusions of the National Wages Board in -9 regard to the wages disputes on the railways would52 be signed that afternoon.   He gave the Cabinet aon-6(b) .)      forecast of those conclusions, with a request thatthey might be regarded as strictly confidential untilpublished.iiehal 1 Gard ens , S. W. 1,December 9, 1925.
