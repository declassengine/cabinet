lOtiHOUSINGSITUATIONIN SCOTLAND,(previous reference:Cabinet 47(25), Con-clusion 5.)1* The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet,as a matter of urgency, that the offer which hadbeen made to Local Authorities in Scotland inregard to houses, in accordance with the previous decision of the Cabinet, had not been takenadvantage of sufficiently.   He gave the Cabinet a comparison of the figures In regard to the houses built in Glasgow and Birmingham, respectivelyunder the various Government schemes.    The net result was that, while Birmingham, with a slightlysmaller population, had built 4,389 houses,Glasgow had only built 1,100.The Cabinet agreed  That, in order to stimulate thebuilding of houses in Scotland,the Government should themselvesprovide 2,000 houses through theScottish/&apos;Housing Company.!
S. The Cabinet had before them-a Memorandumon the investigation made by General Laidoner&apos;mission under the Commission on behalf of theLeague of Nations on the Deportation of Christiansin the neighbourhood of the Brussels line (paper c pP0-531 (25)) ,The Cabinet were informed that this Report wasbeing printed as a Parliamentary Paper.The Secretary of State for the Colonies gavehis colleagues some account of the proceedings inregard to Iraq at the Council of the League of nations at Geneva.    Be informed the Cabinet that the council had declared that their decision in regard to the boundary would become definitive only after theBritish Government had submitted a new Treaty with iraq ensuring the continuance of the mandatory regimefor twenty-five years, unless at some earlier dateIraq was admitted as a member of the League.   Althoughthe Council had granted six months for the conclusionand submission of this Treaty,&apos; Mr Amery was most anxious to push on with the matter as rapidly aspossible.    The  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,he said, also desired this, and that parliament should give its approval, in order that negotiations might be taken up with the Turks with a view to securing their acceptance of the new situation.The precise question, therefore, on which Mr Ameryasked for a decision was as to whether the Houseof Commons  could be asked before prorogation to passa resolution which would enable the Government toproceed with the conclusion of the Iraq Treaty beforethe re-assembly of Parliament, with a view to  it.3acceptance at a specially summoned meeting of theCouncil of the League within the next few weeks.
The Cabinet were informed that the precedentsappeared to  justify the Government proceeding withthe Treaty if the House of Commons had debated thequestion in general terms, and more especially if theHouse had passed an appropriate resolution.Sir William Tyrrell, when consulted on thesubject, stated that  the Foreign Office requirements would be met sufficiently by a resolution passed byParliament approving the actions and statements of theBritish representatives at the Council of the League.After considerable discussion, the Cabinet(a) That   having regard to the fact thatthe debate on Iraq can take place onlyon the last full Parliamentary day ofa very long Session, that the leader of one of the Opposition Parties hasalready left London for a vacationand the Leader of the other will beleaving on Monday evening   it wouldnot be fair to ask Parliament to approve in advance the new Iraq Treaty,and that an opportunity ought - to begiven for its discussion at the beginningof ne^-t Session:(b) That a resolution should be moved inthe House of Commons to the effectthat the House approves the action taken and the statements of british policy in connection with Iraq by therepresentatives of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-development at the recent meeting of theCouncil of the League of Nations  atGeneva:(c) That in the course of the Debate onIraq on Monday, December 21st,  thePrime Minister should make the state-ment contained in the Report of theCabinet Committee of November 25th,192 5 (Paper CP.-502 (25))  as amended by the Cabinet on December 3rd fCabinet57 (25)  Conclusion 4(c))(    The stage the Debate at which this statement should be made was left to the PrimeMinister, in consultation with theSecretary of State for the Colonies:(d) That the question of whether the debate on Iraq should .precede or follow thediscussion on the Lords&apos;  amendments in the  House of Comrrons on Monday,December 21st,  should be settled bythe Prime Minister,  in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal as leader of the House of Lords:
(e) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should have authority toproceed with the new Iraq treaty with a view to  its submission toParliament at a vary early stage of the next Parliamentary Sessionbefore its  final ratification andsubmission to the Council of theLeague of Nations:(f) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should have authority, whan he deems    fit, totake up negotiations with Turkey.The Military (g) That, in regard to Conclusion (f)Situation. of the 207th Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence,  in the event ofan aggression by the Turks againstMosul during the Recess, the- Secretaryof State for Air should have; authorityto arrange for the despatch of air reinforcements from India and Egypt,&apos; subject to the agreement respectivelyof the Secretary of State for Indiaand the Secretary of State for War(who stated that his agreement was subject to the consent of the Chiefof the Imperial General Staff, who,he had been informed in that room,had already been consulted).    In anycase of difference of opinion betweenthe Secretary of State for Air and hiscolleagues, the question was left forthe Prime Minister to decide:(h) To approve the action of the Secretary,who had already informed the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff, the Chiefof the Air Staff and the MilitarySecretary at the India Office,  thatthey were justified in acting onrecommendation (g) of the Committeeof Imperial Defence at the 207thMeeting, to the effect that a GeneralStaff Officer should he  sent to Iraq,since this Conclusion had not beanspec! fie ally referred to the cabinet for decision by the Committee ofImperial Defence.
