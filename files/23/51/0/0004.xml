FOREIGNPOLICY.CHINA,[(previous reference:Cabinet 46(25), Con-elusion 2 .)1, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs      41reported to the Cabinet that the situation in china was one of extreme confusion, and no-one couldprophesy what was likely to happen.   He was inclined to anticipate, however,  that the Tariff commission would feel unable to proceed in present circumstances.The Secretary of State undertook to circulate a Memorandum to the Cabinetin regard to the situation in China,explaining, inter alia^the variouspersonalities referred to in the telegrams were.THE GRAECO-BULGARIANSITUATION.Previous[Reference:Cabinet 44-(25), Con-conclusion 121(b).)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that both o^ the parties to the Incidentwhich had arisen on the frontier between Greece and bulgaria had approached the British Government withcontradictory accounts of what had occurred.   Up tothe previous day his reports had led him to hope thatthe incident would not prove serious.    This morning,however, he had received information that Bulgaria hadappealed to the League of Nations, and M, Briand hadsummoned a Meeting o^ the Council, which ha himself,as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, felt boundto attend.The Cabinet, while conscious of the strain which this would impose on theForeign Secretary so soon after his return fror- his arduous labours atLocarno, recognised th&quot;; desirabilityof Mr Austen Chamberlain attending the forthcoming meeting of the Council.[IRAQ.luestion of turkish ReiSL-Borcerent-s .iyria.Inference:cabinet 4955), Con-Luslon 5(f) ,)3. The attention of the Cabinet was called, as amatter of urgency, to telegrams from Beirout reporting that the Tvirks were seeking authority for 6,000 turkish troops to pass by rail through the French mandated territory in Sy ria (Beirout telegrams Nos .53 and 54).Previously it had beer understood that the passage of600 troops had been authorised.
AThe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he had spoken to the French Ambassador on thematter on the previous day, and a note of his con-versation would be circulated.    He had pointed out to the Ambassador that the Turks probably did not mean to attack Mosul, but these troops could hardly be used for any other purpose than tohadthreaten, and he/expressed the-hope that the FrenchGovernment would not allow them to pass unless an equal number were sent westward,    The french ambassador had undertaken to report his repre-ssntations to Paris,  and had intimated that he had reason to believe that the French Government hadalready made representations and a protest atConstantinople.    He had also briefly discussed thesituation in Syria with the Ambassador.RUSSIA.(PreviousRoference:Cabinet 43(25), Con-elusion 1,)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs referred to the anxiety which had bean expressedspontaneously both by the French and Germanrepresentatives at the Locarno Conference in regardto  the attitude o(f Soviet Russia.    M.Chicherinappeared to be somewhat alarmed &quot;at the failure ofhis policy.    Russia required credits and could not obtain them without the goodwill of the western powers.   Mr Austan Chamberlain intimated that before long he might have to ask the Cabinet toconsider th-: position.
