In addition to the documents which had been before them: at previous discussions in regard to thequestion or Mosul, the Cabinet had before them aMemorandum respect&quot; nc the Iraq frontier dispute,circulated by direction o&apos; the Secretary of State for for-ign Affairs (Paper CP.-450 (25)).
The Cabinet were Informed that the Secretaryof State for the Colonies was about to circulate afresh Memorandum on this question.The Cabinet agreed --To consider the question at their next Meeting, and that it shouldbe placed early on the Agenda,  inorder to allow .ample time fordiscussion.LEAGUE OFNATIONS.composition of theCouncil.previous reference:Cabinet 28(25). Con-clusion 2.)3. The Cabinet were informed by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that, arising out of the locarno Agreements, it was anticipated that germany would shortly make an application to become a memberof the League of Nations.   The Powers whose represen-tatives had initialled the Western Pact were agreed in supporting Germany&apos;s claim for a permanentrepresentation on the Council,   This question, however,was bound to raise the matter of the claims to apermanent seat on the Council by the following nations:-Spain,Brazil,Poland.He had already und rtaken to support the claim of spain.The Cabinet were reminded that the admission ofa Power to a permanent seat on the Council wouldrequire unanimity, and that the representatives of spain and Brazil., who were at present non-permanent members, might withhold their assent unless they were granted per- anent representation.The admission of Brazil and Poland to permanentseats on the Council was felt to present considerable difficulties..

The Secretary of State had nothing to add to the telegrams and despatches that had already been circulated by the Foreign Office in regard to the warning given by the Government of the United Statesof America of their intention to raise claims for compensation in respect of action taken by Great Britainprior to the entry of the United States of America asa belligerent.the largest population, and it was certain that these states would insist on two of the other States being elected among the non-permanent members.   The admissionof Poland would also give rise to a similar demand fromother States^ added to which Poland had not always beena vary law-abiding -member of the League,   Moreover, itwas undesirable, at th-? moment of Germany&apos;s entry, togive the impression of creating an anti-German blocon the Council.The considerable increase to-the numbers of theCouncil would, it was felt, militate against Itsusefulness.Various suggestions were made for meeting these difficulties;    e,g., that a provisional permanent.seat should be given to Brazil pending the possibleadherence of the United States of America to theLeague;    that one permanent seat should be allotted toBrazil,  the Argentine or Chile, according as they themselves might from time to tiim-i .arrange;    that theSouth American States as a whole should be left to dealwith the Brazilian claim;    that the total strength ofthe Council should be laid down by the Assembly.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for Foreign.&apos;Affairs,., taking into consideration theviews expressed-at -the Cabinet,  shouldhave a free hand, to make the bestarrangement he could when the question.&apos;   arose.
.The Cabinet were reminded by the Secretary ofState for India, who had b&apos;:?en Attorney-General at thetime,, that the Am.erloan fleet had co-operated with theEritish fleet in enforcing the whole of the measures for putting economic pressure on Germany, known as the&quot;blockade&quot;&apos;, and that this fact could be utilised:tostrengthen our case if, notwithstanding our representa-tions, the United States Government insisted on pressing the claims.SECURITY. 5.

Conference between his jyajesty&apos;s Government and theGovernment of the Irish FreeState (Paper CP.-467 (25)).The Prime Minister reported to the Cabinet&quot; that hehad considered the possibility of a personal discussionwith one Chairman of the Irish Boundary Commission, but had come to the conclusion that this step was undesir-able insomuch as he had learned that the members ofthe Commission had agreed that they would not communi-cate with representatives of the Governments concernedwithout the agreement of the Commission itself.Discussion took place in regard to the passage in cp.-467 (25) to the effect that areas to be transferred from the Free State to Northern Ireland and vice versashould be taken ovsr from British troops, and not fromthe respective polic    forces concerned:    and the&apos;diffi-culties of utilising troops for this purpose wereemph -sized.   It was explained that the discussion atthe Conference with the Irish Free State representatives on October 29th had. been very general in character andhad been conduct.-&apos;d on the  assumption that comparatively small changes would; be made in. the frontier, and thatthe use of British troops would be limited to a fewparti cvlsv points. &quot; - -The Home Secretary stated that the Prime Ministerof North m Ireland had informed him. that if theCommission&apos;s Award were reasonable in. character, hc-would send the representatives of the constituencies
concerned in the Ulster Parliament to their districts to prepare the way for the transfer, and that in that event Sir James craig hoped that the use of troopsmight be  avoided..The suggestion met with favour that the most satis-factory procedure in regard to the announcement of theCommission&apos;s Award should he that they should firstannounce that they had agreed to such-and-such an award and that they proposed to sign and promulgate it ons\ich-and-such a date, which might follow the announcement in ten days or a fortnight.After considerable discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government shouldaccede to the proposal of the commission for a Conference on Thursday,- November19th, if the Free State Government wouldalso accede to it, and that, as soon ashe had as certainsd. the views of the FreeState Government, the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs should instruct theSecretary of the  Cabinet as to the termsof the reply to be made to the IrishBoundary Commission&apos;s letter of November6th:(b) That -a preliminary Conference should bearranged with the representatives of theIrish Free State to take place on-November 18th:(c) That the.Secretary of State for War shouldbe one of the Ministsrs to accompany theSecretary of SJ-ate for &quot;Dominion affairs at the Conference referred to in (b):(d) That at the said Conference the british representatives should resume the dis-cussions on the arrangements for thetransfer of territory, and should pointout that, it was hoped that an orderlysettle  ent co\i.ld be arranged, and thatthe question of the use of British troopsmi-ht. not arise c    They should be preparedto point, out the objections to theemployment of British troops, which hadcoma to their knowl*dge since the Meetingon October 29th, and other new factorsbearing on this question:(e) To take note that the Home secretary was in close touch with the. Prime minister or Northern Ireland and had suggested tohim that &quot;he should be present in london at the time of the  Conferences onNovember 18th and 19th:
(f) That no final decision oould yet be takenin regard to a request made by the PrimeMinister of Northern Ireland for oompen-sation to persons who might feel oompelledto move into Northern Ireland from terri-tory transferred to the Irish Free State;to take note that the Chancellor of the exchequers attitude towards compensation would be one of resistance;    to authorisethe Home Secretary to inform Sir james craig of the precedents which would bocreated by the grant of compensation and the difficulties thereby involved,and to mako the best nso he could in his conversations of the large financialconcessions made to Northern Ireland inrespect of insurance;    end that the HomeSecretary should inquire into the natureof any statements which had been mado inParliament on this subjs ct and circulatethem if he thought fit:(g) That a Cabinet Committee should be set up. to assist tho Secretary of State forDominion Affairs during the present phase of Irish affairs, and should be composed as follows:^-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(In the Chair),The Chencollor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Seoretary of State for Dominion Affairs,Tho Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for India,The Seoretary of State for &quot;War,The Attorney-General,
