FOREIGNPPAIRS .ecurity.he Locarnoonference .previous reference-:Cabinet 47(%5U Con-luaion 4^)1.. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.,after thanking the Prime Minister for the telegram of congratulation he had sent to Locarno on behalf ofthe Cabinet (No.17, of October 15th), gave hiscolleagues an appreciation of the Locarno Conference.He pointed out that the resulting Treaties, whichhad already been circulated by the Foreign Office,,were absolutely within the limits of policy laid downby the Cabinet.   Among the points       emphasized inthe course of a very full statement, Mr austen chamberlain mentioned that France had taken theopportunity to revise her alliances with Poland andCzecho-Slovakia, and to reduce the obligations - on both sides, so that the right to go to war underArticle 15., para.7, of the Covenant &quot;was&apos;/ limited to the case where there was not only a breach of obligation but an actual attack by Germany:that the Germans had tried hard up to the last moment of the Conference to obtain pledges in regard to theevacuation of Cologne and a relaxation in the condi-tions of occupation in the Rhineland;    and, although no auch pledge could be given, it had been made clearthat great efforts would be made both by France andGreat Britain to most German desires in this matter,on the understanding that the Germans played their part and did what was necessary to make this possiblethat on thia subject he hoped to have conversations with the Secretary of State for War and the Chief ofthe Imperial General Staff at an early date:    that,in order to avoid the necessity of   a-  Treaty in fourlanguages, with a risk of misunderstandings arisingowing to the difficulties of translation, he had agreed to accept the French language as the officialtext.   Mr Chamberlain laid stress on the admirableatmosphere..throughout the Conference, which, in
combination with the goneral desire to reach agreement,had led to such satisfactory results .   He also alludedto the tributes which other nations had paid to theBritish share in these proceedings, and to the highposition which this country occupies In Europe at thepresent time.    He expressed especial satisfactionwith the- Eastern settlementsThe Cabinet agreed ---(a) To place on record their high apprecia-tion of the pe*tience and skill whichthe Foreign Secretary had displayedin the negotiations culminating inthe Treaty of Locarno:(b) That a Resolution should be submittedto both houses of Parliament as an authority for the signature of theTreaty of Locarno (which up to thepresent had only been initialled)with a view to its adoption in timefor the signature of the Treaty inLondon on December 1, 1925.
2.   In continuation of the information in regardto the present position of tho French debt negotiationscontained in his Memorandum CP.-438 (25),  theChancellor of the Exchequer read to the Cabinet alatter he had just received from M. Caillaux indicate-ing an early resumption of the negotiations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs asked that care should he taken to avoid December 1st,the day selected for the signature of the Treaty of locarno, and the preceding few days for the conclusionof the French debt negotiations.
3.   In addition to a Memorandum-&quot;by the First Lordof the Admiralty on the closing of Rosyth and PembrokeDockyards (Paper CP.-422 (25)) and a Memorandum on the strategical aspects of the question (.C..I.D. Paper Mo-139-A) which had been before them at the previous meeting, the Cabinet had under consideration the draft minutes (liable to correction)  of the 203rd Meeting ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence, pages 9 to 12., and aMemorandum by Lord Balfour (Paper G..P.-45? (25))..The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that.,at the request of Mr Lloyd George, he had on the-previous day received a deputation from Welsh Membersof Parliament in regard to the closing of Pembroke.The immediate result had been requests for him toreceive Scottish deputations, which he was bound, to do.In the circumstances, the Cabinet agreed -To postpone consideration of the pro-posed reduction of Rosyth and PembrokeDockyards until after the PrimeMinister had received the Scottishdeputations.
j EMPLOYMENTOP EX-ISERVIOS KEN.The Kins&apos;aRoll.4. Th*s Cabinet had before thew a Memorandum bytho Minister of Labour (Paper CP.-426 (25) on thesubject of the employment of disabled ex-Serviceiren.The Cabinet agreed  That the Minister of Labour shouldhave authority to announce that theintention of the Government is toput down for Parliamentary discus-slon, as soon as they can obtainParliamentary time, a resolution in the following terms:-&quot;That, in the opirlon of this house, it is the duty of theGovernment in all government contracts to make provisionfor the employment to thefullest posBible extent ofdisabled ex-Service men and,to this end,  to confine such contracts,  save in exceptional circumstances., to employersenrolled on the Xingfs National oil.&quot;
.  5.   In &quot;addition to the Memorandum by the secretary of State for the Colonies (Paper 414 (.25)) which hadbeen before them at the previous meeting on thesxibject of Iraq., the Cabinet had under consideration a Report by the Chiefs of Staff (O.I.D. Paper No.632-B);the draft Minutes (liable to correction) of the 203rd*Meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence: . a Noteby the Secretary of State for the Colonies, enclosingan extract from a private letter from Router&apos;s Corres-correspondent in Constantinople (Paper CP.-431 (25)):   anda Memorandum by the Seoretary of State for Aircirculating some notes on the Turkish incursions IntoIraq in the Autumn of 1924 (Paper CP.-435 (25)).As the Seoretary of State for Foreign Affairs(who had only arrived in England the previous eveningfrom Locarno) was not yet in a position to express afull and considered opinion on the point raised inthe first Conclusion by the Committee of Imperialdefence, namely, as to the precise position of thiscountry vis-a-vis the League of Nations in the matterof Iraq, the discussion was confined mainly to theline to be taken by the Attorney-General in presenting the British case at the forthcoming meeting of thePermanent Court of International Justice at The Hague,and to the instructions to be given to the HighCommissioner and the Air Officer Commanding as totheir action in the unlikely event of a serio\ieadvance across the Brussels Line by the considerablenumber of Turkish troops now on or near the frontier.
In .thls latter commotion the point was emphasizedthat, the presence of General Laidoner, the represent-ative of the League of Nations on th. e Iraq frontier.,would be an additional safeguard.In connection with the forthcoming session ofthe Permanent Court of Tnt--rnational Justice at TheHague, the Attorney-General submitted three questions for decision:-(i)  Should he argue for a decision that theaward of the Council of the League ofNations should be arbitral and notmediatory?(il) Should he argue for a decision that theCouncil must be unanimous or that It; should decide by a majority?(iii) Should he argue that the representa--   tives of the Interested parties couldnot vote?After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed  (&quot;a) As regards the -Attorney-General-&apos; squestions., that the reply to (i) and(lit) should be In the affirmative: ctrn^3&amp;^g33g5sas^^ if (iii)were decided against the Attorney-Generaltlsra it would be most desirable to get an opinion from the- Court that theCouncil might decide by a majority,as otherwise no decision would bepossible:(b) That, with a view to early considerationby the Cabinet of British policy in Iraq,the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should circulate a memorandum as to the position of Groat Britainunder the Covenant vis-a-vis the league in this matter:(c) That recommendation (.2) by the Committeeof Imperial Defence,  &quot;That we must avoidbeing drawn into extensive militaryoperations in Iraq&quot; should be approved:(d) That the Secretaries of State for theColonies and Air should inform the HighCommissioner and the Air Officer Command-ing, respectively, that in the event ofa oonsplcuous breach of the frontier,involving a definite advance across the brussels line by a Turkish organisedmilitary force which menaces invasion of Iraq, the Air Officer Commandingshould be authorised to take immediate
action within.reasonable reach ofhis aircraft, and even across thefrontier if this ia a military necessity, but that such action should on no account be taken inconsequence of a small frontierincident i(e) That the instructions to the air officer Commanding, in execution ofthis decision, should be shown tothe Foreign Secretary and colonial secretary before despatch:(f) That the. Secretary of State for air should send to the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs particulars as tothe extent to which, the. Adana-Nisibinrailway is being used for Turkishtroop movements, and should suggestin what way the French Governmentcould assist.Whitehall Gardens, S,WD1,October 21, 1925.
