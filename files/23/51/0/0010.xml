1 0 f*I rC 0The Cabinet met, as a matter of urgency, toconsider the situation arising out of the negotiations between the Ministers nominated by the Cabinet attheir previous Meeting and Ministers of the IrishFree State and Northern Ireland respectively.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and his collea-guea reported the results of their conversations.Agreement had been reached with Sir James Craigand the representatives of the Irish Free State on-the following pointsla   That the existing boundary shallbe left undisturbed.%o    (See bQlow0)30    That the cases of prisoners eon-viewed in Northern Ireland inrespect of offences during theperiod of disturbance shall be reviewed by the Eritish Govern-ment, whose decision in eachcase shall be accepted by theGovernment of Northern Ireland.4.    That the powers of the Councilof Ireland in Northern Irelandshall be transferred to the parliament and Government ofNorthern Ireland, and the Govern-ments of the Irish Free State and-of Northern Ireland shall meet together as and when necessaryfor the purpose of consideringmatters of common interestarising out of or connected withthe exercise and administrationof the said powers.In addition, a personal understanding had been arrived at between Sir James Craig and the IrishFree State representatives for more friendly co-operation, but this could not be put in writing.The Irish Free State, however, were making no furtherclaims upon Sir James Craig in regard to the treatmentof Roman Catholics and other internal affairs inNorthern Ireland.
Regarding the outstanding point, 2 (left&quot;blank above),  the Irish. Free State representativesdemanded the waiver of Clause 5 of the Irish Treaty,on the ground of -(i) The consequences of Article 12;(ii)  The poverty of Southern Ireland,in regard to which Impressivefacts and figures were given tothe Cabinet by the British repre-sentatives:(ill)  Their own political existence and the certainty that if this Remandwere hot conceded they would besucceeded by some Government whichwould be less likely to stand bythe Treaty and which might makethe Oath optional, with incalcu-lable consequences.The Irish Free State representatives had rejected as totally inadequate to the situation theproposal for a moratorium, notwithstanding that thisproposal logically deprived the poverty argument ofIts value.    They were satisfied, however, that thiswould not enable their Government to maintain its position.    They offered the following alternatives:--(i)  In satisfaction of all British claims under Article 5 of the Irish Treaty,to pay to the British Exchequer annual payments of  250,000 for 60 years.The total amount thus paid would be 15,000,000, the present value of whichwas  6,000,000.    The various outstanding questions between them and the treasury to remain unaffected:or, alternatively,(II) To reimburse the British Governmentfor all their compensation payments under the &quot;-Vood-Rentoh Awards, plus asum of 10 per cent, additional on allpost-truce Awards made by the Courtsunder the Damage to Property Act, 1923.The method of payment to be further discussed, the various outstanding questions being likewise unaffected.Payments under this alternative to be neitnermore nor loss in terms of present value thanthe total of alternative (I)..
Tho British Ministers who had been concerned in thenegotiations were not unanimous as to the precise course tobe followed.    But two out of the threo wore satisfied that,having regard to .the importance of avoiding political ohaosin Ireland; to the very difficult state of the Irishfinances (duo partly, perhaps to inoxperionced administra-tion, but mainly to civil war)% to the certainty that noconsiderable proportion of tho British claims under Article5 of the Irish Treaty (estimated at, say, IOO to 150 millions)could ever be realised; that a big political change in theIrish Free State might result in the cessation of payments of pensions to the Royal Irish Constabulary etc. now madeby then; and, above all, to the importance of a final settlement, the British Government would be well advised to conclude a settlement basod on one or other of the abovealternatives or on some corresponding arrangement.One suggestion made to the Cabinet was that theirrepresentatives should be authorised to resume the negotia-tions, with authority to nako suooessivo proposals as follows(i) To make a counter offer which, thoughit would abate our claims without being accepted, might ease the situation.This oounter offer to be based on thefact that the Irish Free State arc nowpaying approximately  1,600,000 a year in Royal Irish Constabulary and other civil pensions arising out of transference of power, and that this total of oourseruns off gradually like our own war pen-siono.    Tho British Government woulddeclare that, v/hen making their full oaseat the arbitration under Article 5 of theIrish treaty, with or without moratorium,thoy would not claim from the Irish FreeState at any time in any year a largersum than the extinguished portion of this total sum of  1,600,000.    Thus tho FreeState would never have to pay more thanthey do now:(ii) If the above wore rejected, to reduoetho sum of  1,600,000 to  1,000,000,the offer being otherwise the same:
(iii) If the above were refused, toendeavour to reach agreement onthe basis of alternative (II)above, but to try and get thebest bargain possible.The Cabinet were reminded by one of the signatories of the Irish Treaty that one of theprincipal reasons for the insertion of Article 5had been that if the Irish Free State were relieved of all debt, its financial and fiscal situation would be so favourable as compared with that ofGreat Britain as to attract capital and industry from this country in order to escape taxation.Owing to civil war and other causes, however, thisanticipation had not been realised, and the financialposition of Southern Ireland was not likely to recover as soon as that of Great Britain.After a careful consideration of the weightyarguments for and against the acceptance of theproposals of the Irish Free State Government,   theCabinet agreed (by a large majority) -(a) That the present opportunity for removing the greatest obstacles toa permanent settlerrant in Irelandmust not be lost, and that,with thissupreme object in view,  the waivingof a great part of the legal claims of Great Britain under Article 5 ofthe Irish Treaty was justified&apos;:(b) That the Chancellor of the exchequer should be authorisedto conclude an agreement on the roostfavourable terms    he&apos; could secure,based on the second of th-.- alterna-tives proposed by the representativesof the Irish Free State Governrent,narely, that of reimbursement of theBritish. Government for all theircompensation payments und r theWood-Renton Awards, plus a sum of10 per cent, additional on allpost-truce awards made by the Courtsunder the Damage to Property Act,  1933(Alternative (II) above):(c) That, with a view to the elimination of as many as possible of the potentialcauses of friction with the Irish
Free State, the Chancellor of theExchequer should do his utmostbefore the conclusion of the present negotiations to obtain a settlementof the outstanding cases between that Government and the Treasury:(d) That the agreement to be signed bythe representatives of the Govern-ments concerned should be drawn upin such form as to make clear tothe world that the sacrifices madeby the three parties, (including thefinancial sacrifices on the part ofGreat Britain) were part of a commoneffort in the supreme interest of a lasting settlement.a     o      o      o2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1,December 2,  1925.-5-
