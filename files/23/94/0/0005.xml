mHE LATE EARL 1. The Prime Minister said that he had received anOP OXFORD ANDACQJXITH. influential Deputation, which included representativesof the Opposition Parties and other distinguished(previous reference: people,, urging that a Memorial should he erected to cabinet 22 (33)Conclusion 7)     the late Earl of Oxford and Asquith within theprecincts of the House of Commons.    In view of thetime that had passed since the death o^ the Earl ofOxford and Asquith he thought that, no opposition was likely to be raised.   He read to his colleagues thedraft of a Resolution which, subject to their approval,he proposed to move in the House of Commons.In reply to the Lord President of the Council hesaid that no action was required by the Mouse of lords in this matter.mhe Cabinet agreed  To approve the draft of a resolution to be moved, by the Prime Minister inthe House of Commons in favour of a memorial to the late Earl of oxford and Asquith, to be provided at thepublic expense, within the precinctsof Parliament,
2.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that further enquiry was necessary to clear upcertain points arising out of General Franco1s Noteabout indiscriminate bombing.    In these circumstances he proposed that an interim statement should be madein Parliament the seme day clearing up certain points and saying, that we were still awaiting a reply fromGeneral Franco1s Government on others.   He would havethe draft o^ a. st.Ptem.ent ready for the Prime Minister&apos;consideration a^ter the Cabinet.The Cabinet approved, this course.
ITALY. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsRelations celled, attention to a telegram that had arrived fromtith. ,the Earl of Perth on the previous evening (Rome tele-(Previous gram No. 141 Saving, of 12th July) giving an accountReference:Cabinet 31      of an interview he had had with the Italian Foreign(38) , Con-clusion 5.)     Minister, at which he had communicated the gist ofF/R.4^(3tf)k (the Foreign Secretary&apos;s) telegram No. 48 Saving,of the 9th July, sent as the result of the discussion at the Cabinet referred to in the margin, commenting on the memorandum in which Sign or Mussolini had expressed dissatisfaction with our inability to ratify the Anglo-Italian Agreement.    Count Ciano&apos;s observationshad been brief and not of a very helpful character, and hehad indicated that the British comments were not likely  tocreate a pleasant effect on Signor Mussolini.   Therewas nothing to be done in this matter except to awaitSignor Mussolini&apos;s reactions.The Foreign Secretary also drew attention to atelegram he had sent to the Earl of Perth (No.370 ofthe 12th July) informing him that the nationalist government in Spain were satisfied that the French hadloyally closed their frontier with Barcelona, and asking the Ambassador to inform Count Ciano accordingly andto suggest to him that care should be taken to seethat no action was taken on the Italian side whichmight force the French Government to relax theirvigilance on the frontier.   He had sent this telegrambecause he had received information that the italians had sent some supplies to Spain, though not on a verylarge scale, and he did not want the French Government,who half probably also received the same information,to think that we were behaving, differently towardsItaly than towards France in this matter.   French
public opinion at the present time had. b-e^rn-T^ritecL:upto a state of rather strained nerves.    There was atendency in Prance to suggest that this country wasturning from Prance towards Italy,    ^he only thing tohe done was to send, a reply of a sedative nature toany representations on the subject, one of his objectsbeing to avert the risk tha.t the French government might reopen the Spanish frontier,.
4. In reply to a question, the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs sai^ that he had been discussing with the Earl of Plymouth how soon it would be possibleto press the contending Governments in Spain for their reply about the ^on-Tntervention Agreement for thewithdrawal of foreign voluntary volunteers .   He thought it would,be necessary to give them about a week in which toF-R-35C$4)    study the document.^he President of the Poard of Education said thatthe Spanish translation was due to reach the two^he Non-intervention$ Agreement.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(38), Con-clusion 1.)Governments the same daySPAIN.
SPAIN. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidPossible Appeal    that he ha.^ been considering whether it was worthfor an Armis-tiee, while to draft an appeal to the contending sides in spain to stop the war.    Such an appeal would, of(previous reference: course, be based on grounds of humanity, Christianity,Cabinet 29(38), Con- the peace of the world, and so forth.   He fearer&quot; thatelusion 4.)it would not. be likely to succeed, but it would strengthen the mor^l position of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and might put them in a position to takehelpful action later on.   He did not ask for a decision by the Cabinet now,   All he wanted, was that hiscolleagues should turn the idea over in their mindsso thet they would be prepared to discuss the matterif he should raise it before the Recess./
I     SPAIN. 6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read.LhP Attitude        to the Cabinet extracts from a letter received bytowards thetinited Kingdom Sir Alexander Cadogan from Mr E*A, Keeling, the Britishin FrankistSpain, Consul-Genera 1 at Tangier, on a recent trip he had had.through Spain.   After a reference to a book on theSpanish War, Mr x&quot;eeling&apos;s letter continued, as follows&quot;On one point the author is wrong   his reference to the general anti-british feeling.    It existed to some extentduring the period of Bilbao and Santander,but during all our journey our experiencewas quite&quot;the contrary.   From beginning to end. the Nationalist Authorities wentout of their way to show us every courtesyand. kindness...........&quot;&quot;At Algeciras we were met by the military governor, with a bouquet for my wife (this happened wherever we went!) who arrangedour landing and transit. At Seville thebest rooms in the hotel were requisitionedfor us by the authorities, who would, nothear of any payment ..........&quot;&quot;During all our stay in Andalusia we harf a major (and well-known journalist) of the african Bureau attached to us as cicerone.At Granada the General in charge of thefront and the Governor immediatelyexpressed, their regret that owing to thefact that our visit was informal theycould, not give us a. banquet, so theyarranger! a party of &apos;gitanas&apos;  and supperat which all the notabilities of the townassisted.   A very &apos;tough&apos;   Italian Fascistmission arrived, the same evening for anofficial visit to begin the following day and wanted, to join our party.   The Generalflatly refused and sent back word that theparty was a private one for the british minister in mangier, and ad^ed. to me thathe was delighted to have an opportunityof showing the Italians they could not goabout giving orders .       At Anteguera, onthe way to Granada, the General commanding the Foreign Legion on that front apologisedfor not being able to have a review of theLegion for us, but stopped their Sundayfootball match and. made them march past and sing the songs of the f:Tercio&apos; .    Theonly blot on the proceedings was that theband, played. &apos; Giovinezza&apos;  for us when weleft, being the only foreign march they knew and. which they were rehearsing forthe visit of the same Fascist mission.Tf we had had. time to extend, our visit toother towns, at least in the south, Ihave no doubt we should have had the same
reception, which was quite spontaneousand genuine.    I was surprised myself.T expected to find them merely polite.Spaniards are naturally disposed tolike English people, and. I am quite sure our policy of neutrality, thoughat moments it has infuriated both sides,can be turned to our advantage in theend, though I can already see signs of opposition and  jealousy from theItalians...........&quot;
CENTRAL EUROPE.7 .The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCzechoslovakia.said that information as to the progress of negptia-tions in Czechoslovakia, was somewhat  conflicting.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(58), Con-elusion 4.)On the previous day he had seen a report receivedby Sir Robert Vansittart indicating that Herr Henleinwas rather discouraged at the lack of progress.    Onthe other hand., the latest reports from the BritishMinisterat Prague were of rather a more Lcpefal character.He expected, to see the Czechoslovak Minister thesame afternoon in order to obtain further information,He felt that the only thing to be done was to continue   -to maintain pressure on Dr. Benes, both directly and.through the French Government.He had also hesrd disquieting hints to the effectthat Germany was working up for a rapid  coup at  theend of August, and that Herr von Ribbentrop was in an aggressive mood..The Prime Minister uttered a ca.vea t agains t givingtoo much credence to unchecked reports from non-official sources,-   He himself had seen His Ma.jesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin, who gave an a.account of theattitude of the German Government that was notdiscouraging.    Apparently Field-Marshal Goering wasin a more chastened mood and wa.s inclined to complainthat our attitude was too bellicose.
8.     In accordance with the Conclusion mentionedin the margin, the Cabinet resumed their discussion ofthe question whether financial support should beprovided to China, and again had before them thefollowing documents:-A memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (cp 152 (38)):A memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. 157 (38)).The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, as requested at the meeting of theCabinet referred to in the margin, he had seen theAmerican Ambassador who had not adopted an encouragingattitude on the prospects of collaboration by hisGovernment in giving financial assistance to China,although he had been generous in his expressions of sympathy with our attitude.     Both he and the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs, he thought, had soundedthe Australian High Commissioner (Mr. Bruce) whohad expressed the clear opinion that Australian publicopinion would be in favour of a loan to China if this were practicable, but not if it would involve risk of trouble with Japan.     He himself had replied that thiswas exactly our own attitude.     He had had examined thesuggestion for an advance based on a purchase of wolfram.     He thought this project could be dressed upto a certain extent, but he could not escape theconclusion that if anything effective was to be done, itmust be by means of a direct loan.      The real difficulty was the uncertainty firstly, as to whether the proposedloan would prove sufficient;    secondly, as to how far weshould be committing ourselves by a loan;    thirdly,whether a collapse in China would of certainty take place if we did not make a loan, and fourthly, as to what would be
the Japanese reactions.      In all this uncertainty, hecould quite understand that opinion was likely to hedivided on this matter.     He himself was not much impressed by Sir Robert Craigie&apos;s recent telegrams as tothe improved attitude of the Japanese Government towards this country, which was not likely to affect the long-rangepolicy of Japan,,     He did recognise, however, the danger that would arise if the Japanese Government reactedbadly to a loan to China, more particularly if they tooksome action ,  for example, against Hong Kong, to which wecould make no effective reply.     He was given to understandthat some time ago when a question had arisen of sending afleet to China, ten or twelve capital ships had beendeemed necessary.     That would be a grave risk to take inthe present European situation with Signor Mussolini in acurious and somewhat inexplicable frame of mind and witha somewhat critical situation in Central Europe.     Inthese circumstances, he was rather impressed by theAmerican Ambassador&apos;s comment &quot;that the British Empirehad enough trouble on its hands at the moment withoutopinion, which he did with great reluctance, he wouldhave to say that his mind was very much influenced bythe Italian situation and he would advise against takingthe risk of an adverse reaction in Japan.     He had considered the possibility of a tentative approach to theJapanese Government in order to ascertain what theirreaction was likely to be.     He thought, however, that noresult was likely to ensue except discredit.     If theJapanese reacted badly, we should be in a worse position than before.Foreign Secretary suggested that he should not make any approach to the Japanese Government, but that he should if he had to give his ownIf the Cabinet decided not to make the loan,  the
inform the Chinese Ambassador that he had examined thequestion of a possible advance;    that he had ascertained thatthe Chinese had no satisfactory commercial security to offer and that any plan that might be dressed up to meet thedifficulty would be seen through,,     He thought that   was abetter course than to adopt a stiff line with the Japanese.He was informed that if he were to convey a decision ofthis kind to the Chinese, they would probably default ontheir foreign loans, but he did not know how much freemoney this would put at their disposal:   he believed thatthe amount would not be large.     If China defaulted, it was anticipated that the Japanese would denounce the customsagreement.     If the Cabinet decided not to assist the  Chinese and they   were     to default, he hoped that we should not be too harsh with them on that account.The President of the Board of Trade said thaton the previous evening he had been visited by a Member ofParliament, who was the Director of a British firm concernedin Chinese business.     The Member had reported to him thatMr. Wellington Koo had asked if his firm would co-ordinateall their purchases in different parts of the world.     in doing so, Mr. Koo had impressed him with the strength ofthe Chinese financial position and their ability to pay for purchases in all parts of the world.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported theview of the Foreign Secretary.      The great difficulty in reaching a decision was the number of unpredictable factors in the situation,     But for that very reason, he thought the Cabinet ought not to be too despondent of the prospects.It was by no means certain that Japan, even if successful in the war, could thereafter deal with so vast an area of territory as was involved,to our exclusion.     Neither was it certain that China could be forced to collapse.      In
addition, all his information was to the effect that a loan of  20 millions would not prove sufficient.     he supported his remarks by summarising memoranda he hadreceived both from Sir Charles Addis, who had very long experience of China, and from the Bank of England.     Heshared the disappointment and distress of the foreign secretary in this matter and agreed in the course he proposed,,The Secretary of State for India recalled that,at the meeting of the Cabinet referred to in the margin, hehad given some reasons in favour of the proposal.     while he did not feel it possible to dissent from the foreign secretary&apos;s deductions, he felt bound to point out thatcontinued inaction was not increasing our prestige in theworld at large.      In support of this, he quoted an opinion-he had received as to the danger that Siam, though stillfriendly to this country, would in the event of a war between Japan and ourselves &quot;sit on the fence&quot; and onlycome down on the side of the winner:    also from pandit Nehruwho had told him that he had found people on the continent of Europe expressing doubt as to whether we were in aposition to take a strong line, though he had noticed thaton two occasions when we had done so, the results had be satisfactory, namely, in the case of the -Nyon agreement and the recent threat to Czecho-Slovakia.The Prime Minister recalled that, at the previous discussion on this question, he had expressed doubtsrather similar to those of Sir Charles Addis.     He was evenmore strongly impressed by the considerations arising outof the state of Europe0     It was his conviction that thiswas not the moment to embark on a policy calculated toproduce reactions in Germany and Italy which would force usto face the dilemma of choosing between the risks of conflict
ana.   inaction. Consequently, he welcomed theadvice of the Foreign Secretary.     Referring to the remarksof the Secretary of State for India, he agreed that Siamwas likely, in the event of an Anglo-Japanese conflict, to&quot;sit on the fence&quot; and only to come down on the side of thewinner.     That, however, only showed the danger of a challenge to Japan, which might not produce the desiredeffect.     He agreed also with what Pandit Nehru had said.It was, however, wrong to draw the conclusion that, becauseon certain carefully selected occasions we had adopted a firm attitude, we should necessarily repeat it on occasions that were less suitable.     It was necessary tobear in mind in these matters that our defensive arrangements were still far from complete.The Secretary of State for the Colonies supported theviews of the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister and thegrounds on which they were advocated.   He thought that our prestige in the world, though not high, was rising and in support ofthis he instanced the confidence of the Government of theUnited States of America in our foreign policy.The Cabinet agreed:(a) That, in view of the serious international situation and the reactions that mightbe caused first on Japan and subsequentlyin Europe by the adoption of theproposals in C.P. 152 (38) for givingfinancial support to China, those proposals should not be adopted:(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should make an appropriatecommunication to the Chinese ambassador on the lines suggested by him in thediscussion summarised above.
PALESTINE. 9.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies said(Previous that reports from Palestine of terrorism on therefore reference e:Cabinet . previous day were rather less/than on recent occasions.31(38), Con- ^elusion 8.)   Without building on this, he hoped that it might beFR.$3(3%)s:   the beginning of a new situation.    Reinforcements,of which he gave some particulars,. were steadilycoming into Palestine. . In addition, arrangements -ha4.been. ma-de for recruiting 200 to 250 new police.    Withthese reinforcements of troops and police, he hopedthat it would be possible to check terrorism.    sir charles Teggart, with whom he had had a long talk,thought that with these reinforcements the authorities would be able to accomplish this task.    Consequentlyawhile by no means confident   that terrorism would be overcome in the early future, he hoped it would bepossible gradually to reduce it.    He was in touch withall kinds of people about the future of. Palestine,including Dr. Weizmann and Dr.  Tannus, the principalArab Representative in London.    The moment had not-oo-m&amp;to consider the Government1s permanent policy inPalestine.    This would have to await the return of thelA Cr9-tLkjLtX.cC-royal Commission early in August.    He himself proposedto remain near London during August in order to keepin touch ^^t&amp; with the -Royal Commission and -febeChi of o of Q-oaf^   He thought it would hardly bepossible for the Cabinet to settle their permanentpolicy before the Autumn
10.    In accordance with the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet resumed their discussion onthe subject of the Military Mission to Portugal, andhad before them the following documents a Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (C-P.  156(38)) circulating copies of a ForeignOffice Memorandum (C-I.D.  Paper No.  1440-B)together v/ith the relevant extract fromthe draft Minutes of the 328th Meeting ofthe Committee of Imperial Defence(Minute 3):A Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 163 (38))circulating copies of a translation of a lecture given by General vonReichenau, Commander of the 4th ArmyGroup at Leipzig, to National Socialistleaders at Leipzig, on the subject of theGerman attitude towards events in spain and Portugal:A Memorandum by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence (C.P.  164 (38))reporting the results of a discussion ofthe above documents with the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee and the permanent under Secretary of State, Foreign Office(in conformity with Conclusion 10 (c) ofthe previous Meeting) and containingrec ommend at ions.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence gave the Cabinet a summary of his proposals.    In thediscussion which ensued certain verbal amendments were proposed and adopted as shown in the Conclusionsset forth below.    The Minister explained thatit had only been possible to assemble the Chiefs ofStaff Committee two days before, and there had not been time to give great precision to the wording.    Somelatitude might be required in this respect if andwhen the proposals were put into effect.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the Conclusion of the Committee ofImperial Defence in favour of the early withdrawalof the Mission (328th Meeting,  Conclusion (e)) wouldrequire some modification.
The Secretary of State for War felt some doubt asto the desirability of the proposal to make earlierdehvery of the 4   3, 7-inch training equipments includedin the token offer already made to Dr.  Salazar.    he agreed with an observation made by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs that so small an offer wasnot likely to have much effect with Dr.  Salazar.    Itwould, however, be criticised in Parliament, where theexport of aeroplanes had already been the subject ofadverse c ommentoOn the whole, however, the view of the cabinet was that the proposal for earlier delivery of the 43.7-inch equipments should stand.The Chancellor of the Exchequer,  referring to aproposal in Co P.  164(38) that if necessary some financial concession such as deferred payments might bemade to Portugal if this was likely to tip the scalebetween keeping that country within our orbit and the partial surrender of our position to Germany, warned theCabinet that if tbis meant doing the same for Portugal-as had already beun done for Turkey, an Act of parliament would be necessaryoThe Prime Minister said that if legislation was involved, this concession would probably prove impracticable.)A suggestion -vas made that it would be better to postpone the decision on this point until it was known whether thf question had been raised in the conversations and,  if so, what  it involved.    His Majesty&apos;s ambassador should be instructed,  if Dr.  Salazar raised this matter,to pass it on.
The Cabinet agreed:-(a) To approve in principle the proposals in C.p.  164(38),  subject to such verbalamendments as might be found necessary,including those incorporated inConclusion (b). ;(b) That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbonshould be instructed to approachDr.  Salazar, as already proposed bythe Committee of  Imperial Defence,  andshould be authorised to propose the giving by His Majesty&apos;s Government inthe United Kingdom of an assurance that,provided the circumstances of our owndefensive situation-^- permit,  we shouldbe prepared to assist Portugal in       ^ ^ Jr^xsfulfilment of our Treaty obligations^.(c) That if Dr.  Salazar&apos;s reactions to theproposal in (b) are favourable, HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador should suggestthat the question should form thesubject of discussion by the british military Mission, who should concerttheir views with the PortugueseAuthorities as to the possible scale of attack on Portugal,  and the airforces required to meet it, togetherwith aerodrome and other necessary facilities.(d) That the Military Mission should be instructed, in carrying out this proposal,to take into account the point raised in paragraph 12 of C.P. 164 (38), namely,the importance of a base in Portugalfrom which our own Air Forces could operate as a counter to activities of possible enemy Air Forces operating from bases in Spanish territory againstthe interests of ourselves,  e. g.Gibraltar,  or shipping,  or our allies.(e) That if the contingent offer to be madeby His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador under (b)above of an assurance of assistance by Air Forces in addition to Naval Forcesin fulfilment of our Treaty obligationsfails  to influence Dr.  Salazar in afavourable  direction,  our ambassador should be authorised to throw out a&apos;  suggestion, as from himself,  that HisMajesty&apos;s Government might possibly beprepared to make earlier delivery of theThe words underlined take the place of thewords &quot;at home&quot;.The words underlined take the place of thewords &quot;in time of war&quot;.
4   3.7-inch training equipments includedin a token offer already made to Dr. Salazar,to which no reply has yet been received.(f) That the recommendation of the Committee ofImperial Defence as to the early withdrawalof the Mission (Conclusion (e) of the328th Meeting) should be cancelled, andthat instructions should be sent to theMission to remain in Lisbon to carry outthe policy set forth in the above decisions.(g) That His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Lisbonshould be instructed that if Dr. Salazarshould raise the question of some financial concession such as deferredpayments, he should undertake to refer it to London.(h) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should issue the necessary instructions both to His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Portugal and to theMilitary Mission, with full latitudeto vary as necessary the languageadopted in CP.  164 (38) and the above conclusions.
THE VAN ZEELANDREPORT .11-The Cabinet had before them the Report (CP-r-167(38)) of an Inter-Departmental Committee on M. vanZeeland.&apos;s Report (Cmd.5648),  circulated for theirReport of later-DepartmentalCommittee. information on the instructions of the Prime Minister.(previous reference:Cabinet 3(28), Con-elusion 6(c) .)The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to thefollowing passages in the Report:-&quot;4............. The fundamental difficultyin the way of securing closer inter-national collaboration on economic andfinancial questions is that the totali-tarian States have deliberately adopted a policy of s elf --sufficiency for politicaland military as much as for economic reasons, and. they will not easily bedeflected from this policy unlessthe democratic countries are prepared,to offer the&quot;1 very substantial induce-rDents .    In any case, these lattercountries cannot do so without adequateguarantees that the assistance thusprovided will not be used, by the totali-tarian States mainly to strengthen their military position.   At the present momentneither of these conditions appearscapable of fulfilment.5.   We are bound to recognise that, in thesecircumstances, progress on the lines ofthe Van Zeeland. Report may not be prac-ticable, at any rate in the immediatefuture........  It. will be for ministers to determine whether or not progress can be made under existing conditions.&quot;&quot;112.    Our general conclusions on this sectionof the Report as summarised in paragraph85 are  (b)  that if no further major politicaldisturbances oscur and if the presentfinancia.1 and economic negotiationswith Germany lead to a satisfactory agreement, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould  consider afresh with theFrench Government whether it isadvisable to invite M. van Zeelandto pursue his enquiries as to theattitude of Germany,  Italy, and theunited States of America, to his report.&quot;In the circumstances it was felt that, no usefulaction could be taken at the moment .mhe Cabinet took note of the Reportattached to CP.-167 (38).
12.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs ( CP.-160 (38))on the Question of the Transfer to the Union of theGovernment of the High Commission Territories inSouth Africa, in which he sought his colleagues&apos;approval to the draft instructions to Resident Com-missloners (Appendix B) and to the line which it wassuggested Sir William Clark should take with general hertzog as to the inclusion of Document &quot;E&quot; , relatingto the Union Government&apos;s Native Policy as a whole,among the other documents to be communicated to theinhabitants of the territories .The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs gave the Cabinet a. summary of his proposals.   Referring to appendix &quot;B&quot; he said that, this might appear somewhatcold in tone, but the intention was to supplement it by means of a. private letter from the High CommissionerThe Secretary of State for the Colonies expressed,agreement in the proposals of the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs.   He hoped that it would bepossible to obtain withdrawal of Document &quot;E&quot;, butagreed that if this should be impossible the proposal in paragraph 6 of CP.-150 (38) was an ingeniousalternative which would make clear that the officersof the Administration of the Territories were not themselves associated with memorandum &quot;E&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer drew attentionto the following phrase at the end of paragraph 3 of appendix &quot;B&quot;&quot;namely, that transfer should, not takepla.ce until, the wishes of the natives of the Territories had been most care-fully considered an^ that before suchtransfer the United, kingdom parliament should be given the fullest opportunityof expressing its views,&quot;
He asked If this was couched in the terms of the pledges given during the passage of the South Africa Bill tothe United Kingdom Parliament of 1909.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat he was almost certain that this was the phraseologythen used, but he would check the wording.The Cabinet agreed  (a.)  mo approve the proposals of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs as set forth in C.P.-150 (38) :(b) That the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should assure himself that the wording of the last sentence of para-graph 3 of Appendix &quot;B&quot;, quoted above,was in exact concord with the pledges given during the passage of the South.Africa. Bill to the Unites VirvaaomParliament of 190-9.
Initsd KINGDON- IS^The Cabinet had under consideration a MemorandumffjSTRALTA TRADEAGREEMENTo by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs (CP.-l&amp;ision of. 162 (38))  containing a summary of the recent difficultlis cuss ions with   but friendly preliminary and exploratory discussionsAustralian Dele-lation. with the Delegation from the Commonwealth of Australiafle. 33/38)7.&apos;     on the question of the possible revision of theUnited Kingdom-Australia Trade Agreement concluded at ottawa, in 1932.   As a result of private conversations ,however, matters had now advanced, to a position wherethe Commonwealth Delegation realised the difficultiesin the way of any alternative arrangement and. had themselves proposed that the existing Ottawa agreement should  continue in operation for the time being.Accordingly there was now in preparation a joint-statement^, drafted, on a broadcasting.d basis and couched inmost friendly terms, indicating how this  conclusionarises from a review of the respective interests involved which include other than purely commercial considerations) and. the factors underlying theposition,    It was hoped, that this statement would(l) emphasise the importance of co-operationbetween the United Kingdom and Australia,(2) recognise the need, on the one hand, forthe progressive development of Australia,and, on the other hand, for the fullmaintenance of United Kingdom export trade,(3)  contain an undertaking on the part of theCommonwealth Government to examine thepossibility of granting us a. suitable listof maximum duties.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that developments daring the past week hadnot been quite so satisfactory.    On Thursday theproposed, draft statement had. been discussed, with sir Earle Page and Mr Menzies,    ^he latter had suggested, various amendments of detail which had given the impression that the fl^f* was accepted in-23-
principle.    On Monday Sir Earle Page had begun bya tat Ing that the 64. f fdcult ieet had been narrowed down^and it had. been left to the President of the Board ofTrade and Mr Menzies to/^ce^le-te-t-he-d-ra.f-t.   At theend of that Meeting Mr Menzies had suddenly announcedthat he disagreed with the document as a whole.Subsequently he had. sent a fresh draft which was a purely ex parte statement of the Australian case,ignoring and leaving out- of account our own difficul-ties .    The only thing to be done was for       himself to see Sir Earle Page and to try and get back to theoriginal draft.The Prime Minister suggested that the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs should report at thenext regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet .
BTTTLDING 14. The Lord Chancellor recalled that when the societies ,matter of Building Societies had last been discussed(previous by the Cabinet it had been assumed that Judgment was reference:Cabinet 31       likely to be Given in the Chancery Court before thef38), Con-clusion 12.)    end of the present Session.   Amendments to the Pleadings,5^3^/0.   however, had been found necessary, and in all probabilitythe case could not come up during the present Sittings.This  change in the situation was not entirely satis-factory, because it meant that the case might be taken before Parliament met again.    If, as was by no means a. certainty, Judgment was given against the building societies, this would, involve a panic both among theBuilding Societies and those financially interested.Tha.t would be detrimental to the public interest,because it would lead to a cessation of the importantbuilding operations carried out by the Societies.   Upto now it had been proposed to deal with this situation by means of, first, a skeleton Bill to enable theBuilding Societies to continue temporarily, and,second, more comprehensive legislation which couldonly be undertaken after full enquiry.   The present-dang^rw-TT8^--th^tt---J^d-gment. might be delivered whileParliament was not sitting, in which case the skeletonBill could not immediately be introduced.   He was inclined to think that in that event the best plan would be to make an announcement that legislation would be introduced as soon as Parliament met.A suggestion was made that the difficulty might be surmounted by an Appeal.The Lor^ Chancellor said that this was a possibility,but an Appeal would not prevent panic.    The Judgmentby the Chancery Court might be sufficient to stop moneybeing lent to the Societies.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said the real difficulty was the uncertainty as to what would be thenature of the Judgment, since the character of theBill would have to depend, to a certain extent upon that.   He suggested that at the moment no decision should be taken in favour of two Bills.   He thoughtthat it was worth while exploring the possibility of taking action by means of a. single Bill in October orNovember in the event of 8. Judgment, against theBuilding Societies.   This might be considered by theCabinet Committee.The Lor^ Chancellor said that the Government Depart-ments had explored, the kind of Bill that would berequired .   He understood, that they had found, thematter so complex and difficult that it was doubtful if a single Bill could be prepared in the time, orwhether it would be possible to get it through theHouse of Commons sufficiently rapidly.   He a.greed,however, that the Cabinet Committee might considerthe question.The Cabinet agreed.  (a) That if Judgment should be deliveredbefore the Cabinet was in regularsession, the Prime Minister should,have authority to issue a. statement to the effect that the subject would,be dealt with as soon as Parliamentmet:(b) ^hat in the meanwhile the CabinetCommittee should consider the questionof whether, in the event of Judgmentbeing postponed until the autumn, itwould be possible to meet the situationresulting from a Judgment adverse to theBuilding Societies by mea.ns of a singleBill instead of the two Bills hitherto contemplated . *n
15.  Tn pursuance of the Conclusion mentioned in the margin, the Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C.P.-165 (38))reporting to his colleagues the result of soundingshe had made in the House of Commons, on behalf of thePrime Minister, on the subject of Pensions for Members.So far as the Opposition Parties were concerned,acquiescence if not full support for the scheme pro-posed by the Departmental Committee in Cmd.5624 couldbe counted on, although from the Government side some measure of opposition might be expected.   The chief whip, however, did not anticipate serious vocal opposi-tion to the proposal, and advised that the legislation(which was required in view of the need for authorityto deduct from every Member  12 a year) should besubmitted to a free vote.   The alternative of dispens-ing with legislation and introducing a voluntarypensions scheme was impracticable for several reasor*&amp;-*The Chancellor then drew attention to the followingpoints in the draft Bill:-(a) The persons to whom payments may be madeare restricted to present and future Membersof Parliament (when they cease to be Members)and. their widows :(b) Provision for Trustees to be appointed bythe House of Commons:(c) The limitations on the powers of trustees,set out in the First Schedule.He asked if the Bill should, be introduced, and proceeded with, and whether the dra.ft was appropriate for thepurpose.   He did not think a reference to the Committeeof Home Affairs was necessary.
The Prime Minister said that the labour opposition Party was so anxious to obtain this legislation that they had approached the Parliamentary Secretary tothe Treasury.     At one time it had seemed possible thatarrangements might be made for an adjustment of theParliamentary Programme to enable their wishes to be met.It had then been found that among some of the government supporters there was a strong feeling against the proposal.In the circumstances, he felt that there could be no questionof introducing the necessary legislation before the Recess.The Cabinet agreed:That the Prime Minister, in reply to aquestion that had been put down, should give a non-committal answer indicating that the matter was under consideration and that an announcement would be madein the Autumn0
ISLE OP MAN 16. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by(CUSTOMS) BILL,1938.(previous reference:Cabinet 29(37). Con-conclusion ion 9.)the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.-166 (38))covering a draft Tsle of Man &apos;Customs) Bill, 1938,the object of which was to confirm the Customs Resolu-tions of the Manx Legislature.   After explaining theeffect of the Resolutions the Chancellor stated inhis Memorandum that there vas no reason to anticipate any discussion on the Bill, which should be passed into law before the House rose for the Summer Recess.As there was no convenient Meeting of the Committee ofHome Affairs he sought authority to introduce the Billimmediately and to proceed with it at once, subject toany drafting or other minor amendments that might before und ne o es s a ry.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer as setforth in CP. 166 (38) and summarised above.
