the CABINET. 1.   The Prime Minister said that the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was absent with the King inq France, and that the Minister of Health and theMinister of Agriculture and Fisheries were absent toreceive Honorary Degrees at Edinburgh.In view of the fact that Mr E.E. Bridges was torepla.ee the present Secretary within the next fortnighthe asked the Cabinet to agree that he should be presentwith a view to ensuring continuity of practice in theSecretarial arrangements.This was agreed to.(Mr Bridges entered, the Cabinet Room.)
GERMANY&quot;. 2.   The Prime Minister,  in the absence of theFuture Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, gave theRelationswith. Cabinet particulars as to the visit of CaptainCaptain Wiedemann to the Secretary of State for ForeignWied emann&apos; visit c Affairs in his private house, some of which, mainly inform,an erroneous/ had appeared in the Press.    Some time(previous reference: before, he and. the Foreign Secretary had. heard. that-Cabinet 22(38) , Oon-        Herr Hitler would like to send one of his principalelusion y,*)Ministers to engage in confidential talks in London.Tt had been understood that the Fuhrer had in mindsaid to haveField-Marshal Goering,   The suggestion w^ty come fromCaptain Wiedemann, who was a confidant of Herr Hitler,who sometimes used him for personal missions of various kinds.    The Prime Minister continued that he and theForeign Secretary had agreed that the opportunity ofsuch a visit ought not to be missed, provided theywere satisfied that it was genuine.    They had made enquiries artd had. hcar-s1 thai Captain Wiedemann wascomings/to this  country,    On alighting at the aerodromeCaptain Wiedemann had been recognised by * newspapercorrespondent, but th^t particular newspaper had. not thought it worth while to keep in touch with him.Another newspaper (the &quot;&quot;Daily Herald&quot;) had done so and had published the fact that he had visited thehouse of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The accounts th*t had been published, were so mislead-ing that he had thought it right to give his colleagues the facts .The Prime Minister then read, to the Cabinetextracts from a. note made by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs of his conversation.    Althoughthe Prime Minister condensed some parts of the note,the whole of it. is attached, for convenience ofreference, in the Appendix,
&quot;&quot;he Prime Minister, referring to the &quot;most &quot;bindingassurance&quot; which Captain Wiedemann had been authorisedto give that in present  circumstances the GermanGovernment were planning no kind of forcible action and that &quot;his Government might be able to give an assurance of the kind suggested limited to a definite period&quot;, said that, though it was not in the foreign secretary&apos;s note, he gathered that the period contem-plated. might be one of a year.   He said that theproposed visit ^y Field-Marshal Goering was not likelyto take pie re before the autumn.    In reply to a questionhe said that the propose^ subject of the conversationsoutstanding    ...    ,was to be all questxons/between the two countries,which, of course, would include colonies.In the course of a short discussion the comment wasmade that anything which made for delay in the risk ofan outbreak of war was valuable, and. that the presentmove might provide a reinsurance of the situation inEurope during the next few weeks .The suggestion was made that, it should not benecessary for the Press Department of the Foreign Officeto issue very much information on these matters.    Thecomment was also made that although probably themajority of sensible people in this  country would, beglad of any ac^ion taken to improve relations withGermany, the danger could not be excluded of a hostileattitude towards Field-Marshal Goering by groups ofextremists.The Prime Minister said that he had. been shown and.had cordially approved what the Press Departmentproposed to issue the previous evening.    He added thatthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had givenCaptain Viedemann a message of a strictly non-commit&amp;alcharacter in the course of which he had referred, to the
desirability of an undertaking by both Governments toco-operate in promoting the achievement of a peaceful settlement in Czecho-Slovakia as not only valuable butcalculated to offer a better prospect of a succesful issue to any conversations than might otherwise beexpected in the state of uncertainty which necessarilyprevailed at present.-4-

The Prime Minister, in reply to a question, saidthat he had nothing to add to the information containedin the telegrams that had been circulated to membersof the Cabinet.   At present the negotiations betweenthe Czechoslovak Government and the representatives ofthe Sudeten-Deutsch appeared to be approaching a deadlock.   Probably His Majesty&apos;s Government wouldhave to intervene in some way.

REFUGEES. 4, The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, atThe Evian the request of the Prime Minister, gave the CabinetConference.an account of the recent Meeting at Evian to consider(Previous the problem of emigration from Germany and Austria,Reference:Cabinet 14 which had lasted from July 6th to July l^th.    His(38). Con-clusion 6.) Majesty&apos;s Government had been represented, there byfr.^(3^)^ himself and.,,  sr (3*v5. Sir Michael Paluiret,   An Official Report would shortly be circulated, but the Cabinet would probablybe interested to hear certain confidential informa-tion which it had not been thought appropriate toinclude in the Official Report.The Meeting had been called by the Government ofthe United States of America., who had originallywanted to extend the scope of the Meeting to dealwith potential refugees from other countries.   HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United. Kingdom had thought it inadvisable to do this and had eventuallysucceeded in securing agreement that it should be confined to the problem of emigration from Germanyand. Austria.  .    The American representative, Mr MyronTaylor, was a. friend and trusted political supporterof President Roosevelt,   He had proved, an admirableChairman.   mhe French representative, SenatorBdvsehger, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-mittee, had proved an easy colleague to work with,and Mr Makins, of the Foreign Office, had been aninvaluable adviser.    One of the difficulties experienced was over the relationship of the new organisation proposed to the Director of the LeagueRefugee Organisations,   ^he United States representa-tive was known to hold, the view that the League was
a dyine concern.     Eventually, however, an understand-ing had. been reached, and the United States government now admitted the principle of close collaboration between the two bodies ,Another o^ the difficulties of the new organisationproposed, was that the United States of America were onbad terms with the German Government,    ^his, perhaps,was not unconnected with the fact that the Jewish vote in the united States was a large one.    The Americanrepresentative had wanted, some clause of a denunciatorycharacter towards the German Government, but theBritish Delegation, under instructions from theSecretary o^ State for Foreign Affairs, had resisted.this successfully.T!HTRD SPATES On a private occasion Mr Myron Taylor had ma.dei? AMERICA .  statements that were almost of a historic character,elations with.He had said, that President Roosevelt was deeply con-previous reference: cerned at the present international situation and feltCabinet 31(38), Con- that, if ever war came the idea, that any single countryelusion 6.)could escape from its effects was a delusion.Mr Myron Taylor further suggested that the co-operationof the United States Government at Evian was by nomeans the last one.    The conclusions would be setforth in the Official Report.    mhe first point wasthat the majority of the Delegates ha.d shown greatgood-will and. a disposition to modify their emigrationpractice so as to admit a greater number of emigrantsfrom Austria and Germany.   The second point, was thatan inter--Governmental Committee was to meet in london to continue and develop the work of the Evian Meeting.The Colonial Secretary, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster continued, had. helped him very much by enabling him to make a statement about the possibility
of a small-scale settlement in Kenya. The AmericanGovernment also was willing to open their quotas of immigrants to Jews from the two countries mentioned.Another importa.nt point was that he had reason tobelieve that  the German Government were not undisposedto come to some arrangement under which they mightallow Jewish emigrants to take out more money,   Thiswas of the first importance in connection with the financing of the scheme.In London it was proposed that the permanent organisation should consist of a single Director, whowould he an American citizen,   For this post theAmerican Government had already selected. Mr GeorgeRublee, a lawyer and a close friend, and associate ofthe late Mr Dwight. Morrow.    The proposed Inter-Governmental Commi+tee would  consist of representa-tives of the T&apos;nited Kingdom, the United States ofAmerica, France,, a Scand.ina.vian and a Latin-Americancountry.   The Foreign Secretary had proposed, and.the Prime Minister had approved, that  the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster himself should be theEritish representative and Vioa-Chairman.   He wouldhave the part-time assistance of Mr Makins, of theForeign Office,    ^he main object of the Committeewould be, with the help of the Director, to try and.get in touch with the German Government in order topromote and. regulate the emigration of Jews from Germany.Incidentally, however, this ought to promote Anglo-American co-operation and assist oppressed peoples.The Secretary of State for the Colonies, afterthanking the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster forthe skill with which he had. looked. e.fter the colonialinterests involved at Evian, gave a summary of the
prospects of Jewish settlement in the Colonial Empire.Palestine, of course, stood by itself.   Apart from that,the Colonial Office had made a careful examination ofthe situation in oLlm African colonies.    In Kenya ithad been found, possible to admit of a certain amount ofland settlement, though the numbers would be in hundredsrather than thousands.    Northern Rhodesia was anotherpossible field of colonisation, but at the present time it was strongly opposed by the Non-Official element inthe Legislative Council.    It was hoped, however, toexplain the matter more fully to the Non-official members, with a viev.- to inducing a change of attitude.A.part f^om these field? there was not much prospect of helping the refugee problem in the Colonies,The Home Secretary sa.id that the Refugee committees were rather wisely concentrating on the emigration of young people, leaving the older ones to look after them-selves.   He warned the Cabinet that, while he wa.s anxiousto do his best, there wa.s a good deal of feeling growingup in this country   a. feeling which was reflected, inParliament   against the admission of Jews to british territory.    He hoped, however, to go on quietlyconsidering individual cases on their merits-The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said thatthe total  cost of the Evian scheme was only  6,000 ayear, of which the British share would, be only . 400.The Prime Minister thanked the Chancellor of the duchy of La.no..ster, and said that the Cabinet, were glad to welcome his report *
PALESTINE. 5. The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat there had. been a. considerable improvement in the(previous reference: situation in Palestine during the last few days.

FINANCIAL 60 The Prime Minister suggested that itSITUATION._ would he convenient if the Chancellor of theCIVIL Exchequer were to make a statement at this pointEXPENDITURE.in regard to Civil Expenditure.(previous reference The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thatCabinet5(38), ne wished to invite the attention of his colleaguesConclusion 9.)to the course of Civil Expenditure.      The lastBudget and Finance Bill had gone through sosmoothly, that there was a real danger that thealarming prospect before the country would not be appreciated.The expenditure of the country in the current year could be divided into three main heads(l)    Debt charges  230 millions.(2)    Defence  343 millions plus a substantial sum for supplementary estimates.(3)    Civil Expenditure    439 millions.Speaking broadly, it was impossible to foresee any reduction under (l);    indeed we wereadding to our debt at the present time.As regards (2), he saw no prospect that defence expenditure would fall in the immediatefuture.It was clear that we could not continue indefinitely to borrow for defence.      It followed that we could maintain our financial stability onlyin one or other of the following wayss-First, that we should obtain an increase inthe yield from taxation on the existing basis,and no one could reckon on this happening.Secondly, that we should obtain additional revenue by an.increase in the rate of taxation, or
by putting on new taxescThirdly, that we should reduce civil expenditure.He was deeply concerned lest our financesshould become unmanageable as a result of the growth of expenditure.He suggested that, when proposals for new expenditure were submitted,  they should be considered from the point of view that another  25 millionsrepresented 6du  on the income tax.Already there were signs that, apart fromany new services* and omitting any demands likelyto result from, e g* Jamaica or a possible award of improved conditions to Post Office workers -there would be a further increase in Civil Expenditurein 1939-40 of the order of  20 millions,The Chancellor of the Exchequer referredto the statement made by the Prime Minister atScarborough on 8th October, 1937, to the effect thatin present circumstances it was impossible for usto introduce reforms which would add substantially to the present enormous annual expenditure of thecountry.      He felt bound to draw the attention ofhis colleagues to the gravity of the situation,and to ask them to ensure that Departmentsinvestigated every detail of proposals for expenditure,in order to ensure that all&apos; avoidable expense wascut out.      It had been found necessary to impose a ration on the Defence Departments.      notwithstanding the difficulties, it might be necessary to take asimilar step in regard to Civil Expenditure.
Finally, he emphasised that he was raising thismatter not in any narrow spirit, hut in order tobring home to his colleagues the heavy responsibility which they all shared in this matter.The Prime Minister said that he entirelysupported the Chancellor of the Exchequer in theaction which he had taken in bringing this matter before the Cabinet.      As an illustration of theattitude of the House and of public opinion in thecountry at large he cited two matters on which hehad recently been asked to receive deputations;namely,  a proposed addition nf ^/   n vrrrrrk. to old age Pensions, and a proposal that back service should count for pension.      It did not seem to be generally recognised that the present was not atime at which to add to the burden of expenditure,lie felt sure that this was a problem of greatimportance, and that its gravity would be felt with increased force as time passed.      Indeed, hewondered whether concrete steps should not be taken before long to effect a reduction in civil expenditure.The Prime Minister suggested to his colleagues that in any speeches which they might make inthe country, either now or in the autumn, theymight utter a note of warning on this point, soas to start educating public opinion.
united kingdom -australia trade,vgreementtision of.revDiscussion withAustralian Dele-gation.(Previous Ref-erence: Cabinet32(38), conclu-sion 13).7. The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs reported that, since this matter hed been discussed at the previous meeting of the Cabinet, he had seenSir Earle Page and had persuaded him to return tothe principles, of the original draft statement.Mr. Menzies had prepared a revise of the draft state-ment which, while not so suitable from our point ofview, could be made acceptable    subject to amendments.After discussions,  agreement had been reached between the negotiating Ministers.      The draft statement had been approved by the Prime Minister onMonday night, and the Australian Ministers had communicated it to Canberra.      It had been arranged that the document should be signed that morning anda private notice question w3s to be asked in the afternoon.      This would be answered to the effect thatagreed conclusions have been reached and would bepublished later in the day as a V/hite Paper.The statement was in substance in accord withthe principle? set out in the memorandum which he had circulated to the previous meeting of the Cabinet(CP. 152(38)).      The main points in the statement were as follows:-First,  the statement recognised that economic progress in Australia cannot depend on the expansionof primary industries alone,  and acknowledged thedesirability/&quot;,  on broad grounds, of tbe maintenance and development of the secondary industries inAustralia, subject to their being economicallysound.
Secondly, the statement recognised thespecial position of United Kingdom agriculture,and the dependence of the United Kingdom as apurchaser of Australian produce upon the maintenanceof the United Kingdom export trade.Thirdly, the Australians had undertaken toconsider a schedule of maximum duties.The President of the Board of Trade addedthat perhaps the main point in the statement wasin Clause 9, which stated that the present agreement should continue in force.The Prime Minister said that he thought theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs was to hecongratulated on the success of the negotiations.
8. The Cabinet had before them a Most Secret Memo-randum by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(CP.-170 (38))  dealing in the main -with Naval Expendl-ture but also reminding his colleagues of the positionreached in respect of the other two Services.   Adecision of the Cabinet was required as to the generalpolicy which should, govern our Naval preparations, inview of the substantial additions in each category ofship for the larger Fleet regarded as necessary by theAdmiralty.   The Minister reviewed, the position eompre-hensively under the headings  &quot;The Navy Ration&quot;, &quot;TheFinancial Issue&quot;, &quot;Standard, of the Fleet&quot;, and &quot;other items of Expenditure&quot;.   After setting forth, for theassistance of his colleagues, the direction in whichhis mind had been moving, he recommended that theCabinet should decide that, having regard to the. extentespeciallyof the demands likely to be made/by the Air, which atthe present time was of the utmost importance, the new standard of Naval Strength was impossible of attainmentand that we must rest content with something substanti-ally less.   Assuming acceptance of this recommendation,with a view to facilitating discussion as to whatstandard the Admiralty should aim at within the limits of available resources, the Minister set out, with somediffidence, a number of factors on the political,,strategical and technical, and financial aspects, inthe hope that discussions with his colleagues would,result in sufficiently definite conclusions to giveclear guidance to the Admiralty as to the general lines of the policy to be pursued.   He contemplated,that the Admiralty would then work out detailed, pro-posals, for submission to the Cabinet or Committee ofImperial Defence at a. later date, to give effect tothe decisions reached.
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence madea statement summarising his memorandum,at the conclusionof which he said that the first decision required was as towhether the Cabinet were prepared to adopt the New Standardof Naval Strength or not,     If the Hew Standard wasadopted, it would add  88 millions to the expenditure inthe quinquennium,,      If this was not considered practicable,the Cabinet would have to consider whether they would adhere to the DoRoCc Fleet, or whether some means could be found for increasing it.     Possibly some adjustment might be made,such as by reducing the number or postponing theconstruction of aircraft carriers or cruisers, which wouldenable such additions to be made.     Obviously; however,those kinds of detail could not be settled by the Cabinetthat day and the Admiralty would have to submit proposals.The Prime Minister said that if the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence&apos;s recommendation that the proposed new Standard of Naval Strength was impossible of attainmentwere to be adopted, the Admiralty could hardly be expectedto formulate new proposals without being given a maximumsum.      Otherwise, they would get back into the old tangle.He agreed that this could not be done by the cabinet itself, but he had in mind that a sum might be consideredby a group of Ministers who would report their recommendations to the full Cabinet,In the course of subsequent discussion, several members of the Cabinet attached importance to the matterbeing brought back to the Cabinet before the decision wastaken.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that thestatement of the situation in CP. 170 (38) was a fair one.It was perhaps hardly necessary for him to impress on theCabinet the importance of sea-power from an Imperial pointof view0     Reference had been made in the discussion to the
importance of air-power, but the Empire could survivea defeat in the air as it had survived defeats to theArmy in the past.     If, however, we lost command of thesea, the Empire would collapse like a pacirof cards.No Air Force or Army could retrieve the position, nor would it be necessary for an enemy commanding the seato strike another blow in order to reduce the Empireto complete submission.     The importance of sea-power,therefore, was as great as ever and he thought that thiswas realised by the public.     Owing, perhaps, to thegood administration of his predecessors, the admiralty had been less in the public eye than the other service departments.     If, however, it was believed that all wasnot going well and that, owing to financial considerations,the Government were rejecting the advice of their Navalexperts as to the minimum needed for security, there would be such a storm in the House of Commons that the Governmentcould not hope to survivee     His own view was that thesystem of rationing the Defence Departments over a long-period of years was a mistake0     The right course wasto decide first upon the policy and then to ask the experts what was necessary to carry out that policy andthen to find the money.     If the latter was impossible,it would be necessary either to change thepolicy or to reduce other items of expenditure.If the country was in danger, it was difficult to defend the maintenance of all the Social service so     If therewere indications that tl..e financial system was breakingdown, desperate measures might be necessary, but, since february when the rationing system was adopted, thecountry had been presented with a Budget surplus of 20 millions, and, following upon that, the Chancellorof the Exchequer had courageously increased taxation to
the extent of 6d. on the Income Tax0 This was taken inthe City of London without a shudder and no evil effectshad followed.The First Lord, continuing, said that the rationing system had already broken down.      The War office had made great sacrifices which would be severely criticised if they were known to the public, but even theWar Office had been authorised to spend  12 millions morethan their ration0     There seemed little doubt that theAir Ministry also were no longer confined within theterms of their ration.-. He felt, however, that thewhole principle of rationing was wrongo     A Minister incharge of a Defence Department convinced of the vitalimportance, from an Imperial point of view, o  takingcertain steps would go to the Treasury for approval.The Treasury might be convinced by his argument that thematter was both vital and urgent and authorise him to incur the expenditure, but, at the same time, they wouldshake a warning finger and remind him that the money wouldhave to come out of his ration,   For exampleP the Navydepended on a single cordite factory.      If they asked fora second one, they were told that it must come out oftheir ration, and they had to choose between a corditefactory and, say, a destroyer flotilla0     He recalled that in paragraph 58 of Cop. 170 (38), the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence had said that if the Gabinetdecided on a course which involved the adoption of a smaller Fleet than was recommended by their technical advisers as necessary to give adequate security on thebasis of a given policy, the responsibility for thedecision must rest upon the shoulders of His Majesty&apos;sMinisterso     He agreed with that, but it would be a fearfulresponsibility for Ministers to take for, at some future
date, they would have to be prepared to state on apublic platform that so desperate v/as the financialposition of this country in the Summer of 1938 thatthey had felt justified in rejecting the advice of asingularly strong, efficient and experienced body of sea Lords thereby risking the security of the Empire.He recalled that the Minister for Co-ordination had suggested that one way of dealing with the situation would be to reshape our foreign policy.     To someextent, this had been done already.     No-one, however,could seriously suggest that we were so confident ofpeace as to be able to reduce our forces.     in discussing an earlier item on the Agenda Paper, it hadbeen suggested that relations with the United States .ofAmerica were better.     He agreed that real co-operationwith the United States would make all the difference,but there was no prospect of that in the next 12 months..It was reallj&apos;- no use asking the Admiralty to work out afresh Programme.      They would have to be given a completely new Terms of Reference.      They had been askedto work out plans on the assumption of having to meet anenemy in the Par East and to hold the situation inEurope.      If the Cabinet wanted a new Programme, theymust give the Admiralty different assumptions.     For his part, he was not prepared to suggest an alternative.The gravity of the situation was shown by the appendix to CP. 170 (38).     Except in capital ships, we were inthe position of numerical inferiority to Japan.     over germany, we only showed a small margin.     Italy was left out of the calculation altogether.     For the first time, we were relying on a possible ally (France) todo al&quot; with- the Italian-aavy.     The position with theDominions in this matter must be borne in mind.     He- 20 -
recalled that during the Imperial Conference a year ago,the Dominions had &quot;been given a memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee which had been based on theassumption that we could send a Fleet to the Far East.There had been no suggestion of lack of money.     TheDominions had been told nothing of the policy of rationing.     As to Japan, he could not accept thesuggestion of the Minister for Co-ordination inparagraph 62 of C,Pt. 170 (38) that because Japan &quot;maybe somewhat exhausted&quot; we should be justified in reducing our Naval Standard,      If the Dictator Powers were to hearrumours of our weakening, it would not alter thesituation to our advantage.      In general, the exhaustionand difficulties of potential aggressors wore a doubleaspect.     A lean dog was perhaps more dangerous than afat one, and there were many examples in history of governments, especially Dictator Governments, embarking on foreign wars in order to divert attention from troublesat home.     He recalled that 14 months agor his predecessor had brought the question of the New Standardof Naval Strength before the Defence Plans (Policy)Committee and that the Prime Minister had then thankedhim for not pressing for a decision      Since that time,the situation had deteriorated.      Germany was more powerful and Japan more hostile than at that time.The First Lord then offered the following suggestions;-(l)    That the Cabinet should adopt the New Standardof Naval Strength, but that no time limit should be fixed, and the matter should be dealtwith as in the past, year by year, in accordancewith the financial issues and the international situation at the times
That the New Standard of Naval Strengthshould he adopted, but should be slowed down.     He had had worked out a scheme of construction over the next four years to effect a saving of some  30 millions, and,if the Foreign Secretary thought it safe to slow down progress and if the Chancellorof the Exchequer thought it essential fromthe financial point of view, the Admiraltymight be prepared to acquiesce.      If that course were adopted, it would have to bemade quite clear in fairness both to theNaval Advisers and to the public that wewere slowing down for financial reasons:neitherIf/plan (l) or plan (2) was acceptable, thewhole question should be referred once more to the Defence Requirements Committee.He ^recalled that that Committee had notbeen told to hold up their recommendations for reasons of finance, and, although thePermanent Secretary to the Treasury hadbeen a member, &quot;the Committee had submittedits Programme irrespective of financial considerations.      Since that time,decisions had been taken piece-meal at cabinet Meetings.      This was unsound andhe suggested that the whole question ofour Defence Expenditure should be referred back to the Defence Requirements Committeeto consider how our available resourcescould best be distributed.
10 LlThe Chancellor of the Exchequer, after thanking theFirst Lord for the moderation with which he had put his case,suggested that he had not stated quite correctly the positionas to the construction of the D.R.C. Fleet Programme.    In thelast two years, owing to the gravity of the international situation, the Cabinet had agreed to accelerate the D.R.Cprogramme, and it was for that reason that his predecessorand himself had provided additional money.    On each occasion the proposals of the Admiralty had been put forward, not asan increase, but as an anticipation of the Programme.    he took a strong view that this was a responsibility for theCabinet and for no-one else.    Admittedly, as the First lord had said,  it was a grave responsibility, but it wasinescapable.    The Board of Admiralty were not concerned withfinance.    That was the affair of the Treasury and theCabinet, who must take the responsibility.    He did not differ from the First Lord as to the importance of the Navy,but he recalled that last February, when the Cabinet had referred    the    task of rationing to the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence, it had been by a unanimousdecision.    It was impossible to say that rationing was right for the War Office cr the Air Ministry, but notapplicable to the Navy.    If it should prove that theAdmiralty programme could not be carried out in full,  itwas for the Cabinet to take the responsibility.    Up to thepresent time the Defence programmes had been implemented in comparatively favourable circumstances.    If, however,there were, say,  a million or two more unemployed, thesituation would be very different.    The Government would notbe able to refuse public assistance more or less on thepresent scales, and if they did,  it might create a revolution.    He said this in no departmental spirit, but
as a member of the Cabinet..    Even though it might be possiblesomehow or other to find money to build a larger Fleet,  thedifficulty still presented itself of how to pay for itsmaintenance.    In this connection he quoted the following extract from paragraph 59 of C.K 170 (38):-&quot;Further,  it would be wrong to build up theNavy at great expense over the re-armament period to such a size that it would be clearly beyond our means to maintain the Fleet once it had been built up to the new level.&quot;He was reminded that this aspect was also referred toin paragraph 24, where the stabilised annual cost of theD.R.C Fleet and the New Standard Fleet respectively weregiven as  88 millions and  104 millionsy&quot;These figures may be and probably are now considerably higher,  and show the immense burden which even the D.R.C.will throw permanently upon our resources&quot;.    He then madesuggestions very similar to the Conclusions set forthat the end of this summary, ,    t   . *     Jg      The Home Secretary wan agrrrnblti) thafr  ^ho^Wow^Standftwd.NaTfP st.rongth ohould not yot bo approved.    Since theImperial Conference, however,  it had become clear that adecision on the question could not long be delayed and thatthe country and the Empire wanted to know the position.He himself had always wished to postpone the decision aslong as possible.    Accordingly at the last ImperialConference he had put the position very frankly, and had emphasised the enormous cost of the New Standard, but had keptthe Conference guessing as to what was intended.    He had hoped to get some assistance from the Dominions.    For manyreasons, he would have preferred to keep the situationfluid.    He was told, however, that every month the matter was more difficult, e.g., from the point of view of the
training of the Navy, next year&apos;s Programme, and moreespecially because under the Anglo-German Treaty,  we had very shortly to inform the German Government what the strengthof the Pleet would be a few years hence.    With great reluctance, therefore, he feared that a decision could notbe avoided.    If that was the case, he found the recommendationof the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence in paragraph60 of CP.  170 (38) very difficult to accept.    He did notbelieve that the New Standard Pleet was impossible ofattainment.    After all, that Pleet was only strong enough to hold the situation in the Par East and in home waters at the same time.    If it was impossible of attainment,that would be a terrible shock for the Dominions.    he deprecated, therefore,  a decision leading to that issue.He would like to say that the New Standard Fleet as a standard was inevitable.    But having settled that, itshould be considered year by year how far we could giveeffect to it.    The attainment of the Standard might takeyears.    He suggested also that the Admiralty might look into the question of slowing down their expenditure, e.g.,on capital ships,  in which he understood that Germany wasslowing down,  or aircraft carriers.    To repudiate theStandard, however, would be dangerous,    It would be verydifficult to explain a sudden cessation of the HavalConstruction programme.    He thought also that the Admiraltymight look seriously into the cost of maintenance of theFleet, e.g., might it not be possible to keep fewer ships in commission in order to avoid reducing the construction programme?   pressure might also be renewed on theDominions.    Eighteen months ago the Government of theCommonwealth of Australia had been very friendly towards the ideaof building a capital ship.    There were hopes that they
might still construct one, but it was not likely that theywould do so if they felt that we could not hold the positionin the Far East.The President of the Board of Education thought thetime was approaching when strong pressure ought to be put onthe Dominions to take a fair share in Irmoerial Defence.He did not think we ought to abandon the idea of the new standard Fleet, but we might make it clear to the Dominionsthat progress must be slowed down for financial reasons, inorder to try arid get their assistance. AP6   .&amp; OlaUtT fir J^tny^^tk Mff^-^The gg^64Jdon-wof- tho -Board, of -Tiiade thought itwould be a great shock to the Dominions if we abandoned^the New Standard.    Only a short time ago discussions hadtaken place with a view to the construction by Australia ofa capital ship.    Those conversations had all been on theunderstanding that the United Kingdom Fleet would go to theFar East in the event of war,  and that in the interval theAustralian battleship could be used very effectively for theprotection of trade.    He suggested, therefore,  that theNew Standard should not be rejected, but that the programme should be settled each year on the merits of the situation.The Prime Minister agreed that it was unnecessary todiscard the New Standard Programme and say that it would never be adopted, but that was not the same as saying thatit must be adopted now.    He could not bring himself to agreewith the suggestions of the First Lord as to how co-ordinationof Defence expenditure should be arranged,    fio would profor--fc-e reverse/the process and government that first the cabinet should lay down what resources were available, then ask theirexperts as to how theycould be spent with the best results,

Referring to the First Lord&apos;suggestion that the rationing principle had broken down,he pointed out that nevertheless it had produced considerableresults.    In this respect it resembled the Non-intervention committee.    It was not a perfect weapon, but it was an effective one.    The idea, therefore,  ought not to be abandoned.    He agreed that the Navy should have some decision to work to.    He therefore repeated the proposalswhich he had made earlier in the discussion and which hadbeen supported by the Chanceller of the Exchequer (see Con-clusions).The Secretary of State for Air,  referring to paragraph60 of C.P.  170 (33),  agreed that increased demands for theAir Force would be probable.    The Cabinet ought to bear inmind, however, pledges made as to our Air strength.    He didnot wish to contest the rationing principle in themanner in which it was worked - that is to say with a plusfigure. I-!-, was good     that the Service departments should have a figure to aim at.The Secretary of State for War said that it would be easier for the Service Ministers if the country were told that there were limits to the expenditure on defence.    Atpresent there was a tendancy to think that their expenditure was unlimited.    He referred to a letter he had received fromMr. Winston Churchill, who had suggested that 20 divisions were necessary.The Secretary of State for Air said he wouldrather put up with the discomfort of criticism than have it announced at the present time that our defenceswere being checked   for     financial reasons.
The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster foresawthat a very difficult situation would arise if Parliamentv/ere informed that the Service Departments v/ere beingrationed, unless the ration v/as extended to Civil departments as well.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatin making the recommendation in paragraph 60 he did not wish to imply that the rvoposeu. New Standard of naval strength was wrong i\ principle.    He only wanted to suggestthat when convert d into terms of ships,  its implementationwas at present beyond our strength,    He had not intended to reject the standard altogether, but to take something lessas an immediate goal.The Cabinet agreed;-(i) That in determining the total scope of our naval preparations and the naval standard tobe adopted and aimed at,  regard must be had tothe financial provision available, bearing that mind the plan adopted by the Cabinet inFebruary last and the distribution of the total available resources between the different services,(ii) That the decision as to the standard of theFleet is a matter of Ministerial responsibilityafter duly considering the views and advice of the Board of Admiralty?(iii) That having regard to the above considerations,the Cabinet must decide that in presentcircumstances we cannot commit ourselves to the standard known as the New StandardFleet,(iv) That in the light of the above decisions,  theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence,  theFirst Lord of the Admiralty and the Chancellorof the Exchequer should at once consult together- with a view to agreement as to thetotal sum to be allocated to the admiralty for the remainder of the quinquennium forall purposeso    The Prime Minister is preparedto be available to assist in reaching agreement so far as necessary.-    The conclusion is to be reported to the Cabinet at theearliest opportunity.
9.    The Cabinet had under consideration a Memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade (H.A.-25 (38))covering the draft Prevention of Fraud (investments)Bill, the object of which was to give general effectto the recommendations of the Departmental Committeeappointed, under the Chairmanship of Sir ArchibaldBodkin, to consider the operations commonly known asshare-pushing and share-hawking, arid similar activi-ties:    together with the following recommendations by the Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 13thConclusions (38)):-&quot;(l) To approve the Prevention of Fraud(investments) Bill in the form of thedraft annexed, to H.A.-25 (38). subjectto the amendments adopted, at the meeting and. summarised in this Minute, andsubject also to any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found- necessary or desirable:(2) To authorise the introduction of theBill in the House of Commons beforethe Recess, with a view to its con-sideration by the financial and.commercial interests  concerned andits reintroduction, as early aspractiea.ble, next Session.&quot;The Cabinet approved the recommendations of theCommittee of Home Affairs as set forth above.

APPENDIX.Captain .Viedemann called at my house by arrangementat 10 o&apos;clock this morning, and I had two hours conversationv/ith him.      Sir Alexander Cadogan was also present.Captain wiedemann confirmed that he had come with herr Hitler&apos;s knowledge, and that his mission was to explore the possibility of some important German personagecoming over here in the near future, v/ith the idea of full discussion of Anglo-German relations.     He indicated that the personage contemplated was field Marshal Goering.I said that His Majesty1s Government would, sincerelywelcome any procedure that gave prospect of improvingrelations between the two countries, though the moment forsuch discussion must obviously be chosen with great care.Any visit of the kind indicated would inevitably attractpublic attention, and if there v/ere no concrete result itmight do more harm than good.Captain r/iedemann said that he ought perhaps to say a word in general in regard to Herr Hitler&apos;s attitudetowards England.     That had always been one of admirationand friendship, but Herr Hitler felt that he had on various occasions been rebuffed, or at any rate that his advanceshad not been well received.      He cited two instances:    inthe first place there had been some disappointment at out failure to produce any concrete proposals at the time ofmy visit to Berlin last November.     Before that visit theGerman Government had understood from His Majesty&apos;ambassador that I should be coming with definite proposals,and when it became clear that this was not so Herr hitler had experienced a degree of disappointment.      In thesecond place Herr Hitler felt that he had made a greateffort in negotiating the Naval Treaty with Great Dritain:
in-that...Tj?eat-y--he had definitely acknowledged British navalsuperiority, hut there seemed little appreciation in thiscountry of the effort which he had made.     He had, moreover,been resentful of the credence given in England to rumourson 21st May of German troop movements.I interjected that there had of course been rumours and counter-rumours .-.t the time;    but that in justice to theattitude His tar jesty&apos;s Government had felt bound to adopt, Xthought I might point out that the denials of troop move-ments would heve had great weight if similar denials atthe time of Au -tria had not proved mistaken.Captain W.edemann admitted that von Ribbentrop had beenbadly informed and had not managed that business well.Nevertheless, Herr Hitler was still inspired with thedesire to be friends with England, and was still preparedto make an effort to that end,I said that His Majesty&quot;s Government would welcomeanything that rave ho;nes of leading to better relationsbetween the twe  countries, but I must warn Captain Wiedemannthat the presert moment might not be altogether favourable.It was impossible to deny that the existing tension causedby the Czechoslovak ] roblern would militate against therestoration of complete confidence, which was essential tosuccess.      If that problem had received a peaceful and satisfactory solution evidently that might afford a good opportunity for attempting a settlement of many other questions.     Perhaps even if a solution had not actually been reached, the situation might be rendered morefavourable if the Geruan Government could give some assurance of their resolve to assist in a peaceful settle-men t of the question and to refrain from any form of direct action or use of force.     Did Captain Wiedernann think
it would be possible for his Government to give any suchassurance or to make any such pronouncement?     As he wellknew, any precipitate action might involve a conflict inwhich the French would be bound to honour their obligations and into which it was impossible, as pointed out by thePrime Minister, for His Majesty&apos;s Government to be airethey would not be drawn.Captain Wiedemann said that he was not himself chargedwith a political mission on this occasion,  and was hardlyin a position to d-iscuss such a question.     He could, however?give me the most binding assurance - in fact, he was authorised to do so - that in present circumstances theGerman Government were planning no kind of forcible action,and so far as one could see into the future, had no intention of resorting to such methods.     His government might be able to give an assurance of the kind suggestedlimited to a definite period.     He doubted whether theycould give it for all time.      There were long delays inthe settlement of the Czechoslovak crisis, and solong as that state of suspense continued, there mightany moment occur incidents which a great State likeGermany would be unable to overlook.      If a number of the sudeten   Deutsch were massacred it was impossible to saythat the German Government would not feel called upon to intervene.I asked Captain Wiedemann whether the exchange of viewsnow contemplated, was to be regarded as a continuation of the conversations which I had had in Berlin, and which had been continued early this year through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador.
Captain Wiedemann gave no direct answer to chis question,but he indicated that the aim of his Government would be toobtain a comprehensive agreement..     He thought that his Governmentwould wish to discuss all outstanding questions, and he hopedthat through friendly negotiations a satisfactory settlementmight be reached.     He said that in the past Germany had on various occasions put forward claims which the German Govern-ment considered to be moderate:    these had on nearly all occasionsbeen rejected, and the result had been that in the endGermany had taken more than she had originally demanded,    asan instance he quoted the fact that in 1933 Herr Hitler had discussed with him the question of the Reichswehr and had saidthat he ivould ask for the numbers to be raised to 300,000,though he indicated to Captain V/iedemarm that he would be pre-pared to accept 200,000. This demand had been rejected, andthe result was that Germany had introduced universal militaryservice.I again put it to Captain V/iedemann that the prospectof any conversations would be greatly enhanced if the GermanGovernment could see their way to declare in some form thatthey were resolved in co-operation with us to seek a peaceful and satisfactory settlement of the Czechoslovak question.I asked Captain Wiedemami what procedure he thoughtHerr Hitler would favour, if and when the negotiations failed.Captain Wiedemann answered very readily that in such an event the German Government would wish to get the negotiationsresumed in whatever way this could best be managed,    I then asked whether I was right in thinking that the German Government
had not regretted the fact that we had been endeavouringin Prague to assist in the discovery of a peaceful solution.Captain Wiedemann replied that Herr Hitler recognisedthat we had made an effort, but regretted that we had not beenable to do yet more.     Vith regard to the suggestion that theGerman Government should make some such declaration as I indi-cated, he again repeated most emphatically that the GermanGovernment was planning no resort to force.      If matters con-tinued on the present basis there was no idea of Germany edopt-ing such a line:    she might only be forced into taking it by someunforeseen and serious incident.      He recurred to the undue delay, which might be misunderstood in Germany.      He instancedthe grant by His Majesty&apos;s Government of autonomy to Ireland,and the acceptance by the French Government of the Saar plebisciteand he asked why the Czechoslovak Government could not followthose examples.      I had to point out that the examples he hadquoted were not quite on the same footing as the problem withwhich we were now confronted.      Further,  I observed that this problem was one that had presented continual difficulty now forseveral centuries,  and it could never be easy of solution.It was therefore surely unreasonable to expect that it couldbe satisfactorily solved in a few weeks or months.In regard to procedure, I encuired of Captain Wiedemannwhether he thought his Government would agree that any further discussion of these arrangements should be continued throughofficial channels.Captain Wiedemann agreed, but he said that in order thatthere should be no misunderstanding, he must explain the
situation.    He said that Field Marshal Goering v/as strongly in favour of the idea.    The Field Marshal was very anxiousto see agreement between Great Britain and Germany, and tosettle amicably all questions that might be at issue betweenthe two countries, and believed that this could be done byfriendly negotiation.    Herr Hitler was not against the pro-ject, but both recognised the need for preparation and toascertain our reactions before committing himself to adefinite and final opinion.    Herr von Ribbentrop at presentknew nothing about it.    In the circumstances he suggestedthat the channel of communication for further exchange of views would be either through Herr von Dirksen, whom hewould take into his confidence,  to Captain V/iedemann himself,or through Sir Hevile Henderson to herr von Neurath,I enquired whether any difficulty would be caused bynegotiating with Herr von Heurath behind the back, as it were,of Herr von Ribbentrop, and I asked whether Herr von Ribben-trop would not now be brought into the matter.    CaptainWiedemann said quite emphatically that Herr von Ribbentropwould not be apprised of the matter until that became abso-lutely unavoidable.    He added in confidence that Hcrr von ribbentrop&apos;s position with the Fuehrer was no longer what it had been.I also raised the question of the form in which any announcement of a visit to London might be made.    I presvxmedthat it might be said that the German Government had desired that such a visit should take place,  and that His Majesty^Government had indicated their assent,  and had invited field marshal Goering.    Captain Viedemann referred to the fact thatI myself on leaving Berlin had said that I hoped that weshould see Field Marshal Goering in London, and he -thought it better
to take that as a starting point;    and to say that Hisnlajesty&apos;s Government haa now issued the invitation whichField Marshal Goering gladly accepted.I aid not pursue this subject further, ana we agreed that that was really a matter that could beconsidered later- on, when we agreed on the principle of the visit.     I told Captain Wiedemann that I should feel obliged to tell the French Government that we had receivedcertain approaches from the German Government, with thepurpose of exploring the possibilities of conversations at a later date, and that if and when this matured, we should of course keep them informed.     He at once said that there could of course be no possible objection:    that would be quite understood.      I also told him that in view of thereport of his arrival in the Daily Express, I should probably have to tell the French that I had seen him.     This also he readily accepted.I also asked him about what time Herr Hitler orField Marshal Goering would have in mind for the visit ifit took place, to which he replied that he supposed it mightnot be possible before the autumn.I at this point, thought it well to read to CaptainWiedemann the message which I had originally drafted withthe idea that it might be sent through His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin.      I subsequently gave instructions for the text of this message to be sent to Captain Y/iedemann,and he should have received it by luncheon time.I then summed up the upshot of our conversation andthis summing up was repeated by Captain Wiedemann himself.It was to the effect that the idea of an exchange of views and a visit of the nature indicated was welcomed in principle by His Majesty&apos;s Government.     But it was agreed that it would-be important to prepare the ground carefully and to try to
ensure a favourable atmosphere.     At present the chiefobstacle consisted in the state of tension produced by thecontinued crisis over Czechoslovakia and His Majesty&apos;sGovernment hoped that a peaceful and satisfactory settlementof that Question might open the way to a fruitful exchangeof views.Before talcing leave of him I had some private conversa-tion with Captain Wiedemann, and it may be of interest to note one or two points that emerged from it.      I asked himwhether he had enjoyed Herr Hitler&apos;s friendship for a longtime;    I understood that he had been with him in the War.Captain Wiedeaann said that he had served with Herr Hitlerfor two and a half years during the War;    during that time he himself was Regimental Adjutant and Herr Hitler was what he described as &quot;despatch bearer&quot;.     Captain Wiedemann addedthat his friends had often asked him whether, in those days,he had detected the great qualities that Herr Hitlerpossessed and whether he had had any inkling of the futurethat was in store for him, ana he had always been bound totell his friends that he had not notieed anything of the kind.Herr Hitler had been a brave, reliable and cool soldier,the sort of man on whom one could rely and whom one v/as glad to have in reserve to put into any post of difficulty ordanger.      But he had had no idea of the capabilities which herr Hitler had subsequently given proof.      Captain Wiedemannadded that he did not enter the party or Herr Hitler&apos;s serviceuntil 1934;    after the War and until that date he had beenfarming in Germany.Captain Wiedemann told me that he would return toGermany either this evening  or to-morrow morning and heassured me that he would looe no time in giving Herr Hitleran account of our conversation.     He would also report to
Herr von Neurath and possibly to certain other officials,and before he left London he would inform the german ambassador of what had passed.A copy of the written communication to CaptainY/iedemann is annexed.(Intld.) H.16th July. 1938.
ANNEX TO APPENDIX.Foreign Office,18th July, 1938.Dear Captain V/iedemann,The following is the text of the message which lord Halifax read to you this morning:-&quot;On the other hand, it might defeat thepurpose we both have in view to embark on conversationsthat, even on a non-official basis, were bound, ifthey became public, to attract much attention, unless we could both feel reasonablv sure that such conversations were likely to lead to good result.It is obvious that if normal relations had been-established between the German and CzechoslovakGovernments, such conversations would be held underthe most favourable circumstances.     Short of the realisation of the above conditions, it would, however,be the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government that anundertaking given to each other by both governments to co-operate in promoting the achievement of a peaceful settlement in Czechoslovakia would be valuable and would offer better prospect of successful issue to any conversations than might otherwise be expected in the state of uncertainty which necessarily atpresent prevails.His Majesty&apos;s Government would welcome theviews of the German Government upon these observations,and if thereafter it should be decided to pursue the suggestion of direct conversations on mattersof interest to both countries./His Majesty&apos;sCaptain Wiedemann,&apos;0. Brook Street,
Government would welcome that decision.     In that event, it would doubtless be convenient that thesuggestion should at the appropriate moment beconfidentially conveyed through the official channels.His Majesty&apos;e Government . ould anticipate that it might be impossible to keep any stich visit,especially if it were of an important personage,secret, and it would perhapo be right to add thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government could not guarantee thatthere might not be some outward manifestation inthe Press or elsewhere of the hostility of certain sections here to the political i.;eas of the GermanGovernment, and to some of their actions.     Theywould, of course, do their best to induce moderationin the Press and to see that any other- activities were strictly restrained.1&apos;with kind regards, and with best wishes to you for your journey,Yours sincerely,(Signed)   ALEXANDER CADOGAN.
