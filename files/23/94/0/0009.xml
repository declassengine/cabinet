CENTRAL&apos; EUROPECzechoslovakia.(previous reference:Cabinet 35(38), Con-ol us ion 2.)^ 30. 3. itf.1, The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that he had seen Lord Runeiman, who had made arrangements to start for Prague on Tuesdaynext, August 2nd.   Lord. Runciman had &quot;been slightlydisturbed at a telegram from Berlin reporting Herr von ribbentrop&apos;s attitude.    The Foreign Secretary there-fore proposed to write to Herr von Ribbentrop asking him to adopt a less frigid, attitude.   He also pror-posed to send a telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorrequestingin Rome      /     him to communicate with Count Ciano andto agk for Signor Mussolini&apos;s support to LordRunciman&apos;s mission.    Finally he proposed to try and.obtain some commendation from President Roosevelt.
MEDITERRANEAN,MIDDLE EAST and north-EASTAFRICA.(previous references:Cabinet 9(58), Con-elusion 4,and.Cabinet 35(38), Con-clusion 10,)2* The Cabinet resumed their consideration of conclusion 7 (c) of the draft Minutes of the 329thMeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence, on thesubject of a proposed, contribution of  30,000 towardsthe reconstruction of the Saudi-Arabia Section of theHedjaz Railway, On which a decision had been reserved,by the Cabinet at their previous Meeting pending theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs ascertaining wether His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda,, who was nowin London, realised the conditions attached to theproposed contribution.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the Foreign Office had. communicated by telephonewith Sir R, Bullard, who was at Oxford.   He adhered,to his opinion that the  30,000 proposal would be most helpful.    Both the possible difficulty forIbn Saud of raising the larger sum (roughly estimated,at  300,000) and the risk of the Railway being uselesswere present to his mind, but he felt strongly thatthose points had best be brought out at the meetingat Jed da and explained to ibn  Saud.    In the meantimeSir R. Bullard much hoped that the  30,000 proposal might be approved,The Cabinet agreed.  To approve the following recommendations made by the Committee of Imperial defence at their 329th Meeting on the 19th July:-&quot;(b) To authorise the Foreign Office toinform His Majesty&apos;s Minister atJedda that His Majesty&apos;s Government   -agree to the holding of a Conferenceat Jedda, to be attended, by repre-sentatives of Great Britain, France,Syria and Saudi Arabia, with a viewto reaching a.n agreement as to the repair of the damaged, portion ofthe Hed jaz Railway:that at the Jedda Conference theBritish representative should, beauthorised, to inform the repre-sentative of the Saudi Arabian
Government that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared, to contribute  30,000towards the reconstruction of the saudi Arabian section of the HedjazRailway, provided that the saudi arabian Government were able to makesatis fa.factory arrangements for obtain-ing the remainder of the estimatedcost (i.e., some  300,000) of thissection from other sources:To note that the contribution of HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not stopat  30,000, since the restoration ofthe Maan-Mudawara Section (without which the restoration of the saudi arabian Section would be useless)would, necessitate further expenditure,tentatively estimated at  100,000.&quot;
UNITED STATESOP AMERICA ..Negotiationsfor a trade agreement. -Report ofCabinetCommitteeon Trade and agriculture.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(37), Con-conclusion 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them the following docu-ments on the subject of the United Kingdom-United StatesTrade Agreement:-A Report by the Cabinet Committee on Tradeand. Agriculture (CoP.-l.84 (38)), to whichwere attached Memoranda by the President ofthe Board, of Trade setting out the positionreached in the negotiations .    The Reportstated, that the American negotiators were now maintaining that &quot;our offers, ta.ken asa whole, were inadequate and. involved littledirect sacrifice on the part of United.Kingdom industry or agriculture, and. thatthey must press: us until we are ready tomake sacrifices corresponding to those whichthey are prepared to make&quot;.    The british delegation were of opinion that, while there might be considerable elements of bluff inthe American attitude, the Americans genuinelyconsidered, our offers inadequate.   The Delega-tion accordingly recommended, that we should now decide definitely how far we were pre-pared. to go, subject to an agreement satis fa c-tory as a whole, and. then to be firm even atthe risk of a breakdown.    The Report then setforth the position as to the more importantitems in respect of which the Americans werespecially pressing for further and betterconcessions.    In the opinion of the majorityof the Committee it was highly desirable from various points of view, including the improve-ment of international relations and. of thefurthering of general economic appeasement,that an Agreement with the United states should, be concluded.    They accordingly recommended the Cabinet to authorise thePresident of the Board, of Trade to proceed,should he find it necessary or desirable todo so during the Recess, with the signature of an Agreement with the United. States on thegeneral basis indicated in the &quot;MemorandumSummarising the Position of the Negotiations&quot;(Appendix I to CP,-184 (38)subject to his being satisfied, that a fair settlement had.been reached on the questions still outstand-ing, and subject also to the Cabinet&apos;decision on the question whether any, and. if so what, further concessions might be offered,in respect of lard.   a matter upon which, inview,of its great importance, the committee felt unable to reach any conclusions or to&apos;make any recommendations to the Cabinet.The objections to the proposal to offer asubstantial reduction in the duty on lard,were dealt with in paragraphs 4 to 10 ofthe Memorandum by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries attached, as Appendix IV:A Memorandum by the President of the Poard.of ^rade (CP.-185 (38)) pointing out that anAgreement with the United. States might beobtained during the Recess;    that, in viewof its importance, it would, be better not toallow any appreciable interval to pass before
bringing the Agreement into force;    that legislation in this  country would be requiredonly in regard to two minor items, as towhich it would be necessary to make special provision in the Agreement, leaving the new duties in respect of them to be brought intoeffect at a. later date;    and asking authorityto be given for the necessary Orders to bema.de and. for the Agreement to be broughtinto effect, as soon as possible aftersignature, on the authority of the PrimeMinister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the Foreign Secretary and himself, or as many of those Ministers as it might bepossible to consult when the Agreement, was concluded..The President of the Board, of Trade explained, thesituation as set forth in his Memorandum.. (C.P.-184 (38).)During the week-end the position of the negotia-tions had. become rather acute.    mhe American ambassador had. called on him as he wanted to see the PrimeMinister and had. conveyed a somewhat gloomy message from Mr Cordell Hull, the American Secretary of State.As a result of that interview he had sent, a. long tele-gram to the United Kingdom Delagation at Washington(No. 483), and. the position for the moment was a.little easier.   Nevertheless he was satisfied that no agreement could be reached unless we were prepared, togo a little further on certain items.   The fouroutstanding points were Lumber, Tobacco, Bacon andHam, and. Lard.On LUMBER nothing could be done because the proposalconflicted, with the principle of the Most-favoured-Nation Clause.    Seven nations  could take us to theHague Court, with the result that we should have topay heavy damages.   He had given to Mr Kennedy awri+ten statement which had already been given toMr Cordell Hull,On TOBACCO also no further concession could, bemade owing to the Ottawa Agreement with Rhodesia,which did not expire until 1942.    mhe American
285-negotiators had suggested that we might offer a concession after 1943, hut as by that time theAgreement now in cont emplat ion would, have expired,this was hardly practicable.On BACON AND HAM we were able to offer a substan-tial advantage by separating the two items and. by giving a large   quota on ham.    The agreement of denmark and Poland would be required .Before coming to the difficult question of LARDhe dealt with demands made by the American negotiatorson industrial items.On IRON AND STEEL most of the American manufactur-ers had agreed with the European Cartel not to import,and consequently only &quot;pirate&quot; firms would use anAgreement, which would tend, to upset the Cartel and.to bring confusion into the iron and. steel industry.On MA.CHINE ^00LS he had had to explain their vitalimportance from the point of view of national security.On MOTOR CARS a concession had. been made, and wehad. agreed to consolidate the rates on high-poweredcars, and to some preferences in the Colonial Empire,e.g., the Malay States.There were some industrial matters in which it waspossible to make some advance.    On AGRICULTURALmRACT0RS the difficulty ha^ been that they were ma^eby only one firm,- namely, in Leeds.    mo secure their position a Duty had been imposed, on the advice of theImport Duties Advisory Committee.   The national farmers&apos; ttnion had applied for a reduction on theground that this firm had not carried out their part.The I.D.A.G., however, had refused and had said thatthey would not entertain a proposal for a further reduction for some years.    On the strength of thatthe firm in question had extended their works .   Toeoneede a Duty would be represented, if not as a
breach of faith, at least as rather sharp practice.He thought, however, it would be necessary to make a concession on this point.    The Company might be compensated by the placing of orders for Tanks orother war material .On the question of TURPENTINE, which was a RevenueDuty, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed to a concession.    It was hoped also- to- make some concession on STLTC STOCKINGS, but. there were difficulties withthe French, who, although a lowering of the Duty would help them, were refusing to agree unless some additional compensastion were offered, on the technical groundthat the terms of the Treaty were not allowed to be altered, without their consent.   There were also various items of a. lesser cha.ra.cter on which concessions were possible.Everything turned, however, on a decision on LARD.He could not guarantee that even with a concession on lard we could obtain an Agreement, but he couldguarantee that without some such concession no Agree-ment was possible.    This washisvery decided and.determined view.fflhe Minister o^ Agriculture and Fisheries asked,the Cabinet to realise the difficulties in concludingthis Agreement.   One such difficulty was that fromtime to time the American negotiators elevated, newitems into essentials.   Lard was the latest example.Bearing in mind the concessions already made on WHEAThe was doub+ful whether the American Delegates would, agree to break on lard.    mhe reason why he himself had had to adopt rather an intractable attitude onlard was due to the effect that a further concession on this item would have on the narrow margin   allowedto curers under the Bacon Industry Bill.   This margindepended, mainly on the return on offals, of which lard-7-
was the most important and had. already been muoh   . - -reduced, owing to the fall in lard, prices since theBill was drafted .   He pointed, out that apart from the concession that the President of the Board o^ trade had. announced, on Agricultural Tractors, for which hethanked him., nothing was bein^ done for agriculture.The neglect of agriculture would be contrasted, withthe provision made for the motor industry, which by comparison was very nourishing,The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, that if theCabinet, accepted the view that it was of the very first importance to obtain an Agreement with the United. Statesof America, it was essential to get over the difficultyof the Minister o^ Agriculture and Fisheries *     he recognised that the Treasury might be able to contribute to .a. solution.   He suggested, therefore, that, if theDuty on lard, was reduced, to 2/6 per cwt. the baconcurers should be given a. price guarantee for lard, inreturn.    The Treasury would lose doubly, both fromthe price guarantee and. from the reduction of the lard.Duty by 2/- per cwt.    In view, however, of the great political importance of reaching agreement with theUnited States, he felt justified, in facing that.The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheries accepted,the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer inprinciple, and. undertook to place officials of his department in touch with the Treasury on the subject with a view to considering the nature of the legislation that would be required.The Prime Minister- thanked, the Chancellor of theExchequer -for his generous and. practical contribution.He himself had. discussed the matter with the american ambassador, who took a. sensible view of the situation,
realising that the practical results of the Agreementmisht not he very great, hut that the psychological effect on the world was of great importance.    The more the impression could he created in Europe that theUnited. Kingdom and the United. States were gettingtogether, the less would, have to he spent on armamentsWhen the conclusion of the Agreement was announced, astatement would, also have to he issued, that thedifficulty arising for the ha.con curers would, haveto he corrected,The President of the Board of Tra.de thanked theChancellor of the Exchequer and. the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries for all the help they had given.   He was not unhopeful that the revised offer would, help to secure agreement.   He presumed, however,that the Cabinet would not want him to permit a breakdown in the arrangements without having anopportunity to consider the matter.    Consequently, ifa breakdown threatened, he proposed to temporize untilthe Cabinet, could meet.Some discussion also took place on the issues raised in cp-lS1^ (38) .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To place on record the importance thatthey attached, from a political and.international point of view, to theconclusion of a Trade Agreement withthe United. States of America:(b) To authorise the President of the Boardof Trade to proceed, should, he find, itnecessary or desirable to do so duringthe Recess, with the signature of anAgreement with the United States on thegeneral basis indicated in the SummarisedMemorandum (CeP.-184 (38), Appendix I),subject to his being satisfied that afair settlement had been reached on thequestions still outstanding:( c)  That the British Delegates should, beauthorised to offer to reduce the Dutyon Lard to 3/- or, in the last resort,3/6 per cwt.     In return for thereduction of the Duty, the bacon curers
should be given a price guarantee forlard:(d)  That the Treasury and. the Ministry ofAgriculture and Fisheries should conferas to the nature of the legislation required to enable the price guarantee for lard to be given:( e) That if the President of the Board, ofTra.de should find, himself in a dilemmabetween having to make a concessions which he felt went beyond his authority and. a. breakdown of the negotiations, heshould do his best to spin out thenegotiations until it was convenient tothe Cabinet to meet.    In any event heshould keep the Prime Minister informed,of the posi+ion, in case a. special meeting of the Cabinet might have tobe summoned, during the Recess :(f) That if and. when an announcement wasma.de of the conclusion of an Agreement,a statement, should, also be issued, tothe effect that- action would, be takento alleviate the difficulties that would,result to bacon curers:(g) That in the event of an Agreement being reached, during the Recess, the Presidentof the Board of Trade should be authorisedto take the necessary action to bring it into force and to make the necessary&apos;&apos;Orders as soon as possible after signatureon the authority of the Prime Minister,the Cha.ncellor of the Exchequer, theForeign Secreta.ry and himself, or ast&amp;any of those Ministers as it mightbe possible to consult ^hen the agreement was concluded:th) That the President of the Board of trade should take such action jas-he might deemadvisable with a view to the adoption ofa Ratification Clause that would, facilitate the ac-c_eptan.ce by Parliament, of the action taken.
.2704.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe President of the Board of Trade ( CP.-186 (38))recalling that at the Meeting mentioned in the marginthe Cabinet had decided that they were prepared toaccept a Trade Agreement with India on the lines suggested by the Government of India subject to asatisfactory settlement of the cotton issue.    Subse-quently a mission representing the cotton trade had.visited India to negotiate with representatives ofthe Indian industry and of the producers of raw cotton,, but their efforts to find, a basis for anagreement had. failed.    The Governments had thenattempted, to reach agreement.    The Memorandumproceeded to describe the latest proposals of theIndian representative relating to cotton piece goods and. raw cotton.    These proposals, however, were less favourable than the Lancashire representatives had hoped, for, and it was improbable that they would approve (and. promise to support) an agreement on thelines suggested.    Their attitude now seemed to be thatthe Government must take the decision, leaving themfree to approve or to criticise as they  might subse-quently decide.   The President of the Board of Tradehimself felt that a pledge of Lancashire&apos;s approval and support was essential.The President of the Board of Tradereminded his colleagues that when the negotiations fora new trade agreement with India had been discussed in February last, he had thought that the pricedemanded was too high.      The Cabinet had, however,decided that, subject to a satisfactory settlementof the cotton issue, they were prepared to accept
an agreement on the lines suggested by the-Governmentof India.    There had been some difficulty in persuading the Lancashire traders to go out to India.      on arrival they had been met with a complete stone-wall^Negotiations had been broken off rapidly and theyhad returned home,     The terms now offered by SirMuhammed Zafrulla Khan were better than those previously offered, but they were below whatLancashire had expected and would, he thought,   beregarded ao a satisfactory agreement.The President of the Board of Trade addedthat he was seeing some of the Lancashirerepresentatives that afternoon..     The chances were that they would not,regard the terms offered as satisfactory.      The position as he saw it might besummarised as follows:-As a result of the present negotiations, wewere asked to give up half the preferences which weenjoyed under the Ottawa Agreements.      Further, thejute industry was suffering severely from importsfrom IndiaP and the carpet and leather goodsindustries were apprehensive,,     Against this,  theonly United Kingdom industry to benefit would beLancashire cotton, and if the Lancashire cottonmanufacturers were not satisfied, we were in an impossible Parliamentary position.      The decision ofthe Cabinet in February last had been that we shouldmake a new trade agreement, provided we could get asatisfactory settlement of the cotton issue0     Hethought that.the Cabinet should adhere to their previous decision, and that we should not go on with thenegotiations unless we could get the support ofLancashiree
The Prime Minister pointed, out that the paper beforethe Cabinet spoke of Lancashire&apos;s approval and support,h H e%and not merely of its support.     He thought the        ...     *distinction might be of importance.     It was contemplated that our exports might be increased to somewhere between350 million yards and 500 million yards.      Some yearsago they had reached 2,000 million yards.      Gould itbe said that Lancashire would apruoove the condition ofaffairs which was envisaged?On the other hand, what was the alternative?     Hehad been informed that Sir Zafrulla had received formalconfirmation of his offer from the Government of India,and that was the extreme limit to which they would goto get agreement.He understood that Sir Zafrulla attached greatimportance to reaching an agreement which the Legislaturewould accept;    otherwise it was likely that they wouldactively oppose any trade agreement whatever with thiscountry.     Already a notice of adjournment had been handed in on the ground that the Legislature had decided two yearsago to terminate the Cttcwa Agreement and this had not beendone.      If a new Agreement was not made now, there was a risk that, not merely should we fail to get the reductionoffered in the cotton duties but that the existing dutiesmight be increased.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that on political grounds we should be glad to reach an agreement provided of course that it was an agreement which could be defended.      At the same time-;  it would, be a bleakParliamentary prospect to go to the House of Commons todefend an Agreement if no single interest derived any realbenefit from it.The Secretary of State for India said that he had little to add to what the Prime Minister had stated.    The
alternative to acceptance of the present proposals was no agreement at all.      If that happened, we should no longerenjoy any preference in the Indian market and the cottonindustry would lose the benefit of the present proposal.He thought, therefore, that acceptance of the present offer was in Lancashire&apos;s interest.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that Dundeewas very worried about the jute position.      Out of 25,000workers in the industry, 10,000 were unemployed.     In thecity unemployment averaged 25.V&apos;/.-- as compared with 13&apos;/.for the United Kingdom as a whole0   About 9,000,000 more yards of jute cloth had been imported into this country in the first four months of this year than in the same period lastyear, whereas exports of jute from India to other countries were declining.     He was aware of the difficulties, butthis seemed to suggest that there was here a bargaining-counter which might be used.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat in this matter of trade agreements, it was impossibleto put back the clock in India and to impose trade agreements on the assembly which they would, not accept.He appreciated the importance of Lancashire support in the House of Commons, but he did not see how Lancashirewould benefit by a refusal of this offer.The President of the Board of Trade said thatif the agreement were terminated, there were a numberof things which we could do to help our industries.      Thus,import duties could be put on jute, carpets or leathergoods imported, from India.      In regard to the cottonindustry,the Indian and United Kingdom quotas in theColonies could he separated.
The Secretary of btate for Home Affairs agreedthat the British market was probably of more value toIndia than the Indian market was to us.     At the same time,he would be very sorry to see a tariff war between theUnited Kingdom and India.      The previous day,  the Cabineti^r ***** ?l*f&quot; 7*-*had been discussing Federation, and :^3bs--Jiie^e-re^wa ^x^r*y^ta\xe^^ez^^ The truth of the ^af&amp;af^xea^ftg, and we were powerless to prevent it.The reduction of duties now offered was substantial and we should have been very glad to have obtained sucha reduction two or three years ago.     Notwithstanding the disadvantages, he was in favour of accepting the agreementoffered.Secretary of btate for Scotland had said about the creation&apos;of a new Special Area in Dundee.      On the general issue,he was in agreement with the President of the Board ofTrade.      He thought that there might be something to besaid for terminating the present agreement and startingafresh on a new basis.      If this were done, India mightadopt a more realistic attitude and might better appreciate the advantages to be gained from trade agreements as well;as their.disadvantagesohis discussion with representatives of the lancashire cotton industry he had spoken of &quot;the best settlementobtainable in the circumstances, and one which would bringreal benefit to Lancashire&quot;.      He thought that thisaccorded with what the Prime Minister had said aboutLancashire&apos;s &quot;approval and support&quot;.       In February wematter was that the Lancashire cottonThe Minister of Health agreed with what theThe President of the Board, of Trade said that in
had offered great concessions, and the real questionseemed to him to he whether we were now to concede stillmore.     Again, in February, it had been suggested that thenew agreement would meet with real support from theassembly.      Now,  the idea seemed to be that the agreement might be got through by a majority of a few votes.     he also pointed out that the tariff concessions offered were linked with the importation of specified amounts of raw cotton from India.      The cotton industry thought thatthese amounts were in excess of what we could import,and to this extent the benefit of the tariff concessionsmight be lost.Lord Zetland said that it seemed to be assumed that the terms set out would be accepted by the LegislativeAssembly.      There was no certainty that the Legislaturewould accept the new agreement proposed, but the Governmentsof India had undertaken to pass the agreement if need be over the heads of the Legislature.      The decision of theLegislative AS-assembly-would depend largely on the attitudeof Mr. Jinnah, who was prepared to give the support of his party if sir Zafrulla considered that the terms offeredwere in the interests of India.The Prime Minister said that it must be left tothe Board of Trade to see representatives of the lancashire cotton industry and hear what they had to say.       If they felt that they would rather run the risk of being worse off than they were at present than take the agreement,then it would be difficult to go against their view.But the President of the Board of Trade would no doubtput to them the alternative to this agreement as he saw the matter, and he thought that, when they saw the matter in this light, the representatives of the Lancashire cottonindustry would, in fact, give the assurance asked for.     , .
The President of the Board of Trade asked what should be done if the Lancashire cotton industry weredefinitely against accepting the offer.      It was&quot;&quot;suggested that in this event they should be asked tostate what they could accept:    a counter offer might then be made and an attempt made to continue thenegotiations.There was further reference to the position ofDundee.      The President of the Board of Trade explainedthat this was a matter whioh must be dealt with separately and by a voluntary agreement to limitproduction.      There was a reasonable prospect that something could be done on these lines.The Cabinet agreed :-(a) that the President of the Board ofTrade should put before therepresentatives of the Lancashire -;cotton industry the Indian terms,and should explain to them theprobable alternative if thepresent terms were not acceptedj(b) that if the representatives of theLancashire cotton industry were in,   favour of accepting the offer, thePresident of the Board of trade should be authorised to accept it;(c) that if the representatives of theLancashire cotton industry wereagainst acceptance of the offer,they should be asked to state whatterms they would accept:    a counteroffer might then be suggested andan attempt made to continuenegotiations.
MALTA OONSTI-TTJTION.(previous reference:Cabinet 38(38), Con-conclusion 7.)5.   With, reference to the Conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had. before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-179(38)) relating to constitutional issues in Malta.The first question, namely, the situation created, bythe Judgment of the Court of Appeal in Malta, whichhad held that the Letters Patent establishing thepresent  constitution were ultra vires, had. now been disposed, of, as that Judgment had been reversed on appeal to the Privy Council.   On the second, question,namely, the grant of a more liberal constitution to malta, which had. already received. Cabinet approval inprinciple, the Secretary of State submitted for theconsideration of his  colleagues a statement of thenew form of Government that he propose^, with thefull approval of the Governor, should be established.Although a return to self-government was not eontem-plated, the proposals described by the Secretary ofState in his Memorandum -represented a considerableconstitutional advance on the present Crown ColonyGovernment of Malta., for which he thought the time wasripe.   He added that it would, not be possible to bringthe new constitution&quot;into effect for some time, butrin order to forestall political agitation,,, it was important that the main outlines of the new eonstitu-tion should, be announced, at an early date.

SIR MAURICE 8. The Prime Minister said that before he left theHANKEY.- Meeting he wished to say a word to Sir Maurice Hankey.presentationt,0. This was the last Meeting at which he would be among them, holding the post which he had. held, with so muchdistinction for so many yea.rs .    Sir Ma.uriceTs Secretary-ship to the Cabinet went back to the War days, and. hecould fairly be called the creator of the modernCabinet.    The members of the present Cabinet were thelast of a. great body of statesmen who had. passed, through his hands, with all of whom he had been on intimateterms, and who had all given him the fullest confidence.Sir Maurice had. often been tempted to leave his post,and on occasions he had. been sounded as to whether hewould, like to join a Government.   He had preferred, towork in comparative obscurity, and. to complete the workwhich came from his own initiative and which he had.fostered, until he had brought it to perfection.Sir Maurice Hankey seemed to them all to be a. part ofthe Cabinet Room, and without him it. would be a differ-ent place.   He had gained the respect and affection of&apos;every one of them, and. they would miss him very greatly.In view of his long service and connection with theCabinet, and as the first and greatest Cabinet. secretary in history, they wished to give him a personal token oftheir affection and esteem.    They had. conspired withLady Hankey and. had chosen a clock of modest dimensionswhich would be mounted on a stand, and. which would beinscribed with the names of the Cabinet.   He hopedSir Maurice would accept this as a. token of theirgreat regard and. affection, and as a remembrance ofthe happy days which they had spent with him.
Sir Maurice Hankey said that he was so unused tospeaking in the Cabinet Room that he hardly knew the sound of his own voice there.   He found it difficultto-find adequate words to thank the Prime Minister andthe Cabinet.   He had many memories, not only of thepresent Cabinet but of 7 Prime Ministers and. 14 or 15Governments.   He had taken the minutes of more than,100 Meetings of the Cabinet proper, or over 1,700if the Var Cabinet were included.It was true that other posts had been offered tohim, but he had always felt that the greatest privilegehe could have was to serve the Cabinet, and that was hisunfailing thought on entering the Cabinet Room.    Baconhad. said that &quot;The greatest, trust between man and. manis the trust of giving counsel&quot;.   His trust had. been to hear members of the Cabinet giving counsel to eachother, and to record, the results,   ^hat, he felt, wasthe highest service which he could render.    He was gladthat he had. continued, to serve the Cabinet for so long.He regarded himself as perhaps something of a robot,but robots had their feelings, their    criticisms andadmirations.    So far as he was  concerned, since thepresent Government had been in office,  criticism had.been lacking and admiration had been continuous.   Hewould, like to end. on one word which the Prime minister had used, - &quot;affection&quot;.
