THS LORD MAYOR&apos;S 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet thatANNUAL DINNER.he had been in communication with the Lord Mayor of(Previous London, who had now decided that for the Dinner reference:Cabinet 3 was giving to the Cabinet on the following day, evening(38), Con-clusion 1.) dress with decorations should be worn.   The Lord Mayorhad told him that members of the Cabinet would not be detained, very late.   The dinner itself would takeabout an hour and a quarter, after which there wouldbe chamber music for twenty minutes .    The Lord. Mayorhoped that any members of the Cabinet who could do so would stay a little longer after that for purposes of conversation.
ATTENDANCEOP ministers at DIVISIONS(previous reference:Cabinet 28(36), Con-conclusion ion 1.)3. The Prime Minister said that on the previous friday the Division on the Supply Vote of the Ministryof Transport had not been very favourable to theGovernment, namely, 117 to 95.   Next Friday the vote for the Ministry of Labour was to be taken, and. he hoped, that all Ministers of the Crown would be present,if possible, and that if for any reason this wasimpossible they would obtain a &quot;pair&quot;.(NOTE BY THE SECRETARY:    It is usual, in casessuch as the above, for Cabinet ministers to communicate the Prime Minister&apos;swishes to their Under-Secretaries.)-3-
ITALY. 4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs gelations reported that he had made it clear to the FrenchGovernment that we could not hold up the Anglo-ItalianfRANCO-ITALIAN Agreement until a Franco-Italian Agreement was broughtILLATIONS. %:about.   He was, however, doing his best in Rome toiPr evious3Reference:I Cabinet 281(38), Con-1 elusion 3 .)SPAIN.Proposed[ Armistice.(previous reference:Cabinet 28(38), Con-clusion 3 .)bring about a renewal of Franco-Italian conversations .Unfortunately the latest telegrams from Rome went toshow that he was not likely to be successful in this.He had also made it clear to Italy that, the PrimeMinister&apos;s condition about a &quot;settlement of the Spanishquestion&quot; must be maintained.   His efforts to enlistItaly&apos;s support in urging an armistice on general franco had met with a complete check at the hands ofCount Ciano.   He had not yet received Signor Mussolini&apos;sconsidered reply, but Count Ciano had. spoken in a mannerso emphatic as to make it fairly clear that he musthave known the Duce&apos;s mind.
SPAIN. 5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsjjon-Tnterven- reported that agreement had been reached in substancetio^i.on the British scheme for the withdrawal of volunteers&apos;(previous in Spain except for the question of finance.Reference:Cabinet 28 It was hoped to get that point settled at a Meeting(38), Con-clusion 4.) of the Non-intervention Committee on Friday next, the/3g ^ \ .   24 th Instant.    The British, French, German and italian governments were ready to pay their respective shares of the cost, but the Russian Soviet representaiivewas making difficulties.   He thought it possiblethat if Soviet Russia refused to co-operate, thefour Governments might agree to share the whole cost,including the Russian Soviet share,   When thefinancial question was settled the main Non-intervention Committee would, have to give their approval and the scheme would then be submitted, to both sides in the conflicto    The Earl of Plymouthanticipated, more difficulty on this with the BarcelonaGovernment than with General Franco.   The Secretaryof State, however, entered a caveat against too muchoptimism on this question, as there were many difficulties still to be overcome.
A3SPAIN. 6. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsfind is criminate reported that on the previous day the French AmbassadorbonjMng.  had called upon- him and had. told, him that the SpanishThreatenediReprisals . (Barcelona) Government were so annoyed at the indis-criminate bombing carried out by General Franco&apos;si( previous Reference: forces that they were contemplating reprisals   e.g.,1 Cabinet 28j (38), Con- against towns in Northern Italy.   mhe French Govern-elusion 3 .)ment was very disturbed about this and had. asked ifwe could help to stop this insensate idea.   He hadalready instructed the British diplomatic representa-tive with the Barcelona Government to try and dissu8.dethem from taking action, especially now that progress was being made on the Non-intervention Committee.In addition, he had seen Sir Walter Citrine, andhad given instructions that the Belgian Government,whose Prime Minister happened to be a Socialist,should be notified of the French Government&apos;s news.The Secretary of State then informed his colleagues that, owing to the lukewarm attitude of the UnitedStates of America, the Swedish Government were ratherinclined to run out of the International Commissionto verify the facts of bombing in Spain.   He hoped,however, that they would be willing to join in theplan if a Belgian, Dutch or Swiss representative couldbe added in place of the United States member.
CENTRAL EUROPE.       7.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsCzechoslovakia, reported that conversations were proceeding betweenS the Government of Czechoslovakia and the representa-(previous reference:      tives of the Sudeten-Deutsch.   The Prime Minister ofCabinet 28(38), Con-     Czechoslovakia had, on the 18th June, informed, theel us ion 2 .)British Minister that his Government intended in anyease to introduce the Governments concessions andreforms by July 12th, when Parliament would meet.Meanwhile he had received rather less reassuringimpressions from a secret source to the effect that dr. Benes was holding back and. that Dr. Hodza was rather disappointed, with the Presidents attitude, so he intended to keep on putting pressure on Dr. Benes.The Secretary of State proposed to see the Czecho-slovak Minister the same day and to tell him thatthese reports had. reached him.As he had already informed the Cabinet Committee onForeign Policy, in case the conversations broke downhe proposed to have a wise British subject availableto slip off quickly to Central Europe to try and getthe parties together again.The. Secretary       State alsq gaye. a ahgrt apppuntof a conversation between Mr Gqnwell Ivafis, theSecretary o^ the Anglo-German Fellowship, and Herrvon^ Ribbentrop, in which the former had tried to getthe idea to the German Foreign Minister that even ifthe conversation between the Czechoslovak Governmentand Herr Henlein did not succeed, efforts should befjaade to continue by negotiation,   Mr Oonwell Evanshad also said that Herr von Ribbentrop had asHed him.why the United Kingdom were so bent on whipping ^pthe war mind in Europe ?   Mr Conwell Evans had repliedthat we were in search of &quot;Gleiohbereehtigung&quot; si^peGermany had. increased her armaments beyond ours.
On the question of Czechoslovakia calling uptroops, the Foreign Secretary reported that the demilitarisation of the Class called up on May 31stW8.3 now practically completed.    The czechoslovak government were believed to be considering theextension of the present military service from two to three years, but this would require legislation,which could not be introduced until the Chamber met,namely, about the middle of July.
CORPORAL8. The Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumPUNISHMENT .by the Home Secretary and. the Secretary of State forthe Departmental Committee on Corporal Punishment( Cmd. .5684), presented, to Parliament on the 17th march last,  contained, the following unanimous conclusions(i) That, for children brought before JuvenileCourts corporal punishment is an ineffectivemethod;(ii) That as regards adults corporal punishmentcannot be defended as a penalty for offend-ers who can be dealt with by imprisonment;(iii) That it is only for gross violence against their custodians by persons who are alreadyserving sentences of imprisonment that resort to this other method of punishment is justi-f able *The authors of the Memorandum were satisfied, that thegreat body of enlightened public opinion endorsed, theabove recommendations , and accordingly b.C-j:1sb6 theCabinet to accept them and to authorise the prepara-tion of legislation for the purpose of giving effect-to them.    They suggested that the provisions of such legislation should be included in the Criminal justice bill, where they would, fall into proper perspective ina wider measure of penal reform, rather than in a Billconfined, to the question of corporal punishment, whichwould, concentrate attention on one controversial aspect.The Home Secretary made a. statement bringing outthe main points in the Memorandum.The Secretary of State for Scotland, expressed agreement with the Home Secretary0    InScotland, the abolition of corporal punishment wouldinvolve a greater renunciation than in England, as ttwas used, more freely there, more especially in thecase of juveniles.    Prom the point of view of Scottishexperience, however, the recommendations were wise,stating that the Report of
bearing in mind the numbers of juveniles who were brought beck to the Courts notwithstanding theinfliction of corporal punishment for an earlieroffence.   He agreed in the abolition of corporal punishment both for juveniles and adults.    So far asthe use of corporal punishment as a penalty inprisons was concerned, the only prison where thepowers existed today was Peterhead., and he would liketo have the powers extended to other prisons.Some doubts were expressed as to whether theabolition of corporal punishment would be acceptable to public opinion, and it was recalled, that two yearsago a private.te Bill on the subject, had been rejected,largely owing to opposition from the government&apos;s supporters .   Moreover, it seemed probable that theHouse of Lords might still be hostile.A suggestion was made also that public opinionheld that this punishment should, be retained, as a deterrent to sexual offences against young girls.The Prime Minister pointed, out that there were tworejection of the Privatenew factors since the^/Bill.   First, the Report of theauthoritative Committee now before the Cabinet, and,second, the &quot;Mayfair case&quot; in which corporal punish-ment had. been inflicted on certain young men convicted of crime, and. which had. led to a wave of disgustthroughout the count ry .The President of the Board of Education, as leader of the House o^ Lords, thought it probable that theHouse of Lords would take the same line as on theprevious occasion.    Bioy would, differentiate betweensntie.,. .P^nn^hme^n^by the Courts and at school.   The aggumonfewould he uo-od that s choolmastens^ Jfro stood in theplace of the parents, olieiulfl liorwa the right toadminist er corpor al punishment.
The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendations of theHome Secretary (CP.-142 (38)) infavour of accepting the Report of theDepartmental Committee on corporal punishment ( Cmd. 5684):(b) That the provisions of the necessary legislation should be included inthe Criminal Justice Bill:( c)  That the Home Secretary should do his best to hold the position without making any announcement in Parliamentuntil the Criminal Justice Bill was ready.
90  The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum, by theMinister of Health ( CP.-135 (38)) pointing out that so far as the Civil Service was  concerned, the whole cost of any facilities for sport and. recreation wasmet by the employees, and that, the position of Parlia-ment as a large employer of labour compared unfavour-ably with that of the better employers generally.The Civil Service Sports Council, a voluntary organisa-tion of Civil Servants, had succeeded with great-difficulty in making grounds available at certaincentres.   Even so, the facilities were inadequate,and. the financial position was such that unless thewhole movement could, be put on a firmer footing itwould, have to be wound up.      In these circumstances the Minister proposed, with the concurrence of thePrime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,that for the time being an annual grant of  20,000should be made in respect of sport and. recreational facilities in the Civil Service, and asked authorityto make a statement in the House of Commons at Questiontime.   He added that the money would be borne on theMinistry of Health Vote, and a Supplementary Estimatewould be necessa.ry.After some discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposal of theMinister of Health that an annualgrant of  80,000 should be made forsport and recreational facilities inthe Civil Service;(b) That the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Health should look into the question of the legal powers under which this action couldbe taken, and as to which Ministerought to make &quot;the announcement inParliament.- IS
ousting.describing the developments that had taken place sincej(Previous the Government&apos;s decision on this subject (Cmd.5207 ofReference:Cabinet 32 June, 1936, item 16)&apos; that the existing syistem of licensing(36), Con-clusion 4.)    private relay exchanges should be extended, for threeL      years (up to 31st December, 1939), during which time&quot;the Post Office should undertake technical research and practical experimenta-1 work in distributing broadcastprogrammes by wire&quot; (e0g., over the electricity supplynetwork, over telephone subscribers&apos; wires, and. over aseparate wire-network similar to those used, by the exist-ing Relay Companies), the Postma.ster-General desired adecision by the Cabinet on the following points:-(a) Whether in the circumstances which have nowdeveloped.   and. having regard, to the Govern-ment&apos;s intentions  concerning wireless broadcast-ing in time of war   the Post Office should undertake a commercial trial of wire broad-casting:(b) Tf so, whether such a trial might be undertaken,if need be, at a town where the Council has a labour majority;(c) Whether the existing system of licensingCompany-owned Relay Services should, be extended,for a. further period, of years   say to the31st December, 1942.If the Government was not prepared, to authorise a trialsuch as was referred to in (a), and.  considered, that thequestion of taking over the operation t-f the RelayServices should not be further pursued, the question arose  (d.) Whether the Government ia^pxepared to considerthe provision by the Post Office of a carrierfrequency service to telephone subscribers.At the request of the Prime Minister, the assistant Postmaster General informed the Cabinet thatthe Postmaster General, who had had a serious illness, was making steady and sure progress and might be back beforethe Parliamentary Recessa     He had had an opportunity to(The Assistant Postmaster General entered at thispoint.)ROADCASTTNG.        10.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSelay Ser- Postmaster-General (CP.-132 (38)) relating to the opera-yiees andV^re Broad-     tion of Relay Services and Wire Broadcasting.     After
discuss the matter with the Postmaster General,,     on question (a) above, the Postmaster General&apos;s view was thatthe Government should first decide whether, if the experiment was successful, it intended to adopt theUllswater Committee&apos;s recommendation that the Post office should take over the ownership and operation of relayexchanges,,      On this question, the Postmaster Generalinclined to the view that, if it was decided to maintainwireless broadcasting in time of war, the case for thePost Office taking over the operation of relay exchangeswas a weak one having regard to the political issues involved^     If, on the other hand, it was decided to discontinue wireless broadcasting in time of war, thePostmaster General was much impressed by the importanceof having a really efficient system of wire broadcastingimmediately available, and would be prepared to meet thepolitical objections in the national interests,On question (b), the Postmaster Generalrecognised that there were political objections toselecting a town with a Labour Council for an experiment,but would be prepared to face these objections in thenational interestoOn question (c), the Postmaster General agreedthat if there was any possibility of the Post Officetaking over the operation of the relay exchanges, theexisting licensing system should be extended, as suggested, to the 31st December, 19420On question (d), the Postmaster General was inclined to favour having an experimental service by meansof carrier frequency to telephone subscribers if thequestion of taking over the operation of the relay serviceswas not to be further pursued,,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer pointed outthat the difficulty was that broadcasting in time of war would provide enemy aircraft with the means of verifyingtheir position - acting virtually as a direction finder.He recalled, for example, that the airship R.101 had been receiving messages every few minutes during its finalvoyage which ended in disastero     The argument in favourof some relay system was that we ought to have analternative method of sending messages to the civilpopulation over wires.      The difficulty, however, was thatat the present time the number of wires available for thepurpose was extremely limited.     If some alternative methodto    wireless      broadcast was to be established, an immenseamount of work would have to be done on it.The Assistant Postmaster General pointed outthat the proposed Southampton experiment would cost 2^0,000 which bore out what the Chancellor of theExchequer had saidoThe Prime Minister pointed out that the questionturned to a considerable extent on the aspects of nationaldefence and whether, in time of war, an alternative to urtXeJ^sbroadcasting was necessary.      If it should turn out thatthis was the case, it would dispose of the argument thatthe establishment of a service by the State involvedSocialism0     He thought, therefore, the question should go, in the first instance, to the Committee of ImperialDefence.     The Assistant postmaster General should beincluded on any Sub-Committee that might be set up.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he had received observations from his Department which seemed to indicate that this question was rather closelybound up with the next item on the Agenda Paper and thatit might be advisable for the two subjects to be dealt withby the same body (but see conclusions on following item),- 15 -
The Cabinet agreed;(a) That the memorandum by the PostmasterGeneral (CoPu 132 (38)) relating tothe operation of Relay Services andWire Broadcasting should be referred,in the first instance, to the Committeeof Imperial Defence in order toascertain to what extent it was safe to utilise wireless broadcasting intime of war, or whether, from thepoint of view of national defence, itwas necessary or desirable to establishsome form of wire relay service:(b) That the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence should be responsible for settling the most convenient formof inquiry taking into account thePrime minister&apos;s undertaking that thePostmaster General should be represented by the Assistant Postmaster General:(c) That the Committee of Imperial defence should be asked to report as soon aspossible and, in any event, before theParliamentary Recess0
BROADCAST TNG-.&quot;Sponsored&quot;Programmes.(previous inference:Cabinet 34(36), Con-elusion 13 .)11.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by thePostmaster-General ^C^Po-133 (38)) reviewing compre-hensively developments thai had taken place on thesubject of Advertisement Broadcasting since the cabinets decision (referred to in the margin) that&quot;sponsored&quot; items should not be included in the broadcasting service.-,   At the end of his memorandum the Postmaster-General summed up as follows the policyhe recommended the Cabinet to approve:-(a) That the practice of excluding advertise-ments from the broadcasting service inthis country should for the present bemaintained:(b) That the scheme submitted, by Mr Boothby ,M.P.,and. any similar proposals which necessitate the approval of HoM. Government of thepra.ctice of broadcasting advertisementsin English from foreign stations, shouldbe rejected:( c) That a suitable opportunity should, betaken to make a public statement thatthe Government is opposed, to the broad-casting of advertisements in English fromContinental stations, and. that if and. when a sponsored broadcasting service is  eon-ceived to be in the public interest theBritish Broadcasting Corporation will be requested, to undertake such a service.In reply to the Prime Minister, the assistant postmaster General stated that the term &quot;SponsoredProgrammes&quot; signified programmes by advertisers whohad paid for the use of a broadcast service0The Secretary of State for Air demurred tothe following sentence at the end of (c) above:-&quot;and that if and when a sponsored broadcastingservice is conceived to be in the publicinterest the British Broadcasting corporation will be requested to undertake such a service.&quot;The Chancellor of the Exchequer also demurredto so definite a statement,.     The Governments lineought to be that if it was necessary to produce such a service, they could do it0
The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the &quot;broad assumptions made by experts in his office were that it was impossible for the BritishGovernment effectively to control what was launched in english from foreign stations and that the 1933 conventionhad turned out a dead letter.      In those circumstances, his advisers felt that it would be valuable to have in existencea station abroad which could be controlled by the BritishGovernment and which would be very useful for putting out their point of view in strained relations.     They had urgedthat the strategic importance of this aspect of the question should be examined.     That was why, in discussing theprevious item, he had suggested that the two questions were linked together.     He did not know whether this question also would be appropriate to the Committee of Imperial Defence.The Assistant Postmaster General said that thePostmaster General had hoped to have a Cabinet Committee onthe subject.The Prime Minister said that the best plan would beto treat the previous item as recorded in the Cabinet con-clusion thereon and to send the Report now underconsideration to the Cabinet Committee on Overseas Broadcasting.In view of the preoccupations of Sir Kingsley Wood with hisnew office, he proposed to appoint the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence as Chairman - Sir Kingsley Woodremaining a member.The Cabinet agreedsThat the Postmaster General&apos;s memorandum onSponsored Programmes (CP. 133 (38)) shouldbe referred for consideration by the CabinetCommittee on Overseas Broadcasting&apos;, whichshould be reconstituted as follows:-
The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence(Chairman),The Lord Privy Seal,The Secretary of State for Air, andA representative (Cabinet Minister or Under-Secretary) of the Treasury, ForeignOffice, Dominions Office, India Office,Colonial Office and Post Office.(The Assistant Postmaster- General withdrew at thispoint. )
