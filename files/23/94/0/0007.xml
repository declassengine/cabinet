The Interim Report stated, that ithad become clear that the Committee&apos;s investigationwould occupy some considerable time, and that the issues referred to them would have to be considered from a number of aspects   military, financial, consti-tutional and political   before they were in a. positionto submit final recommendations.    There were, however,two matters  capable of being settled at the outset ontheir own merits and without prejudice to the ultimatemain decisions of policy, upon which the Committeesubmitted the following recommendations:-n(i) That the War Office should be authorisedto arrange for the transfer of four british infantry battalions from theIndian to the British establishment assoon as the necessary barrack aecommo-dation is ready.   According to our present information, accommodation for two of the battalions will be available in April, 1939,and. for the other two during the troopingseason 1939-40.(ii) That a Committee of Inquiry should proceedto India, at an early date to consider andreport whether savings can be made in existing Indian Defence expenditure toset against the cost of modernisation ofthe Defence Forces in India, and in parti-eular to meet increased future maintenanceThe Secretary of State for India saidthat while he did not wish to be unduly alarmisthe thought it right to inform the Cabinet that asa result of the deliberations of the CabinetCommittee so far as they had at present gone, hewas convinced that there was a serious risk ofthe Cabinet being faced with political difficultiesof a grave nature in India in the not very fardistant future in connection with expenditure on defence.

He had since examined, it carefullyand found it was open to strong objections from the-1-
9 0 it u I)political point of view in India.    The mere fact of sending a Committee of Inquiry .to examine into theDefence Budget with a view to economies would, weaken the position of the Government of India, and moreespecially the Finance Member and. Commander-in-Chief.It would make it more difficult for the Government to resist the demand for a more rapid Ind.ianisa.tion ofthe forces, more especially as an Indian soldiercost one-fifth of a British soldier.    It would, alsocause trouble in the development of federation^   Oneof the main objections in India to federation was thatthe Federal Government would, have no control overDefence expenditure.   Without that, many people said.that its adoption was not worth while.    If they could.say that the Government of the United. Kingdom had so little faith in the Tndian Government as to send a.special Committee to examine the military budget, it.would, give a handle to the objectors . If, however, theUnited Kingdom Government were prepared to admit that by altering the terms of service in the British Armythey had.   imposed, budget charges for which no provisioriHhad. been made in India and that for the first year theywere willing to render temporary assistance by way of .a grant, and were to justify the desiatch of theCommittee on the ground that it was necessary tosatisfy them that due economy was being practised inIndia, it would ease the situation.   This was the moreimportant because the present financial year was a verybudgetbad one for India;  the^he-d only just balanced, and.revenue was falling off.    They were faced with a deficit largely due to the improved, conditions of theBritish soldier at a time when public opinion in Indiathought that the British soldier already cost too much-
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed the matter with the Secretary of State forIndia on the previous evening and had since thought the matter over.   He found, the greatest difficulty inthe plan proposed, by the Secretary of State for India.The two points of view were set forth in paragraphs and 7 of CP--174 (38), which he quoted.    If we wereto agree to the Secretary of State&apos;s proposal we shouldbe conceding the principle of paying maintenance charges,which would involve us in great difficulties and. makeit impossible to get right with Indian opinion.    Inthe circumstances he thought thai the first proposal should be adopted but that no decision should, be taken on the second.   He understood, -thai- in any event theCommittee, if it were decided on, would, not sail forIndia before October,After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve proposal (i), namely:-&quot;(i) That the War Office should be authorised,to arrange for the transfer of four british tnfantry Battalions from theIndian to the British establishment assoon as the necessary barrack accommo-dation is ready,   According to ourpresent information^ accommodation for two of the Battalions will be availablein April, 1939, and for the other twoduring the trooping season 1939-40&quot;.(b) That the proposal in recommendation (ii),in favour of the despatch of a Committeeof Inquiry to India should be referred ba.ckto the Cabinet Committee, which was in any event due to meet in the following week.
2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theiet President of the Board of Trade (CP.-173 (38))on and  circulating a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mines onthe inter-related problems of the inter-district co-ordination of coal prices and the future of the coalexport trade.    Tn his Memorandum the President statedthat the Central Council of Colliery Owners had.)resolved, subject to certain provisos concerning the adequacy of the levy and. the &quot;expectation&quot; of a contribution by the Government, to seek statutory powers by an Order under the Coal Mines Act to collecta levy of 3d. a ton on all coal produced and to use thefund, so obtained for reducing, as might be necessary,the price of British coal in contested markets abroad.Certain difficulties presented themselves in thismatter, and in the Presidents view action must wait until Parliament reassembled after the Recess.   Never-theless he recognised that something must be done to check the failing off and to recover ground alreadylost in our coal markets abroad through the competition of subsidised German coal.    Tn his  judgment an inter-national   coal cartel was the only satisfactory solution.Conversations on this aspect had. been proceeding betweenthe producers in the principal European countries, and afurther meeting was to take place on July 29th.   he proposed to urge the coal-owners to make the fullest possible use, in discussion with their European colleagues,of their decision as an industry to create a fund tocomba-t the competition of subsidised, foreign coal;    toallow&apos;the industry&apos;s representatives to say that theyhad. been in constant consultation with His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, who sympathised, with their efforts to pro-*tect the interests of the British coal export tra.de;and. to add, in his forthcoming talk with the coal owners,.,that the Government was  continuing to pursue vigorously-a policy of negotiation with Prance and, as opportunityoffered, with other countries, to secure by agreement the greatest possible scope for the export of british coal.-4r-
The President of the Board, of Trade explainedthat the Secretary for Mines had. been in attendanceready to advise the Cabinet at the Meeting the same morning but that he had important engagements that afternoon, so he had excused his presence.After some discussion as to the precise degreeof encouragement that it was intended to give therepresentatives of the coal industry, and of thepossible reactions of a collapse of the export tradeupon both internal coal prices and manufacture.generally, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of thePresident of the Board.of trade as set forth in CP.-173 (38) and summarised above, but only on theunderstanding that, he should exercise the utmost care to ensure that therepresentatives of the coal industry were not given any encoura-gement, ,      whatsoever to think that the Govern-Uy^l^u.^ $^*^t^^^l    ment were/pledgod to giv-e themfimncial support.   This decision,however, as to the attitude to beadopted, towards the coal industry should, not be treated as a decision that, in no circumstances would theGovernment consider financial assist-ance to the coal industry if theapprehended, threats to that industry,should mature.
*M ABRITISHNATIONALITYAND status of ALIENSBILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(85)-, Con-elusion 5,)g. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theHome Secretary (CP.-159 (38)) stating that the british nationality and Status of Aliens Bill ( a private member&apos;s Bill down for Second Reading in the House ofLords on July 21st) would effect drastic alterations in the existing law by providing that a British-bornwoman on marriage to an alien should retain herBritish nationality;    that an alien woman should notacquire British nationality by reason of her marriageto a British subject;    and that a. married woman mightapply for naturalisation in her own right.     Thequestion of the nationality of married women had beenthe subject of consultations with the Dominions atImperial Conferences and otherwise, but, apart from certain modifications  concurred in by the Dominions,it had not been found possible to arrive at any agreement with them,  for a. change in the existing law.The Home Secretary therefore suggested that the properline for the Government Spokesman would, be to summarise&apos;the history of the question;    to emphasize the import-ance of maintaining proper uniformity in the lawthroughout the British Commonwealth affecting the&quot;common status&quot;;    to refer sympathetically to thecases of hardship resulting from loss of british nationality on marriage;    to say that the government recognised, as indicated by the last Resolution of theImperial Conference, that the subject was one for stillfurther consideration;   but to point out that in thecircumstances the Government could offer no facilitiesfor the Bill.In the course of a short discussion it was recalled that this question gave rise to a good imany difficulties;    for example, in relation toalien enemies in time of war.
The Home Secretary said that he was fullyapprised on that aspect of the question.   At thisperiod of the Parliamentary Session, however, he felt that there was no alternative but. to adopt atemporising line the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposals of theHome Sfcretary as set forth inC*Po-159 (38) and summarised above o
4. The Cabinet had before them a. Memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (.CUP.-1.73 (38)) seeking authority to proceed, with the preparation of a short bill, with a view to its introduction as soon as thein orderParliamentary programme allowed.,/to remedy an unsatis-factory state of affairs relating to the statutory time limits within which certain actions precedent to thegrant or maintenance of a patent must be performed, atthe Patent Office under the Patents and. Designs Acts,1907 to 1932.   After explaining the provisions of theproposed. Bill the President stated, that it was limited,to validating old-established, practices of the PatentOffice and should be non-controversial.The President of the Board of Trade, aftersummarising the proposals, said that he had discussedthem with Sir Stafford. Cripps, the principal authority on the subject on the Front Opposition Bench, who had agreed, that they were desirable.The Cabinet agreed.  (a.) To approve the proposals of thePresident of the Board, of Tra.deas set forth in CP.-172 (38):(b) That the President of the Board ofTrade should, have authority,, if he felt that this was desirable, to.announce that the government intended to introduce a Bill onthis subject.
5 . The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-171 (38))relating, to the translation of General von Reichenau&apos;salleged lecture at Leipzig on the subject of the german attitude towards events in Spain and Portugal (CP.-163(38) , which had. been under consideration at the meeting mentioned in the margin.   Publication of the lecturein a British newspaper and. references to it in severalFrench newspapers had resulted, in the German Ambassadorcalling at the Foreign Office to deny the authenticityof the document.   The Ambassador had. telegraphed the gist of it to his Government and. had received a reply from Berlin to the effect, that the whole thing couldbe categorically denied and. that the German Governmentwere issuing a formal dementi.
