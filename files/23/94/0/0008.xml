FRANCE.The RoyalVis it to.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(38), Con-conclusion ion 1.)SPAIN.Non-Inter-vent ionAgreement.(previous reference:Cabinet 32(38), Con-clusion 4.)1. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairscommented on the notable success of the Royal visit to France and the remarkable enthusiasm with which their Majesties were received.    The French haddisplayed a fine combination of taste, quality andstrength as witnessed by the Military Review.   Hewas impressed by the high standard that had been set,which His Majesty&apos;s Government would have to keep inmind on the occasion of President Lebrun&apos;s returnvisit.    The Police precautions had been somewhatover-elaborate from the point of view of british standards.   He had. no doubt at all about the valuablepolitical effect that the visit had exercised abroad..He had. ha.d discussions with French Ministers, as wellas with French statesmen such as M. Herriot, M. Blumand M. Flandin.On the question of Spain the French Ministersdisplayed no feeling that they had been pushed, by us into action.    They said that in closing the french frontier they had acted on their own responsibility in the interests of non-intervention.The Foreign Secretary added that the GermanAmbassadorjf^discussing the Spanish question, had saidthat Germany and. Italy had done a great deal for Spainbut that after the war what Spain would, want was money,and. the United Kingdom was the only country that had that.    Consequently they would be the only gainersfrom the war.
gjPRAL EUROPE.aeehoslovakia.(previous reference:Cabinet 33(38), Oon-conclusion ion 3 .)2-. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat on his return from France on the previousSaturday he had found a deadlock setting in overCzechoslovakia.   After consulting the Prime minister he had. sent a telegram to the Czechoslovak Governmentcontaining the suggestion of a British mediator.He was glad, that the Prime Minister, in his Speech inthe House of Commons on the previous day, ;had made itclear that Lord. Runciman would be acting on his own responsibility and not under instructions from HisMajesty&apos;s Government or any other Government.   Thatwas a matter of some concern to Lord Runciman himself,who had suggested that this was &quot;putting me out in adinghy in mid-Atlantic&quot;.Later in the Meeting the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs read, a telegram that he had just received from Prague stating that the British minister had. had a long and friendly talk with Herr Kundt, therepresentative of the Sudeten-Deutsch Party, who had seemed quite well-disposed, to Lord. Runciman&apos;s proposed mission.    (For further details see Prague, TelegramNo. 407. of the 26th July.) &quot;&apos;     - -..The Foreign Secretary thought the Cabinet would be interested to know that some of his advisers who had.been inclined, to take rather a gra.ve view of theoutlook over Czechoslovakia now thought that the warparty in Germany had. received, a. check at the end. ofMay; and. perhaps x^ere receiving a further check by what was happening now, and. that for that reason there might be a. better prospect of a peaceful issue to theaffair.
The Foreign Secretary then stated that LordRunciman., who had invited an official from the RoyalInstitute of International Affairs to accompany him? had also asked for the services of mm Ashton-Gwatkin, ofthe Foreign Office^     He himself had no doubt as to thegreat assistance that Mrc Ashton-Gwatkin could render,which would not necessarily he confined to those economic matters in which he was an experts     The foreign secretary wished to know, however, whether his colleaguesthought that this would associate His majesty&apos;s government too obviously with Lord RuncimanTs mission,or whether they shared his own view that Mr, Ashton-Gwatkin&apos;s attachment to Lord Runciman was prudent and could be justified to public opinion on the grounds of his expert knowledge of economic matters.The Cabinet agreed -That Lord Runciman should be given allpossible assistance and that there wasno objection to the proposal that Mr.Ashton-Gwatkin, of the. Foreign Office,should accompany Lord Runciman on his mission,
29 93 .    The Secretary of State for F orrs^grLj^f f a^trvs-said. that in his talks with the Egyptian Prime-Minister-the latter had. raised, the question of the cost of theproposed, barracks in the Canal Zone.    This was working out much higher than he had. expected, and he had drawna doleful picture of expenditure of  12 millions onbarracks in the Canal Zone,  5 millions on strategicroads and bridges, and  3 millions on Alexandria Harbour.This would, leave ve:^y little money available for the equipment of the Egyptian Army and. might lead, to theTreaty becoming unpopular.   He had. suggested, sharingthe cost fifty-fifty.On broad politic&apos;).1 grounds the Secretary of state was in favour of moving on the lines suggested by the .Egyptian Prime Minister, subject to the latter agreeing to carry out the improvement of Alexandria. Harbour asthe responsibility of the Egyptian Government, and. totheir agreeing to three or four British officials beingattached to the Egyptian Works Department to help thembuild, the barracks .The Prime Minister said that there were two points to be cleared up:    first, what would be the extra costof accepting, the Egyptian Prime Minister&apos;s suggestion?Secondly, was it a satis fa. factory arrangement that theEgyptian Government should, be responsible for buildingthe barracks?Some,discussion took place as to the extra cost involved. .v. It was pointed, out that the origihal idea&apos;had been that Egypt should, pay the whole cost of remoAralto the Canal Zone, which was made at their request.. &apos; ... i        ...Later, it had. come about that the number of our troopswas increase^ by 25 per cent., and this was the reason why, under the Treaty, we had accepted the liability to pay 25 per cent, of the cost of the ba.rra.ck and
9  *lu U ijtechnical accommodation in the Canal Zone *   At thetime of the Treaty it had been -estimated that the totalcost would-be some  10 millions.    It was -true thatduring the Treaty negotiations we had. offered, to erectthe barracks ourselves and. to pay the cost, in eon-sideration for a grant of  5 millions from theEgyptian Government, but this offer had. been refused.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,that the latest estimate of the total  cost of the barracks, including R.A.F. requirements, was  13.7millions.    If we paid, half, our share would, thereforef-)&apos;tn*- ft. fy   ft  s- ibe about  6.8 millions, as compared with-Sjgtme-^^s^millions if -we paid -25 per centy^ He felt, however,that when the matter was examined it would be foundthat the only two practiea.ble alternatives at thepresent day were:    first, that we should, revert to theidea, of building the barracks and should, receive agrant of  5 millions from the Egyptian Government:secondly, that we should, accept the Egyptian PrimeMinister&apos;s plan.   He thought that there would, be verylittle difference in cost between these two plans, andthat there was a good deal to be said for accepting the latter, which would, please Egyptian public opinion...The Secretary of State thought that if-we imde no concession there was a danger that the Egyptians - wouldnot build the barracks in the Canal Zone, in which event we should, have to spend a large sum of money in repairing the existing barra eks in Cairo and alexandria-In regard to the second, question, namely, whetherit was a satisfactory arrangement that the egyptian government should, be responsible for building the barracks, both the Secretary of State for ,Var and theSecretary of&quot; State for Air said that in the view of
their Departments they doubted whether the EgyptianG-overnment was  capable of carrying out the work.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he.appreciated, the desirability, on political grounds, of reaching a settlement on this matter which would? be acceptable in Egypt, but he felt bound to point outthat it was proposed, that this should, be done at theexpense of the British taxpayer.   He thought that ifthis concession were to be made we should at leastmake certain that Egypt carried out the AlexandriaHarbour works.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed.The Egyptian Prime Minister intended to do this,although the cost of the works had now risen to  32millions.The President of the Board of Trade referred, to thefact that negotiations were now being carried on with egypt on cotton.    On this matter it was in Egyptrs powerto make a. concession which would be very valuable to us .He thought that it would be disastrous if we were to fail to use the opportunity afforded by negotiationsover the  cost of the barracks,to secure what we wanted,over the cotton .negotiations ...The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat he agreed that it would be necessary to ensurethat,if we made a concession on the barracks^we gotwhat we wanted out of Egypt over the cotton negotiations and. over Alexandria Harbour.    At the same time, carewould, have to be used as to how this matter was expressed, in order to avoid making undue political difficulties for the Egyptian Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought that it would-be desirable to get the Egyptian Prime Minister to enterinto as binding a commitment as possible on Alexandria
Harbour, before we made any concession on the cost of the barracks.The Secretary of State for War pointed out thatthe Treaty had been negotiated with an all-Party Government,If we made this concession it would be said that we had given the present Egyptian Government better terms thanNahas Pasha had got out of us.    Would not every succeedingEgyptian Government try to wring further concessions   outof us?The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat if the present Egyptian Prime Minister fell fromoffice, he thought that his most likely successor wasa man who could probably be relied upon to honour undertakingaentered into by his predecessor.Continuing, the Secretary of State said that theEgyptian Prime Minister was leaving on the 2nd august and wanted to know how matters stood.   He would like the assent of his colleagues in general terms to tell him thatwe would agree in principle to a fifty-fifty settlement ofthe cost of the barracks, subject to an agreement onsubsidiary questions, such as the satellite civil town andto our being satisfied with the Egyptian Prime Minister1sassurance on Alexandria Harbour.    The Secretary of state would also press the Egyptian Prime Minister again on thequestion of the cotton negotiations.    He suggested that ifthe broad decision of tfce Cabinet might be on the general lines suggested above, the Prime Minister, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, the three Service Ministers and himself mightbe empowered to settle any other questions that might arisewithout further reference to the Cabinet.The Prime Minister thought that, in view of thepolitical advantages to be derived from a settlement acceptable to the Egyptian Government, the course
proposed by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs was the right oneQThe Cabinet agreed(a) That the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs should have authority to tell the Egyptian PrimeMinister that we would agree in principle to afifty-fifty settlement of the cost of the barracks, etc*, subject to an agreement onsubsidiary questions such as the satellitecivilian town and to our being satisfied withthe Egyptian Prime Minister&apos;s assurance onAlexandria Harbour and the cotton negotiations!(b) That the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Service Ministers and the foreign secretary should be empowered to settle any other questions that might arise without further reference to the Cabineto
palest ins -(previousReferencetCabinet 33(38), Con-elusion5&quot;,4. The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedthat there had been deplorably heavy loss of life inPalestine during the last few days.   This, however,&quot;was not due so much to an increase in the number of incidents as to the very heavy casualties sustained.l^(36)&apos;0.    in a single incident where a bomb had. been thrown inthe Haifa market-place.   He feared, that it was neces-sary for his colleagues to reconcile themselves to thefact that these disorders were liable to continue forsome time to come with varying intensity.   he hoped the situation would improve, but it was unsafe toprophesy.   he had had conversations with Sir CharlesTegart and others on the question as to whether it wasnecessary to declare martial law or to alter thepresent regime in Palestine.   The result of these conversations wa.s that the right course appeared to beto continue the present regime.;    that is to say, tomaintain the authority of the Civil Administration,acting in full co-operation with the Military Authori-ties to whom certain powers had been delegated.   he felt that the main object was to maintain the prestige of the Civil Administration, which, in the long run,would have to control the country.    Consequently,unless there was an emergency of an extreme character,he advised that the ordinary Civil administration should remain in control.   This was the view ofSir Charles Tegart and of the War Office, and of theGeneral Officer Commanding in Palestine.    Owing to theexcellent co-operation between the General OfficerCommandi^ng^a^i^the High Commissioner there was little or no /)bB-^u^titMa by .the -M4^a?**a^-fee--%h^-,!;&amp;ivil Adminis-tratiory^ There might be points where, if the Militaryw^re in control, thejr would, do some things that were not
considered advisable by the present Administration,e.g., the use of the Jewish Supernumerary Police in.cases where the present High Commissioner thought thisinadvisable.   He was satisfied, however, that the HighCommissioner was using the Jewish Supernumerary Policato the grestest, extent possible, aad 4aAc own y.&amp;&amp;ejat-        .^ee-^^^gBa^^thi-c^mafcbcr *The question remained for consideration as towhether the present forces were adequate.   GeneralHaining was, he understood, at present satisfied.   TheDirector of Military Operations and Intelligence waswriting privately to General Haining on the subject.At the moment, however, he understood that no reinforce-ments were available except in case of a real emergency.In that   event it might be possible to speed up thedespatch of the new Middle East Brigade which was atpresent due in the last half of September.   He gaveparticula.rs of the forthcoming despatch of additionalPolice, and. added, that the Middle East administration was being scoured, with a view to providing some additional Officers for service in Palestine.   He was satisfied that the matter was being dealt with on theright lines, but no Army, however large, could stop the occasional throwing of bombs, which, there was little doubt, were being manufactured in Palestine.^he Colonial Secretary added that the TechnicalCommission were due to return early in August and.intended to start taking evidence in London on theISth August, when they would be in touch with theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee,   ^hey would report assoon as possible,
mThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, whilesupporting the policy of the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, hoped that there would be no great delay in his making his permanent proposals.    The effect ofevents in Palestine on the general position caused himgreat anxiety .   He had heard, a good deal from the PrimeMinister of Egypt during his visit to London.    Ibn Saudwas notoriously restive, and. the present High Commis-sioner of India had warned him as to the risks from aMohammedan point of view.    If trouble should, arise inEurope the position in the Middle East arising out ofthe Palestine situation might be one of great embarrass-ment.mhe Secretary of State for the Colonies agreed inthe importance of an early settlement.   He could not give a definite programme until the return of theRoyal Commission, but the kind of programme in his mind,was that as soon as the general trend, of the royal commissions views was known. Departmental representa-tives should, get together and prepare material on which ministers  could, work with a view to a. decision the.tcould be announced early in the new Session of Farlia-ment.    It had to be remembered, that the approval of theLeague of Nations would have to be obtained, to the new policy.    The first normal Meeting at v/hich the matter could, be discussed, would be in January, though it mightbe possible to get an ea.rlier Meeting.
5-The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for India ( CP.-180 (38)) on thesubject of the Indian Federation and the Negotiationswith the Indian States as to the Terms of theirAccession.    In his discussions with the Governor-General, on leave from India,, the latter had impressed upon him the importance of early initiation of stepsto secure the accession to Federation of the requisitenumber and proportion of the Indian States, in orderthat the Government might be in a position to inviteParliament to proceed with the measures prescribed, bythe Act for the inauguration of Federation.   TheGovernor-General considered that further delay inapproaching the States would merely facilitate thedevelopment of the organised opposition to Federationnow in progress, and that there was no immediate prospect of opinion among the Princes becoming morefavourable to accession than it was at present..After describing the problem, as a whole, the Secretaryof State dealt with particular matters of difficulty,.e.g., Customs, Federal Excises, etc., and sought theauthority of his collea.colleagues to authorise the Governor-General to initiate action with a view to. the earlycommunication to the States of an offer of terms of accession on the lines explained, in his Memorandum.He attached thereto as Annexure I the form of Instru-raent of Accession which he proposed, for adoption,,subject to final drafting changes.   Annexure n get out the releva/nt entries in the Federal LegislativeList showing the matters for which the States would berequired to accede either unconditionally or subject-to limitations
The Secretary of State for India apologised, for having to trouble the Cabinet with a Memorandumincluding Annexures of great technical complexity just before the Parliamentary Recess.   He had, however, felt bound, to bring the matter up because he was satisfied,that the time had. come to put to the Indian Princes theconditions on which His Majesty&apos;s Government wereprepared, to accept their accession to Federation.There were no less than 49 categories of subjects inrespect of which the Princes had. to consider theconditions of their accession, all of which were setout in Annexure II.    It was only necessary, however,to mention to the Cabinet the two cases of Customs and.Excise.   As to Customs, most of the Maritime states at present had. Treaties or Agreements enabling them toretain a. part of the proceeds of the Customs duties.These the Princes were unwilling to forgo.    In thesecircumstances he proposed, in agreement with theGovernor-General, that in the case of the MaritimeStates accession to the entries relating to sea customsshould not be allowed on the terms which the states were demanding, but that, the present Agreements should,continue and should, be enforced after Inspection, if need be by sanctions imposed by the Paramount Power.In the case of Excise the position was somewhat similar.The Viceroy was emphatic that no State that hadbenefited under the present. Agreements would, be willingto accede for Federal excise except subject to a limitation which would ensure to the States as amaximum the amount which they got in the year 193S-3 7.He agreed with Lord Linlithgow that the accession&apos;of the States in question for Federal Excises shouldbe subject to limitations which would secure for themthis position.
He mentioned the above two points because thedecision was one which might be open to criticism inParliament.   He emphasised that the various items inAnnexure IT were the result of continuous consultation between the Viceroy and himself over the last twoyears.    The whole situation had been explained to the princes two years ago, and since then they had. been considering the matter.   A promise had been given tothem   of a detailed statement of the conditions for federation, and. he was being pressed, now with theimportance of proceeding without delay.    One reasonwas that the Provincial Governments were becomingestablished, and. if they remained free from any co-ordinating Authority it might before long create a difficult situation for the future and. the bringing ofthem together would become more and more difficult.He asked, therefore, for the agreement of hiscolleagues to authorise the Viceroy to communicate tothe Princes the final terms as set forth in Annexure III;then to give them six months for reply;    and then,subject to a sufficient number being willing to accede,to put Federation into operation.The Home Secretary, a former Secretary of State forIndia, advised, acceptance of these proposals .   He warned,his  colleagues, however, to keep in mind, the danger that the Princes might refuse.    If that happened, theGovernment would be  confronted, with a difficult situa-tion which he himself had always wanted, to defer aslong- as possi^le^  He agreed, that there were some   -arguments in favour of going further now, ^ut he feltthat difficulties might result.   He was in favour of putting the position to the Princes and. of giving them what might be represented, as a final offer.   He doubted,however, whether a &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; answer could be obtained,
and further negotiation would probably be necessary.He agreed in the proposals as to Customs, but he regretted having to make a concession to the Princeson Excise.    Looking to the future, he did not want togive the impression that we were making terms with the princes,which would strengthen the extremists in congress.   While supporting the policy of the Secretaryof State for India, therefore, he urged caution and notproceeding too rapidly.The Prime Minister said that he had. had. a talk withthe Viceroy, who was  clearly very anxious to bringFederation forward as soon as possible and. had been more optimistic than the Home Secretary.The Chancellor of the Exchequer di* not dissent fromthe proposed, policy, which was an attempt to remove theobjections of the Princes to Federation by concedingsome matters that ought, not to be given to them underFederation.   He thought this might well be the beginningof further demands.The Secretary Of State for India. said that he wasconscious o^ the iropbrtance of the Home Secretary&apos;views.   He pointed out, however, that Federationdepended upon the accession o^ a. certain number of theStates, without which it  could not take place at all.As to the suggestion of further negotiations with the princes, he pointed, out that they had already received.two years ago an outline of the conditions which theywould, be asked to agree to ^or Federation.   This had.been explained to them by special emissaries from theViceroy.       The Princes, therefore, were perfectlyfamiliar with the conditions, and. the present offertook into account to some extent the representationsthey had made.    It ought to be made clear, therefore,that the present  conditions ^ere final.-IS-
The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for india should authorise the Viceroy to initiate action with a view to theearly communication to the Statesof an offer of terms of accessionoh the lines explained in CP.-180(38) .
h) *) 5INDIA. 6.    The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence reminded his colleagues that at their last meeting the Cabinet hadQuestions.    had be:fore them a Report from the Cabinet Committee on indian Defence Questions.    That Report had contained two(previousCabinet06&apos;&apos;   recoraraendations.    The first - that the War Office should beConclusionl)autho:rised to arranSe for tne transfer of four british infantry Battalions from the Indian to the Britishestablishment - had been accepted.    The second recommenIdation - that a Committee of Enquiry should proceed toIndia at an early date - had been referred back for furtherconsideration.In the last week considerable progress had been made.The position reached could be summarised under five heads.-In the first place, the Chancellor of the Exchequer had agreed to provide a sum not exceeding  5 millions to meetthe capital cost of the equipment required for the modernisation of the Imperial Reserve Division.Secondly, the Chancellor had agreed to increase thegrant-in-aid paid under the Garran Award from  l-g- millions to  2 millions.    This would help the Indian Governmentin meeting the recurring maintenance costs of the ImperialReserve Division.Thirdly,  the Chancellor had agreed to find thecapital cost of the new aircraft required to re-equip four of the existing R.A-F. squadrons in India as ComberScpuadrons.Fourthly, as regards the modernisation of unitsnot forming part of the Imperial Reserve Division, theChancellor had not felt able to suggest any financial contribution until a detailed enquiry had taken place toshow whether it was practicable for savings to beeffected, possibly by reductions in the establishment ofthe present defence forces in India.
Fifthly, it had been agreed that a Committee ofEnquiry should go out to India in the early Autumn to report whether savings could be made in Indian defence expenditure.It had been agreed that this Committee should comprise anindependent Chairman with representatives of the Army,Air Force and Treasury.    It had also been agreed that thei nvitation to this Committee of Enquiry should come fromthe Government of India.    A settlement of these matters had only been reached late the previous evening and it was for this reason that an oral report was now made to theCabinet.The Secretary of State for India said that in viewof the offer made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  andof the proposal that the invitation to the Committee ofEnquiry should come from India,  the objections which he had raised at the previous meeting of the Cabinet no longerheld.    He agreed with the recommendation made by theCabinet Committee,  as summarised by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the concessions which he had agreed to, had only been made afterthe most careful consideration.    It would impose a consider-able burden on the United Kingdom taxpayer.    On the Otherhand the concessions which he had made would not do morethan meet the most urgent items in the somewhat extensiveprogramme which had been submitted by Indian authorities.The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Cabinet Committee,  as outlined by the Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence,  and set forth above,
7. The Minister for Co-ordination of defence said that since the last meeting of the Cabinet,discussions had taken place between the Chancellorof the Exchequer ? the First Lord of the admiralty and himself, as a result of which a settlement hadbeen reached as to the total sum to be allocated to the Admiralty for the remainder of the quinquennium for all purposes.     He had orginallyproposed a total of  355 millions for the threeyears April, 1939 - March, 1942.     The FirstLord, on the basis of the New Standard Fleet,had asked for  88 millions more, or a total of 443 millions.      Settlement had now been reached on the basis of  410 millions, and it had beenagreed that the Admiralty should apportion this sum between the three financial years.     The FirstLord had furnished particulars as to the size ofthe proposed programmes on the basis of this figure.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that hewas grateful to the Chancellor of the exchequer for the extent to which he had met him over the sum to be allocated to the Admiralty over the next threeyears.     He wished to point out, however, that theNew Standard still represented the standard whichthe Board of Admiralty thought we should aim at,and that if we were to continue with programmes of the size now proposed for a number of years, weshould ultimately reach the New Standard.    Hethought it was a mistake to lend colour to asuggestion that the expert advice of the Board ofAdmiralty was being rejected.     For this reason he
was not altogether satisfied with conclusion H (iii)recorded in the Cabinet Minutes of the 20th July? 1938(33(58)1? and he would prefer to substitute for this conclusion the following.-&quot;In these circumstances? while notrejecting the advice of the Boardof Admiralty on the strength of theFleet, the Cabinet must decide thatfor financial reasons it is not practicable to lay down or orderduring the remaining years of there-armament quinquennium sufficientnaval tonnage to achieve the New-Standard.&quot;The Chancellor of. the Exchequer said that he hoped that the Cabinet would not make any alteration in the Cabinet conclusions of the previous meeting,which he thought recorded precisely what had beenagreed.The Prime Minister read out the conclusions reached by the Cabinet the previous week.     He saidthat he thought the effect of the First Lord&apos;salternative was that the Cabinet did really acceptthe New Standards  although they did not commit themselves to obtain that standard at any particulardate.     He himself would have difficulty in acceptingthat conclusion? and he was reluctant to modify theconclusion set out in the Minutfes of last week*cabinet.     This conclusion had been framed to meetthe First lord s point of view, and made it deal?that the New Standard was not rejected.The First Lord said that he thought there might be some difficulty with the representatives ofNew Zealand and Australia.     The former? at any rate?were under the impression *hat we had adopted theNew Standard.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat the impression he received from discussions withMr. Menzies was that if we pressed Australia hard5they would build a battle-cruiser.     Mr. Menzies had informed him that Mr. Parkhills  the AustralianMinister for Defence., had never informed hiscolleagues last year as to the strong representations which had been made to members of the australian government in favour of their building a capital ship.The Secretary cf State for the Dominions saidthat his information was to the same effect.The Cabinet approved the agreement reached that the total sum to be allocated to the Admiralty forthe remainder of the quinquenniumfor all purposes should be 410 millions
MERCHANTSHIPPING.Defence of.(previous references cabinet S(38)., Con-elusion 11.)8. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord of the Admiralty ( CP.-182 (38)) drawing attention to an important question Of policy which arose in connection with the arming of merchant ships at the outbreak of war, namely, the effect that sucharming, and the use of the armament when fitted., mighthave on the tactics pursued by the enemy in attackingour trade.    In the light of the arguments adduced inhis Memorandum the First Lord invited, his colleagues to approve the following proposals:-(i) That the recognised, policy should beto commence the defensive arming ofmerchant ships immediately upon theoutbreak of war:(ii)  That the instructions to masters ofships with an armament should, be tothe effect that they should use theirguns to resist any attack or attempt at capture by an enemy warship,submarine or aircraft, whether madein accordance with the rules of war ornot, as long as there appears t;o be areasonable chance of escape.The First Lord of the Admiralty said thatthe reason why he asked for a decision as a matter of urgency was that this was required to enable theAdmiralty to complete a book of instructions for theuse of the Merchant Service in time of war which, inother respects, was ready.     In reply to a question,he said it would not be necessary to announce thedecision, but only to include it in the dormantinstructions to be issued to Merchant Captains in timeof war.The president of the Board of Trade saidthat this made the arming of merchant ships more urgent than ever before.     According to his information, this was proceeding rather slowly.     Forexample, in the case of the stiffening of ships, theprogramme provided for only 800 out of 2,000 merchant ships to be ready by 19416- 22 -
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that ships were coming in for stiffening in larger numbersthan had been anticipated.,It was suggested that this was due to thefalling off of freights and the Cabinet were informedthat the numbers available might be even greater in theAutumn.The Cabinet agreed;(a) That the recognised policy should beto commence the defensive arming ofmerchant ships immediately upon theoutbreak of wars(b) That the instructions to masters ofships with an armament should be tothe effect that they should use theirguns to resist any attack or attempt at capture by an enemy warship,submarine or aircraft, whether madein accordance with the rules of war or not, as long as there appears tobe a reasonable change of escape.
9,    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theFirst Lord, of the Admiralty -(CP.-183 (38)) describinga proposal that had been put forward for the formationof Naval Erigad.es with a view to creating an outlet forthe large resources in this country of volunteers forsea service for whom the Royal Naval Volunteer Reservecould make no provision.    The Naval Brigades would, be formed under the control of recognised, bodies andwould be subject to Admiralty inspection.    their members would, undertake to serve in the Navy in theevent of war, and. would thus form a nucleus of the50,000 men whom the Navy would, require to enter andtrain during the first year of war.    It was proposedthat. Admiralty recognition should, be limited, in thefirst year to ten units and. to 1,000 men in all.   Themaximum cost for the first year woulr&quot; be  2,000,including a non-recurrent expenditure of  1,000..The First Lord desired. Cabinet approval of the principle involved, namely, that full use should, be made in peace-time of the voluntary material available, and. that no opportunity should be missed of increasing the number-of trained, and. disciplined men, even though the servicesof all of them might not be required, at the outbreak ofhostilities.   All details of schemes a.d.opted. would,of course be subject to Treasury approval.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidthat he had been consulted by the First Lord of theAdmiralty and had agreed to the circulation of his memorandum.      Since then, however, various alternativeuses   for our man-power had come to light such as thecreation of an Air Guard, new Air Raid PrecautionServices, etc.     In these circumstances, he suggestedthat the memorandum should be examined in the firstinstance by the Man-Power committee 
The Cabinet agreed:That the memorandum of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (CP. 185 (38)) should bereferred to the Committee of ImperialDefence and that, at the discretion ofthe MihiBter for Co-ordination of Defence,it should be examined in the firstinstance by the Man-Power Committee.
10.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theMinister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP.-178 (38))circulating for the information of his colleagues, atthe request of the Committee of Imperial Defence, aReport by the Standing (Official) Sub-Committee for questions  concerning the Middle East (C.I.D. PaperNo. 1447-B) on the measures -which might, be taken to influence those minor Powers and Arab States whoseassistance or even benevolent neutrality might be of value to us in time of war:    together with the relevant extra.ct from the draft Minutes of the 329thmeeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence (MinuteThe Conclusions reached by the Committee of ImperialDefence were a.s follows :-General.(a) That the good, will of ron Saud and other arab rulers is particularly important atthis juncture, in view of the situationin Palestine.The Saudi Arabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway.(b) To authorise the Foreign Office to informHis Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda. that HisMajesty&apos;s Government agree to the holding of a Conference at Jedda, to be attended.by representatives of Great Britain, France,Syria and. Saudi Arabia, with a view to reaeh-ing an agreement as to the repair of thedamaged, portion of the Hedjaz Railway.( c) That at the Jedda Conference the british representative should be authorised toinform the representative of the saudi arabian Government that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared to contribute 30,000 towards the reconstruction of the saudi Arabian section of the Hedjaz   Railwayprovided, that the Saudi Arabian Governmentwere able to make satisfactory arrangementsfor obtaining the remainder of the estimatedcost (i.e., some  300,000) of this sectionfrom other sources.(d) To note that the contribution of HisMajesty&apos;s Government could not stop at 30,000, since the restoration of theMaan-Mudawara Section (without which therestoration o^ the Saudi Arabian Sectionwould be useless) would, necessitate further expenditure, tentatively estimated at 100,000.
Proposal for the provision of an All-Arab Porton^the; Mediterranean Coast.(e) To take note that no action on the proposalfor the provision of an All-Arab Port on theMediterranean Coast could be taken pendingreceipt of the Report of the PalestinePartition Commission.South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.(f) That, with a view to the settlement of theSouth-Eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia on lines acceptable to Ibn Saud, the ForeignOffice and India Office should: be authorisedto take up the question of the cession bythe Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in the Persian Gulf known as theKhor-el-Od.eid;    and that, should compensa-tion in the form of a cash payment prove necessary, the expenditure of a sum tenta-tively estimated at  25,000 for this purpose should be provisionally authorised, subjectto the usual arrangements for obtainingTreasury sanction.The King of the Yemen and Shabwa.(g) To authorise the Government Departmentsconcerned to continue to examine thepossibility of finding a solution accept-able to the King of the Yemen in respectof the Shabwa area.The Supply of Arms to Ibn Saud and other ArabSt at eg.(h) (i) That requests for the supply of arms toArab Rulers should be considered by theService Departments as and when theyarose.(li) That the Foreign Office and India office should, be authorised to make arrangementsfor the investigation   by the local british authorities of the question of consoli-dating our relations with the minor ArabSheikhdoms .(i) That the Report by the Standing (Official)Sub-Committee on Questions Concerning theMiddle East (C.I.D. Paper Wo. 1447-B),together with the above Minutes and. Gonclu-sions, should be forwarded, to the Cabinetby the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence.In the course of the discussion, some doubts were expressed as to conclusion (c).     Questions were asked as to whether Ibn Saud realised that the contribution of  30.000 was only to be given on condition that he was able to find the remainder of the 300,000 required for the reconstruction of the 8audiArabia Section of the Hedjaz Railway?     Was it likely
that Ibn Saud would he able to raise so large a sum?If not, was this proposal likely to be of much help?If, as stated in paragraph 11 of Enclosure No, I to cp. 178 (38), the railway was likely to prove aneconomic burden, would not Ibn Saud&apos;s satisfaction be converted into resentment?The Cabinet were informed that what hadinfluenced the Committee of Imperial Defence was thatthe proposal was reported to have originated with ibn saud himself,,     The Committee had been influenced to aconsiderable extent by the immediate situation inPalestineo     Ibn Saud might prove a very important factor in that situation so that the present proposals wereperhaps more important from a short than from a longpoint of view.     The idea of the Committee of ImperialDefence had been that someone should go to Jedda to talk with Ibn Saud with authority, if he found it advisable, tomake this offer of  30,000.The Cabinet were informed that Sir ReaderBullard, His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Jedda, on whosejudgment the Foreign Office relied, had been immenselypleased to hear of this proposal and had said that itwould be most helpfuloThe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said,however, that if the matter could be placed on the Agendaagain on the following day, he would like the opportunityto make sure that Sir Reader Bullard had realised thatthe promise of  30,000 was conditional on Ibn Saud being able to raise the larger sum.Referring to conclusion (f) of the Committee ofImperial Defence on the South-Eastern Frontiers of SaudiArabia, the Secretary of State for India warned theCabinet that the Government of India saw strong objections- 28 -
to the proposal to take up the question of the cessionby the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi of a strip of territory in thePersian Gulf known as the Khor-el-Odeid, as they thoughtthat this would have a serious effect on the Trucial ,Chiefs, He was prepared, however, to pu-t-presour-e^-onthe Government of India in the matter.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, inreply to the Prime Minister, said that apart fromconclusion (c) which had been reserved, the Cabinet need only take note of the remaining conclusions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To take note of the conclusions of theCommittee of Imperial Defence at the329th Meeting as set forth above,subject to -(b) The reservation of conclusion (c) onthe subject of a proposed contribution of  30,000 towards the reconstruction of the Saudi Arabia Section of theHedjaz Railway until a meeting to beheld on the following day:(c) That in the interval the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs should ascertain whether His Majesty&apos;minister at Jedda, who is now inLondon, realised the conditionsattached to the proposed contribution of  30p0000
inOAD CASTINGWAR.eport ofabinetommittee *previous reference:cabinet 29 (38)conclusion 10)11.     The Cabinet had before them the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on Overseas Broadcasting(CP. 175 (38)), who had given consideration to theMemorandum by the Postmaster-General relating to theoperation of Relay Services and Wire Broadcasting(CP. 132 (38)).     The Conclusions and Recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee, as summarised in paragraph 27of their Report, are reproduced as an A.appendix tothese Minutes.The Assistant Postmaster-General explained the main issues from the point of view of the PostOffice.     His Department thought that a synchronisedservice could be safely carried out without dangerof guiding enemy aircrafto     It should also bepossible to have announcements at irregular intervals,even though aircraft might come within 50 miles ofthe synchronised stations.The Minister for Co-ordination of defence said that two main questions had been before theCabinet Committee.     The first was to what extent itwould be safe to utilise wireless broadcasting intime of war.     The Cabinet Committee reached theconclusion that Empire broadcasting on short wave-lengths should be allowed to continue, but thatcontinuance of long and medium wave broadcastingwould afford assistance to the enemy.      The second question was whether it was desirable to establishsome form of wire relay service.     The answer wasthat this could only be done as part of a long-termprogranmie and would cost about  100,000,000.     Fora short-term policy the Government, were, therefore,relying on a synchronised scheme of fixed stations.These stations could operate unless aircraft approachedwithin 50 miles.     In this event they would have to
close down, but it would be possible to arrange forannouncements of varying length at irregular intervals.As regards long-term policy, the Cabinet Committee thoughtthat there should be a thorough investigation into a .number of matters, including the development of wirebroadcasting (a highly technical matter) and also into thepossibility of two or three high-power stations situatedaway from the vulnerable areas.The Home Secretary said that this was a much moreimportant matter than the communications of any particular department, for which the telephone could be made to serve.The real question was whether, in certain circumstances,broadcasting should be shut down in an emergency, whichwould make it virtually impossible for the Prime Minister to speak to the nation.     He was afraid that in war, there might well be a number of simultaneous air raids, in which case the synchronised stations would, ^e^-the^es-^-pa-r-b,be closed down.      In his view, all this was very serious.Nevertheless, he was prepared to accept the compromiseproposed for a period of 6 months, provided that it was understood that enquiries would proceed in the meantimewith the utmost urgency to find a more satisfactory solutionof the problem.The Secretary of State for Scotland agreed with theHome Secretary^ views.     From the point of view of theMinistry of Information, he regarded it as of the utmost importance that broadcasting should continue in war-time.Nevertheless, he was prepared to accept the present proposal&quot;.The Secretary of State for Air said that he wasin agreement with the views already expressed.The Prime Minister said that this matter presented a dilemma, for which no really satisfactory solution had yetbeen found.     He thought that there was no alternative but to
accept the proposals submitted in the report of theCabinet Committee on Overseas Broadcasting.     Thisoourse. was agreed to.The Cabinet approved the Report of theCabinet Committee on Overseas Broadcasting(CP. 175 (38)) as summarised in paragraph 87of their Report and reproduced as an appendix to these Minutes.
12.      The Minister for Co-ordination ofDefence recalled that an undertaking was given bythe British Oxygen Company to proceed with thePort Talbot part of their scheme for themanufacture of calcium without awaiting thedecision of Parliament on the Caledonian PowerBills     In pursuance of this undertaking, theyactually acquired a site at Port Talbot and set on foot various negotiations for the supply of thenecessary limestone and other materials.     TheCorpach part of the scheme, however, was rejected by the House of Commons and this decision was regarded by the British Oxygen Company as creating a new situation.     He was now advised by theCompany that, after full consideration of that situation and especially of the present commercialpossibilities for the production of calcium carbide,they did not feel justified in proceeding with thePort Talbot part of the scheme.     He proposed togive an answer to this effect to a Question in theHouse of Commons the same afternoon.The Cabinet took note of the proposed &apos;reply by the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence.,
NEXT meeting of THECABINET.13.     The Cabinet agreed:To complete consi^e-s-ati^n of their&quot;Agenda Paper at a further meeting to foe held on the following day,Thursday the 28th July, at 10 &apos;downing street, at 11.45 sum.2r Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.27th July, 1938.
APPENDIX.REPORT OF CABINET COMMITT.JE ON OV.-JRd^S BROADCAST INC(CP.  175(38))Conclusions and Recommendations.(l)   As regards the question to what extent it wouldhe safe to utilize,, wireless broadcasting intime of war.Short y/avelengths.(a) Fe recommend that Empire broadcastingfrom the United Kingdom on shortwave.lengths should be allowed, tocontinue in war time but that this conclusion should be kept under close and constant expert review in thelight of the development of wirelessnavigational technique.Long andMediumfave leng;ths.(b) We are of opinion that continuance of longand medium wave length broadcastingon the peace-time scale would affordnavigational assistance to enemy air-craft of the highest value and would gravely impede our active defenceoperations.    Accordingly we endorse theSub-Committee!s recommendation thatwireless broadcasting on long and medium wave lengths under the existingpeacetime arrangements should be discontinued from the first moment ofthe war or in the precautionary stageif there are grounds for expectingenemy air attack before the declarationof war,.
As regards the question or whether, from thepoint of view of national defence,,  it ISnecessary or desirable to establish, some formof     wire    i relay, service&apos; .(a) We think that  to close down allbroadcasting stations for the whole&apos;period of the war as the only sureand effective way of denying allnavigational aid to enemy aircraft would be inconsistent with theminimum essential requirements of thepassive defence services^(b) We recommend the adoption in. pr-esentcircumstances of a short-&quot;term policycoveringj seys the next six months.By so doing provision will be madeto meet any sudden emergency that may- arise within that period and more time will be provided for the formulationby the experts and the considerationby Ministers of a permanent long-term policy.(c) Assuming that it is decided not to discontinue altogether wirelessbroadcasting in war-time we aresatisfied that the only practicableshort-term policy that can at once be brought into operation is thesynchronised scheme of fixed! stations in the two groups of four stationseach outlined&apos;in Annex I to Appendix I.We recomnend the adoption of that schemes which can be brought into existencein 48 hours? as a short-term expedientbut subject to the condition that astation must close down an the approach of enemy aircraft within 50 miles of it.To this condition must in.the interestsof passive defence be added thestipulation author!sing9when all.stations in a group are closed   down?the broadcasting   from all    stations in the group    at irregular intervals of announcements of varying lengthbut not exceeding two minutes induration;    the first announcementnot to be made until at least half ahhour after the stations have closed down and subsequent announcements atthe rate of not more than one per halfhour measured from the time of thefirst announcement.In the opinion of the Air Ministry that department should be authorised to postpone the issue of an announcement should the circumstances justify suchaction.
-term Policy.(d)    It will be clearly understood that,   oneHome Secretsry;s acceptance of our recommendation in regard to the short-term policy is conditional on his being satisfied that the arrangements now proposed will meet the requirementsof passive defence, while the short-term policy is in operation.-(e)    We recommend that a thorough investigation into the possibility and implications of developing a system of wire broadcasting,to such an extent in peacetime as would justify complete reliance upon it in war for passive defence purposessshould beundertaken and that the investigationshould cover inter alia the proposalsfor   a service to &quot;telephone subscribers?etc. j, contained in Appendix jl to thisReporte     We further recommend thatthis inquiry should be carried out bysome ad hoc body&apos; with an independent chairman.( )   We also recommend in connection with thelong-term policy that the Sub-Committeeshould make further inquiry into allother possible alternative solutionssincludings as proposed by them inparagraph SI of Appendix I9 thepossibilities of (i) 2 or 3 high powersynchronised fixed stations situatedwell away from the vulnerable areas;and (ii) high power mobile stations (a)synchronised., or (b) unsynchronisedslocated away from vulnerable areas.(g) We further recommend that the Home  Officeand the Post Office should considertogether ways and. means of providing^otherwise than by some form of broads-castings for the requirements of passivedefence in connection with the dissemination of Government announcements(h) We draw attention to the Sub-Committee&apos;swarning about progress in&apos;wirelessnavigation contained in paragraph 28of Appendix I.-, viz:that they may find it necessary at some future date to advise that further restrictions shouldbe placed on transmissions from v/irelessstations in time of war in view of the advances which continue to be made inthe development of wireless navigationtechnique and that therefore any solution based on the methods of wireless broadcasting so far consideredmay prove to have only a passing value and should not be allowed to delay thedevelopment of some practicable alternative arrangement of a permanent and more satisfactory character.-3-
Our investigation into the question ofsponsored programmes referred to us by the Cabinet&quot; on 22nd June lasthas been postponed and we hope to bo-in a position to report to theCabinet on this question soon after the Recess.
