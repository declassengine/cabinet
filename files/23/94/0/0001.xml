CENTRAL AND 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsSOUTH-eastern europe. recalled that at the Meeting referred to in the marginBritish the Cabinet had had before them a Memorandum by himselfInfluencein. suggesting the desirability of   action     on the partof His Majesty&apos;s Government to counteract the efforts(previous reference: of the German Government to extend their political,Cabinet 27(38), Con-        economic and commercial influence in Central andelusion 6*)South-Eastern Europe.   The Cabinet had decided torefer the question to the Cabinet Committee on Foreign&apos; SO 1**)]Policy.    That Committee had met and had decided toset up an Inter-Departmental Committee under theChairmanship of Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, who had accepted, the position.    mhe Secretary of State addedthat on the previous day he had seen Sir Percy Loraine,His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Angora, who had reportedthat the effect of the recent decision to foster tradeFR. 55&quot; (33)3. -with Turkey had been electric in that  country.   Theree.etion in Greece had been electric   by anticipa-tion.
CENTRAL EUROPE. 2, The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said.Czechoslovakia . that the Cabinet had been kept fully informed, of the(* Czechoslovak situation in the telegrams that had beenfPreviousReference: circulated. The Czechoslovak Government had acceptedCabinet 27(38), Gon-i Herr Henlein&apos;s Carlsbad programme as a basis of dis-clusion 2.)cuss ion.    Eusiness negotiations had. begun on theprevious day.   Dr. Hodza. had informed the british minister at Prague that he intended to get through these discussions in the present week and to submit the agreement to Parliament next week.    mhe Czecho-slovak Minister had. returned to London from Prague inan optimistic frame of mind.    In the meanwhile we had.to prepare ourselves against the risk of incidents by making available Observers whose presence might eitheravert trouble or have the effect of abating it.    Theyconsisted of a Military Officer and the British Consulat Innsbruck.   Meantime the German Press, wireless and Statesmen, such as Dr. Goebbels and Dr.Hess  ,had been doing their worst.   He was making representa-tions through His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Berlin.Connected with that matter was a difference of opinionthat, had arisen between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inBerlin and the -ritish Minister in Prague on thequestion of further military precautions contemplated by the Czechoslovak Government, and. more particularly the raising of the period of military service from two to three years .   The Minister at Prague thought this measure desirable from the point of view of security and the maintenance of order.    mhe ambassador in Berlin thought it provocative and calculated tohadprecipitate action by Germany.   He himself/consideredthe balance of advantage.   At first he had examined the desirability of telling Germany that we could not
press the Czechoslovaks to drop the proposal at thepresent moment, but that if the German Government wouldmoderate its views we could do so.   He had rejectedthis idea first because he had no reason to suppose that the Germans would keep their bargain, and secondbecause he did not think the Czechs would be willingto take our advice.    On the whole he thought that thebalance of ri?ht lay with the Czechs.   He proposed,therefore, to tell His Majesty&apos;? Ambassador in Eerlinto inform Herr Rib^entrop that, we could not put pressure on the Czechs to ahandon the plane    the ambassador would be told to say that, we had. put pressure on them some weeks ago and had hoped therefrom to obtain8 reduction of the tension between the two countries,but, so far as Germany was concerned, there had been no result.    Consequently we could not take the responsi-notbility now of advising the Czechs/ to take action whichthey thought necessary for their security.   He would point out that the Czechoslovak intentions involved norisk to Germany.The Secretary of St*te then recalled that the british minister at Prague had told. Mr Strang, of the ForeignOffice, that, even if the Sudeten-Heuts ch question was settled, the foreign policy issue was likely to beraised by Germany.   He himself had prepared, a shortPaper on the subject which he proposed should beconsidered first by the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy,    &quot;&quot;he Paper contained suggestions as to themeans by which we should endeavour to meet thefeeling of resentment in Germany against Czechoslovakpolicy.    The first move in this direction would merelyconsist of an approach to the French Government as to how the policy of the two nations towards Czechoslovakiashould be re-modelled.
SPAIN. 3. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs/Indiscriminate   reported that a statement on bombing in the SpanishBomb ing.^ hostilities had been made in both Houses of Parliament(Previous on the previous day,   Probably everyone felt that the reference:Cabinet 27        only effective remedy in this matter was to bring the(38), Con-clusion 4.)       war to an end.    No-one under-estimated the difficulties,F/?.2^3 ) 6.        ^e thought a.11 his  colleagues agreed that the possi-bilities of giving an impetus in favour of a settlementought to be exploreds,    Consequently he had instructedSir &quot;ilric Phipps to approach the French Government witha. view to their helping us in trying to obtain an armistice.   mhe idea was that we should try and obtainthe co-operation of the Italian Government.    It wasanticipate-1 that they would ask what the position wasto be on the French frontier.   Nothing more than an interim reply of a favourable character had beenfrom Paris.received^/    We had. asked for a full answer, but it had.not yet arrived, and if it was not received within twenty-four hours he proposed, to send, a strong reminder.ITALY. Meanwhile Signor Mussolini was pressing us to bringRelations with, the Anglo-Italian Agreement into force, and the French(Previous were asking us to hold it up until they themselves had.Reference:Cabinet 22 reached agreement with Italy,    On the first point we(38), Con-clusion 6.)        could not bring the Anglo-Italian Agreement into force1 until there was a &quot;settlement of the Spanish question&quot;0FRANCO-ITALIANR&apos;5LAmlONS . On the second point he had. had. to inform, the French(Previous Government that we could not agree to hold, up the Anglo-deference:.

He was seekingBP.2^(ii)i4-.a solution of both questions on the line of getting the French to promise to close their frontier during an armistice, and. on the strength of this promise ( if wegot it) persuading Signor Mussolini (if he really wanted-4-
THE FAR EAST .China andJapan0(previous reference:Cabinet 87(38), Con-clusion 5 o)/T/?.3o (3tf)3.an Agreement) to press General Franco to agree to an armistice.    Once the French frontier was closed, the franco-Italian Conversations might re-commence, but thisall depended on good will and decent relationsoReverting to the question of bombing, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs said that progress hadbeen made with the Commission for investigating bombingincidents.    The Norwegian and Swedish Governments had.agreed to appoint representatives.    No answer had beenreceived  from the United States of America, but it was anticipated that they would refuse and that we shouldhave to take their place.In the Far East he had done what he could to protest against the bombine of Canton.    If the proposed.Commission on Spain was appointed, it was possiblethat the Chinese might ask for a corresponding Commis-sion in China.    He himself saw no objection.
sSPAIN. 4. In reply to a question, the  Secretary of Sta.teNon-intervention   **or Foreign Affairs sai^ that the Earl of PlymouthCommittee .was seeking a compromise between the Russian Soviet(previous reference: proposal that there should he Observers on land in allCabinet 27(38), Con- ports used by foreign shipping and. the French proposalelusion 3 .)that there should he Observers in some ports only.
THE AUSTRIANLOAN.(previous inference:Cabinet 275.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer, who was requested by the Prime Minister to report on the position of theAustrian Loan, recalled that at the conclusion of thelast Meeting of the Cabinet information had been(58), Con-clusion 12.)    received, which indicated an inclination on the part ofGermany to climb down from the position she had taken.The situation now was that it had been agreed that weshould not announce our intention to crive notice to terminate payments under the Payments Agreement of1934, as the Germans had given us the right to termina.teif we so desired.    On the previous day, however, he had made clear in the T:Touse of Commons that rjCis Majesty&apos;sGovernment were free to terminate the present agreement on the 30th June without notice.    The Germans were nowadopting a stif^er attitude.   A Note had been received,on the previous day stating that they did not recogniseany obligation to pay the interest on the Austrian debt,but that as the british  Government had been called  onto make good their guarantee they would reimburse them.This offer, however, was  conditional only on a drastic reduction of the interest on the whole of the Dawesan&apos;&apos; Young Loans.    A reply was being sent today thatthis position was not satisfa.factory.    The situation wasa. somewhat anxious one.    If we were to set. up a ClearingAgreement the results would be very serious to Germany,who would lose all trade with this country.   Put it wouldalso be very inconvenient to us.    All his experts,however, were agreed that a stiff front ought to bemaintained.The Prime Minister agreed, that there was no alterna-tive to maintaining a firm front.    It was necessary tobear in mind the attitude the German Government had.taken up towards their own people about, the Austrian
adventure, namely, that the whole country had heenintensely desirous of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; and were onlyheld down ^y their former enemies, whose loans had been made for political purposes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in reply to aquestion, said that at present the matter was heingdealt with hy correspondence between Sir frederick leith-Ross an^  thfl corresponding official in Germany.It was rather interesting to note, he added, that someo^ the most important German financial authorities,including Dr. Schacht, were keeping clear o^ thiscontroversy.
D^F^nos. LOANS.       6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet, in strict  confidence, that the Defence Loan(previous reference:       had ha* a pood Pr^ss and had heen well received.Cabinet 7(37), Con-       The terms of the Loan were very favourable to theelus ion 13 .)public, the issue beine at 98 with 3 per cent, interest.These figures had been adopted on very strong expert advice.   The lists would not close until 3.30 p.m.,in accordance with the prospectus, but the applicationswhich had been received up to 11.30 were quite satis-fa factory.
7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies (C.P.-137(38)) informing his colleagues of the constitutional position that might arise in Malta as a result of an action recently broueht in the Malta Courts by LordStrickland, in which the Court of Appeal in Maltahad held that the Malta Letters Patent of the 12thAugust, 193 6., issued in pursuance of the Malta (letters patent) Act, 1936, were issued ultra vires, and thatin consequence all Ordinances passed under them wereinvalid.    The hearing of the Malta. Governments appeal by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was fixed for the 20th June.   The Secretary of State also informed his  colleagues that his predecessor and.himself ha^ been considering, in consultation with theGovernor, proposals for a revised Constitution formaltality including provision for some measure of popularrepresentation.,    In summing up his proposals on thesetwo matters the Secretary of State sought  cabinet authority -(a) in the event of the dismissal o^ the MaltaGovernments appeal now pending before the privy Council to make an immediate announce-ment that His Majesty&apos;s Government will ask parliament to validate retrospectively the letters Patent of the 12th August, 1936,which govern the present Malta  constitution and the Ordinances enacted thereunder;(b) -yo proceed with consideration of a. revised and morp liberal constitution for Malta;(c) to make an^announcement of His Majesty&apos;governments intention to introduce a newconstitut.ion either -(i)  in the event o^ the Privy Councilupholding the Malta Governmentsappeal, immediately following thatdecision, or(ii)  in the event of the dismissal of the appeal, at the time o^ the introduction in Parliament of the legislation neces-sary to safeguard the position in Malta,-10-
After hearing a statement by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies % supplemented by the LordChancellor -The Cabinet approved the proposalsof the Secretary o** State for theColonies as set forth in CP.-is(^8) and quoted above.-11-
8. The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat after careful consideration he had reached thedecision th* t a Royal Commission ought to be appointedto examine the whole situation in the West Indies.He had been preparing a Memorandum for the Cabinetsetting forth the reasons for and against, a RoyalCommission and asking for permission to announce it within a week or two.   Action had been precipitated,however, by an announcement thai the question was tobe raised in Parliament.    Consequently, a-fter discus-sion with *he Prime Minister and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, he had found it necessary on theprevious day to announce the intention of the Govern-ment to recommend a Royal Commission.   He thought itnecessary, however, to warn the Cabinet, thai theGovernment would have to be ready to spend more money on the West Indies than at present.    The Royal Commis-sion was likely to report that the present position was rather discreditable, and its recommendations were almost, certain to involve more expenditure.    Some ofthis might perhaps be obtained from the^West Indiesthemselves, as in some of the Islands^ taxation, wws-very low.    But part would have to b^ found from the mother Country.    It would be disastrous to send a royal Commission and then reject its proposals purelyon financial grounds.   ^he Chancellor of the exchequer had agreed that, notwithstanding this latter consider-ation, a. Royal Commission was the proper course,    ^heannouncement had been well received in the House ofCommons .    In reply to a. question, he said that a recent statement made by Mr Lloyd George that theonly telephone service in the Island was owned by an american Banana Company had. been true a. ye^r agobut he thought it was probably not true today.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that,notwithstanding the probability that a Royal Commis-sion woul^ result in proposals involving increased expenditure, the course proposed by. the colonial secretary was the right one.   He hoperi that the RoyalCommission would ascertain why it was that Cuba could produce sugar profitably without any subsidy, whereas the British &quot;Vest Indian Isla.nds were struggling inspite of a. heavy preference.   He woul^ like to put on record that it would not be sufficient for the RoyalCommission to recommend a. larger subsidy for the islands without full explanation.The Lord President of the Council said that theUnited States of /merica provided an unlimited market-for Cuban sugar, to which a large preference was granted.?he Secretary of State for the Colonies added thatthe best Sugar Companies in the -Vest Indies were ableto show a profit ,    Perhaps the Royal Commission would^e able to show how that profit could be extended toother Companies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer hoped that theRoyal Commission would discover how efficiency couldbe achieved and the precise action that ought to betaken.    It was not much use transmitting general recommendations to relatively inefficient ad^inistra-tions.The Prime Minister recalled that the Royal Commis-sion would be concerned not with Jamaica, alone but withthe whole West Indies.   He had been into the question and it seemed to him that there was no short cut tothe rehabilitation of the Islands *    &quot;Tiere were onlya limited, number of industries in the West. Indies,
and all were of an agricultura.1 nature.   mhe market for their products was limited, and, so far as sugarwas concerned, was decreasing.    It might be possibleto make the sugar industry more efficient, hut theprobable consequence would be to increase unemploy-ment, for example, by the adoption of labour-savingmachinery.    It might &quot;be necessary to take steps toenable the natives to obtain subsistence from theland without exporting the product of their labour.For that, more finance would be necessary, and. he didnot think that further expenditure could be avoided..The Cabinet 8greed.  To approve the announcement made bythe Secretary of State for theColonies on the previous day inParliament that a Royal Commissionon the West Indies was to beappointed.
JXLDING 9-    The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by theI^TIES. , ,    x,Chancellor of the Exchequer (C .P.-141 (38)) drawingF*-i,^3g),r2&quot;-attention to the serious financial and politicalreactions of the probable decision in an action nowbeing heard in the Chancery Court, relating to theconditions under which Building Societies advancedmoney on the security of freehold or leasehold pro-perty.    &quot;&quot;he common arrangement in roughly 70 per cent,of the current &quot;business of the Societies was that theSociety advanced 75 per cent, of the value of thehouse, with an additional 1^ per cent, on securityfurnished by the builder.    In the present action the borrower claimed that the Building Society was actingultra vires in taking collateral security, and the societies feare^ that the decision would go a.gainstthem.    Such a decision would mean that an immensenumber of operations by all the big Societies would be declared invalid -    They had therefore insisted on thepassage of a Bill relieving the-s retrospectively fromthe results of an adverse decision o^ principle.    Inthis event it seemed to the Chancellor of the exchequer that legislation was inescapable.    He therefore proposedto tell the representatives of the Building Societiesimmediately that it was impossible to legislate beforethe result, of the Chancery Court  case was announced,but that the Government Bill, besides  containing pro-visions defining &quot;collateral&quot;, must include other safe-guards described j.n his Memorandum.     If time affordedno opportunity to submit a draft Bill to the Committeeof Home Affairs the Chancellor asked authority for asmall hody consisting of the Prime Minister, the HomeSecretary, the Minister of Health, the Secretary ofState for Scotland, and. himself, to decide on the course to be adopted,
After a statement of the position by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the lines of his memorandum, a discussion took place in the course of which the LordChancellor reported that this was a matter which had come&quot;before him on more than one occasion,,      One feature wasthat the builders employed the Building Societies to do their financings      First they would obtain an advance of75 per cent, or sometimes more0     The builder advancedthe balance possibly on an inflated value.     If an unfortunate purchaser could not continue to pay hisinstalments, for example, owing to unemployment,  the societies would foreclose, obtain possession of theproperty and sell the house,     They claimed that the purchaser did not appear in the transaction,     This wasthe case because the purchaser was out of work and all hisinstalments had been confiscated.      The position was similar to what had arisen over Hire Purchase and ought tobe dealt with on similar lines0The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster reportedthat in the Southern Counties the position had almostreached one of a public scandalsThe Secretary of State for Scotland said thatthe Scottish law was somewhat different and the^Advocate-Oeuaoral wanted time to consider the matter and discuss it with the Department concerned,,The Home Secretary suggested that the Chancellorof the Exchequer should take charge of this matter.The Chancellor of the Exchequer consented.The Lord President of the Council suggested that advantage should be taken of the short delay before thecase was dealt with in the Courts of Justice to investigate the factso.     If they were as stated by the Lord Chancellor
it appeared doubtful as to whether the Government ought to validate the past actions of the Societies..The Secretary of State for Scotland suggested thatit might be advantageous to wait for an appeal in the eventof a judgment adverse to the Societies,.The Minister of Health said that from the point ofview of housing, it was risky to delay action on the lines proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer until after anappeal.    An adverse judgment, even in the event of an appeal,might easily have a very serious effect on the building ofhouses, which was already tending to fall off.     this involved a danger of increased unemployment.The Secretary of State for Air reminded the Cabinetthat the Building Societies held a very important place inthe life of the country so far as building was concerned.The President of the Board of Trade drew attentionto the danger of using the occasion for an emergency Billto lay down a new code for the Building Societies without adequate prior enquiry.The Prime Minister pointed out that in the courseof the judgment,  some harsh observations might be made whichmight compel the Government to do more than was contemplated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    In these circumstances,he thought an immediate enquiry into the facts would be useful.The Cabinet agreed:That a Cabinet Committee composed as followsThe Lord Chancellor     (In the Chair)The Chancellor of the exchequer the Secretary of State for scotland the Minister of health the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Attorney-general should be appointed to examine the question raised in C.P, 141 (38),and more particularly to enquire into the facts on which the policy ofthe Government would have to be based*
)R7M&quot;5N&apos; SiMPENSA01 TON.Previoustef erence:cabinet 4637), Con-jlus ion 14.)10.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary &apos; CP.-140 (38)) on the subject of workmen&apos;? Compensation.   He was constantly being pressed in the House of Commons and elsewhere tointroduce amending legislation, and there was nodoubt that many fes.tures of the Workmen&apos;s CompensationActs  called for careful re-examination in the light of modern ideas and developments.   He had come to theconclusion that the questions at issue were of suchmagnitude and complexity that it woul^ be practically impossible to frame any satisfactory legislationwi+hout the ba.sis of some comprehensive inquiry.He therefore suggested that the best course would beto appoint a Royal Commission on the subject, whichshould be given very wide terms of reference enablingit to review the whole working of the present system and to consider proposals such as had been made bythe Labour Party for the substitution of a State systeman^ generally to overhaul the working o-f the Act,together with the question of the modification ofthe employer&apos;s liability at common law in relation toany developments proposed in workmen&apos;s  compensation.Pending the results of this inquiry, further legisla-tion would be postponed.   The Home Secretary wishedthowever, to reserve the rirtit. to raise the questionof a small Bill next Session to give effect to therecommendations of the Stewart Committee on thespecial problem of compensation for cases of miner&apos;snystagmus, which were agreed, to by the representa-tives of the coal-owners an$ the miners on theCommittee 0
After a statement of the position by the HomeSecretary on the lines of his memorandum, a discussion took place in the course of which the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence recalled the difficulties that had arisen through the Government     not taking actionon the Report of the Holman Gregory Committee.   To appoint a Royal Commission to go into the whole matter when anumber of the recommendations of the previous Committeehad not been acted on might be considered awkward.       Hesuggested that some of these recommendations might becarried out without awaiting the result of the RoyalCommission,       Private Bills were frequently introduced on details of workmen&apos;s compensation and perhaps itmight be arranged that some of them should give effectto recommendations of the Holman Gregory Committee that were acceptable to the Government0The Home Secretary agreed that this possibility should be considered, but insisted that he would be in abetter position to deal with the Question if there were a comprehensive enquiry.      In reply to a question by theChancellor of the Exchequer, he said that he did not propose to include expressly in the Terms of Reference tothe Royal Commission the question of whether a state system should be substituted for the present system, but the reference would be so framed that the point would not be excluded,,The Cabinet agreed:(a)    To approve the proposal of the HomeSecretary in CP. 140 (38)  for theappointment of a Royal Commission onthe subject of workmen&apos;s compensationwith very wide Terms of Referenceenabling it to review the working ofthe present system, and to consider proposals such as had been made by theLabour Party for the substitution ofa State system,and3 generally, tooverhaul the working of the Act,together with the question of the
modification of the employer&apos;sliability of common law in relationto any developments proposed inworkmen^ compensation.That the possibility of legislationwithout waiting for the Report of theRoyal Commission on narrower pointsconnected with workmen?compensation which could be isolated,should not be excludedo
DIVORCE ANDNULLITY OPMARRIAGE(SCOTLAND)BILL.(previous reference&apos;Cabinet 49(37), Con-conclusion 4.)11.  The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Scotland (C.P.-136 (38)) repeating the request of his predecessorfor authority to facilitate the remaining stages ofthe Divorce and Nullity of Marriage (Scotland) Billby the grant of a small amount of Government time ifthis should prove necessary.   The Bill had now passed through all its stages in the House of Lo^ds, hadreceived an unopposed Second Reading in the House ofCommons, and had been dealt with by the Scottish GrandCommittee.    It incorporated the best features of theEnglish Matrimonial Causes Act, and certain features of the Scottish Bill of last Session which seemed topresent difficulty had been discarded.    In its present form the Secretary of State believed the Bill to be acceptable to all sections of moderate opinion, andthe Church of Scotland offeree! no opposition to it.After a short discussion, the cabinet agreed:That subject to the agreement of theParliamentary Secretary to the treasury the Secretary of State for scotland should have authority to facilitate the remaining stages of the Divorce andNullity of Marriage (Scotland) Bill bythe grant of a small amount of Governmenttime if this should prove necessary.- SI -
12. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandumby the Minister of Agriculture an^ Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland &apos; CP.-139 (38))relating to an extension of the Milk Acts, 1934-37,in which they pointed out that there will not now betime this Session for the passage of the necessary2--legislation to give effect to the proposal? of theWhite Paper on Milk Policy of July, 193 7 (Cmd.5533)and recommended that the introduction of the Billshould be deferred until the autumn;    sought authorityfor the preparation of a Bill, for passage into law before the Summer Recess, to extend for a further year those provisions of the Acts which would other-wise expire on the 30th September next;    and propose&quot;that the opportunity should be taken to implement the promise made in the White Paper that the Milk Market-ing Boards (an^ the Government of Northern Ireland)should, be released f^om any liability accruing afterthe 30th September, 1937, for the repayment of advances under the Milk Acts;    and that during theyea.r by which the period, for Exchequer grants forschemes for increasing the demand for milk is to beextended -(i) the sum of  7^0,000 should be providedfor the purpose of Exchequer grants on approved schemes;(ii)  the schemes to be approved should heconfined to those for the sale of milkat reduced prices for consumption byschool children, and by nursing and.expectant mothers,  and children underschool age.
After a statement &quot;by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries on the lines of the above memorandum, a discussion took place mainly on the question of whether a definite sum suchas the  750,000 proposed in the memorandum or, alternatively, 800,000 as proposed by the President of the Board ofEducation should be provided or not.The President of the Board of Education pointedout that the provision of milk was a Social Service and thatin order to carry out the policy of the Government whatevermilk was required for the schools had to be found.     He was advised that the sum of  750,000 was likely to proveinadequateo     The consumption of milk in schools hadincrease! as a result of the National Health Campaigninitiated by the late Minister of Health and himself, and the increasing tendency for children to take two bottles a daymust be taken into consideration.      It was also necessaryto provide for an increased distribution allowance in rural areas where the cost of distribution exceeded the amountallowed under the present scheme0      If this were not providednot only would they be unable to get milk supplied in rural areas where this was at present not being done, but they would fail to hold the position which they had won0      It must &quot;beremembered that the increased figure of  750,000 would have tocover not only the I&quot;ilk in Schools Scheme in England andWales but also the similar scheme in Scotland and the whole ofthe expenditure on the Ministry of Health scheme for cheap milk for mothers and pre-school children.The Minister of Health thought it would be a mistake toinclude a fixed sum in the Bill, though it might be mentioned inthe financial resolution,,     A difficult situation would arise ifthe campaign in favour of milk consumption went well and then theGovernment had to impose a restriction for financial reasons.   Hethought it would be administratively possible to keep down thecost somewhere near to the present limits, but it might be veryinconvenient to be bound by a fixed sum.- 23 -
The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged that theCabinet should accept the proposal of the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the Secretary of State forScotland,,     He pointed out that this was a temporary bill.      The present position was that  500,000 was providedfor this Service.     As it was not possible to produce apermanent measure before the Summer Recess, it wasnecessary to prolong the present position for a time.     Hewas prepared to agree to raising the  500,000 to  750,000.He did not think that the Government would be exposed to political attack if they proposed that sum in substitution. Evenif the Departments had a free hand, he thought it would bedifficult for them to spend more than this, moreespecially   as the permanent scheme would probably be inoperation in less than 12 months.     It was important to have a proper arrangement with the Milk Boards in regardto the scheme.     He had one observation to make on paragraph 9 of CP. 139 (38)*     That paragraph correctlystated that existing legislation authorised payment from public funds of up to half of the expense incurred byMilk Marketing Boards in giving effect to approved schemesfor increasing the demand for milk.      The principalillustration was, of course, the milk in schools scheme whioh.began in 1934 and under which children get milk to drinkat the exceptionally low price of l/- a gallon - one-thirdof a pint for -g-do     The formula under which the expenseincurred by the Milk Marketing Boards in supplying thismilk at this cheap price was calculated assumed   that ifit was not so supplied the milk would nearly all be soldat the full price as liquid milk.     There was every reason to believe that this assumption was not at alljustified but the point had only recently come to the clear notice of the Treasury,     The truth was that a large
part of this milk amounting to some 23,000.000 gallonswould otherwise have to be sold as milk for manufactureat a much lower price and the effect was that the taxpayerinstead of hearing half the expense was hearing nearly all of it.     This did not affect the contents of theproposed temporary Bill which would preserve the 50 percent, formula;   but he would ask the particular attentionof the Minister of Agriculture to the point as he wascharged with negotiations with the Milk Marketing boards in the future.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said he had received the comments of the Chancellor of theExchequer in writing and he was not in entire agreementwith them,,     To ascertain the effect of the scheme onthe Milk Boards was a very complicated matter.     His ownbelief   was that the Milk Boards lost on the transactionsHe would, however, prefer to discuss this question withthe Treasury at a later stage.     The real question was asto whether the sum of  750 000 should be included in theBill or not.The Prime Minister pointed out that this was only temporary legislation.     He did not think that that wasthe right moment to make a change involving an alterationof principle.     There might be a case for such a change in permanent legislation but a temporary Bill was not theright occasion for including it.The Minister of Health accepted the PrimeMinister&apos;s proposal on the understanding that the detailswould be swept up in the Bill   providing for a permanentpolicy.The President of the Board of Education made anappeal to raise the  750,000 limit to  800,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer urged theCabinet to adhere to the figure which he had already agreedto0
The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries and theSecretary of State for Scotland as setforth in CP. 139 (38) and summarised atthe head of this conclusion including therecommendation that during the year &quot;bywhich the period for Exchequer grants forBchemes for increasing the demand for milk was to &quot;be extended the sum of  750,000should be provided for the purpose of exchequer G-rants on approved schemes.!(b) That the various questions of importantdetail raised during the meeting shouldbe dealt with in connection with thepermanent legislation to be introducedlater.
JpREME C0URmJUDICATUREAMENDMENT)Jill.fpreviousiReference:jCabinet 17(38), Con-clusion 9 ,)13. The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-rand um by the Lord Chancellor (H.A.-19 (38))  cover-ing the draft Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment)Bill, in which provision was made relating to thenumber of Judges of the Court of Appeal, the performance by such Judges of the functions of judges o^ the &quot;Jigh Court, and the filling of vacancies among Judges of the Chancery Division:together with the following recommendation thereon by the Committee of Home Affairs (H.A.C, 10thConclusions (38) Minute l)&quot;mo authorise the introduction in theHouse of Commons of the Supreme Courtof Judicature (Amendment) Bill in theform of the draft annexed to H.A.-19 (38),subject to the amendment mentioned above ,and to any other drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.&quot;(i.e.,deletion of the words &quot;or more&quot;in line 28 of page 2 of theBill.)The Lord Chancellor said that the last reporthe had had from the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury was that he thought it might be possibleto find parliamentary time for this Bill.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the recommendation of theCommittee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
14o    The Cabinet had under consideration a Memo-)randum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(H.A.-20 (38))  covering the draft Anglo-Turkish(Armaments Credit) Agreement Eill, designed to confirm and give effect to the Agreement in theSchedule, in which His Majesty&apos;s Government undertook to advance by way of loan to the Government of theTurkish Republic sums not exceeding  6,000,000 forthe purchase of armaments in the United Kingdom.The Conclusions of the Committee of Home affairs thereon &apos;H.A.C. 10th Conclusions (38), Minute 2)were as follows:-&quot;(l) To reserve for determination by theCabinet the question of the minister by whom the Pill will be introduced:(2) To recommend, the Cabinet to authorisethe introduction forthwith in the Houseof Commons of the Anglo-Turkish (ArmamentsCredit) Agreement Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H.A.-20 (38), subjectto any drafting or other minor altera-tions that may bp foun^. necessary or desirable.&quot;A short discussion took place on thequest ir.n of which Minister should be responsible forthe Bill.The Prime Minister said that it was clearthat the Bill must be intended either as a commercial or a political arrangement - in fact,  it was mainlypolitical.    What was more doubtful was whether itwas desirable to emphasise this.      That was a question for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.    Inany event, he thought that a member of the cabinet ought to be responsible for the Bill in the House ofCommons.    Consequently it would lie between thePresident of the Board of Trade and someonerepresenting the Foreign Office.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat in that event the choice appeared to lie between thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Prime Minister as representing     the Foreign Office. If the Prime minister were to take it up, the Bill would be considered by theHouse to involve a matter of very high uolicy.    He did not want that,  especially as he was hopeful that similarlegislation might be introduced later.    He suggested thatit might be treated as a matter for the Treasury.The President of the Board of Trade pointed outthat neither in the Bill nor in its schedules was there any suggestion that it was intended to further theinterests of normal trade.    It would be seen that the Billrequired the Treasury to make advances.    It provided thatsums certified by the Treasury should be paid by way ofsuch advances out of the Consolidated Fund of the UnitedKingdom.    Frequent references were made to the responsibilities to be placed upon the Treasury both in the Bill and in theschedules.    He had no objection to taking the Bill, but heapprehended that Parliament itself might insist that ithad little relation to the Board of Trade and might demandexplanations from the Treasury.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said thatthe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had questionedthe desirability of including the words in brackets&quot;(Armaments Credit)&quot; in the title of the Bill.    He under-took to look into the question.After some further discussion,  the Cabinet agreed:-(a) To leave to the decision of the Prime minister the determination of the question of theMinister by whom the Bill should be introduced.
(b) To authorise the introduction forthwith in the House of Commons of the Anglo-Turkish(Armaments Credit) Agreement Bill in the formof the draft annexed to H.A-  20(38) subjectto any drafting or other minor alterations that may be found necessary or desirable.(c) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should look into the question ofthe title of the Bill, and more particularly the inclusion therein of the words&quot;(Armaments Credit)&quot;.
15.  The Minister of Transport said that the following question had been put down for him to answer in the Houseof Commons the same afternoon&quot;To aslc the Minister of Transport whenrepresentatives of the Trade unions concerned are to be invited to become members,  as was the case during the war,of the Port and Transit Committee. &quot;Some time ago a similar question had been raised,and the Man Power Committee had recommended that labour should not be included in the Port and Transit Committee.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence had thought this advice unfortunate,  and he agreed.    The Minister of Labouralso agreed with that.    Consequently he would like to givea reply to the effect that he was taking steps to securethe representation of Labour on the Committee.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said thatthe reason for the recommendation of the Man power committee had been that a good many enquiries of one kind and another were on foot,  and they had thought that ifLabour was included in one, they would insist on being included in all.    He had not agreed with the Man power committee, as he wanted to establish this link with labour.The Prime Minister agreed with his colleagues.He thought a little attention to the Trade Unionists inthis matter might prove very useful.The Cabinet agreed:-To approve the proposal of the Minister ofTransport that he should reply to thequestion on the following lines:-&quot;The Port and Transit Advisory Committeehas so far dealt with very generalaspects of the questions before them,but I am now taking steps to securerepresentation of Labour on thisCommittee.&quot;
