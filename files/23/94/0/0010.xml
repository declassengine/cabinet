WEWATIONALITUATION.entral Bar ope.zeohoslovakia.previous reference:Cabinet 36(38),Conclusion 1)THE PRIME MINISTER said he had been unwilling tobreak in on his colleagues&apos; holidays.      The situation,,however, was so grave that members of the Cabinet should know how matters stood.      He thought it was right thathe and the Foreign Secretary should tell their colleagues what they had been doing and how they viewed the situation, and should hear their comments.Sir Nevile Henderson, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inBerlin, had been recalled to this country and he thoughtit would be a good plan that Sir Nevile should be present during the discussion.      This was agreed to.(Sir Nevile Henderson then entered the meeting).The Prime Minister then asked the foreign secretary to give an appreciation of the situation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS gave asummary to his colleagues of the principal facts in thepast three weeks.      Just before the Recess, theRunciman Mission had been announced in Parliament andhad received a chilly reception from the German Ministryof Foreign Affairs.      On the 28th July, the foreign secretary had written to Herr von Ribbentrop asking forhis co-operation over the Runciman Mission;      On the3rd August* Lord Runciman had arrived in Prague.      Aboutthe same time news had arrived of the wide extent of theGerman military manoeuvres.      Our Military Attache in
60SBerlin had taken a serious view of them.      The widescope of the German military measures receivedconfirmation from a number of apparently independentsources, e.g. purchase of oil fuel for reserve, theimpressment of labour for work on fortifications, andthe stopping of leave.Continuing, the Foreign Secretary said that, inconsultation with the Prime Minister, he had thought it worth while to make an appeal to the German Governmentin regard to their military measures.      This had taken the form of a memorandum in which emphasis was laid onthe anxiety to which these measures would give rise.Our Ambassador in Berlin had been asked to send thismemorandum direct to Herr Hitler.      The memorandum hadduly reached Herr Hitler, but he had sent it back to theMinistry for Foreign Affairs.      Herr von Ribbentrop&apos;sanswer to this memorandum and to the appeal to him toco-operate in the Runciman Mission had now been received and had been circulated to Ministers.      It was entirelyunhelpful.On the 17th August a deadlock had been reached inthe negotiations between the Czechoslovakian Governmentand the Sudeten party.      This deadlock had been resolvedas a result of efforts made   by Lord Runciman, and negotiations were resumed on the 24th August.The Chief of the French Air Force had recently paid a visit to Berlin.      He had been a good deal impressed,in an unfavourable sense, by Field Marshal Goering.
The latter&apos;s attitude had represented anattempt to split Prance and Czechoslovakia and to leaveGermany a free hand in Central Europe.On the 20th August,  the German Ministers in yugoslavia and Roumania gave a warning that germany was prepared&quot; to intervene if necessary to obtain asatisfactory solution of the Sudeten problem.      In thecase of the communication made to Roumania, the german minister added that if Prance intervened, she would beresponsible for starting a general conflagration.A somewhat similar communication appeared to have beenmade in Moscow.At this stage the situation appeared veryunpremising.     On the 25th August, however, Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin came back to London and reported that the CzechGovernment were prepared to make proposals greatly inadvance of their previous offers.     They offered threeautonomous German districts, the removal of Czech police-from the German districts, and the exchange of German andCzech officials.THE FOREIGN SECRETARY said that he and theChancellor of the Exchequer had discussed with Mr. Ashton-Gwatkin the proposal that some eminent person should besent to see Herr Hitler, in order to facilitate theacceptance of a reasonable solution on the German side.They had thought that if anyone should be sent it should beLord^Runciman.     Lord Runciman, however, on being consultedhad been unwilling to visit Herr Hitler.The present position which had been reached was thus that M. Benes and Herr Kundt were engaged in negotiations with the assistance of Lord Runciman andthat M. Benes was prepared to make considerably greaterconcessions than previously offered..     These concessionshad been mentioned privately to Herr Kundt, who had takenthem quite well.
Meanwhile things were blowing up fast as regardsthe press in Berlin.      Our Ambassador said that theGermans regarded it as impossible for M. Benes to runstraight or for a peaceful solution to be reached.      Inhis own view, the essential thing at the moment was thatM. Benes latest proposals should be published at once.This would have the effect of tying him down definatly to these proposals, and would also show Germany that lord Runciman was producing results.      This would makeit much harder for Germany to intervene.How should we view the position as a whole?One view - and there was a great deal of evidence insupport of it - much of it from good sources - was that herr Hitler, against the advice of the Army and ofthe moderate party, was determined to intervene by force.     Three reasons were advanced for this suggestedattitude.     First that he believed that a solution couldonly be obtained by force5    second that&apos; he wished to wipeout the flavour left by the events of 21st May?    thirdthat he wanted a spectacular success for internal reasons.It was suggested that this policy was based on an estimate that France could not achieve much if she were to inter-vene, and that we should do our best to prevent Frenchintervention,The alternative view was that, while Herr hitler was determined to get the Sudeten German questionsettled this year, he had not yet made up his mind touse force for this purpose.     He was, however, determined to have everything ready.     This attitude was perhaps a
2 c 0mixture of bluff and reliance on force.The Foreign Secretary thought that this wasthe view of our Ambassador.The conflict of evidence was such thatit was impossible to say which view was correct.     He proposed, therefore, toexamine both.Taking the first view,  if Herr hitler had made up his mind to use force, theForeign Secretary did not think there was muchuse repeating what the Chancellor of theExchequer had said so well at Lanark.      Ithad been quite right to make that statement,notwithstanding that the reaction inBerlin had been one of annoyance.      he himself felt that the advantages of makingthe statement outweighed any disadvantagesfrom having made it;    but in his view there wasno object to be gained in repeating it.The only deterrent which would be likelyto be effective would be an announcement thatif Germany invaded Czechoslovakia we shoulddeclare war upon her.      He thought thatthis might well prove an effective deterrent.Against this it was necessary to take into account what would be the results ofmaking such a declaration.      It was clear thata declaration in this sense could not bekept secret.      He thought that it wouldprobably have the result of dividing publicopinionP both in this country and in the Empire.
He was not too certain what effect it would produce on the Czechoslorak Government.-He-would feel! extremely uneasy at making any threat if he was not absolutely certain thatthe country would carry it out.      He thought,that his colleagues would have to considermost carefully whether they were preparedto give effect to such a threat.The Foreign Secretary also pointedout that once our efforts at deterrent */ -i-intimidation had failed, there was nothing whichwe In this country or France, or Russia could do which would prevent Czechoslovakia from being orerrun by Germany.      It would, ofcourse, be possible to fight a war to makeGermany give up Czechoslovakia, but he thoughtit was unlikely that any peace reached at theend of such a war would recreateCzechoslovakia as it existed today.      It might,therefore, be said that there was not muchuse in fighting a war for an object which one could not secure.      He agreed, however,that there was much more in the present crisisthan the attempt to defend Czechoslovakia againstGermany.     We were, in effect, concerned withthe attempt of the dictator countries to attaintheir ends by force.      But he asked himselfwhether it was justifiable to fight a certainwar now in order to forestall a possible warlater.
Again, if Germany was t o absorb part of Czecho-slovakia, the result in the long run might not all be onthe credit side from the German point of view.      He hadin mind the gathering force of world opinion particularlyin the United States of America.In the Foreign Secretary&apos;s opinion, an invasion ofFrance by Germany was quite a different matter to an invasion of Czechoslovakia.   vWhatever our precisecommitments might be, we could not stand by and see Franceinvaded without becoming involved ourselves.      We were,therefore, directly interested in what happened to France,whether or not it arose out of the Czechoslovak crisis.It was, therefore, necessary t hat we should continueto remind the French that we were interested in theiractionscIn reply to the question whether, if Germanyinvaded Czechoslovakia, France would be likely to declare war on Germany, the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that he had put this question to the FrenchCharge d&apos;Affaires a few days ago.      Ihe latter had repliedthat he thought that, in this event, the position inFrance would be confused, but thats if war started,opinion would come round to t he view that they must take some action.      His own view was that, in such an event,the French would mobilize and occupy the Maginot line in force, and would consult us as to what action we proposed to take.      If we were against being involved inwar, we should, presumably,  try to exercise a restraininginfluence over the French.In reply to a question whether, if the Frenchmobilized, the Germans would refrain from air actionagainst France, the Foreign Secretary said that he didnot think that Germany would attack France unless forcedtu do soo
&amp; 0 3SIR NEVILE HENDERSON, asked for hia opinion onthis points said that in his view Germany would certainlytry to avoid attacking Prance,  in order not to involvethis country in war.      This country was the one country of which Germany was afraid.      At the present time,hundreds of thousands of workers were employed on the siegfried line, the sole purpose of which was defensive.This supported the view that Germany had no intention of attacking Prance.: THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS thenturned to t he second view, namely that Herr Hitler hadnot yet made up his mind whether to use force.Assuming that this was the correct diagnosis, hethought that there was not much we could do, except tocontinue to act on the &quot;basis of the Prime Minister&apos;s.speech on the 24th March, and the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s speech at Lanark on 27th August.      In effectwe should try to keep Herr Hitler guessing.      The factthat the present meeting was being held and the recall ofour Ambassador from^Berlin would all be helpful.The Foreign Secretary said that in the precedingweek he had considered the possibility of asking the FirstLord to take some rather dramatic action in regard tothe Fleet.     He had not done so, partly because theFirst Lord had been away, and partly because he feltthat action on these lines was not quite on all fourswith the other action which we were taking.      he mentioned that the Prime Minister had also consideredthe possibility of inviting the Opposition Leaders
to see hirn or summoning Parliament, but it had been felt that either of these courses might give rise tosome difficulty and create the impression that wewere on the verge of war.One very important point was to let it be knownpublicly that the Czechoslovak Government wereprepared to make a generous offer*      It was very important that M.  Benes proposals should be made publicbefore the Nuremberg Conference.      A telegram in this sense had been sent to Prague on the previous day.The Foreign Secretary mentioned that he had hadconversations in the previous week with Mr.  Churchill,to whom he had indicated his general attitude;Mr.  Churchill had expressed himself as reassured, and had emphasised the point that if we recognised the probablenecessity of going to France&apos;s help if she were involvedin war, we were entitled to give advice to the French.Mr. Churchill had referred to the possibility of ajoint note to Berlin from a number of Powers.     His own view was that,  if we were to invite countries to signa joint note, they would probably ask embarrassingquestions as to our attitude in the event of Germanyinvading Czechoslovakia.The Foreign Secretary said he had also had somediscussions with Lord Lloyd, who took the view that thecountry was not at present in a position to go to war.The Foreign Secretary added that many moderateGermans were pressing us to go even further than thePrime Minister&apos;s speech of 24th March, and said that, ifwe did so, there would be no attempt to coerceCzechoslovakia and the Hitler Regime would crack.For his part, he received these messages with somereserve.      Further, he did not believe that the internalRegime of one country was destroyed as the result of
action taken by some other countries.      He therefore came to the conclusion that the two   lines which we should pursue were? first, to keep Germany guessing as to our intention? and secondly, to do all that we could to forward the success of Lord Runciman^ Mission.There was no guarantee that this policy would be successful, but the only alternative was to make a directthreat to Germany.      He wished it to be clearly understoodthat if this policy failed;, the Government would be told that if only they had had the courage of their convictionsthey could have stopped the trouble.      They would also be accused of deserting the principle of collective security,and so forth.      But these criticisms left him unmoved.The Prime Minister thanked the Foreign Secretary forhis full and masterly statement.      He only proposed to supplement it by a few words?A decision must be reached at the present meeting as to how far we were prepared to go.      JVIany people inthis country and in Germany took the view that if we made it clear now that, if Germany used force, we should come inon the side of Czechoslovakia, there would be no war.Many people of this way of thinking also thought that sucha statement would probably be followed by a revolutionwhich would upset Herr Hitler.The Prime Minister read extracts from a letterfrom Mr.  Robert Boothby, M.P., which was typical of thispoint of view.      This letter reported the statements ofcertain German industrialists as followsThe Extremist Section of the Nazi Party thoughtthat the present occasion was their best opportunity.      Theplan comprised the partial mobilisation measures, the armingof the&quot;
Sudeten Germans, a Press campaign againstCzechoslovakia -- all working up to a climax atNuremberg.      Subsequently an incident would be stagedand an invasion would take place between the middle and the end of September.      They reckoned on a rapidmilitary success and on this country persuading the French to remain neutral.      It must be admitted that so far events had borne out the earlier partof this plan.In his letter3 Mr. P. Boothby said thathe had asked his German friends whether the successof this plan would prove ultimately to be theundoing of Germany.      The answer given had beenthat it would consolidate the power of the Extremists.The Prime Minister said that he had been sufficiently impressed by this repetition of the case for an immediate statement9 to go over in his mindvery carefully9 the possibilities of making such astatement.      But he always came back to the sameconclusion as that reached by the Foreign Secretary.No States certainly no democratic State9 ought to makea threat of war unless it was both ready to carry it out and prepared to do so.      This was a sound maximand neglect of it had in the past h^d unfortunate results s e.g.  the Schleswig Holstein case.      Again.,although It wags possible tha^ Sucfi a statement if madenow might avert war, it was not certain that itwould do so.      Herr Hitler was withdrawn from his ministers and lived in a state of exaltation.    He... v.. .     .-\ \:     .;-might well take the view that the statement wasbluff.      If he did we should then have to choose between being shown up as bluffers and going to war.
War might he forced on us and if so, weshould do our best.     War in present conditions X&amp;ks not.,he thought3 a prospect which the Defence ministers would view with great confidence.      The strategic position seemed to him to be somewhat worse than inMay, Prance being weaker and the position vis-a-visItaly having deteriorated.As regards opinion in this country, at themoment the Press showed fairly solid support for theattitude which the Government had adopted.     But if wewere right up against war, public opinion might wellchange suddenly.      There was also the question ofwhat line would be taken by the Union of South Africa.The policy of an immediate declaration or threatmight well result in disunity, in this country, andin the Empire.Finally, supposing the threat was made andhad the desired results on this occasion, would that be the end of the- story?    The steps taken on the21st May had not proved the end of the story, and people were now saying that it had produced inHerr Hitler a feeling of being thwarted.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thathe was in entire agreement with the reasoning of theForeign Secretary and the Prime Minister.      there might be occasions when the Government could take acertain line and make a success of it, althoughthe people of this country were only half persuadedof its Tightness, but he felt that any idea of goingto war for Czechoslovakia would produce conclusions &apos; .which could not be contemplated with equanimity.For example, there would be a strong body of opinion which would ask whether the Czechs had done all theycould to meet the legitimate aims of the Sudeten
Germans.     He was &quot;by no means -unhopeful that theForeign Secretary&apos;s line would prove successful. .He attached considerable importance to M. Benes&apos;latest proposals, which comprised substantial concessions, being made public as soon as possible.This would make a considerable impression on public opinion and on Herr Hitler&apos;s mind0It was impossible to know which of the twoviews or hypotheses mentioned by the foreign secretary was the correct one, but since on the firsthypothesis war was inevitable he thought that wewere bound to act on, the basis of the secondhypothesis which contained an element of hope.No injury could be done to peace by continuing to act on the assumption that the second hypothesiswas the correct one, up to the last possible moment.   JTHE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he was in complete agreement with the Foreign Secretary with theexception of one point, on which he thought thatthe Foreign Secretary had gone a little further than he intended.     The Foreign Secretary had saidthat this country could not see France invadedand stand by without going to her support.     he assumed that invasion included bombing.     he asked himself whethery supposing France declared war on Germany   Without consulting us, andsupposing we were not satisfied that the Czechshad done all they could to reach a settlement,&quot;we should be obliged to declare war in support
of the French?     France was hound &quot;by treaty obligations and we were noto      Further, we werein a most difficult position in the Far East.If we became involved in war, Japan would treatus as a nonentity^     Again, if we were involvedin war he thought that Italy would be bound tocome in and there would be further difficulties in spain,,     He did not know what would be the reaction on India if we were engaged in a major war.     He thought that the other members of theCommonwealth would be placed in a very difficult position and the position might lead to the breakup of the Empire,The existence of these dangers did notnecessarily lead to the conclusion that we shouldnot come to the support of France,      Indeed we might be obliged to do so both on grounds of honour and interest;, but he thought that these facts,together with the views of the General Staff asto our unpreparedness, were sufficient to make ushesitate for a long time before subscribing to theview that if France was at war with Germany we wereinevitably bound to go to her assistance.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he drew a distinction between an attack by France on Germanyand an attack by Germany on France.      In thelatter case we could not keep out of war.     Hethought, however, that in practice the situationwhich would arise would be a confused one,  in
which it would he difficult to say which party wasthe aggressor.     He thought too that each side,would sit tight in their own fortifications, andin that event we might keep out of war.      If,however, Germany started &quot;by bombing Paris we shouldhave to come to Prance1 s help.The Home Secretary referred to the importanceof continuing to press the French to consult with us,before they took any action which might lead to war. he also enquired what action had teen taken to consult with the Dominions,On the main issue he accepted the foreign secretary&apos;s conclusions.     He was against making any further declaration at the present time.     he doubted whether, if such a declaration were made, itwould do any good.He wondered whether there was any further actionwhich ought to be taken at the present time by the three service Ministers, or by himself as regards air raidprecautions.THE MINISTER FOR GO-ORDINATION OF DEFENCE said thathe agreed entirely with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views.He thought that if Germany overran Czechoslovakia, thiswould increase Herr Hitler&apos;s Internal difficulties.Further, if M. Benes&apos; latest offers could be brought intothe open and were regarded by world opinion as the basis for an accommodation, this might be a deterrent to herr Hitler.On the question whether we were ready to go to war,in a sense this country would never be ready owing to itsvulnerable position.     With a country as formidable as germany so close to us we should be bound to go through a period of suffering and serious injury and loss.     Itwas obvious, however, that at the present time we hadnot reached our maximum preparedness and should., not doso for another year or more.-15-
There was a further point, that we had based ourrearmament programme on what was necessary for our own defence.       We.had concentrated on the Navy and the air.We could not put an army into the field large enough&apos;to have any decisive effect for many months after theoutbreak of war.     A Naval blockade made its effectsfelt very slowly.     As regards the air9 apart from doubtswhich were felt as to whether air bombardment was a proper use of force, its use by this country would calldown strong retaliation against our own urban centres.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR THE COLONIES who was asked by the Prime Minister to deal also with the position vis-a-vis the Dominions (in the absence of the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs), said that he had listenedto the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement with increasingassurance.     He thought that it expressed exactly theopinion of the great majority of the people in this country.Two questions were involved.     First, should we go to warCzechoslovakia was invaded by Germany.     Secondly, should we go to war if France was invaded by Germany.As regards the former, looking at the matterfirst solely from the point of view of the United Kingdom,,we should not go to war.     Apart from considerations ofmilitary strength, we should be hampered by the opposition of a very large minority in this country.      Indeed^before long it might be a majority and not a minority.It was also necessary to consider the point of view of
the Dominions.-     It was extremely doubtful whether&apos;we hadthe political right (as contrasted with the constitutionalwe should go to war. without consulting the other unitsof the British Commonwealth.      This threat would in actual practice commit not only uss but^/certain olhoif&apos;Dominions.     Australia and New Zealand would certainlyfollow our lead in declaring war.     Constitutionallythe other Dominions were bound to go to war if we did9 butit was rather doubtful whether in f act they would do soin the case now envisaged.The result of consultation with the Dominions wouldprobablys therefore3 be that we should not be in a positionto utter the threat.      If. neverthelesss we made thethreats we should put a great strain on the loyalty ofthe Dominions and might break up the Commonwealth. /Purther9 he was doubtful whether the threatwould be effective in preventing Herr Hitler from goingto war.As regards the Home Secretary&apos;s questions theDominions had been kept informed of developments.     Hithertothere had been no reaction from any of them.     A telegram had been despatched the previous night explaining the seriousness of the situations but there had not yet been time for.any answer.     He had little doubt that theDominions would be in favour of holding this country back.As regards the second questions namely if france was invaded by G-ermanys this might involve a direct threat to this country;   but he thought they were not called uponto answer that question on the present occasion.^right) to make a threat that in certain circumstances
&quot;    SIR NEVTLE HENDERSON was then asked to give his views,      He said that the real question was whetheror not Herr Hitler had made up his mind to use force.There was much evidence that he had done so but none ofit was authoritative.      In Germany important secretswere well kept, and it was noticeable that all the statements to the effect that Herr Hitler had made up his mind to use force came from enemies of the regime whowould be unlikely to know the facts.     No one could have certain knowledge of what Herr Hitler had decided.One must therefore be guided by judgment and instinct.His own view was that Herr Hitler had made up his mind to settle the Sudeten-German question before the winter,but that he had not decided what steps he should take to this end.The Nuremberg meeting took place from the 5th -12th September.     If M. Benes had not by then come out into the open with his revised offers., he thought that herr Hitler would make some strong pronouncement atNuremberg.      Thus, he would demand a plebiscite, or hewould say that he would compel M. Benes by force tomake concessions.     If things were left as they stodduntil the Nuremberg Conference, Herr Hitler would thustake the initiative, and Lord Runciman&apos;s mission wouldbe left in the air.     He agreed very strongly withthe point of view that one must assume that the second alternative was right, namely that Herr Hitler had notyet decided to use force.iiei
Sir Nevile Henderson then replied to a numberof questions put by various Ministers.     He attached great importance to getting M. Benes&apos;  offers inwriting.     He thought that it would be better that thisshould be done at once rather than that Lord Runcimanshould go to Berlin.     The question whether at alater stage Lord Runciman should go to Berlin would,he thoughts have to depend on the immediate reactions in Germany to M. Benes1 proposals.Herr Henlein was not entirely in Herr Hitler&apos;spocket., although some of his followers were.He thought that the threats if made, would strengthen the position of the extremists rather than of the moderates.     The extremists would say thatwe were moving towards a preventive war.      If the threat was made Herr Hitler might draw in his hornsnow;    but that would not be the end.     He would presson with his rearmament.He thought that the views expressed to Mr.Robert Boothby by his German friends were to someextent fostered by their desires.The orders for partial mobilisation hadbeen worked out some months ago./   He himself didnot believe that the German Army had been partiallymobilised on account of the present crisis.      Onthe other hand, the naval manoeuvres recently announced rather worried him.   He thought thatthey had been announced in order to impress us.
As regards the relationship &quot;between Herr Hitler andHerr von Ribbentrop, the former now never saw the latter.The position was an impossible one.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER, asked whatwould be the next move, if everything went according to plan and Herr Hitler marched into Czechoslovakia.    Y/ouldit be a demand for the return of the Colonies?SIR NEVILE HENDERSON said that if Hitler marchedinto Czechoslovakia and took the Sudeten areas, he would realise that he would have no possibility of gettingcolonies from us.    He thought that the next move would bean attempt to blackmail us and that when that failed hewould tear up the Naval Agreement, and proceed to build upa large Navy.He thought that Herr Hitler attached little import-ance to Russia except as regards aeroplanes, and that hewould go forward against a combination of France, Russiaand this country.THE first LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY said that therumours were all to the same effect, namely, that onlystrong action by this country would stop Germany fromattacking Czechoslovakia^There was a story goingvround that the German Generalshad told Herr Hitler that they were not ready for war.Herr Hitler&apos;s reply had been that he was banking on aswift invasion of Czechoslovakia which would break down the primary defences within 5 days before we had timeto complete mobilisation.    He then proposed to hold his hand and offer to make peace, and he reckoned that thismanoeuvre was likely to come off.     The story went that
the Generals who had been strongly opposed to war againstCzechoslovakia had gone away from the meeting sayingthat perhaps the Fuhrer was right again.The First Lord did. not agree with the view that ifthis coup was made and was successful, it would weakenGermany,    On the contrary, he thought it wouldenormously strengthen it, at any rate for the time being.&apos;After all the Napoleonic Empire had lasted 20 years before it broke up.    He thought that public opinion in theUnited States of America would be much discouraged if we took no action in the face of aggression againstCzechoslovakia.    The view would grow that nobody didanything to prevent acts of aggression, and the americans would only be still further encouraged to keepout of entanglements.Continuing, the    First Lord said that he thoughtthat, if war came, the Czechoslovaks would fight bravelyand well and the French would go to their assistance.He thought there was a danger that we should consider thismatter as though it -were a question whether we should goto war to help Czechoslovakia.    In his view,   the position was that if there was a European War we should inevitably be involved in it.    On the question whether publicopiniom in this country would favour a statement that weshould go to war with Germany if Germany invadedCzechoslovakia, he thought that the people,would expectsomething tangible to be done in the matter, although theymight not have any very clear views as to what ought tobe done.    He thought taat we ought to show taat we werethinking of the possibilities of using force.    He had discussed the matter that morning with the First    Sea Lord
from the point of view of what action we shouldtake if we were contemplating imminent war.The Pleet was going to the North Sea in 14 daysftime.     This time could he advanced by 4 or 5 days.Likewise the &quot;Repulse&quot; could he brought back fromthe Mediterranean a day or so sooner and the &quot;Hood&quot;could be moved from the Eastern to the western mediterranean,        Another step would be to bringthe strength of crews up to war strength, but thiswas almost tantamount to Naval mobilisation.        he put these measures forward somewhat tentatively, buthe thought that the effect on public opinion of announcing that the Pleet was going to Scapa Plow4 or 5 days earlier, as an answer to the German navalmanoeuvres, would be advantageous,THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR AIR was against taking action on the lines proposed by the FirstLord at the present moment. He thought that perhaps the Minister for Co-ordination of Defencefsstatement as to our preparedness under-stated the position. Any attempts to bomb Germany
would bring a terrible retaliation on this country andhe would look with great apprehension at the prospect ofwar at the present time.     He thought that any statement that we should declare war on Germany if she invadedCzechoslovakia wovild divide the people of this country andthat in a few weeks&apos; time there would be a majority inthis country against such a policy.     He was in favourof every endeavour being made to secure some settlementof the present problem.     He thought that so faras possible Herr Hitler should be put in the centre ofthe picture in order to make him realise his responsibilities.      For his part he did not despair ofa settlement being reached.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR thought that a threat of war could only be made if there was an overwhelmingpublic demand first.      Such a demand did not exist.There was no way of preventing the Sudeten Germans from joining their compatriots.     If a world war broke outthen our position must be considered in the light of thefacts.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he concurred in the view thatno threat should be made at this moment.      Such apolicy would not have the country behind it and wouldnot be right.He agreed, however, with the First Lord that it should
not go out that the Cabinet had virtually decided totake no action if Hitler marched into Czechoslovakia.The importance of Czechoslovakia in the general picturemust not be under-estimated.      If this part of the frontcrumpled up, several countries in Eastern Europe whichwere trying to keep out of the German orbit would be absorbed in it and we would lose a number of potentialallies.Apart from the military aspect, he thought that a successful German onslaught on Czechoslovakia would resultin a dispersal rather than a gathering of the forces of moral opinion in the world.The Lord Privy Seal added that he was not quitehappy about the assumption that,  if Germany marched, wecould keep out of war.     Herr Hitler was stillhesitating;   we had to consider what could be done to stop him from going to war without having recourse to an open threat.      One suggestion would be that we should tellPrance that, if Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, providedPrance acted in consultation with us, we would back herup.Another suggestion would be some action in regard tothe Defence Services and Air Raid Precautions.     he wanted to see a policy of moderate action,  combined with a show of resolute strength.THE MINISTER OP AGRICULTURE AND FISHERIES said thathe entirely concurred v/ith the Foreign Secretary?s&quot;conclusions and arguments and had no comments to make.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP EDUCATION said he agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s conclusions.Indeed, he went somewhat further, and thought weshould have no support if we made threats to germany at the present time.     A strong Government in thiscountry was the best antidote to war, and in his View astrong Government would cease to exist if we embarked on a policy of threats.THE MINISTER OF HEALTH said that he agreed with theForeign Secretary, but felt some uneasiness as to theaction to be taken if the position developed.Suppose, for example, M. Benes published his terms and Herr Hitler brushed them aside, what should wo thendo?     He thought that the forces of moral opinion in the world would be weakened if it came to be thoughtthat this country could not be relied upon totake action in a crisis.      If Germany attacked France,then we should not be able to keep out of war.     Hethought that it was desirable to make some move to showthat T*re were envisaging the fact that we might be drawn into hostilities before the year was out.THE PRESIDENT OF THE BOARD OF TRADE said that,so far as concerned the immediate point at issue, he agreedentirely with the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary.
He was somewhat disturbed, however,-by the statements ofthe Foreign Secretary and the Lord Chancellor about theposition if France was drawn into war.    He found itdifficult to accept the view that, if Germany attackedCzechoslovakia, we should put pressure on France to&apos;localise the conflict.    He was very doubtful whetherthis was the right course, since this might be thelast opportunity of standing up against German&apos; aggression.It was true that there were grave deficiencies inour defence preparations, but the German Army leaders were also recommending that war should be postponed, and presumably this advice was given in their own interests.In a year or so Germany would be in an immeasurablystronger position for fighting a long war than at thepresent time.    He thought that every effort should be madeto reach a solution, but that this did not mean that ifaggression took place it was our duty to try to stopFrance from joining in.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER agreed -that if Czechoslovakia was attacked it must not beassumed that we ought to attempt in any way to dissuadeFrance from going to her aid.    He thought we underratedthe capacity of Czechoslovakia-to defend herself.    while he supported the immediate proposals of the foreign secretary, he was in general agreement with the views expressed by the President of the Board of Trade.,:-
THE MINISTER OP LABOUR agreed v/ith the foreign secretary&apos;s views.-   He thought that the positionamounted to this;    that a threat to make war couldnot be made on a hypothesis.    It could only bemade on the facts of a given case when it arose.He agreed that our policy at the present time should concentrate on getting M. Benes proposals made public, and on keeping Germany guessing. yTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views on the immediate question.    He thought that the question of going towar on behalf of Czechoslovakia, or indeed theimminence of war at all at the present time, had not really found its way into the mind of the public. ^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that he did not think they were called upon todecide at the present meeting what action.we shouldtake in regard to France,  should the situationdevelop and France become involved in war.    Hehad, however, been rather surprised by what hadbeen said by the President of the Board of Tradeand the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,His point was, not that he disagreed with theirattitude on the general question, but that if they took such a clear view on the matter, he wassurprised that they should hesitate to make thisclear to Berlin.
THE PRESIDENT OP THE BOARD OP TRADE said thatif Germany&apos; were at war with Prance we should be obliged to come.in.    At the present time, however,there was no support for this view, and indemocracy one could not leave out the intermediatestep.THE SECRETARY OP STATE FOR FOREIGN affairs said that it would obviously be necessary to defineour attitude further on this matter when thequestion arose, but he would not deal with thematter further at the present Meeting.As regards the First Lord&apos;s proposals as to theFleet, the contrast between the care which we tookto cut down our announcement about our naval manoe-uvres and the way in which Germany had announcedher naval manoeuvres was distinctly irritating.But it would, he thought, be rather playing Germany&apos;sgame to make an announcement that we were putting forward the time of our naval manoeuvres.    Hesuggested that when the news of German naval manoe-uvres was published, the press should be told thatthey Yifere at liberty to say that our Fleet also was going to Scapa Flow for manoeuvres.The Foreign Secretary then referred to three papers which had been handed to him inthe course of the Meeting.    One of them related to a rumour that Herr Henlein had been in communication with Herr Hitler and had stated that
it was too dangerous to put into force the arranged plan,and that the plan should now he called off and he shouldhe authorised to enter into negotiations with the czechoslovak Government.      The second was a telegram fromPrague stating Lord Runciman saw nothing inherentlyimpracticable in the acceptance as a general basis ofthe eight   Carlsbad points, subject to their being definedon suitable lines.     Lord Runciman might be prepared to,come out himself with the same definition should direct negotiations fail.     This was obviously a matter which,required consideration.     The third was a statement froma journalist to the effect that the German Embassy hadreceived instructions to deny,   that they had given thewarnings to the Governments of   Yugoslavia and Rumania onthe 20th August, to which he had referred in his openingstatement.      These views, if confirmed, might be somewhatsignificant.THE PRIMS MINISTER then summed up.     The Cabinet wasunanimous in the view that we should not utter.a threat to Herr Hitler, that if he went into Czechoslovakia weshould declare war upon him.      It was of the utmost importance that this decision should be kept secret.He asked Ministers.to bear this in mind In provate conversations.There remained the hypothetical case that, inspite of all our efforts to bring about a settlement,Herr Hitler might brush everything aside and have recourse to force.     What we should do in that event
&apos; JL ^could not be decided to-day0      He thought that if some such situation did arise, it would probably be found tobe very different from the situation as it was envisagedto-day, and the Cabinet would, of course, be called together at once to consider the position..Continuing, the Prime Minister said that his own view, which he held strongly, was that nothing shouldbe done in the nature of pin-pricks.       This conclusion,which he had reached independently, was reinforced by the messages which the Foreign Secretary had just received.     He thought that it was very important notto exacerbate feeling in Berlin against us.     He agreedthat we should go on with the naval manoeuvres, but hewas not disposed to anticipate their date or toi take any further action.       We should, of course,  continueto watch the position carefully.The Prime Minister then read out the terms of thedraft communique   which he proposed to issue to thePress   on the conclusion of the meeting.      There was general agreement with the terms of the communique andit was agreed that details should be settled by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary in consultation.A copy as issued is attached to these minutes as an appendix. .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE COLONIES said thatit would be necessary to send a telegram to theDominions.     It was proposed that the telegram shouldbe based on the phrasing of the communi que, but shouldnot give any detail of the decisions reached at themeeting..    The terms of the telegram   would be agreed with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.
In reply to a suggestion, the PRIME. ministers aid that he would prefer to make no statement to the leader of the Opposition as he thought that sucha move might result in embarrassmentsoCONCLUSIONS.It was agreed:-(1)   That no declaration should be madeto the German Government that ifthey had recourse to war to settle the Sudeten German question, his majesty&apos;s Government would declare war upon them:(S)    That the policy to be pursuedshould be that outlined by theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs, namely, that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should continue to acton the basis of the statement madeby the Prime Minister on the24th March and restated by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in his speech on the27th August.      In effect, we should try to keep Germany guessing as toour ultimate attitude:(3) That every endeavour should be madeto press forward the negotiations in Prague for a settlement of the sudeten German question:(4)   That it was of the utmost importance that M. Benes&apos;  latest proposals should be made public as soon aspossible and, in any event, beforethe Nuremberg Conference to be heldon 5th-12th September:(5)    That the question of our attitude inthe event of Prance becoming involvedin Yjar with Germany as the result ofthe Sudeten German question should be reserved for further consideration inthe light of the actual situation, if and when It arose:
7ft- to tk?/s    (6)(?)(8)(10)X(11)That we should continue to impress onthe French that they should consult usbefore taking any action which wouldinvolve them in war:That no step should be taken which wouldbe likely to attract publicity or toexacerbate feeling in Germany against us.      For example, the date for Navalmanoeuvres should not be brought forward:That when the news of the German Navalmanoeuvres is published,  the Pressshould be informed that they are at liberty to state that the Fleet is going to Scapa Flow for manoeuvres:That a communiqufe should be issued, to thePress stating that Ministers had expressed their entire agreement withthe action already taken and the policy to be pursued in the future, but givingno details of the decision reached:That telegrams should be despatched tothe Dominion Governments baaed on thephrasing of the communique, but givingno details of the decision reached atthe meeting:That no approach should be made at present to the Leader of the Opposition and that parliament should not be summoned..Richmond Terrace, S.W.1.31st August,  1938.
