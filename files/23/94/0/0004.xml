SPAIN. 1. The Secretary of State for Foreign-Affair aNon-Inter- reported that by means of an effort the Non-Tnterven-vent ion.tion Committee had reached agreement on the previous^Previous day and that the British., French, German and. ItalianReference:Cabinet 29 Governments had each contributed a cheque for(38), Con-clusion 5.)  12.500 towards the preliminary expenses.    The repre-.    sentative of Soviet Russia had made one difficulty,but this had been met by a. small alteration in theDraft Report that had   &apos;.proved acceptable to theother Powers .    ^he next stage was that the plan wason its way to the two Governments in Spain.   his experience at the Non-Intervention Committee on theprevious day di^ not inspire him with much confidence in rapid progress .   As Italy and. Germany had bothaccepted the Agreement, however * it seemed possiblethat General Franco&apos;s Government might not make much difficulty about it.   &quot;&quot;he agreement o^ the Barcelona.Government   was likely to depend unon theadvice o-e Soviet Russia.   He x^arnert the Cabinet thatthe document offered every facility for any party-seeking to make trouble.   As soon as it ha.d been handed to the two Governments in Spain the report would be published.    If both should a.accept, some further formal stage was necessary in London, and afurther fifteen ^ays would be required before themachinery got into working order on the frontier and in the ports, and two or three months was the shortest estimate       the time required before thefirst volunteer to be repatriated, boarded a ship.He understood that the principal delay was involved,in getting the volunteers first into camps.   Hewould do everything possible to expedite it.   he added that the Italie.n Ambassador had been very helpful on the previous day.
SPAIN. 2. The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsIndiscriminate       said that, on the previous day he had seen Sir R.Bombing.  Hodgson.   He had circulated General Franco&apos;s Note*General Franco&apos;note. about indiscriminate bombing to the Cabinet.    Apossible point o^ confusion arose out o^ the following(previous reference: phrase in paragraph 2 of General Franco&apos;s Note:-Cabinet 30(38), Con- &quot;It has never entered into plans of elusion 1.) National Air Force to single out,    \ ships of British nationality asFl?.32(-5v2-- objectives of its bombardments.&quot;It was not  clear whether this meant that british ships had not been singled, out as distinct fromships of other nationa.facilities . or whether it meant that British ships had not been singled out as distinct  from military objectives on land, in proximity to which they are lying.   A telegram had been sent to clear- up this point  (Foreign Office &quot;&quot;telegram No. 206to Burgos, July 5, 1938).    He feared that the answerwould be that General Franco did not deliberatelyselect. British, ships for bombing but that he. claimedthe right to bomb any ship in port.Proposed The Secretary of State,  continuing, said that theNeutralPort. shippers did not like General Franco&apos;s proposal of asingle port in Spanish Government territory wheregoods  could be unloaded free from bombing.    Theirreason was that all other ports would, in effect belabelled as open to bombing.   Another objection tothe proposal was that in the northern part of theGovernment territory there was no suitable port otherthan Barcelona.   *   -   Almeria was quite unsuitable.He proposed to take up the solutions which general franco was prepare* to offer about aerial warfare.He also had it in mind to send a private warning toGeneral Franco in which he would, make clear that wecould not accept his views on international law, and.would warn him that his present action was calculated
to drive us into violent measures. He was, however,anxious to avoid taking such measures, as they would of getting, any result from mediation at the presenttime.    He had reported, however, that General Franco&apos;sGovernment was  concerned about the extent of Germancommercial activity in Frankist territory.    They had therefore passed a law providing that future commercialCompanies must always have 60 per cent, of Spanishcapital.   British concerns, such as the Rio mintoCompany, would not be affected, as the law was notretrospective.    Tt was aimed at the Germans.He had reason to believe that bombing of ports hadbeen temporarily suspended.The Prime Minister, referring to the proposedwarning to General Franco, said ths* jl tb-^iiph he had.favoured it of qu(? timc^ ho did. not  contemplate &amp;Q*h&amp;%*What he had in mind was a. verbal Communication cat ion intimat-ing to General Franco that if he must bomb the SpanishGovernment&apos; s ports he must use discretion and. thatotherwise he might arouse a feeling in this country which would force the Government to ta.ke action.Such a situation was by no means beyond, the bounds of possibility if the sinkings were to reach, say, one ship a day.The President of the Board of Tra.de said that aweek ago the number of British ships calling at portsunder the control of the Spanish Government was very few.    Tf, however, General Franco goroaiotod iw. bombing,B^BW*wy* they were likely to return to the trade,   ^heAlmeria project was of no value.involve us in formidable consequences with othercountries besides Spa.in.PossibleMed iation.Sir R. Hodgson had said that there was no prospect
SPAIN. 3.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs proposed expressed the view that it would be necessary to make0 statement in Parlia-        some sort, of statement in Parliament on Thursday,ment.July 7th.   He did not think much could, be said pendingthe elucidation of the meaning of the phrase inGeneral Franco&apos;s Note on indiscriminate bombingquoted in Conclusion 2.   He thought that the idea ofselecting Aimeria or some other single port should, bere jected.
CENTRAL EUROPE.



Czechoslovakia.



(Previous Reference: Cabinet 30 (38), Conclusion 2.)



4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that the conversations were proceeding in Czechoslovakia. The whole atmosphere in that country, however, was probably slightly vitiated by Sokol. An exchange of telegrams had taken place with the British Minister in Prague as to the Comprehensive Statute to be introduced into the Czechoslovak Parliament. The Foreign Office view was that this was undesirable unless the Comprehensive Statute was accepted by the Sudeten Deutsch. Their idea was that the Statute should consist only of points which had already been agreed, and that other points should be left over for subsequent settlement. There had been an idea of holding in readiness a British mediator who could go to Czechoslovakia and get in touch with both parties in the event of a breakdown. Mr Newton reported his own view that the Czechoslovaks might reject the proposal if we made it plain, as we should have to do, we should not hold ourselves committed to what the mediation might suggest.


ITALY. 5. &quot;&quot;he Secretary       State for Foreign AffairsRelations drew attention to a telegram from His Majesty&apos;with.Ambassador in Rome (Wo .133 of July 2nd)  containing* (Previous a memorandum, written by Signor Mussolini himself,Reference:Cabinet 29 complaining that,whereas the Italian Government had(38), Con-clusion 4.) carried out the Anglo-Italian Agreement, there hadbeen no corresponding contribution on the part ofGreat Britain:    objecting to the idea of proposingah armistice to General Franco;    refusing a uni-lateral withdrawal of Italian volunteers:    andadmitting that for the application of the Agreementthere was nothing else but to await the development ofevents in Spain, though this delay, in the view ofthe Fascist Government, risked  compromising the moral effects of the Agreement.   mhe memorandumfurther repudiated any connection between the eventual Italo-french Agreements or the resumptionof italo-Frenoh Conversations and. the application of anglo-Italian Agreements.    In communicating thememorandum to the &quot;Sari of Perth, Count. Ciano had.said that Signor Mussolini desired publicity to the notes that had been interchanged, including his ownmemorandum.   The Foreign Secretary said, that the viewof the Foreign Office was that Signor Mussolini wasannoyed at events in Spain and at General Franco&apos;sslow progress :    that he was animated, by anti-Frenchsentiments;   was upset by the references in theBritish and French Press to the grain restrictions in Italy and their subsequent cancellation, as wellas by our recent policy in ^turkey and Bulgaria.There was probably force in the suggestion thatwas made at the Cabinet that an attempt to separate* Great Britain from France was In Signor Mussolini&apos;mind.   We had, however, always made it plain that
while we were anxious that the Franco-ItalianConversations should he maintained, we did not insist on their success as a condition of the Anglo-italian agreement:    in other words, that we desired to seethe Anglo-Italian Conversations  completed, by Franco-Italian Conversations, but not as a condition of the ratification of the former,In the course of the discussion it was pointed outthat Signor Mussolini was completely wrong in suggest-ing that he had fulfilled his contract but we had notfulfilled ours,Some emphasis was placed on the danger of publica-tion of&quot; Signor Mussolini&apos;s memorandum, the politicaleffects of which might mean an end. to the Anglo-italian agreement.    It was suggested that an answer should be drafted, which it would be difficult for Signor Mussolinito publish-The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs read the heads of a draft- answer as follows :-We should recognise that Italy had beenhelpful at the Non-intervention Committee.We should make  clear that we had nevermade any secret of our condition thatthe Spanish situation must be cleared up.We should express our inability to acceptthe imputation that we had of.one nothing in return for the withdrawal of troops from. Libya and the stopping of the Baribroa.dcasts ^We should, point out  that we had. already informed the Italian Government that thecoming into force of our Agreement, wasnot dependent on the Franco-ItalianConversations, though we regretted thathe refused, to continue those until ourown Agreement wa.s in force.Failing his acceptance of our suggestionsor his making suggestions himself,, wecould only agree with him that we must,wait to ratify the Agreement, meanwhilepushing on with *he British plan.We should hope also that neither Governmentwould do anything to render the situationmore d if fi cult.
We should express the hope that delay would not annul the Agreementao-thijmou2H hn held t,&quot; juntify thr nttitmdrof-.....the- -late Foroign -Soorgt-a/ry- .In addition, he would mention that we deprecated,publication df the memorandum.    Generally speaking,our attitude should be one of frankness and good. will.The Prime Minister hoped that Signor Mussolini&apos;smemorandum would not be taken too seriously.   Experi-ence showed that dictators were liable to gusts of illtemper,    ^he arguments mentioned, by the foreign secretary did not meet Signor Mussolini&apos;s real point,which was that  Italy desired above all things Britishrecognition of her position in Abyssinia.   Unfortunatelthis  could not be given because the Spanish war stillcontinued .   Added, to this , General Franco had not succeeded in winning!    the bread supply of Italy had failed:    the orders issued, had. had to be rescinded;and Signor Mussolini had got in a temper.   He (thePrime Minster), however, felt that we ought to be ableto get round this point, if only for the reason thatthe Italian people were well satisfied, with the Anglo-Italian Agreement, a rupture of which would be no advantage to the Duce.   He agreed that it was very important that the memorandum should not be published.
CHINA. 6. The Cabinet had. before them tfce following MostAssistance Secret documents on the subject of Assistance totb.China:-(Previous A Memorandum by the Secretary of StateReference: for Foreign Affairs (CP.-152 (38))Cabinet 30 posing the question whether His Majesty&apos;s(38), Con- Government should provide financialelusion 3.) support to China to the extent of/ . w  20,000,000, and adducing argumentsfrR-3 L    J &apos; which led him to the conclusion thatthe necessity and the possibility of doing something to protect Britishinterests and prestige in China andin Asia should, on balance, outweigh the risk and consequences of Japaneseresentment:A Memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer ( CP.-157 (38))  putting forward considerations of the utmost-gravity on the other side, and drawinghis colleagues&apos;  special attention tothe possible consequences to ourselvesof intervening in the Sino-Japaneseconflict, having regard, to the dangerousstate of Europe.The discussion showed that the arguments for and.against the provision of financial support to china were very nicely balanced.    The Chinese, with theirbacks to the wall against a peculiarly brutal aggression by Japan, were fighting the battle of Western nations in the Far East.    If Japan obtained, control of a large part of China, British trade would gradually be frozenout, as had already happened in Manchukuo.   A Deputa-tion which the Foreign Office had received, on theprevious day from the China Association ha.d beenunanimous on this subject, though some members of ithad not been favourable to the proposed, financial support owing to the hostility that, it would provokein Japan.    The proposal was  consistent with theResolutions adopted at Geneva, which so far it hadbeen found impossible to implement.    Most of the experts on China, were reported to agree that great danger to that country arose from the collapse of the
currency.   While the propos-al  oould- be -&quot;^jr^e^ertt-enand supported a.s a British interest,  the loan couldnot be tied, up by conditions which would prevent theChinese Government from a.pplying it to var purposes .It was admitted, therefore, that the loan would,amount to intervention on behalf o^ China.    attention was drawn, however, to the following telegram that had been received  from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in japan:-&quot;I have received hints from fairlyresponsible quarters that Anglo-Japanese a.ction (to be taken withthe assent a.nd. co-operation of chinese Government) for preventingcollapse of Chinese national currencywould, if obtainable, be agreeable to Japanese Government...........11(mokyo telegram No.815, of 5th July .)The Foreign Secretary had already sent a telegramasking for the precise meaning of this passage.The Cabinet were informed that India was watching the struggle between China, and. Japan with the utmostinterest, with a strong bias in favour of China.Something was being done in Burma, to improvecommunications with China.    If nothing was done bythis  country it. would  give the impression that wewere afraid to act or were unable to do anything.The a-dmission that the proposal amounted tointervention in China was used, as a. powerful argu-ment. against its adoption.    In this  connectionattention was drawn to the earlier warnings of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tokyo as to the effect itwould, have in the alienation of Japanese opinion fromthis country. It was suggested that the realground for the proposal was to secure China fromdefeat.     SO millions, however, was not likely to prove sufficient for this.   What was to happen at
the end of the year if this proved, to be the case?Were we to find another  20 millions?   As to theviews of the China Association, they would naturallywant a backing for China, and it was particularlysignificant that some members of it did not. want it.The passage quoted above from Sir bes-Iie- Cragie&apos; telegram showed, that what the Japanese had in mind was Anglo-Japanese action, and did not detract fromthe gravity of the Ambassador&apos; s warning againstpurely British action.    It. was sta.ted that some ofthe experts did. not consider that the collapse ofthe currency would have such critically serious consequences -^s had been suggested.    China had great powers of resilience.   The first effect of a collapsewould probably be the suspension of payment ofinterest on Bonds which had hitherto been paid.The effect on British banks would, of course, be serious, but,  in the view of some experts, notcatastrophic.    Whatever financial resources were left, after colla.pse of the currency would, be used for financing the war instead of for paying the interest on debts .    One suggestion was that if the  20 millionswere forthcoming it. would involve us in doing every-thing we could to help China to win the war.   Wecould, not stop at that point,It was stated that a somewhat similar proposal had been made at Geneva a year ago by Dr. Kung, whohad openly admitted that his object, was politicalin order to bring out the fact that the UnitedKingdom was on the side of China.   While the latestproposal was in line with the Resolution taken atthe League of Nations, it. was stated that it wentbeyond what had. then been visualised.
Another reason given against the proposed financial support to China was that, as  constantly urged by theChiefs of Staff Sub-Committee, it was very important to avoid, simultaneous war with Germany,  Italy and japan.   At the present moment, when our relations with italy threatened, to deteriorate, it would be a great mistake to antagonise Japan.   Failure to supportChina might involve loss of prestige in the Far East,but this would be inconsiderable compared with theconsequences of an unsuccessful war.Two suggestions were made for easing our positionin relation to Japan if the loan was made to China.,viz. -(l)  That we should ask other Powers interested,including especially the United States ofAmerica, to co-operate in the loan&apos;.(2) That we should follow up the idea of anglo-Japanese co-operation containedin the Tokyo telegram referred, to above.Another suggestion was that Australia, and NewZealand ought to &quot;He consulted before a decision wastaken.The Cabinet were reminded o^ a proposal that had.been ma^e two months ago for a commercial loan to china on the security of the deposits of antimony andwolfram in that country.    That proposal had been rejected by the City of London on commercial grounds.It was suggested, however, that, in the event of his majesty&apos;s . jesty&apos;s Government providing financial support to china, they might secure part of it at any rate onthese deposits.    This would also h8.ve the advantageof preventing Germany from acquiring these importantmetals .   A variant of this proposal was that we should,purchase the whole of these deposits,    ^he objectionto this proposal, however, was that the deposits v-erestill in the ground.    To pay for them as and when
they were received would not help China;    hut to pay for them in advance would he as irritating to Japanas a mere loan.Another sugges+ion was that in return for a loanwe should obtain an extension of the leased  &apos;territory at ^owloon.    In this connection the- Cabinetwe^e informed that an extension of the leased territorywas being examined, but this was not  considered afavourable moment for opening the question.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, saidthat the arguments were very nicely balanced.   TheForeign Secretary had put both sides fairly in his memorandum, and when he found his colleague, after considering both sides of the question, still urgingaction, he himself found it difficult to oppose.Nevertheless he could only agree to the proposal with grave misgiving.    It was not disputed that the objectof the proposal went beyond mere support to the Chinesecurrency in the interests of British banks.    serious as the failure of the currency would be, the attempt was made to justify the proposal on the ground that wemust support China in the war.    In fact, the proposalamounted, to intervention.   The more effective that intervention was,  the more disagreeable it would be tothe Japanese.    We had no guarantee that after a yearJapan would be reduced to such a state of exhaustionaa to agree to terms which would be fair to China and.leave us a proper share of the trade of that country.We should then be told that another  SO millions wasnecessary.   He felt that this was rather a long vistaand that we were being committed to a policy based onthe supposition that our interests were against a japanese victory and that we must d0 all we could toprevent it.   He himself was not prepared to dispute
: io5that a Japanese triumph might result in a situation inNorthern China, resembling that  in Manehukuo.    He wasnot certain, however, that China would collapse.China, had. always shown great powers of recuperation.The Japanese operations might he less successful in thefuture than in the past.    mhe Chinese had received agood deal of munitions from Soviet Russia, which hadnot yet, he believed, been paid for, except to someextent by barter.    It was by no means unlikely thatthe Soviet might continue to furnish support.    Ourmoney might well go to Russia instea-d. of to theBondholders.    The result, therefore, of a loan mightbe bad.   The situation would, be different if we onlyhad. to consider Japan and ourselves, when the present proposal might be faced.    But we could not limit thequestion    to these two nations.    In Spain we had adopted a policy of non-intervention so as to avoidspreading the conflict.   Were we certain that toadopt an opposite policy in China would not have that very effect?    In this  connection it was  interesting to note tha.t the Germans had  just withdrawn all theirGenerals, although they had very large interests inChina.    He did not see how any device, such as purchases of wolfram,  could hide the real  object of a loan.Was it not, probable that Signor Mussolini, who wa.s ina captious mood, might stigmatise our action asdirected, against the Dictator Countries in genera-l?The Prime Minister then recalled, the repeated warningsof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee a.s to the necessityof avoiding a war with three nations at once.    If wewere to become embroiled in the Par East, Germany mightseize the opportunity to do something in Czechoslovakia,or Italy in Libya.   He agreed that the situation would
be much improver&quot; if the United States of America couldjoin us, as suggested in paragraph 11 o^ C.P.-l?i2 (38)and in the draft telegram attached thereto.   He had,however, been opposed to sending the telegram untilthe Cabinet had made up its mind.    There was always a.danger that Washington might announce that they had refused a British suggestion of the kind.    On theprevious day, however, he had. seen the american ambassador, who had just returned from Washington,and who had given a very favourable account, from our point of view, of President Roosevelt&apos;s attitudetowards, an^i desire to co-operate with, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment,    ^he Ambassador had a.lso been reassuringas to the Presidents intentions over the application0^ the Neutrality Law if we became engaged, in war.The Ambassador had also shown himself very desirousto help.    This led him to suggest that the american ambassador might be a better, as well as a. slightly less formal,  channel for taking soundings as to thepossibility of American co-operation in the proposalbefore the Cabinet than His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington.   He suggested, therefore, that thedecision should be left over while a little freshlight on certain aspects of the problem, was obtainedfrom s/s.shington and Tokyo.^he Foreign Secretary agreed that a. delay in makingso grave a decision was reasonable,   He did not under-rate the objections to his proposal.   He agreed thatit would be easier to apply it if other nations would,join.   He had. to see the American Ambassador the same day, and he would sound him on the question and as certain if he was willing to sounr1 the AmericanGovernment t/0He agreed also that it was desirable to await Sir too lie Craigie&apos;s reply to his latesttelegram to clear up the point quoted earlier in this
summary . He raised the question as to whether theGovernments of Australia and New Zealand should heconsulted .The Prime Minister thought it would be premature to consult the dominions and that it would he better to wait until the Cabinet had had a further discussion.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To postpone the question of whetherfinancial support should be provided,to China until the next regular weekly Meeting of the Cabinet:(b) That in the meanwhile the Secretaryof State for Foreign affairs.irs should -(i) obtain from Sir t^e-fHrer Craigiethe further information he hadalready asked for as to themeaning of the proposal con-tained in Tokyo telegram.

REPLACEMENT OP     7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the.M. YACHTVICTORIA AND   First Lord of the Admiralty (C-P.-155 (38)) seekingALBERT.the views of his colleagues on the question of replacing[p.zn..)    HoM.Yacht VICTORIA AND ALBERT, which was launched in1899 and. was now not only quite out of date but wouldalso require extensive and costly repairs if she wereto be retained, in commission.   Plans had already been drawn up for the construction of a suitable vessel,which in war could be transformed into a hospital ship.It would, be necessary to include the ship in nextyear&apos;s Navy Estimates, but in the meanwhile, if theCabinet approved the proposal, steps could be takenbetween now and next Spring in order that, when parliament agreed, there might be as little delay aspossible in construction and delivery.The First Lord of the Admiralty made a short statement in amplification of his memorandum, in thecourse of which he referred to the political value of royal Visits for which the Royal Yacht was very useful.He pointed out that the proposed Royal Yacht could beused in war as a hospital ship.     The estimated costwas  900,000o     This was a good deal less than thecost of a hospital ship which had to be dropped out ofthe estimates.     Moreover,- he hoped it might bepossible to reduce the estimate very considerably.It was proposed that the Yacht should be built by ayacht builder0In the course of the discussion, theimportance was emphasised of avoiding any possibility that the King might be exposed to criticism by theconstruction of the Yacht0     The kind of argument thatmight be used in political discussions was that money was not available for the unemployed, but could be found for a Rtiyal Yachts
The First Lord of the Admiralty said that HisMajesty, while interested in the proposal,  did not want topress it if there was any risk of interrupting progress with rearmament thereby.    As a matter of fact, however,the construction of the Yacht v/ould not interfere withrearmament, the limiting factor of which was notshipbuilding but armaments,    The construction of theYacht would relieve unemployment which existed in ship-building.    If a new Yacht was not built, the presentRoyal Yacht would have to be repaired at considerable expense before long.    Politically it was unlikely thata more favourable moment than the present would occur.An important point that was made in the course ofthe discussion was that the present Royal Yacht was veryexpensive to maintain and requires a very large crew.From the maintenance point of view, the new Yacht wouldprovide a large saving.The Cabinet agreed:To approve the proposal of the FirstLord of the Admiralty as set forth inC.Pc  155 (38) and summarised above forthe provision of a new Royal Yacht toreplace His Majesty&apos;s Yacht Victoriaand Albert.(The Lord Chancellor and the Chancellor of theExchequer withdrew at this point.)

The decision had been most carefully considered both in Palestine and at homeand there had been no escape from a capital sentence.The effect on opinion in Palestine, however, hadbeen considerable.     Moderate Jews had thrown the weight of their influence on the side of restraintbut the extremists had urged that this was an occasion for violence and martyrdom0      It was very important to reduce this terrorism if onlytemporarilyj, but he feared it would break out againo*l*-Xj- k   &quot;hut.when the Commission&apos;s Report wa  ^published.,     Hewas in continuous consultation with the HighCommissioner and the War Office as to the adequacy of the present Forces, and they were considering whether the arrival of the extra Brigade inSeptember would be soon enough,,     He was proceeding with the recruitment of 100 extra British Ex-Servicemen to the Palestine police Force and theother approved measures.      In addition to theabove, representations had been made to France asto the activities of the ex-Mufti directed fromSyria against Palestine.
Ill90     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence (CP. 153(38)) drawing the attention of his colleagues, at therequest of the Committee of Imperial Defence (328thMeeting, Minute 1 - Appendix III to the Memorandum)to two matters raised in the course of a discussion on the Conversations between representatives of the&apos; Board of Trade and the French Government on the supply in time of war of food, other raw materials and tonnage, namely,  (l) the scope of these Conversations,and (II) the Naval ConversationsoAs to (i) the Minister stated that he had felt that his colleagues as a whole should now receivethe information prepared for the Committee of ImperialDefence so as to enable them to appreciate the rangealready covered by the food conversations, which, bythe Cabinet decision of June 1st, was to be extendedto other commoditieso     Whilst he did not accept theview that conversations restricted to a general survey of joint requirements would be of negligible value,he did not object to a continuance of the conversations on the proposed footing, provided that his colleagues were aware of what was taking place0     He added thatthe Committee of Imperial Defence felt that the basis on which these talks were to be conducted should belaid down more precisely than hitherto0      The Ministertherefore suggested that formal authority should begiven for the continuation of the Conversations on food, oil, coal, non-ferrous metals and minerals,textile and raw materials, and tonnage, to be under-taken with representatives of the French Governmenton a basis which,  slightly amended, is set forth inconclusion I (iii) below0
As to (II) , in the course of the discussion at theCommittee of Imperial Defence the Naval Conversations werementioned as an illustration of the danger that provisional and non-committal arrangements might be interpreted andtreated as definite undertakings.,     For example, the french naval authorities might redistribute their Fleet on thestrength of the war dispositions of the British Fleet asdisclosed to them in the course of the Conversations, and inthe event of a war in which we did not take part they might find themselves at a serious disadvantage by reason of redistribution.      The Minister submitted that the subject ofNaval Staff Conversations should be reconsidered.     He felt it desirable to avoid any step v/hich might lend support to the idea that moves of French Naval units made on our suggestion involved any obligations on our part, and recommended that the Cabinet should record a decision to theeffect that it should be left to the French to make any suggestions for further redistribution of the Naval units of either country,,The President of the Board of Trade asked for aslight amendment of paragraph (iii) of the basis proposed bythe Minister for Co-ordination of Defence:   his object being to enable minor departures from this item in the basis to bemade by approval of the Committee of Imperial Defence insteadof by the Cabinet.This was agreed.Jbo^(see words underlined inconclusion I CiJ-i&quot;) below0The First Lord of the Admiralty thought it wasnecessary to make the situation clear with the FrenchGovernment.     We ought to point out to them that the dangers to which they were exposed could be divided into (l) warwithout the support of the United Kingdom and (2) war withthe support of the United Kingdom.     Of these, the former
was the me**e-iiiteeiy and,  therefore,  it would bedesirable for them to make their normal arrangements onthat basis.      If the United Kingdom were also in thewar, however, they would ask for a redistribution of theFrench Fleet and the French should be advised to makethe necessary administrative arrangements to rendersuch redistribution practicable in the oase ofnecessityoThe Minister for Go-ordination of Defence was prepared to accept this proposal provided it was madequite clear that wo were not committed to give support,This was .agr egd to 0The Cabinet agreed;(i)    To authorise the continuation of the conversations with the FrenchGovernment on food, oil, coal, non-ferrous metals and.minerals., textileand raw materials and tonnage on thefollowing basis:-(i)    That the conversations are designed to meet a purelyhypothetical contingency, thatno commitments or agreements should be entered into, andthat no question arises of taking a final decision now   on actionto be takenf if the contingencymaterialises, which remains amatter solely for the Governmentof the day;(ii)    That conversations should begin with an exchange of information on estimated requirements and discussions regarding the basis on which estimates have been framed;(iii)    That where no question arisesof overlapping requirements,e0go, in the oase of ccal, the conversations should not becarried any further withoutthe upyr-pval of the Committee ofImperial Defence;
Hi(iv)    That, in cases where requirementsmay overlap, conversations should becontinued to cover the preparationof an outline of contingentarrangements to secure the necessaryco-ordination;(v) That the Foreign Office should be associated with the conversations at all stages;(vi)    That steps should be taken, by consultation with the Treasury, toensure that the financial positionis properly safeguarded;(vii ]   That reports should be submittedperiodically by the department concerned to the Committee ofImperial Defence regarding the stateof the various conversations,and inthe event of any question ofprinciple arisingo(II)   That, in order to avoid any step whichmight lend support to the idea that movesof French Naval units made on our suggestion involve any obligations on our part, the French Ministry of Marine shouldbe reminded that war without BritishatA^t^   support is for them the/moro probablesojaiiaageftey and that the normaldistribution of their Fleet had better bemade on that basis.    if the United Kingdomparticipated in the war, however, v/e should ask for a redistribution of their fleet and it would, therefore, be advisable for the French Government to make theadministrative arrangements required toenable this to take placeB      It shouldbe made plain that His Majesty^s Governmentin the United Kingdom were undertaking no commitment in the matter.
