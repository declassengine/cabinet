THE MONTRfSTJXCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(36), Con-clusion 5 a)1.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal, acting for the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-196 (36))  informinghis colleagues of serious difficulties arising atthe Montreux Conference.   The Turkish desire tore-militarise the Straits had met with no opposition,but on the subsidiary question of the passage of warships through the Straits in time of war, Turkeybeing neutral, a deadlock was threatened.    The soviet delegation, in combination with the French andstrongly supported by the Roumanian Delegation, were trying to insert amendments in the British draft ofthe Straits  Convention the effect of which would bethat Turkey would be obliged to close the Straits toall belligerent warships except those acting in virtue, not only of the Covenant, but of any regional.,pact which may now exist or be concluded in thefuture within the framework of the Covenant, whether.Turkey is a party thereto or not, and irrespective ofany pronouncement by the League.    These provisionswere clearly designed to discriminate against Germany.The Turks much disliked the proposal, and the UnitedKingdom Delegation had suggested an amendment by which,in time of war, Turkey, being neutral, would only be obliged to discriminate between belligerents if her own obligations, under the League Covenant or undera Treaty commitment to which she herself was a. party,were involved.    It remained to be seen whether theFrench and Russians could be induced to accept thisreasonable compromise.    If not, the Lord Privy Sealproposed, before asking his colleagues to choose between breaking off the Conference and acquiescing in the Russian proposals at the risk of far-reachingreactions on Germany and. on Anglo-German relations,
to take certain action in Paris .At the outset of the Meeting the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs handed round, a new telegram(No .46) that had arrived from Montreux (Appendix) .from which it appeared that unless the Russians wouldgive way there was a likelihood. - of a deadlock leading to a breakdown of the Conference,    ^he position was described, as follows :-&quot;That the Russians , with the support of theTurks, French and Roumanians, are takingthe line that the Straits should be normallyclosed in time of war, Turkey being neutral,subject to certain exceptions, while theUnited Kingdom Delegation, in view of previous instructions and. telephoneconversations with the Foreign office on July 14th, are maintaining that theStraits should be normally open to bothbelligerents unless Turkey decides to close them to both unless provisions ofCovenant or of pacts to which Turkey isa party entitle her to discriminate&quot;,of a breakdown in th.e   eventy^turkey was likely to proclaim that the&quot;Lausanne Convention had become inoperative and toproceed, to fortify the Straits, but would probablypromulgate at Russian instigation regulations for thepassa.ge of ^&quot;ar and. merchant vessels which would bemore unfavourable to us.The Lord Privy Seal, who had been handling thisquestion at the Foreign Office in the absence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, sa.id thatMr Rend.el had telephoned to the Foreign Office fromMontreux at 9.4s. ami. to the effect that it was aquestion of hours whether there would be a breakdownor a settlement.    It appeared that the United kingdom delegation had been successful in persuad.ing theFrench, Russian and. Roumanian Delegations to abandon their insistence on an exemption being &quot;given in wartd-:-t&apos;he warships-b&apos;f belligerent&apos;States that had concluded Pacts comingunder the Covenant of the League even though Turkey
was not a party to those Pacts.   M. Litvinoff, it seemed, was now disposer1 to agree that the limit at ionon Turkey&apos;s right to close the Straits should be confined to rights and obligations under the covenant of the League and of Pacts thereunder to which Turkey was a party:    but his agreement was conditional onour agreeing on the questions of escorts and s^allsurface vessels .    The Lord Privy Seal was advised bythe Foreign Office that we ought to approve thisarrangement.    The effect on Germany would not be very good, but the arrangement was preferable to the firstproposal, and better than what would, have happened,in the event of a breach of the Treaty negotiations.The First Lord of the Admiralty was apprehensiveas to the effect on Germany o^ a Treaty concluded, onthese lines.   Many warnings had been received as tothe probability of German resentment at the conclusionof such a Treaty.    There was grave danger that theresult might be that Germany would, seek to escape from the Anglo-German Naval Agreement.   As soon as -the Black Sea was closed to warships and thereby madesafe for Russia it would, be possible for Russia to concentrate all her naval effort in the Baltic.She could build, warships in the Black Sea and thenpass them out to the Baltic .    Germany, on the otherhand, would not be able to send her ships into the black Sea.    This was a. different situation from theone in which the Anglo-German Naval Agreement hadbeen concluded.    The question at issue, therefore,he suggested., was. as to whether it was worth while to run the risk of losing the Anglo-German naval agreement in order to avoid a breakdown of negotia-tions for a very dubious ^treaty from which theItalians, who certainly ought, to be a party, were
excluded.   He asked if it would not be possible to conclude a Treaty on the militarisation of the starits and. to postpone the other questions until Germany andItaly could take part.    A settlement&quot;of the questionof belligerent rights, he pointed, out, could, not properly be achieved without Germany, and the peacefulissues ought not to be settled without Italy, whichwas much concerned, in the commerce of the Black Sea..The First Commissioner of -/forks, who had taken part in the negotiations at Montreux, reported that according to his knowledge Turkey would not agree toa Treaty confined to the re-militarisation of theStraits but felt bound to insist on the right tocontrol the passage of warships .    If they did. not gda satisfactory settlement they would take the law into their own hands.    There were two parties in murkey,the military General Staff under German tutorship, whowanted to take the law into their own hands, and thepolitical element which preferred to negotiate aTreaty.    If the latter were thrown over the military party would, become uppermost and the reaction on ourrelations with Turkey might be serious .   As regardsthe exclusion from the restrictions in time of war ofthe warships of signatories of certain Pacts, germany would be in no worse position than we ourselves andother Powers that were not parties to those Pacts,^hat could be explained to Germany.It was pointed, out. that if ^turkey were to adhere to the Franco-Russian Pact the difficulty would be cleared, up.The Cabinet were impressed, by the following passage in Montreux ^elegra- No. 46:-&quot;In our view Turkey would, in that event(i.e., a.breakdown) proclaim that the lausanne Convention had. become inoperativeand. would proceed to fortify the Straitsbut would probably promulgate at Russian.
instigation regulations for passage of -war and merchent vessels which might hemore unfavourable to us&quot;.Tt was suggested that that also could be explained.to the Germans.    In fact, it csould be said, that theposition would be much the same for Germany whethera settlement was concluded, on the lines now proposedor whether there were a breakdown o^ the Conference .Tn the latter event, the only difference would be thatthe settlement would be a wor?e one both for Germanyand. ourselves and that the solution would be arrived.at by unilateral e.ction.Tt was suggested also that if we were to break upthe Conference by our attitude we should be doing soto assist Germany at the expense of France.The general view of the Cabinet was that therewere disadvantages in either course, but on the whole the lesser disadvantage lay in concluding a Treaty onthe lines proposed, though the First Lord of theAdmiralty again warned his colleagues of the probable effect of their decision on Germany.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Seeretary of State forForeign Affairs should be author-ised to instruct the United kingdom delegation to conclude a Treaty onthe lines indicated in their telegramNo . 4S : (Appendix.)fb)  that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should give fullexplanations to the Germans,pointing out that from their pointof viev as well as from ours theposition was better than it wouldhave been in the event o^ a breakdown of the Treaty negotiations, whichwould have left the Black Sea entirelyclosed, with Turkey as the doorkeeper.
GERMANY ANDTT-TE locarno treaty .Propos edBrusselsMeet ing.(previous reference:Cabinet ^1(36), Con-conclusion ion 2.)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that on the previous day, when he had still been in temporary charge ofthe Foreign Office in the absence, of the&apos; Secretaryof State, he had consulted the Office on the proposedBrussels Conference.    On the whole, the view of theForeign Office was in favour of a postponement ofthe Brussels Conference.   They thought that to hold the Conference after Italy&apos;s refusal, and at a timewhen the German Government was saying that nobusiness could be done before October, would onlytend to emphasise the division of Europe into camps .While all those he had. consulted, had agreed, onpostponement, there were thereafter two views:-(l) That, the Conference should, be heldin October, to be attended, by the locarno Powers, including Germany,and., since it would, have to dealwith European peace, Russia and.Poland also:(2) That it would, be better not toinclude Russia and Poland, at the outset, since the main object wasto bring Germany into working arrangements with Europe.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsinclined, to the view that the Brussels meeting should be held, in order to show Europe that theWestern democracies had. views of their own andwould like to make a contribution to a European jsettlement, .   The question of whether a conference with Germany was to be held would, depend, upon whetherthey had. ideas for a constructive European settlement.Another view was that the result of holdingthe Brussels Conference would be to bring Germanyand. Italy more closely together.Some discussion took place a? to the object ofthe Meeting.    It was recalled that at the Genevadiscussions M. Van Zeeland.&apos;s original idea had. been for the Locarno Powers other than Germany to meet at
Brussels and then and there invite the Germans tojoin them.    It was also recalled that M. Van Zeelandat that time had rather seemed to suggest that his idea was to drive Germany into a corner.Attention was called to Telegram No. 57, which seemed again to indicate an extension of the objects of the Conference.The question was raised as to whether,  supposing that the only object of the Conference was to concert,a telegram to Germany, it. was really necessary to holda meeting at. all.    The mere holding of the meeting would give the impression that something else was going on. Moreover, the question was ashed as towhether there was the least prospect of any result from the Brussels Meeting sufficient to justify it.In view of the urgency of a decision, the cabinet agreed  (a)  That the Foreign Policy Committee ofthe Cabinet should meet the same day at 5 p.m. in the Prime Minister&apos;s room at the House of Commons&apos;.(b)That the Cabinet should meet on thefollowing day, Thursday,  July 16th,at 10.4^ a.m., at 10 Downing Street,to receive the recommendation of theCabinet Committee.(NOTE:    In view of the above, the Meeting arranged for the Irish Situation Committee the same day at 5 p.m. was postponed until the morrow,Thursday,  July 16th, at 4.15 p.m., which wasto have been devoted to a Meeting of theForeign Policy Committee.)

TTg; ANGLO-egyptian treaty NEGO-T TAnIONS .(previous reference:Cabinet 51(36), Con-clusion 3 .)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairshanded, round, at the outset of the Meeting a MostImmediate telegram from Cairo (No .960) asking for an alteration in the instructions that had been sent tohim as the result, of a Meeting of the Anglo-EgyptianConversations Committee on the evening of Monday,FTR. July   13th.The Cabinet agreed.  That the telegram should be referredto the Anglo-Egyptian ConversationsCommittee, which should meet for its consideration the same evening at p.m. in the Prime Minister&apos;s room at the T-Touse of Commons .
E4LESTIHE 5.      The Secretary of State for the ColoniesSituation in drew the attention of the Cabinet to the followingIj    ____telegrams that had been circulated in the Colonial(previous inference: Office prints:-jCabinet 51(36)I Conclusion 9) Paraphrase of telegram from the Secretary offr SL-fsOQ        State to the High Commissioner for Palestinef.K.  if i  yy-        despatched at 6.30 pm., 10th July, 1936,No. 327, conveying the decisions of the cabinet at their meeting referred to in the margin;and paraphrase of telegram from the HighCommissioner for Palestine to the Secretary ofState dated 11th July,  1936, No.502 (36) inwhich the High Commissioner strongly recommendedthat any announcement of a suspension of immigration should be deferred until law andorder were restored.Since the receipt of that telegram, however,the Secretary of State for the Colonies reported thatthe Foreign Office had been pressing the ColonialOffice as to the reply that was to be made to theMinister for Saudi-Arabia in consequence of theoffer of Ibn Saud in conjunction with the Kings ofIraq, and Transjordania to render good offices with theArabs of Palestine.      To meet the views of thosemonarchs, the Foreign Office and the Colonial office in concert had drafted for consideration a telegram which, inter alia^ included a promise that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would, in certain circumstances,consider a suspension of Jewish immigration,,There was general agreement, however, that theinclusion of any such passage would be tantamount to anannouncement of intention to suspend immigration whenthe Reyal Commission sailed, which would be contraryto previous declarations to the effect that order must first be restored.After considerable discussion, the Cabinet%/( agreed:(a)    That no. immediate announcement couldbe made as to the intentions of theGovernment.- 10 -
(b) That as soon as he was in a positionto announce the composition and terms of reference of the RoyalCommission,  the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies should also include a statement on thefollowing lines:-The Government can make no statement as to their futureintentions with regard toJewish immigration untilorder is restored.     It isobvious that when thathappens the Government must consider that question witho the rs.(c) That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should informthe representative of Ibn Saudthat no answer could be given at present to his question asto the suspension of jewish immigration until law and order was restored.     At the same time,Ibn Saud should be thanked forhis offer of good offices and itshould be indicated that the time would no doubt come when HisMajesty&apos;s Government would be glad to avail themselves of the offer.
PALESTINE. 6.     The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byChief Justice&apos;s the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP.-194-Comments on free^ahamolitions. (35))  circulating for the information of his colleaI?the text of a letter and despatch he had received(previous reference: from the T-Tigh Commissioner for&apos;Palestine, in which cabinet 51(36), Con- the latter referred to the unfortunate effects onelusion 9.)Arab opinion of certain comments against theGovernment by the Chief Justice of Palestine whengiving judgment in the case arising out of thedemolitions in Jaffa.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that he had written to ask the Chief Justice to resign.     He read a letterreceived from the High Commissioner for Palestineindicating the extent of the harm that had beendone by the remarks of the Chief Justicewhich had been used extensively aspropaganda by the Arabs throughout Palestine andwould prolong the disorders.Some discussion took place as to whatprocedure would be available for getting rid of theChief Justice if he should refuse to resign.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesundertook to enquire into the matter.

One question that arose was as towhether celebrations were to be held in connectionwith the KingTs Coronation in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland.     He had resisted any approach to the King on the subject until the Cabinet had considered the matter, which had politicalimp lications.After some discussion,  th&apos;e Cabineis agreed:That the Lord President of theCouncil should be asked to convey to the King thoir view that a visit to Edinburgh would beexpected in connection with the coronation and that the questionof visits to Wales and NorthernIreland arose for consideration.He should ask His Majesty&apos;spermission to consider such visitsand submit further details.f

APPENDIX.Frorn SWIT ZSRLAND.Decypher.British Delegation.(Montreux).14th July, 1936.D. 1.40 a.m15th July,  1936.R. 9.30 a.in.15th July, 1936.No.  46.MOST IMMEDIATE.Following from Lord Stanley:M.  Litvinov was informed this evening that His Majesty&apos;sG-overnment might he disposed to yield point of escort for capital ships through the Straits and restriction of passage to light surface vessels provided they could obtain satis-faction in regard to articles 16 and 23.      He replied that soviet Government were most unlikely to agree to any solution other than closure of Straits to both belligerentsin time of war, Turkey being neutral,  subject to rights and obligations under covenant of League and possibly of pactsto which Turkey was a party,  though he would refer forfurther instructions to his Government.      The position,therefore, is that Russians with the support of the Turks,French and Roumanians are talcing the line that the Straitsshould be normally closed in time of war,  Turkey beingneutral, subject to certain exceptions, while UnitedKingdom delegation in view of previous instructions and telephone conversations with Foreign Office on 14th Julyare maintaining that Straits should be normally open to both belligerents unless Turkey decides to close them to both unless provisions of covenant or of pacts to whichTurkey is a party entitle her to discriminate.
Unless therefore Russians give way there is like-lihood of a deadlock, leading to breakdown consequences of which may well be more unfavourable to uo than conditions we could now obtain.      In our view Turkey would in that event proclaim that Lausanne Convention had becomeinoperative and would proceed to fortify the Straits but would probably promulgate at Russian instigation regulations for passage of war and merchant vessels which might bemore unfavourable to us.We feel that above considerations should be before theCabinet if, as we understand, the question is to be con-sidered by them to-morrow.
