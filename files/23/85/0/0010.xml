PUBLIC ORDER. 2. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum b,ypreservation the Home Secretary (CP.-261 (36) j on the desirabilityof.of strengthening the existing law in order to ensure(Previous the preservation of public order, arising out of1 Reference:Cabinet      3f       tne recent attempted Fascist demonstration in the(34), Con-clusion &amp;..) East End of London and ugly incidents in Leeds,7Manchester and other provincial towns.   He suggestedff^S^i^)^      that a small Ministerial Committee snould be appointedto consider whether any legislative proposal snouldbe put forward by the Government, and, if so, wnatform it snould take .    If it was decided that legisla-tion should be introduced, the Home Secretary thougntit certainly ought to be announced in the King&apos;sSpeech.The discussion snowed that the Cabinet was very strongly in sympathy with the desire of the HomeSecretary to strengthen the existing law.   The view was expressed, and strongly supported, that, not-withstanding certain criticises that would be raised,if the Government were to make clear that tney wouldnot allow minorities to be attacked and public orderdisturbed, they would be supported by a strong popularopinion.   The present situation was recognised to beopen to strong objection not only on account of the disturbances that had taken place, but of tnepublicity that was given to them in newspapers andparticularly in cinemas.    It was suggested thatpemaps some immediate action might be taken to induce the Cinema Companies not to reproduce scenes of violence.    It was recognised taat the usual criticismwould be encountered as to tne danger o&apos;f interferingwit., the liberties of tne people, but tiie reply totxiis would be tnat it was necessary because some sections of the population insisted on abusing theirliberties.   Moreover, steps could be taken to
minimise the objection by such expedients as licensingharmless uniforms or -^aking tne law applicable onl^to uniforms used for political purposes, and so fortn.The Cabinet agreed  That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows:-The Home Secretary,The Lord President of tne Council,The Chancellor of tne Excnequer,The Minister of Healtn,Tne Minister of Labour,The Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence,The First Commissioner of works,The Attorney-General and./orTne Solicitor-General,Tne Lord Advocate,should meet at once to consider theproposals contained in tne HomeSecretary&apos;s Memorandum.

MARCH OP THEUNEMPLOYEDOH LONDON.(previous reference:Cabinet 56(36) , Con-clusion 10.)F.R. 6        %3 - The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP .-256 (36)) calling attentionto the arrangements made   as a protest against theUnemployment Assistance Regulations   for contingentsof unemployed persons to march on London, the marchersbeing due to arrive on the 8th November.   Two otherdemonstration marches had been organised, both ofwhich were timed to reach London on the 31st October,one consisting of 200 unemployed men from Jarrow,and the other comprising about 250 blind persons,accompanied by some 50 attendants.   The existing lawcontained no provisions by which orderly bands ofdemonstrators could be prevented from marching toLondon or elsewhere.    The only course open, therefore,was to take every precaution to minimise the risk of disorder on the routes of the contingents and inLondon, and the Memorandum described the steps taken with tnis object.   After consultation with theMinister of Health and the Minister of Labour, theHome Secretary thought that tne best method of inform-ing the public on the present occasion, in order to discourage them from furnishing assistance to themarchers, would be to arrange, probably through theNational Publicity Bureau, for selected journaliststo be interviewed and given material for exposing tneorigin, motive and uselessness of the hunger march.He had been informed that, as in the case of previousmarches, unemployment benefit would not be payable tomarchers, but they would be entitled to relief from public Assistance Authorities.    On tne question of thehunger marchers being received in deputation, the HomeSecretary pointed out that it was the settled practiceof recent: Ministries not to receive them, althoughMinisters would be prepared to receive Members ofParliament accompanied by a few representatives of
the marchers .    In this respect it would not bepossible to distinguish between tne nunger maronersand the Jarrow and Blind marchers.After considerable discussion the Cabinet(a) That/ fea^ljjeme-&quot;&amp;e^-aH^6^y^^.nould. is-auea^^-fe^treTtierrt- designed to discouragesuch marenes and to make clear that ministers could not receive deputa-tions of marchers, altnougn tneywould be prepared to meet Membersof Parliament:(b) To approve the following statement togive effect to Conclusion (a), whichwas drafted by the Home Secretary and read out by him at the end of theMeeting:-&quot;Ministers nave had under con-sideration the fact tnat a number of&apos;marches&apos; on London are in progressor in contemplation.    In tne opinionof H.M. Government, sucn marchescan do no good to the causes forwhich they are represented to beundertaken, are liable to causeunnecessary hardship to those taking part in them, and are altogetherundesirable.    In this country,governed by a Parliamentary system,where every  adult has a vote and every area has its representative inthe House of Commons to put forwardgrievances and suggest remedies,processions to London cannot claimto have any constitutional influence on policy.   Ministers have, therefore,decided that encouragement cannot begiven to such xuarches, whatever their particular purpose, and Ministerscannot consent to receive any deputa-tion of &apos; marchers&apos; , although of coursetney are always prepared to meetMembers of Parliament&quot;; j ,   , ,i(c) That tne Home Secretary/^ ho aid have authority to arrange, through theNational Publicity-Bureau or suchchannel as-fheymight deem appropriate,for selected journalists to be inter-viewed and given material for exposingthe origin, motive and uselessness ofthe march, on the lines proposed inparagraph 6 of his Memorandum, but tnatcaution should be exercised in anyreferences to the past practice ofMinisters of the Crown in receivingdeputations, since it appeared probablethat Members of Parliament, accompaniedby a few of the marchers, had beenreceived on occasion.
FACTORIES BILL.(previous reference:Cabinet 65(30;  Con-clusion 20 .)4. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by the  Home Secretary (CP.-255 (36); recalling thePrime Minister&apos;s announcement, in the Debate on the address on December 3, 1935, of the intention of tneGovernment to promote a new Factories Bill.   ThisFR.&amp;fe(30^-   announcement had since been the subject of frequentreference in Parliament.    In these circumstances hehad felt justified in instructing his Department toundertake a considerable amount of worn preparatoryto the Bill, the main objects of which would beto revise the existing provisions in regard tosafety, health, welfare and hours of employment inconformity with modern standards, and to re-defineand in some respects extend the scope of their application.   The Home Secretary sought cabinet authority to continue with the preparation of theBill and have it drafted at the earliest possible date with a view to its being mentioned in the KiAg&apos;sSpeech and introduced early in the Session.   He also suggested that it would be useful if a small CabinetCommittee could be appointed whose help he couldinvoke on specific points of difficulty arising inthe preparation of the Bill.The Cabinet recognised that while a factories bill might not be popular with some sections oftheir supporters in Parliament, Ministers werepledged to introduce legislatioxi on the subject.Tne main issue was not so mncii as to whether aFactories Bill should be introduced, but as to itspriority in the legislative programme   a matter which, as the Prime.Minister pointed out, could notbe decided until tne programme had been considered as a whole.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed  
(a) To postpone a decision until afterthe King&apos;s Speech on tne Opening ofParliament nad been drawn up:(b) That in the. interval the HomeSecretary should proceed with tnepreparation of his Bill:(c) That if it were decided to proceedwitn the matter in tne present session, a Cabinet COiJiuittee snouldbe appointed which the Ho^e Secretarycould invoke on specific points of difficulty arising in tne preparationof tne Bill,
ROYAL OOMMIS-SION ON THEPRIVATE MANU-PACTURE OPAND trading in ARMS .Report.(previous reference:Cabinet 8(35), Con-elusion 1.)5 . The Cabinet had before t)ae.a a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary (CP.-258 (36)) circulating fortheir information the Report of the Roval Commissionon the Private Manufacture of and Trading in Arms,on pages 53 and 54 of which would be found a summaryof their conclusions and recommendations .    In his memorandum the Home Secretary stated that before theReport could be published it must be submitted toThe King and presented to Parliament .   Presentationcould be made to Parliament during tne Recess, and he sought the views of the Cabinet as to whether it snouldbe presented and published forthwith, or whetherpresentation should wait until Parliament met.He thought the Cabinet might wish to refer tnedocument to tne Committee of Imperial Defence witn a request for a report on its recommendations.Satisfaction was expressed at the general trend of trie Royal Commission&apos;s Report.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To authorise tne Home Secretaryto publish the Report of tne RoyalCommission as soon as he might deemadvisable:(b) That the Report should be referred tothe Committee of -Imperial Defence fora report on its recommendations.
FOREIGN POLICYGeneral Reviewof.(previous reference:Cabinet 31(36), Con-clusion 5 .)defence requirements(previous reference:Cabinet 55(36),  Con-clusion 13.6.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that tne international situation regainedanxious and tense, but that there were so^e signsof improvement both in the position generally andso far as oar own policy was concerned.   Auiongthese signs he instanced tne relaxation of tension in regard to Abyssinia;    tne realisation that was growing ay of the seriousness of our own re-armament;and the recent action in the monetary field.   Tiierewere indications tnat trie dictators in Germanyand Italy both had their worries, which might telleither in a favourable or an unfavourable direction.On the whole, however, tne situation was better.Nevertheless there was nothing to justify any relaxation in our own defensive preparations.From the point of view of foreign policy it was more important than ever to push on with themeasures for strengthening our defences, for atany time we ^ight be confronted by a situationin which this country would need to speak writh tnefullest authority, backed by a sense of strength.
7,     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs mentioned that since he last reported to the Cabineton Foreign Affairs, Germany and Italy had bothaccepted in principle to attend the Five-power conference with a view to a fresh Locarno Treaty,He had then circulated a Note on the subject and hadreceived replies from the French Government, and had discussed the question with the Belgian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs at Geneva,     There were indications that an early reply might be expected from the German Government, possibly the same afternoon.     The German reactions to the British Notehad proved not unfavourable, and if the Germans were willing to attend the Conference the ItalianGovernment would no doubt also be represented.     Onthe eve of the despatch of the British Note he hadreceived a French Note, but it had been sent to theBritish and Belgian Governments alone, and the fFrench Government had agreed to allow his own note to be the sole basis for Initiating discussion between the Powers concerned.     A minor difficulty was that there had been some diminution in theBelgian attachment to France, due perhaps to theLeftward tendency of the French Government.      In hisNote he did not ask the Belgians to guarantee theUnited Kingdom.     The French had reacted ratherstrongly against this proposal, and he intended inthe early future to ask the Committee of ImperialDefence to consider the French objections.     For themoment, as His Majesty1s Government had done all theycould to promote the Conference, he thought it advisable not to appear too eager.
The de-valuation of the Franc.



Economic Consequences thereof.



The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the French Government had been very well pleased at the incidents connected with the de-valuation of the Franc, which had been rendered possible only by the co-operation of the British and United States Governments. They were now anxious to follow up the devaluation by measures to unfreeze international credit and trade, and by the reduction of trade restrictions. In principle he was in agreement, but held that the initiative rested with France, since it was not British tariffs, quotas and restrictions that were holding up trade. The French Government had startled us at Geneva by suggesting an Economic Conference on a basis which would enable the United States and Russia to be summoned, but not Germany or Italy.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs interpolated that he thought the French proposal would also have excluded Russia, but the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his information indicated that Russia would be included.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer, continuing, said that he himself had felt that no enter ostentatiously into negotiations from which Germany and Italy would be excluded would be most imprudent and calculated to react against the holding of the political Five-Power Conference. He had expressed his views, therefore, in no uncertain terms. The French had withdrawn their proposal and had agreed to co-operate in any suggestion we might make. they themselves, however, had proposed that a Note should be sent to the United States Government. In view of the

   
 election in the United States of America he had thought the moment ill-timed for this. Just now the French had a representative in London who wished to open negotiations. Meanwhile the Financial Secretary to the Treasury had raised questions as to whether it was desirable to hold a Conference at all, and, if a Conference was to be held, what was to be discussed? He himself felt something ought to be done to take advantage of the present situation, but thought that the proper line was to let the French know that we had made our contribution in not raising our tariffs or increasing restrictions on the fall of the Franc, and that it was now the French turn to make some real contribution.

The President of the Board of Trade said that the lowering of the French tariffs and barriers to trade was in fact more than offset by the effect of the fall in the value of the Franc. He warned the Cabinet that caution must be exercised. He was anxious to remove trade barriers, provided that this was not done solely at our expense.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said he had made enquiries from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, who was now in this country and who thought that if President Roosevelt won his election his victory was likely to be followed by an approach to the United Kingdom to enter into negotiations for a trade? treaty. The President might even have in mind, somewhat vaguely, the idea of a n International Economic Conference?.

The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries also uttered a note of warning as to the caution that had to be exercised in entering on a Conference.

  
FORMERAN COLONIESPreviousReference:Cabinet 55  (35)Conclusion 4)iI8.     The Secretary of State for the Colonieswarned the Cabinet that he had observed manyindications that there would be a big drive on thesubject of German Colonies when Parliament re-openedand the question would, have to be considered beforeParliament met.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet an account of a very secretin Paris,conversation he had held/on his way to Geneva withM, Blum.      In the course of this conversation,  theFrench Prime Minister had given an account of twoconversationswith Doctor Schacht in regard to theGerman economic difficulties and the vital importanceto Germany of Colonies.     Doctor Schacht had intimated that the German Government would like tohave conversations at once with the British andFrench Governments with a view to/^oomo kind of a dooA*sft&amp;ea* which Germany in return for some Colonialconcessions would give guarantees for peace in western Europe, with an indirect guarantee to GreatBritain and France that she would not attack Russia,and participation in a Disarmament Conference eventhough Soviet Russia was represented there.Doctor Schacht*s attitude had subsequently been confirmed by Her   Hitler.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had pointed out to M. Blum the great danger of conversations on the basis that we were willing todiscuss Colonies while Germany had not indicated withany precision what she was prepared to do.     At thisinterview, he had promised to send an interim reply which he had done after consultation with the PrimeMinister and one or two of his colleagues.     He read
to the Cabinet this reply, in the course of which he had pointed out that the British policy in regard to german colonies was covered by his own statement in Parliament onthe 27th July.     In more recent conversations, M. Blumhad regretted the resolution passed by the conservative party Conference at Margate which   he thought closed the door to this negotiation.     He himself had not accepted this view, and had pointed out that it was as well that herr Hitler should appreciate the strength of publicopinion in this matter.
THE SITUATIONIN SPAIN,(previous reference:Cabinet 56 (56)Conclusion 5)The BalearicIslands.9.     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs gave an account of the circumstances in.whichthe International Committee for the Application ofthe Agreement regarding non-intervention in Spainnow sitting in London had heen appointed on Frenchinitiative supported by our own Government,The arrangement was not 100 per cent, effectivebut had reduced the quantity of arms andammunition sent to Spain,     The situation had recently been complicated by the Russianaccusation against certain Powers, which had ledto a somewhat violent meeting of the Committee.Nevertheless, the Committee still remained in being.The Soviet Government had recently sent a message to the effect that there was seriousleakage through Portugal and that the Britishand French fleets ought to teAaekade that country.The Chairman of the Conference (Lord Plymouth)was about to reply that the procedure prescribed by the Conference itself of calling on thecountries concerned to reply to charges made against them was being followed up and that theRussian proposal could not be brought before theConference until the replies were received.Information had recently been receivedwhich indicated that the Italians were breaking the rules in the Balearic Islands,     The moment was peculiarly inopportune for bringing.this^/fl-tAd l**4&amp;*U fh,   L-*Ax$matter before the Committee, but h-ej pre^e-se^ atthe appropriate moment to consult the FrenchGovernment and if they raised the matter, to promise to support it.The Secretary of State was reminded that the Italian contravention was widely known
and was certain to &quot;be raised in Parliament and thatthere sfewaAeh-sw-bHs^/ undue delay in taking any action he deemed necessary.The Cabinet were also informed that therewas information that the Russians were sendingaircraft to Barcelona.The First Lord of the Admiralty who had recently returned from a visit to the Mediterraneanreported that naval officers who had recently been inthe Balearic Islands reported that the Italians were rather over-stressing their attitude and that theislanders were inclined to resent this.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had received definite assurance from italy that they had no designs on the BalearicIslands.The Cabinet were reminded that information had been received to the effect  that considerable quantities of arms and munitions were being sent tothe Spanish Government from Mexico.
PALESTINE. 10.    The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda circulated by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies for their information:-CP.-254 (36), containing a copyof a Secret Despatch from the rlighCommissioner for Palestine, dated12th September, 193 5, regarding thepolitical situation in Palestine andthe question of the deportation ofthe Mufti, together with a copy ofthe Secretary of state  s reply , dated 1st October:CP.-260 (35), containing the text of a Secret Despatch from tne highCommissioner expressing the view tj.xat,while temporary susgensionof immigrationmight possibly be justified for political reasons, he was satisfied that itcould not be defended, certainly notpublicly, on those grounds, and thatit was not at present justifiable oneconomic grounds.The Secretary of State for theColonies said that he had circulated theabove memoranda only for information.     He read to the Cabinet the following extract from atelegram which he had received that morning fromthe High Commissioner in Palestine:-&quot;There has already been a very markeddiminution of disorder and General Dillconsiders that there is now no need toissue the proclamation of delegationeither before or after 19th Octoberunless untoward developments take place,&quot;He warned the Cabinet that very shortly hewould have to bring before them the question ofthe continuance or otherwise of immigration whilethe Royal Commission was at work.

He was satisfiedthat, while Malta could not be made invulnerable, itcould be rendered difficult for attack even by italy.     In the case of Gibraltar, the featuresthat struck him were the lack of anti-aircraftartillery and the fact that not a single gun pointedtowards Spain and, above all, the importance ofproviding an aerodrome - though admittedly, thiswas a matter of the utmost difficulty.     So far asalmost at onceCyprus was concerned, he hoped /   to submit proposals to the Committee of Imperial Defence of a much less costly nature than those which had hitherto been mentioned.

Tne Committee had expressed themselves as against tne setting up of an authority without whose licence Unit Trusts could notbe formed or enlarged, and had proceeded to make anumber of detailed recommendations for safeguardingtne interests of the potential and actual investor.Early legislation being desirable, the President ofthe Board of Trade asked authority to have tnenecessary Bill drafted for submission in due course to the Committee of Home Affairs with a view tointroduction early next Session.   At tne end of his memorandum, however, the President emphasised thatcertain dangers were inherent in tne Unit Trustmovement wnich would not be eliminated by the pro-posed legislation:    e.g., the movement had prosperedon the foundation of a rising market in securities,and no-one could foretell what would happen in times of depression.

He had receivedmany letters favourable to tne idea, and none in an adverse sense, and the idea had ieaagnt tne attentionof the public.

THE SPECIAL AREAS.

21. In the course of the discussion on the preceding question the Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that he had received reports that caused him some anxiety as to the medical condition of the population in some of the special areas, particularly in South Wales. There was evidence of physical deterioration which in some cases affected the children. He asked if, in connection with the armament programmes, something could not be done to bring hope and life to some of these districts, for example, Merthyr Tydfil. He was reluctant to ask for special arrangements for feeding, but that might become necessary. The very fact that the remainder of the country was prosperous aggravated the misfortunes of these districts.

The Prime Minister pointed to the danger that the districts in question would think that no-one cared about them, as this would provide fertile soil for Communism.

The Minister of Labour said that he had examined a remarkable list of actions taken to improve the situation in the special areas, as well as a catalogue of proposals that it had not been possible to carry out. The major problem was to discover an effective way of appealing to industrialists to establish manufactories in these districts. The late Commissioner for the South Wales area had taken individual steps in this direction, and in addition on appeal in the form of a roneo-ed letter, which had probably been overlooked by many of the 7,000 industrialists to whom it had been addressed. He was trying to devise a more effective form of appeal.

The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence said that his duty, in conjunction with the Service Ministers, was to press forward the defensive

 
programmes, and at the moment he was confronted with great difficulties in regard to labour, andespecially building labour.    If they were to put,for example, an aeroplane factory in South wales,the skilled labour would not be available and fouryears would be lost before a single aeroplane couldbe produced.   If he was told by tne Cabinet tnat hewas to put tne interests of the special areas in front of tne defensive programmes, he could do it;but if the programmes were to advance at maximum speedwe could not afford to establish them in South wales .Finance was not the difficulty, as one of hiscolleagues had suggested.   He added tnat he would bedeceiving the Cabinet if he gave any other reply.The Secretary of State for Air said that he hadalready succeeded in promoting a good deal of worjs.in Lancashire by an ascertainment of firms whichcould undertake work as sub-contractors to themain contractors of the Air Ministry.   He had recommended Sir Robert Horne, the Chairman of theIndustrialists Committee on the Special Areas, toadopt a similar procedure, and ne understood thatthis would be investigated.   He had also asked theAir Ministry to look into the possibilities ofSouth wales for the establishment of undergroundpetrol storage, if this should be approved.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence saidtnat another possibility for wales was in theproduction of liquid fuel from coal, whether by the  Billingham process or the Fiscner process, bothof which were uneconomic but might become necessary on defence grounds.The President of the Board of Education addedthat before Christmas he would be publishing tne
Annual Report on the Health of School -Children,which would reveal so^e unpleasant facts about thehealtn of children in South nVales .The Chancellor of trie 3xeh.eq.uer thought itwould be premature to take a decision at tnatMeeting on such a short discussion, but if healthwas deteriorating he agreed that something must bedone .   He was iuore than doubtful as to tne wisdom of adopting a completely uneconomic decision.The subject, which was not onthe Agenda Paper of the Cabinet,was adjourned.

The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had received an intimation from The Kingthat His Majesty would be glad if Cabinet Papers,other than Cabinet Conclusions, could be circulated to His Royal Highness The Duke of York.He had gladly acceded and had instructed theSecretary to make the necessary arrangements.

Guardian when the hands had not fallen in when ordered and ten minutes had elapsed beforethe order was obeyed.     The Admiralty had made someinvestigation and had/^come to the conclusion thatthe crew had not intended any mischief, but theringleader was a man who had been suspected in thepast of a mischief of the same kind.     As a court martial would take place on the morrow and would receive some publicity, he wished his colleagues toknow what had occurred.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.I.14th October, 1936.
