Beforethe two Ministers could frame remedial proposals,however, they considered that the matter neededfurther ventilation?    they therefore sought theconcurrence of their colleagues in the setting upof a small committee of independent persons of standing,with the following terms of reference:-&quot;To examine the present position inregard to the regulation of wagesand conditions of service of personsemployed in connection with the carriage of goods by road (whether in vehicles authorised under &quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot; or &quot;C&quot; licences) and to make recommendations as to the actionwhich it is desirable to take.&quot;After hearing explanations of the proposal   bythe Minister of Lahour, in the course of which he mentioned that it would be a public Inquiry with apublic Report, the Cabinet agreed  To approve the proposal of theMinisters of Labour and transport as set forth above.

In thesecircumstances the Minister requested the authority ofthe Cabinet -(l) To complete the preparation of a Billfor transferring the control of specifiedtrunk roads from County Councils to theMinister of Transport as from the begin-ning of the next financial year (or some later date to be appointed by him), witha view to the introduction of the Billin the autumn,    the Bill to be submittedto the Committee of Home Affairs in theusual way .(2) To make an announcement in parliament in general terms of the Government&apos;intention to introduce a. Bill to transfer the Trunk Roads to the Minister ofTransport .(3) To explain the proposals and their financial effect to the Local Authoritiesgenerally in the course of the discussions as to the adjustment of the GeneralExchequer Contribution which are nowbeing conducted by the mreasury and theMinistry of Health and Scottish Officeand to pursue discussions with the CountyCouncils&apos;  Association at once,in suchdetail as may seem desirable, of thenature of the scheme with a view toenlisting their co-operation.In the course of a short discussion the Chancellorof the Exchequer drew attention to paragraphs (10)- and (ll) on pages 5 and 6 of the Memorandum, where0it was proposed that the Minister of Transport should assume financial responsibility for the scheme, butadded that it was hoped to recover a certain amountfrom the Local Authorities in the general review
of the Block Grant   which was now being undertaken in consultation with Local Authorities by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for&amp;Scotland.The Minister of Health reported that these negotiations were making good progress.The Minister of Labour, while welcoming thescheme, laid the utmost stress on the importanceof taking advantage of this opportunity to insist on work on the roads being provided, by those responsibleI for the actual work (e.g., County Councils acting^a^. t.f   a^.oL 7Ljx.L&apos;     \ as agents for the Ministry of Transport, orcontractors working for County Councils)  for young-iLunemployed in en/.In reply to a question as to what steps wereto be taken in the case of trunk roads runningthrough a succession of very poor Counties lackingtechnical personnel for the direction of road construction, the Minister of Transport explainedthat in those cases the Ministry could, lend, specialiststo assist the County Councils.The Lord Chancellor, while sympathising with theMinister of Labour&apos;s desire for young unemployed,men to be engaged for this work, entered a caveatas to the und.esirability of imposing conditions in contracts, as other Governments might use the precedent  to insert very undesirable conditions.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the proposals of theMinister of. transport as set forth in paragraph 20 on page 9 of his memorandum   C .P .-186 (36)) and. quoted,above:(b) That the Minister of Labour should,put his Department in communicationiLz ^&amp;et.ds&amp;4-   I with the Ministry of Transport on the(The Lord Privy.

RAILVAY FREIGHTREBATES SCHEME.(previous reference:Cabinet 3 8(35),  Con-elusion 7 .)4, The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Transport  (CP.-161 (36))  showingthe effect of certain legal decisions as to the valuation for rating purposes of the Southern and london and North Eastern Railways on the railway freight Rebates Scheme.   He suggested that the mostpracticable means of preserving the scheme fromextinction were:-(l) By amending legislation to relieve the Railway Companies of their obligations to bear half of defi-ciencies arising in the Fund andto ask them to agree to a,eceptrepayments over a. term of years without interest;(S) Also by amending legislation to concentrate the reduced, sumavailable for rebates upon anarrower range of traffics fora period, of years, and. to thisend. to negotiate with theinterests concerned, as soon asthe position in regard, to thevaluations is sufficientlydefinite .In the course of the discussion the Ministerof Transport, gave the Cabinet an explanation of his proposals, and. the Minister of Health mentioned,that the Railway Companies had now made an offer tothe Locs-1 Authorities .   He counted on the Ministerof Transport to co-operate in the negotiations whichhad been undertaken by the Ministry op Health, inconsultation with the Board of Trade and. the scottish office so far as Scotland was concerned.The President of the Board of Trade reportedthat the rebates proposed were very important.   Forexample,coal for export, which had. hitherto receivedrebates of 8d.. a. ton, was now only to receive 5d.As a result of enquiries he had. to report that thereduction of 3d. might in many cases prove decisivein the question of whether a contract for the supplyof coal abroad could be accepted or not.   A hardly-tried industry was going to be hit once more.
Attention was also drawn to the fact thatagriculture was treated worse than the export coal, but it was pointed out&apos; that export coal wasin a very peculiar position.The Minister of Transport informed the Cabinetthat by adopting his proposals the Cabinet wouldnot be committed to the particular proportions inwhich their effect was to fall on different indus-tries .    These were matters of disoussion between theDepartments concerned.On this understanding the Cabinet agreed  (a) mo approve the proposals of theMinister of Transport in CP.-161(3 5) paragraph 9, which are quoted above:(b) That the President of the Eoard ofTrade and other Ministers concerned should keep in touch with theMinistry of Transport in regard tothe incidence of the effect ofthese proposals .
