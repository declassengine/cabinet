THE MEETING OF PARLIAMENT.



Request for an earlier Date.



(Previous Reference: Cabinet 54 (36), Conclusion 2.)

 1. The Prime Minister read a letter, dated  October 19th, which he had received from Mr Attlee, the Leader of the Labour Opposition, expressing grave concern as to the situation in Spain and suggesting that in view of the increasing gravity of the position the Prime Minister should consider the immediate summoning of Parliament. He then read a draft of the reply which subject to the approval of the Cabinet, he proposed to send. The effect of this draft reply was to point out that an International certain allegations which had been made; that the policy of the Government was not only to carry out loyally their own undertaking not to send arms to Spain but also to promote in every way possible the execution of the terms of the international agreement on the subject; that the work of the Committee would not be materially assisted and that the limitation of the conflict in Spain would not be affected by the summoning of Parliament a few days earlier than it was due to meet; and that consequently he did not think it desirable to request Mr Speaker to summon Parliament earlier than October 29th. at the same time he would be prepared to arrange that a Debate on the Situation in Spain should take place on the day on which Parliament re-assembled, namely, October 29th. The Prime Minister added that the effect on this was likely to be to postpone until October 30th the prorogation of Parliament.

The Cabinet approved the draft reply proposed by the Prime Minister, which, together with Mr Attlee&apos;s letter to the Prime Minister, is attached as Appendix I to these Conclusions.

    
The King&apos;s referred to a declaration recently made by the KingrecentAnnouncement.       of tne Belgians on tne attitude of Belgium towardsthe present European situation, and more particularlytowards the proposed nev. Locarno Treaty.    Tnere wasnotning particularly new, so far as our Knowledge ofthe Belgian attitude was concerned, in what the king had said.   The Belgian Foreign Minister nad, in conversations at Geneva, expressed similar views,and before tne Foreign Secretary went to Geneva tneCoiamittee of Imperial Defence nad examined tne effectof tne Belgian desire to be a guaranteed but not aguarantor country.    The difficulty arose mainly fromthe unfortunate manner in wnich the announcement nadbeen made.   The root cause of the announcement wasthe internal politics of Belgium.   The Flemings,who had always&apos; been somewhat anti-french, had become more so owing to the Franco-Soviet pact.    Tneir support,however, was necessary to the Government in order tosecure the passage of tneir armament programme.Belgian GovernmentTne/ had miscalculated tne international effect ofthis announcement in tne manner of herr Hitler.The Secretary of State himself had nad severalconversations with tne Belgian Ambassador, and thedifficulties had partly been cleared up.     the outstanding difficulty, however, arose out of thedeclaration of March 19th, when tne Belgian, french,British and Italian Governments had declared that nothing tnat had happened before or since the breach of tne Treaty of Locarno should be considered as having freed tne signatories from any of tneir.obligations or guarantees, which subsisted in tneirentirety.   How far was that affected by tne Belgianaction?    The Iritisn position ebviouoly was not etUentL^affected, as wo -had &quot;undor-takon- to otar^mt)j&apos;&apos; tho  /     ,-
 terms of the old Locarno Treaty. Hitherefore?, Belgium did not occupy a similar position, we should be indirectly affected? He suspected the Belgian attitude to be that they would stand by the old Locarno Treaty except insofar as concerned the guarantee that they gave therein to France. The question arose as to whether he was to press Belgium on the point. He was inclined to take no action for the moment and leave it to France to clear the matter up, which he understood the French Government intended to do in their own time. The only difficulty was that the question might be raised in Parliament.

In a short discussion on this point it was suggested that a Question might be asked in Parliament as to how we stood in the matter of the Locarno Treaty and the declaration of March 19th, which was drawn up on the assumption that all were bound by Locarno. The Government might be asked as to whether Belgium was still bound, and, further, as to whether this country was still bound.

One view was that it would be rather risky to give an affirmative answer to the latter question, as involving an unpopular commitment. Another point of view was that it would be a mistake to say anything which threw doubt on the validity of the Locarno engagement and that it would be better to take at its face value the Belgian statement that "The King&apos;s speech does not in any way affect the obligations by which Belgium is bound". If that were done, the question as to the British obligation would not arise.

The Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs --

(a) That he should leave to the French Government in their own time to ascertain the precise attitude of the Belgian Government towards the existing Locarno Treaty:

  
(bj That if the question of the Belgianattitude was raised in Parliament,he should quote tne Belgian declara-tion that the King&apos;s speech does notin any way affect       obligations bywhich Belgium is bound.

3. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C.P.-268 (36)) circulating in combined form the recent correspondence regarding the preparation for the proposed Conference of the five Locarno Powers.

The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that on September 17th we proposed non-aggression and guarantee arrangements as in the Locarno Treaty, supplemented by guarantees for the United Kingdom from Germany and France. The French agreed; the Belgians, though their official reply is still outstanding, do not want to give the guarantees to France and Germany which they gave in the Locarno Treaty; the Italians prefer an agreement going no further than the old Locarno Treaty; the Germans prefer an agreement with the same non-aggression and guarantee arrangements as in Locarno. The importance of the German and Italian attitude was that, when considering an Air Pact, they were willing that this country, should be given a guarantee. They now proposed that the Air Pact should be swallowed in the Locarno Treaty, and consequently we should receive no guarantee.

So far as exceptions to the Treaty were concerned, we wished to except self-defence and action under the Covenant, as in Article 2 of the Locarno Treaty; the French agreed, and wanted a special provision intended to cover their commitments in Central and Eastern Europe, on the understanding that those commitments fell within the Covenant; the Belgians had so far expressed no opinion; the Germans wanted no exceptions. Neither the Germans nor the Italians would accept the exceptions required by the French Government.

  
So far as the League of Nations was concerned, we claimed that violation of thenon-agression undertaking was a matter for the Leagueultimately, even in the case of a flagrantagression this was the case.     The French agreed;the Belgians and Italians had expressed no view;the Germans did not consider it necessary orappropriate to submit this question to the Leagueof Nations.Everyone accepted our views as to thecompletion of the new agreement by arbitration and conciliation arrangements as in Locarno.The situation, therefore, was far fromeasy.     As soon as the Belgian official answer wasreceived he proposed to collate the replies and toask the Cabinet for a discussion.The Prime Minister asked that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should, if possible,circulate .a memorandum on the question before the endof the week, with a view to a discussion at the next regular weekly Meeting Of the Cabinet.t
SPAIN .Situation in.(Pr previous reference:Cabinet 57(35) , Con-f elusion 9 .)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs drew the attention of tne Cabinet to telegrams hehad sent on the previous day to tne British Charged&apos;Affaires at Madrid and to tne british ambassador to Spain, at Hendaye, with a view to mitigating tnedangers to, or sufferings of, non-combatants,including an urgent appeal on purely humanitariangrounds to tne authorities on both sides to cometo an agreement for an exchange of nostages, andmore especially for tne release and removal into some place of safety of women included among tnehostages.    In addition, tne good offices of HisMajesty&apos;s Government were offered.   He had thoughtit right, in tne present situation, not to delay-action until after the Meeting of the Cabinet.The Cabinet warmly endorsed tneaction of tne Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs .

5. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs recalled that the International Committee on Non-Intervention had asked the Portuguese, Italian and German Governments to reply to certain charges made by the Soviet representative on the Committee. An answer had been requested by Friday next, but no reply had been received as yet. The Italian and German Press seemed to indicate that their respective Governments were in no hurry, which gave the impression that they would not be averse to a breakdown. He himself proposed to see the three 

Ambassadors concerned the same afternoon and to ask for a reply before Friday, even if it were only of an interim nature. He thought it unavoidable that the International Committee should meet again on Friday. Meanwhile the Foreign Office had received details of certain alleged infractions, of which he handed round particulars. (Appendix II.)

After a short interval for study of the Memorandum a discussion followed on the question of whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should bring these alleged breaches of the agreement to the notice of the international Committee.

It was pointed out that the more specific evidence was against the Soviet Government, the evidence of Italian breaches being less definite. It was undesirable to give the appearance of making accusations against one Government only. It was recalled, however, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had taken a lead in bringing to the notice of the Committee the allegations of the Spanish Government against certain other Governments, including the Italian Government.

The Cabinet were reminded that when Parliament met the Government were certain to be asked question as to what evidence of breaches of the agreement they had 


received, and it would then be necessary to make somedisclosures.    In these circumstances, while it was most important to avoid any action calculated to jeopardise/ tne international -agreement, it seemed unavoidableto bring the evidence, where it was sufficient, tothe notice of tne Committee .It was suggested that this might be ascomplisnedby stating that tne information we have is notdefinite enougn to justify the bringing of specificcharges.   tie felt, however, that we ought to supply the Committee witn such information as we nad, wnicnwent to show tnat some infractions nad taken placeon both sides .    It would then be for tne international committee to take such action as it thought fit .A suggestion was made tnat it might be advisable to give notice to the Ambassadors of the countries concerned   Russia and Italy   of the proposed action.The Cabinet agreed  (aj That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should prepare aMemorandum, in the light of tneCabinet discussion, for consider-ation by the International Committee:(b) That if some new factor should arise,such as an announcement by some otnerPower of its intention to communicateevidence of a breach of tne agreement,he should consult the Prime minister as to tne expediency of communicating-his Memorandum to the Committee.
The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedtnat in normal circumstances tne insurgents would,in accordance witn precedent, nave been recognised as belligerents some time ago but for tne inter-national agreement of non-intervention.Tne Cabinet approved tne proposal of tne Secretary of State forForeign Affairs .Possible Re- informed tne Cabinet tnat if tne insurgents  capturedcognition ofInsurgents. Madrid he proposed to recognise them as belligerents.The significance of this was contained in the(previous reference: following note by the Naval Staff, which, in theCabinet 58(35), Con- absence of the First Lord of tne Admiralty, had beenelusion 5 .)sent to the Secretary and was read to the Cabinet:-FR.io^(,)7.. It ig un(ierstood that the Foreigntt(3^.)&apos;5 Office have it in mind to suggest tnatthe Spanish insurgents should be recog-nised as belligerents when Madrid falls .From the Naval point of view theeffect of tnis would be to conferbelligerent rightd at sea upon botnsides in the Spanish Civil war.    these rights would include tne right ofbio chad e (if a blocha.de could inpractice be made effective) and theright to seize contraband on the nignseas.   For example, the insurgentwarships would be legally within tneirrights in capturing Russian snips onthe high seas conveying arms to tneiropponents.   The same would apply tocargoes of arms and other contrabandin British ships.&quot;

The minister suggested January 4, 1937, as the date of commencementof payment of contributions, if Parliamentary approvalof the necessary resolutions could be obtained bythe middle of November.   Tne Exchequer contribution would be rather more tnan  100,U00 a year, but this amount should be more than off-set by the saving-tothe Exchequer as from April 1, 193 7, of tne cost ofunemployment allowances which would otherwise havebeen payable to unemployed private gardeners.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Minister of Labour as setforth in his memorandumCoP. 267 (36) and summarisedaVove.

THE LATE KING(JiiORGE V.MEMORIAL TO.14.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer apologised for having to bring this question to the Cabinet withoutcirculating papers.    His colleagues would recollect(previous reference:^Cabinet 17(36)    that at a Meeting held at the invitation of the LordConclusion 13.Mayor of London last March, it was resolved that the memorial to His late Majesty King George V should takethe form of -1. a statue to His late Majesty in London insome noble setting.2. A philanthropic scheme of a specificcharacter which would, benefit the whole country andwhich could be in the late King&apos;s name,A Committee was appointed to advise the most appropriate means by &quot;which effect could be given tothis resolution, and it was finally decided that for thefirst of these purposes an area of ground at AbingdonStreet immediately opposite the Houses of Parliament shouldbe acquired, cleared of existing buildings and laid out as an open space, in the centre of which a statue of thelate King should be erected.For the second purpose it was decided that themost suitable project was the provision of playing fieldsfor young people and children throughout the country.These decisions were reached on the sole responsibility of the Lord Mayor&apos;s Committee,    They had had before them various alternatives,  including a proposalfor the maintenance as an open space of the site inParliament Square which was recently acquired by theMiddlesex County Council at great cost,  towards &quot;whichthe Council have more than once urged the Government,without success, to contribute, as an entirely separateimprovement scheme.    Before the Lord Mayor&apos;s Committeereached their decisions,  the Prime Minister and he himself had informed a deputation of members of Parliament
BOBthat they would not refuse to consider a contrihutionto either the Abingdon Street or the Parliament Squareimprovement scheme if one or other were adopted &quot;by theCommittee,The full Abingdon Street scheme as originallyadvocated by the Archbishop of Canterbury involved the demolition of all the houses between Poets&apos; Corner andCollege Street and was estimated to cost approximately 400,000,    To carry out this scheme in full and at thesame time to provide adequately for the national &quot;playing fields would have necessitated the raising by publicsubscription of approximately twice as much, since theCommittee had given a pledge that not less than one half of the public subscriptions should be applied tothe Playing Fields scheme.    In fact the Fund on the16th. October amounted to only  293,000 and it was obviousthat even allowing for the promised contribution from theGovernment, the Memorial Committee would have to modify their ideas.In these circumstances the Lord Mayor andLord Macmillan called recently to explain the positionto the First Commissioner of &quot;works and himself and as certain the Government&apos;s views.    The Fund then stood at about  280,000 and they hoped that it would reach 300,000.    They realised that the original AbingdonStreet scheme was impracticable, but they -were convincedthat a satisfactory truncated scheme could be carriedout on the same site, in which the demolition would stopat a point opposite the Victoria Tower, leaving untouchednumbers 28 - 18 Abingdon Street.    They estimated thatthis scheme.would cost about  200,000,  and they proposedto contribute about  100,000 to it, in the hope that theGovernment would make good the balance.    That wouldenable them to devote say  200,000 to the provision of
national playing fields which naturally makes a much wider appeal to the public than the metropolitanscheme.    They were confident that a scheme on theselines would he thoroughly satisfactory from all points of view.    He, himself,  indicated that the figure ofwhich he had been thinking for the government contribution was in the neighbourhood of  50,000rather tnan  100,000, but he promised to consider thematter and communicate with them further.Circumstances today are not propitious to alarge gift of cash by the Government to a purpose ofthis kind;    indeed, any cash contribution might be criticised.    Ho Government contribution of any kindwas made to the national memorials to Queen Victoriaor King Edward VII.    It was, however, clear that thescheme in the form in which it has been publicly announced could not proceed without government assistance of some kind;    and it so happened that wewere in a position to give a generous measure of support to the Fund without imposing a correspondingimmediate burden upon the Budget.    Of the area whichit was proposed to devote to the memorial, about one half is   p roperty in the ownership of the Office of Works,a portion of which is already unoccupied.    The actualvalue of the occupied portion might be put at about 80,000, based on the capital cost of providingalternative accommodation elsewhere.    He thought,however, that it would be generally felt to be inappropriate that so large a portion of the publicsubscriptions should be devoted to a payment to theGovernment for public property, more especially as the surrender of this property would not involve theGovernment in any immediate capital expenditure, sincethe Office of &quot;forks would almost certainly provide the
necessary alternative accommodation by renting ratherthan purchase or building.    He proposed, therefore,that the Government contribution should take the formof a free gift of all the property within the area nowin the ownership of the Office of Works0    The value ofthis to the Fund might he put at approximately 100,000 including the value of the unoccupied space;but tue consequent charge on the Budget would belimited to the cost of rent of alternative accommodation,say  3,000 per annum.To complete the truncated scheme as proposed by themselves,  the Committee would have to incur from theFund an expenditure of approximately  100,000, leaving a sum of nearly  200,000 already in hand for theNational Playing Fields - practically as much as they themselves had aimed at.It would be necessary to obtain parliamentary approval of the gift, and he proposed, if his colleaguesapproved, to move a Resolution to that effect on thefirst convenient occasion.Meanwhile the Lord Mayor very much wished to announce the Governments decision on the occasion ofthe Guildhall Banquet on November 9th, and he proposed,subject to the approval of the Cabinet, to authorise him to do so, making clear that the gift was subjectto the approval of Parliament.He added that it was proposed that the MemorialCommittee should take full responsibility for theappointment of the Architect and Sculptor and for the lay-out of the site;    but the First Commissioner ofWorks would, of course, be represented on the ExecutiveCommittee and would be consulted on all questions ofprinciple.    Further, the approval, of the Commissioners-2&amp;-
of Works was necessary for the erection of any statuein any public place, under the terms of the Public .Statues Act of 1804.It had been suggested that the aestheticvalue of the scheme might be improved by including in the site No.28 Abingdon Street.    The acquisitionof this house for demolition would add  15,000 netto the cost;    and he proposed to leave it to the memorial Committee to decide whether it was worthwhile for them to incur this extra expenditure fromtheir own resources.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence as Chairman of the National Playing Fields Associationwarned the Cabinet that the sum of  200,000 would not go nearly so far as Lord Macmillan had assumed in a recent speech, in providing playing fields throughoutthe country.    Except in a few localities expenditureof this order would hardly be noticeable.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer as set forth above.

The Meeting of Parliament.Correspondence between the Prime Ministerand the Leader of the Opposition.House of Commons.19th October, 1936.Dear Prime Minister,Ever since the Adjournment of the House in Julythere has been,  as you know, grave concern regardingthe situation in Spain,  and with the progression ofevents anxiety has steadily deepened.Although the allegations have not yet been definitely proved,  there is strong ground for the belief that the policy of non-intervention has been deliberatelyviolated, and whilst it is true that the international committee have now initiated an investigation into theseallegations, we fear that the delay, not wholly unavoidable-able, will enable the policy of non-intervention to bestill further abused in order to aid those who are inrebellion against the elected Government of Spain.In view of the increasing gravity of the situationwe would ask you to consider the immediate summoning ofParliament in order that the full position may be made public and the House given an opportunity to consider how best to deal with it.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    C.R. ATTLEE.The Rt. Hon.  Stanley Baldwin,  P.C., M.P.,10, Downing Street,London,  3.W.I.
10, Downing Street,S .W. 1.21st October, 1936.My dear Attlee,I have to-day consulted my colleagues aboutthe request conveyed by your letter to me of October 19ththat Parliament should be summoned immediately toconsider the situation in Spain.The Government&apos;s main concern has been tosee that events in Spain do not involve hostilities overa wider area.    With that object in view they supported the initiative of the French Government in setting upthe International Committee.    That Committee is even now, as you mention in your letter,  engaged in thework of investigating certain allegations which havebeen made.    The Government are determined not only tocarry out loyally their own undertaking, but also topromote in every way possible the execution of theterms of the agreement.    I do not see that the work ofthe Committee will be materially assisted or that themain object which the Government has in view, namely the limitation of the conflict to Spain, will bevitally affected by the summoning of Parliament at themost four or five days earlier than it is due to meet.For these reasons I do not think itdesirable to request Mr.  Speaker to summon Parliamentearlier than October 29th.At the same time I appreciate your desireto have an early discussion and I would be prepared toarrange that a debate on the situation in Spain shouldtake place on the day on which Parliament reassembles,namely October 29th,Yours sincerely,(Signed) STANLEY BALDWIN.The Right Hon. CR. Attlee, M.P.
List of -probable infractions of the agreement regarding Non-intervention in Spain based upon evidencesupplied by British official sources,It should be noted that His Majesty&apos;s consular officers have not been instructed to seek out informationof this nature, the opinion being held that the sole dutyof His Majesty&apos;s Government in the first instance was tosee to the application of the Agreement in the UnitedKingdom rather than to seek evidence of infractions byother countries.For this reason the information at our disposal asvoluntarily supplied by His Majesty&apos;s Ships and consular Officers is somewhat meagre.Ho information containing sufficient evidence to warrant a charge being made is available in regard toGermany, France or Portugal.ITALY(1)   On September 7th the Italian s.-s.&quot;Itereide&quot;discharged a cargo at Palma which, from observationsmade by His Majesty&apos;s Ship &quot;Galatea&quot; was seen to include6 fighters and an unknown Quantity of bombs,  shells,rifles and ammunition.    On the same day 3 Italianbombers arrived.(2)    His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Palma reportedthat on September 23rd cargo was transferred from theItalian s . s.&quot;Sicilia&quot; to the Italian destroyer&quot;Malocello&quot; which landed the cargo on September 23-24.The cargo was believed to contain ammunition and bombsbut this could not be confirmed.(3)    His Majesty&apos;s Vice-Consul at Palma reportedthat on September 25th the unloading of cargo from an italian steamer at Palma on to the Italian cruiser&quot;Polar&quot; took place all day.
