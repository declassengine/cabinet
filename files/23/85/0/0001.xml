THE REGENCY 3. In the course of the discussion on parliamentary business referred to in the preceding Conclusion,I(Previous the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury drewReference:Cabinet 39 attention to the difficulty -o&apos;f finding time for the(35), Con-clusion 11.)       passage of the Regency Bill.pps.sx.(i^)^. -ke TJome Secretary reported that, in accordancewith the decision of the Cabinet, he had shown thedraft of the Bill to the Leaders of the Opposition.The Leader of the Labour Opposition did not like theBill, and the Home Secretary himself thought hecould see his way to a better draft and was in communication with Parliamentary Counsel on thesubject.    It would not be possible, however, for him to re-draft, introduce and pass the Bill beforethe end of the present month.    If the K&quot;ing should goabroad, therefore, arrangements would have to be madeon the same lines as in the past.The Cabinet agreed  ^hat it would not he possible topass the Regency Bill before theParliamentary Recess .

UNEMPLOYMENTASSTSTANOE.^he new Dra^tRegulations .(previous reference:Cabinet 47(36), Oon-clusion 1.)5 . The Minister of Labour gave the cabinet an explanation of the announcement he had madeon the previous day that the Unemployment As sist-ance Regulations would be published on July 14th.The reason for this delay was that in hiscalculations he had had to make allowance for thefollowing five elements :-(l) The completion of the Regulations.(2) The issue of a White Paper.(3) The work of the Cabinet Committee.(4) Printing and publishing.(5) Possible disagreement by the Board.The Regulations were in draft and very nearlyready, but he had to be quite sure that theyembodied the decisions of the Cabinet.   A gooddeal of the White Paper also was in draft, but every sentence had to be examined, as the presentation of the case was all-important.He hoped to circulate these documents to theCommitteeCabinet/ not later than Saturday morning.    If theCabinet Committee could, take its decision by the8th and agreement was reached by. the ^UnemploymentBoard,Assistance/ he thought it possible that theRegulations might be published by the 10th.It was impossible,  however, to be sure of this,and the earliest safe date he had been able togive,- after consultation with his officials, wasthe 14th, which he believed was a firm date.He was not yet in a position to report agreement on the part of the Unemployment Assistance Board.Owing to the bereavement of one of the membersof the Board, the Chairman had had to go toDerbyshire for a funeral and the work of theBoard, had been unavoidably delayed..,
Tn the course of a short discussion the Ministerof Labour was asked to do his utmost to expeditematters, and, with this object in view, to let theCabinet Committee have any parts of the draft white paper that were ready, for the earliest possibleconsideration.The Minister did not anticipate being able to circulate either the Regulations or the White paper before the morning of Saturday, July 4th, though his department had already received instructions to treattheir preparation as a day and night task.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Cabinet Committee on theRegulations of the unemployment assistance Board should meet onMonday, July 6th,  at 11 a.m., inthe Treasury Board Room:(b) That the Minister of Labour should, . -in the meantime, circulate to them the Draft Regulations and the draft white Paper at the earliest possible moment and in any event not later than the morning of Saturday, July4th:(c) That  it would only he necessary forthe Cabinet to meet in the event of disagreement by the unemployment assistance Board:(d) That the Cabinet Committee should endeavour to complete its work by july 8th.
GERMANY AND&apos; S. Geneva Telegram No. 89, of July 1st,  frommw LOCARNOmR^^my. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, was handed round at the outset of the Cabinet for consideration(Previous , .Reference:       as a matter of urgency (Appendix).    It contaxned aCabinet 41(35), Con-       recommendation from the Secretary of State forelusion 4.)Foreign Affairs that he should be authorised topa*.sofityz..     accept a proposal for a meeting of the locarno powers (other than Germany)  at Brussels on July ISth.In the course of the discussion the first point raised was as to whether it was wise to include italy in the proposed meeting.    In favour of the proposalit was pointed out that Italy had been represented at meetings of the Locarno Powers (other than Germany) that had taken place when that country was subject to active sanctions.   By July 16th sanctions,would have been removed.    Italy was one of the locarno Powers, and the proposed, meeting at Brusselswould not have the status of the Locarno Powersother than Germany (who had broken the locarno treaty) unless Italy was represented.    It wassuggested also that this was a particularly goodway of getting Italy back into co-operation with other european Powers, more especially if the invitationwas sent not by the three Powers  (the United Kingdom,,France and Belgium) but by the Belgian Prime minister as the host at the Brussels meeting.On the other hand, doubts were expressed as tothe effect of the inclusion of Italy on publicopinion in this country, which had been a good dealembittered by the fact of Italy&quot;s successful issuefrom sanctions .A second consideration that was raised, was as towhat would be the effect of a meeting of the locarno powers (other than Germany) not only on the German
Government but on persons in this country whocriticised the Government as ^ anti-German.Germany, it was recalled, was one of the locarno powers, and the German Government might well resentanother meeting being held without their presence,more especially if Italy was present.    Tn this con-nection apprehensions were expressed as to certainphrases in the telegram:    for example, reference to&quot;M. Van Zeeland&apos;s own purpose of placing Germany ondefensive&quot;:    M. Van Zeeland&apos;s suggestion that events&quot;had allowed Germany to escape from consequences ofher own action&quot;&quot;,    and the suggestion that if herr hitler refused this new chance of co-operation &quot;then the situation would he to that extent clarified&quot;.These passages of the telegram, it was suggested,were inconsistent with some others, such as thestatement of M. Van Zeeland&apos;s desire that the Powersrepresented at the Brussels meeting should &quot;make, ajoint approach to Germany which would, offer herr hitler a new chance of co-operation&quot;, and. that therewas a ten to one chance that Herr Hitler would accepta new opportunity of co-operation, and the expression of M. Blum&apos;s and M. Van Zeeland&apos;s desire &quot;to negotiations-ate with Germany as an equal&quot;.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that if an approach was to be made to Herr Hitler it would bebetter now than later, for the reason that after theOlympic Games, about to be held, in Berlin, Herr hitler was likely to be more difficult to deal with.It was thought possible that the Foreign secretary had been moved, by the consideration that if no replyto the British Questionnaire was received in the nearfuture the French and Belgian Governments would
declare that the negotiations had &quot;broken down andthat the agreement providing for that contingencymast come into force.Another suggestion was that possibly M. Blumand M. Van Zeeland, who for some time had desired ameeting of the Locarno Powers, had concerted thisproposal in order to force the hand of the foreign secretary.    In that event the Cabinet might hesitate to accept, though public opinion might react badlyto a refusal when it was known that M. Blum andM. Van Zeeland had pressed this proposal.The issues before the Cabinet, it was suggested,were as follows :-(l)  Aether the proposed Brussels meeting should be held?(2) Whether it was necessary to inviteItaly?(3) What was to be the Agenda?Was it to form a bloc against Germany?    Was it toplace Germany on the defensive?   Was it to driveGermany into a eorner where she could not avoidanswering the Questionnaire, or was it to offerHerr Hitler a new chance of co-operation?One suggestion was that before a decision wastaken it was desirable to ascertain from His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin what would be the probable effectof the Conference on the German attitude.While there was very strong disinclination onthe part of the Cabinet to reject the recommendationof- the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, thegeneral view was that rather more information was required:    for example, as to what the Belgian PrimeMinister had in mind in his suggestion that thePowers should make a joint approach to Germany.
Moreover, the issues at stake were felt to be ofsuch great importance that before taking a decision the Cabinet would be glad of an opportunity todiscuss the matter with the Foreign Secretarypersonally .The Cabinet agreed  That the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs should communicate by telephone with theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs( at Geneva) and. inform him of thegeneral trend of the Cabinet discus-sion, and more particularly of their desire for personal  contact before adecision was taken.   He was askedto suggest that the Foreign secretary should inform M. Van Zeeland of this and. should ask him in particular what he had in mind as to the form of jointapproach to Germany, and as to the subjects to be discussed at., and thepurpose of, the proposed Conference.

After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the proposals of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs in CP. 184 (36).(b) That as the above decision wouldresult eventually in conversations with the French onthe question of the capitulations,the Foreign Office and Board ofTrade should confer as to theattitude to be adopted in theevent of France proposing inreturn the abolition of ourPR, 30^37^) 3       rights in Morocco which were a factor in the important british trade in that country.(c) That the provision under which theBritish Government recognises the responsibility of theEgyptian Government for theprotection of foreigners(CP. 184 (36) Annex I, N)might be open to criticism andwould be improved by the proposal of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs in CP. 184 (36),paragraph 4? but that inview of the much more importantconcessions that had alreadybeen made in order to secure atreaty, it would be a mistake to insist on a modification onthis point.
THE ANGLO-EGYPTIANTREA^ NEGO-TIATIONS .The Sudan.(previous reference:Cabinet 43(36), Con-clusions 1and 2.)PA?-8,     The Cabinet    took note of a    Memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-182(36)) on the question raised at the Meeting referredto in the margin as to whether there was any risk that, at the end of 20 years, the League of Nations,at the instance of Egypt, might be able to secure theright for Egypt to appoint the Governor-General ofthe Sudan.   The answer to this enquiry seemed to bethat the position of the British Governor-General was assured constitutionally by the proviso under the condominium Agreement of 1899 that the Governor-General shall be appointed by the Egyptian Sovereignon nomination by His Majesty&apos;s Government:    if theGonstitution of the Sudan were changed at the instanceof the League of Nations, this and other provisos andsafeguards might be modified:    but (a)  it seemedinexpedient to draw attention to any such contingencyin the present negotiations&apos;    (b) presumably our influence with the League of Nations would preventthe League recommending a change of constitutional practice that would seem contrary to the legitimateinterests of His Majesty&apos;s Government and the SudaneseAdministration and which would be contrary to theterms of an agreement in which both parties had con-curred without time limit.   After calling attentionto a relevant passage at the top of page 3 of C.P.-176 (36), the Secretary of State added that HisMajesty&apos;s High Commissioner would seek agreement withthe Egyptian Delegation on the Sudan Article set outin Annex &quot;A&quot; to C.P.-176 (36), subject as regardsparagraph 7 ^which deals with the indebtedness of theSudan to Egypt) to the results of the discussion about to be held, between the Treasury and the Foreign Office,with the assistance of the Governor-General.

His Majesty&apos;sHigh Commissioner had been told that he was at liberty to tell Nahas Pasha that we should be glad,to agree with him that the signature of a treaty should take place in London.    On the question of whether the negotiations should ^e transferred toLondon (as Nahas Pasha wished) once the military clauses and the Sudan Clauses had been agreed to,while the Secretary of State would prefer that agreement should be reached on the whole Treatybefore the Egyptian Delegation visited this country,there might be advantage from the point of view ofspeed if the negotiations on the Civil Clausestook place in London.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs said that Sir Miles Lampson&apos;sreport on this point had not yet been received.

PROGRAMME OP 11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byNEW CONSTRUC-TION FOR 1936.    the First Lord of the Admiralty (C.P.-175 (36))The two new drawing the attention of his colleagues to twoCapital Ships.matters likely to cause criticism in*connect ion with)(Previous the steps to be taken to order the two BattleshipsReference:Cabinet 29 of the 1935 Programme, and seeking their concurrence(3 6), Con-clusion 1.)       in the following Admiralty proposalsPR 57/36)13.   &quot;(l) vYe propose to order the two chips- &apos;    &apos;   &apos; from two firms to be selected&quot; without competition.(2) We do not propose to wait for theReport of the committee of ImperialDefence Sub-Committee on the Vulner--ability of Capital Ships to air attack.&quot;In the course of the discussion, it waspointed out that the Admiralty must expect a gooddeal of criticism on the ground that they were departing from the ordinary methods of competition.,     The criticswould claim that the various precautions and checks toprevent over-charging were insufficient and this was another proof that the Government were not trying to stop profiteering.     They would also have to meet the criticism that, having abolished the competitivesystem, they selected a firm, namely, John Brown ofClydebank, who had already been specially favoured by the construction both of the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; andof the second &quot;Queen Mary&quot;.     Even if other firmswere getting other orders, it would be pointed outthat the construction of a capital ship broughtexceptional prestige.     The question was raised as towhether, in order to secure the completion of theship by July, 1940, instead of Januarjr, 1941 - amatter of six months, it was justifiable to reverse the ordinary procedure.      The question was also raised as to whether the report of the Committee on Bombsversus Battleships might not lead to alterations in
designs of ships which would, in any event, involve further delays.The First Lord of the Admiralty said thatthese points had been weighed very carefully.     Asregards the last point, he was informed that thepreliminary steps would be taken in such a way as toenable alterations to be made as a result of thereport of the Committee on Bombs versus Battleships.The work of the firms had to begin in the DrawingOffice and they did not place large orders at the outset.      So far as the placing of the orders was concerned, John Brown was the firm with the latestand best experience.     The other possible firm, namelMessrs. Cammel Laird, already had received an order for an aircraft carrier which, in some respects, was preferable to that of a capital ship.      It might beimpossible to say to-day that the completion of thecapital ship in July 1940, as compared with January,.1941, would be of vital importance or not, but whatwas important was to give Parliament the impression that construction was being expedited to the utmost possible extent.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencerecalled that,in the House of Commons in reply toMr. Churchill, he had made a statement to the effectthat certain preliminary steps could be taken now toenable capital ships to be laid down in the early months of 1937;    that to delay laying them down nowsimply meant that a corresponding delay would be involved before the battleships would be available and that a delay of two or three months was a responsibility which the Government would not take(Hansard,Volume 313, JNb, 78, Columns 1434-1435^1- 19 -
He understood that the First Lord of the admiralty was, in effect, only going to make the sameannouncement with greater authority.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed thathis statement would dot the &quot;jJs&quot; and cross the &quot;t&apos;s&quot;of the statement by the Minister for Go-Ordination ofDefence.      If the action proposed in his memorandum was not taken, it would result in deceleration,  that isto say, the very opposite of what the Minister forOo-Ordination of Defence had stood for.After considerable discussion, the cabinet agreed:(a) That the keels of the two capital ships must be laid down inJanuary, 1937.(b) That the First Lord of the admiralty should look into the possibilityof placing the order for one of thecapital ships to a firm in the mersey, but subject to (a) above and subject to consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequerbefore placing the order.(c) That if the President of the Board ofTrade had any suggestions to make to the Admiralty for improving theirsystem of costings, he shouldforward them to the First Lord ofthe Admiralty.

APPENDIX.Prom SWITZERLAND-.Decypher.His Ma jesty&apos;s Consul (Geneva).1st duly,  1936.2.00 a.m.&apos; 1st July, 1936.R.3.10 a.m.1st July, 1936.No.   89.IMMEDIATE.Following from Secretary of State:-Lord Stanhope and I dined this evening with Monsieur Blum,Monsieur Delbos, Monsieur Van Zeeland and new Belgian Ministerfor Foreign Affairs, Monsieur Spaark.      In the course of conversation which covered whole range of Italo-abyssinian dispute and (? general) European situation, Monsieur Van Zeelandand French Minister pressed strongly for a meeting of locarno powers in the near future.      Belgian Prime Minister emphasised that in his mind purpose of that meeting would not he a negativeone.      It was his desire that Powers there represented, which&apos;he hoped would include Italy, would make a joint approach to germany which would offer Kerr Hitler a new chance of co-operation which,in Monsieur Van Zeeland&apos;s view, he thought it ten to one latter would accept.      If,however,Herr Hitler were to refuse, thensituation would he to that extent clarified.      Monsieur Blumassociated himself with Monsieur Van Zeeland&apos;s point of view.It will he appreciated that Monsieur Van Zeeland&apos;suggestion gives new purpose to a meeting of Locarno Powers.Hitherto I have felt no enthusiasm for such a meeting because Ianticipated that we should there be called upon to take note ofbreakdown of conciliation and to admit that letter agreed uponhowever, to be considerable advantage from many points of view inin London on 19th March would come into force.There seems,
a meeting such as. Monsieur Van Zeeland suggests.    If Germ&apos;anGovernment has replied before meeting takes place then thatreply can be basis of our deliberations.If they have not replied, then joint approach will bethe more certain fulfilment of Monsieur Van Zeeland&apos;s ownpurpose of placing Germany on defensive.    Main burden of his remarks tonight was that events,  some of them extraneousto European affairs, had allowed Germany to escape fromconsequences of her own action.    he desired to negotiate withGermany as an equal, which comment Monsieur Blum warmly seconded.French Prime Minister declared   that he wanted a Europeanarrangement with or without Germany, preferably with.Both French and Belgian Ministers expressed a desire for ameeting; of Locarno Powers in Brussels next week.   This I saidwas physically impossible and they somewhat reluctantly agreedthat the projected date might be 16th July.    I undertook to letMonsieur Van Zeeland know if possible by tomorrow night the viewsof Mis Majesty&apos;s Government as to this meeting.    The matter is all the more urgent since the French and Belgian Ministers  are -anxious to approach Italy and cannot do so until we have made clear whether we are prepared to attend a meeting on the datesuggested.In all circumstances I strongly recommend that we should accept.Addressed to Foreign Office, No. 89 of 30th June,  repeated to Paris,  Brussels, Berlin and Rome. ;
