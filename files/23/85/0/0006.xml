GERMANY ANDT-TE locarno treaty.The proposedBrussels orLondon Meet-ing .f previous reference:Cabinet 52(3 6), Con-clusion 2.)f. R. 5U(sL) 31.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet a summary of the results, of aMeeting of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign affairs on the previous evening.    Generally the Committeehad felt that it would be difficult to adjourn theproposed Meeting of the Locarno Powers to October,as this would give the impression that the western powers had lost the initiative and that it was leftto the Dictators.    The French Ambassador, on theprevious day while the Cabinet was meeting, had seenSir Robert Vans ittart and made clear that the french were anxious to hold the Three-Power Meeting.    Theywere probably actuated mainly by considerations ofinternal policy.    The Government was weak and. wanted to show that they counted for something at any rateUnited kingdom with the /    and. Belgium.    This was to our own interestIf the Meeting was to be held., the Cabinet Committeepreferred. London, which was less likely to arouse thesuspicions of the Germans, and better in some respectsfor the French.    It would  give M. Blum an opportunityto meet the Prime Minister.    In addition, it would tend to give the leadership to this country.In reply to a question as to why the germans could not be asked to the Conference straight away,the Foreign Secretary said that the French would be-unlikely to agree.( The Foreign Secretary then handed,round two draft communiques. oneto be issued before the Conferenceand the other after the Conference,which had been approved, by theCabinet Committee and slightly amended in the Foreign Office.)The question was raised as to whether some reference ought not to be made to the abandonment ofthe British questions to Germany.
The Foreign Secret.-ry sai&apos;&quot;1 that one object op theMeeting was to get away from the Questionnaire.   he pointed out also that    as drafted, the communique&apos;.to be issued before the Conference made no referenceto Germany, and it would be difficult to drag in the questionnaire.    No-one, it was thought, would belikely to wish to revive these Questions.Turning to the German aspect of the question,the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs reportedthat the German Charge d&apos;Affaires had called uponSir Robert Vansittart the previous afternoon to enquireas to the prospects of a Meeting of the Locarno Powersand. had. stated, most confidently that his government wished, to participate.   Speaking personally, theCharge d&apos; Affaires had added, that he woul^ sooner havethe Meeting take place in the first fortnight, ofSeptember, that is, before the Meeting of the League,than later.    Tn any case he agreed, that the latestdate shoul- be earl3-- in October.   He had suggestedthat the proposed preliminary Meeting of the three powers would, prejudice the prospect of German participa-tion, if it did. not destroy it.    Sir Robert Vansittarthad replied that- a new situation had. arisen since the austro-German agreement, and. the negative reply receivedfrom Italy, had. reminded the Ambassador that therewere difficulties on both sides, and that the susceptibilites-bilities of the- French an/T Belgian Governments, whoboth desired a preliminary Meeting, toad to be takeninto account,    If it were decided that there should, bea preliminary Meeting of the three Powers it mustsurely be obvious that 1+ wrould be in the nature of aformality, for time alone, if nothing else, would prevent it from dealing with any programme which might
give umbrage in other quarters.   A preliminary meeting could, at, best, be but a brief prelude tothe real one to follow, and the German Governmentwould make a serious mistake if they looked upon thematter in any other light .    It was not, the moment toboggle about formalities of procedure.   At this PrinceEismarek had. brightened considerably and had volunteeredthe observation that, perhaps any preliminary conference would really be held, to soothe the susceptibilities ,ofthe French.   &quot;Re had left in an optimistic spirit.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs addedthat he proposed to keep the German Governmentcontinuously informed, and. would make clear that theproposed preliminary Meeting was not to discuss detailsbut only to concert an invitation to a Conference .After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(a)  To approve, for submission to theFrench and. Belgian Governments, thetwo draft Communiques attached inAppendices I and. II. the first being a preliminary Communique&apos;&apos; to be issuedbefore the proposed Conference, andthe second to be issued after theConference:(MOTE: The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was asked tore-draft paragraph (i) of thefinal Communique&apos; as the word&quot;european.n&quot; appeared to be inthe wrong place and should perhaps precede the word&quot;nations&quot;, so as to read&quot;all European nations&quot;.)(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should see the French and BelgianAmbassadors and tell them that, in spiteof ?,ome preliminary doubts, we were willing to hold the Meeting, preferably in London:    that, our idea was that theMeeting should, be a very short one,and that its object should be a.s setforth in the first Com.nuniaue.   Heshould, make clear that the object wasnot the formulation between the three powers of what was to be put to Germany.T-Te should hand them the draft Communiquesreferred, to above.   He should add thatif the French and Belgian Governnentsagreed to these proposals he intended.
to see the German Charge^ d&apos;Affairesand give him assurances as to the exact purpose and scope of the Meeting:(c) That an early date for the Meetingof the five Locarno Powers, in any event &quot;before the Meeting of theAssembly of the League of Nations,was preferable to a Meeting afterthe League Assembly.   Postponementto the later date was liable toincrease the area of discussion,whereas if held before the Assemblyit would be easier to confine theConference to a new Locarno Treaty.One result might even be that germany would return to the League of nations and become associated, with the pro-posed amendments to the Covenant .
THE MONTREUX So     The Secretary of State for ForeignCONFERENCE.Affairs said he gathered from such news as he had(previous reference: received that the United Kingdem delegation had cabinet 52(36)Conclusion l) secured an amendment to the effect that a pactIconcluded under the League of Nations would onlysecure exemption from the prohibittnby Turkey ofthe passage of warships in time of war in caseswhere Turkey was at the time a member of the pact.As regards Germany, he drew attention to telegram171 of the 7th July from Berlin where the german minister for Foreign Affairs was reported to havelet fall the remark that, in his personal view,no arrangements by us, if not to be observed intime of war, were of any value as the. Power in control of the Dardenelles could and would dowhatever it wished.      The German Charge d&apos;Affaireswas to call at the Foreign Office to-day whenexplanations would be made to him as to the presentposition.
THE MEDITERRANEAN.Guarantee tocertain Powers.&quot;(previous reference:Cabinet 4g(36)Conclusion 3)F R. SU. (34) if..3.     The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs attributed the misunderstandings that had arisen in Italy as to the temporary assurances tocertain States in the Eastern Mediterranean to theindiscretions at Montreux of the Turkish ForeignMinister, who had succeeded in giving the impression that a long range guarantee had been given.     TheItalian Foreign Minister was reported to have theintention of addressing assurances to the saidPowers that might enable us to liquidate thisparticular difficulty.
THE OLYMPIC 4.      In connection with the decision taken byGAMES.the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the(ProviousReference: margin, attention was drawn to a telegram fromCabinet 51 (36)Conclusion 4.) Tokyo No. 209 of the 10th July in which HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador had stated emphatically thatthe effect in Japan of a claim on our part to havethe Games again in London would be deplorable, andto Foreign Office telegram No. 125 of the 14th july to Tokyo which, it was suggested, was not in line with the Cabinet decision that steps should betaken to avoid the proposal being put forward tohold the Olympic Games in London.The Cabinet were reminded that the matter was not one for which the Government had any- responsibility, but it was suggested that none theless pressure could be put on the british representatives not to advance British olaims inthe circumstances.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs undertook to look into the question.

FORMERRMANJLONIES.^0Pirow&apos; stements.eviousfere rice:binet 51(36)conclusion 6)6.     The Cabinet discussed briefly statementsreported in the Press to have been made-by Mr. Pirow,the South African Minister of Defence and communications on his return to South Africa to theeffect that he had gathered from responsible quarters in England that we were not averse to  the return of someof Germany&apos;s former colonies.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said he had asked the Acting British High commissioner in South Africa for details and had received a reply,in the course of which he stated that he had ascertained that Mr. Pirow&apos;s statement was not the result of conversations with members of the Government.      He had tele-graphed for permission to use this information publicly,A short discussion then took place as to the answer to be given to a Question to be addressed to thePrime Minister in the House of Commons the same afternoon.The general view was that whatever else was said, it should be made quite clear that the british ministers had not expressed the -views   attributed toresponsible persons in this country by Mr. Pirow, but theframing of the reply was left to the Secretary of Statefor Dominion Affairs, who hoped, during the morning, toreceive a reply from the Acting British HighCommissioner in South Africa,2&quot;, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.16th July, 1936.
APPENDIX A.PRELIMINARY COMMUNIQUEAs a result of the exchange of views foreshadowedpy below   in the communique issued in Geneva on July 4thx, theGovernments of Prance, Belgium, and the United kingdom have now decided that there shall be a meeting in london on of representatives of these three Powers,  in order to consider hoy/ best to furthertheir purpose of promoting a general European settlement.ANNEX.Communique of July 4th.&quot;As a result  of conversations at Geneva betweenMonsieur Blum, Monsieur Delbos, Mr. Eden,.

APPENDIX B.FINAL COMMUNIQUE&quot;.The Representatives of France, Belgium, and the UnitedKingdom, having met in on ,have arrived at the following conclusions:-(1)    The main purpose to which the efforts of all european nations must he directed is that of general settlement.(2)    It is evident that such a settlement can only heachieved by the free co-co-operation of all the Fowers concerned,and that nothing would be more fatal to the hopes of suoh asettlement than the division, apparent or real,  of Europe intoopposing blocs.(3)    The three Powers, France, Belgium, and the UnitedKingdom, accordingly consider that steps should be taken toarrange a meeting of the five Locarno Powers as soon as sucha meeting can conveniently be held.
