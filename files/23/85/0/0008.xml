The Lord President of the Council informed theUse ef post-War    Cabinet that the Secretary had communicated theCabinet. papers in Autobio- Cabinet&apos;s decision referred to in the margin to thegraphies .Right Non. J .T-T.Thomas , who had replied in a letter(Previous showing that he had. taken the decisien in good part.Reference:Cabinet 64(36), Con-clusion 10.)
GERMANY AND 2. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theTT-TE LOCARNOrnREAmY. - Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP.-201(35))  circulating a report oh thesimpressions(previous reference: derived from a recent visit to Germany by a trustedCabinet 54(36), Con- and trained observer, who had had the opportunityelusion 3 ,)during his visit of meeting a number of prominentFT R. 5  (34) 3.personalities in that country.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that no reply had yet been received fromGermany or Italy, and he had no indication of whatthe tenor of the reply would be to^ the communication^sent as the result of the recent Conference inLondon with the Prime Ministers of France andBelgium.   He asked that if any of his colleagueshappened to be making speeches within the next week or two and wished to refer to this matter, theywould give the impression that we were hoping foran affirmative answer.   He added that he wasexpecting an approach from Berlin in the nearfuture as to their new Ambassador in London, whichwas perhaps a favourable symptom of their attitude.The Cabinet agreed with the Secretary of Statethat the outcome of the recent Conference in london was highly satisfactory.
THE ANGLO-GERMAN naval agreement.(previous reference:Cabinet 42(35), Con-elusion 11.)12,(3]) 4.3 . The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that on Monday, March 16th, the&apos; Cabinet-had authorised the Admiralty to continue negotia-tions with Germany with a view to bringing thatcountry into the Naval Agreement, on the under-standing that there was no question of signing a.Treaty with them at the present time (Cabinet 20(-36), Conclusion 5).   He now ashed authority to sign a subsidiary Agreement with Germany arisingout of the Treaty negotiations during the Recessif necessity should require it.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, in consultationwith the First Lord of the Admiralty,should be authorised to sign, orarrange for the signature of, a naval Agreement with Germany arisingout of the Naval Treaty if occasionshould arise during the Recess.
4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs had nothing to report on the question of the formerGerman Colonies .    Cabinet Ministers who were members of the TJTouse of Commons would, realise theeffect of his r*ecent statement in Parliament uponthe sub subject.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had received aletter from Lord Rothermere covering a copy of aletter to Sir Robert Home deploring the negative attitude the latter had adopted in his speech inthe House of Commons on the subject.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidthat the subject was to be raised again in debate on the Adjournment on Friday, July 31st, when he proposed to make clear that he could add nothing tohis previous statement .
TT-TE LEAG.TEOP NATIONS.Future of theCovenant.(previous reference:Cabinet 51(36) , Con-clusion ^,)5. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs warned the Cabinet that he would require guidance as to the line he was to take when the Assembly ofthe League of Nations met on September 21st toconsider the future of the Covenant.    The variousPowers had been asked to send in their observationsbefore Aungu^t^^tfe, but it woul^ be quite practicable for him to say that we preferred to state our .casex^erbally at the Assembly.    This line, he thought,might also be acceptable to the Dominions .The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said he had already held a preliminary discussion on thissubject with the &quot;-high Commissioners and Representa-tives of the Dominions in London, which had been satisfactory so far as it had. gone.   Mr Dunning, theCanadian Treasurer, had. indicated that Canada wouldprobably stand for a consultative and. conciliatingbody, but his impression was that the canadian government woul&quot;1 be willing to compromise.   Mr Brucethought that the Australian Government would, stand for a compromise plan.   Australia was becoming evermore interested in Europe, for economic reasons, andMr Bruce had even gone so far as to suggest that theAustralian Government might be willing; to sign a newLocarno pact.    It had to be remem^ere^ , however,that there would be another General Election .inAustralia before long, and the Opposition would, be-opposed, to anything of the kind.    The representativesof the other Dominions had not expressed a clear view,but Mr te Water expected, to be in possession of theviews of his Government in the near future and. wasvery anxious fo^ consultation.
After some further discussion the Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Secretary should circulate-to members of the Cabinet- copies of theForeign Office Memorandum on the reform of the League of Nations(F .P. (36)  5), and that ministers should be invited, to forward, to theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs any observations they might wish to make:(b) That- the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy should, meet on ^uesday, August.25th at 10.30 a.m.and should beprepared to meet also on Wednesday.August 26th, for consideration ofthe above Memorandum:(c) That the Cabinet should, meet ^or thesame purpose on Wednesday, September2nd, at 10.30 ami.(The Prime Minister entered, towards theend of the above discussion, but beforethe Conclusion was reached.)
THE ANGLO-egyptian treaty NEGO-TTAmTONS .(previous reference:Cabinet 54(36), Con-elusion 7.)6.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffaiB&apos;reported that if the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was successfully concluded the Secretary of State forWar was anxious that the Array should evacuate the barracks in the Citadel at Cairo.   He asked thatthis matter might be left  to the Secretary of Statefor v/ar and himself in the event of a conclusion ofthe Treaty.A short discussion also took place as to hoxv thequestion of the Sudan was to be handled during the recess .The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretaryof State for ;7ar should be authorisedto arrange for the withdrawal ofBritish troops from the Citadel in cairo if and when the Anglo-egyptian treaty was concluded:(b) That in the event of difficulties arising during the negotiations inconnection with the Sudan, theSecretary of State for Foreign affairs should consult the Prime Minister andthe Lord Privy Seal.
7. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreporter; that the Spanish Ambassador had drawn his attention to the sale to France from this country of certain passenger aeroplanes and had intimated that his Government was likely to instruct him toraise the question.    It was also possible that that question might be raised in Parliament on July 31st.The technical position was that, as these aircraft-were civilian and not military, the Government hadno control over them.The Cabinet were informed that the aircraft hadbeen sold to France by British Airways and were reported to have been held up by the French authori-ties at Bordeaux.    It was rumoured that they hadbeen, or might be, sold, either by the Frenchpurchaser or possibly by a Portuguese purchaser, tothe Spanish rebels.It was suggested that after their arrival inFrance the French Government became responsible forpermitting or preventing their exportation to Spain.The Cabinet were reminded that at the DisarmamentConference the British representatives had taken theline that it was very difficult to distinguishmilitary an^ commercial aircraft but that they hadbeen driven out of this position by the representa-tives of other countries .The Cabinet agreed.  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,.if approached bythe Spanish Amba.ssador, or if thequestion should be raised, in parliamentary Debate, should make clear that the British Governmenthad no legal power to stop the sale,of commercial aircraft.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the Spanish Ambassador had warned him that he might soon be asking to purchase arms for
the Spanish Government.    If a request should bereceived to purchase arms from private manufacturershe proposed to deal with it in the ordinary, way,that is to say, by reference to the Foard o^ Tradeand the Government Departments concerned.   TheSpanish Government- he pointed out, was a recognisedGovernment, and we could not act  otherwise unless it was decided to recognise the Spanish insurgents.The Cabinet were reminded that if it were aquestion of purchasing new weapons, the defence departments might wish to stop supply, on the groundthat the whole of our production resources were required;    but it was recognised that this wouldtake place under the ordinary procedure.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should follow theordinary procedure in the event ofan application from the SpanishGovernment to purchase.se arms .Possibilities of The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs saidInt ervent ion.that the Spanish Ambassador, speaking for himself,had asked if any nation ;cou3^ intervene to stop thebloodshed in Spain, which, he evidently feared, would otherwise proceed for some time + 0 come.    One factor in the situation was that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs was at present the President o^ theCouncil of the League.    It appeared impossible,however,  for the League to interfere at the presenttime in the affairs of Spain.   Possibly the momentmight come when, either officially or unofficially,the League or this country, in concert with othercountries, might have an opportunity to offer good,offices.    For the moment, however, there was noquestion of this.A short discussion took place on this subject,
from which it was clear that the Cabinet shared the views of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs .
ijitj^ ITALO- 8.    The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsABYSSINIANDISPUTE. reported that in the Pebate on Friday, July 31st,(Previous he expected to be asked as to the British attitudeReference:Cabinet 52 in regard to the recognition 6f Italy&apos;s conquest(36),  Con-elusion 3.) of Abyssinia and loans to Italy.,   \ A short discussion took place on the subject,&quot; maize(jq) z in tlie course of which the Cabinet were remindedof the dangers of delaying too long in the matter -of recognition, or of leaving it entirely to theLeague .The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should make clear -(a) That T-Tis Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad no present intention of recognising the Italianconquest of Abyssinia:(b) (subject  to the agreement ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer,who was absent indisposed)n.        .y.-    -i , That there was no alterationt/atyya. llnvuiLu  in the statement made by the/Sha^e-ellor of the Exchequer *in the Nous e of Commons onMey-1*, 193 5.)
PALESTINE. 9. The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidSituation in. that he proposed to announce the Terms of Referenceto, and composition of, the Royal Commission the(previous reference: same afternoon in the House of Commons.   TJe thenCabinet 54(.35), Con-v read a telegram from the &apos;-Tigh Commissioner whichelusion 9 .)u   23 (V/)^-indicated, inter alia,, that there was a possibility that the announcement of the Royal Commission might-provide an opportunity for ending the presentsituation in Palestine.    mhe Emir Abdullah hadintervened, usefully with the Supreme Committee ofthe Arabs and had advised them to put an end to thesed.it ious movement.    The TJigh Commissioner, however,ha&apos;&quot; some doubts as to whether the Supreme committee could exercise the power.   However, this was thefirst ray of light on the situation.   He himself wasseeing the Arab representatives, now on a visit toLondon, the same afternoon.    Sir Harold. Morris,K.C . ,M.3 .E ., had agreed to become a member of theRoyal - Commission.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that, notwithstanding the somewhatdiscouraging reply sent to Ibn Saud (Cabinet 52(36), Conclusion 5(c)), that monarch was reportedto be doing his best, in conjunction with the other arab rulers, to put an end to -the disturbances.P
T^E IRTSt-tFREE STATE.Proposed Dis-cussions onall outstand-ing Questions(previous reference e:Cabinet 43(36), Con-clusion 8.)10. The Cabinet had before then a Report (CP.-204(36)) by the Irish Situation Committee, who had examined, in the light of subsequent developments,the proposals in CP -124 (3 6)  for settling the outstanding questions between the Irish Free Stateand this country, with the object of framing instruc-tions to the United Kingdom Officials which wouldenable them to put forward proposals as a basis  for settlement, on the understanding that the Irish FreeState remained a Dominion inside the Commonwealth.After dealing fully with all the questions in issue,the Committee made the following recommendations tothe Cabinet:-(l) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs should be author-ised. to inform Mr De Valera thatour representatives will be readyto start discussions early inSeptember:(2) That our representatives shouldbe authorised to discuss a possible basis of a general and. comprehensive settlement on the lines set out inparagraphs 6 to 16 of this Report.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs made a statement to the Cabinet in elaboration ofthe Report of the Commit tee.In the course of the discussion hp mentioned the names of the Officials whom he proposed should, actas the British Repr^s representatives, which were generally approved .After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed.  (a) To approve the recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee as set forth above:(b) That the actual wording of the Preambleor Declaration which Mr De Valerashould be asked to include in the IrishConstitution, viz ., that &quot;The IrishFree State and its citizens acknowledge the King as the Head of and as repre-senting the Commonwealth of which theFree State forms a part, alike inpeace and in war&quot; (CP.-204 (36),Appendix II, Para .11), should, be left
open, in order to give the Secretarof State for Dominion Affairs anopportunity to introduce someamendments of detail.
THE ATLANTIC 11. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by -AIR ROHmE. &quot;the Secretary of State for Air (CP.-808 (35)). statingIrish FreeState Parti-       that during the week-end negotiations had taken placecipationbetween the Departments concerned and the Irish(previous Free State on the subject of the Atlantic Air Route.Reference:Cabinet 2 On the question of the cost involved in, and the(36). Con-clusion 5.)        responsibility for, the construction of the air base,involving both a seaplane base and a land aerodrome,the Irish Free State representatives had stated thatthe Irish Free State would be prepared to financethis entirely, both as to capital and as to annualrecurring maintenance charges .    They stronglycontended, however, that if they incurred this largeliability they ought to make either no contribution,or only a modest &quot;token&quot; contribution (to a maximum of  3,000 a year) to the subsidy cost of the scheme.For a number of reasons an immediate decision was required, and in view of the position disclosed inthe Irish Situation Committee the Secretary of Stateasked the Cabinet for directions in two respects:-&quot;(l) Have vre authority to enter into a bindingagreement with the Irish Free StateGovernment, assuming that the Cabinetapprove the proposals on their merits?(2) Assuming that the Cabinet approves ofour entering into a binding agreement,I would, ask for authority to agree asettlement on the following conditions:-(a) That the Irish Free State accept fullfinancial responsibility for the eon-struction and maintenance of the base:(b) That they agree to pay a net subsidycontribution of not less than  3,000per annum.    mhe Eritish government representatives should, try to getthe financial terms for which theyhave contended, but if we cannot getj better than  3,000 a year,  T suggestthat we should close on that&quot;.
The Secretary of State for Air reported that theIrish Free State Representatives had agreed to finance the whole of the construction of the airbase and had rejected our offer to contribute.They had telephoned acceptance 6^ the whole of thefinancial terms, subject, to the substitution of 12,000 for  15,000 as the maximum subsidy contri-button.    The figures in paragraph (b)(ii) of theAppendix to 0.P.-2O8 (35) would then be altered to read as follows:- B/F    12,000 In respect of meteorology 6,000Reduction from  11,000 to 10,000 in the postal pay-ment under the Common-wealth Air Mail Scheme 1.000       7.000Met cash payment    . . . 5,000.or  6,000 if the IrishFree State do not take part in the Empire AirMail s cheme .The Irish Free State Government were anxious to getahead with the construction of the base, and proposedto ask the Bail for authority on the morrow,Thursday, July 3 0th.    In these circumstances hethought that a statement shoul-&quot;1 be made in theT-?ouse of Commons on either Thursday or Friday.The above arrangement was a very good bargain forthis country .The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the Agreement with theIrish Free State Government and toauthorise the Secretary of Statefor Air to conclude it:(b) That if the announcement by the IrishFree State was to be made in the dail on Thursday, a Private notice question and Answer should be arranged to be given in the -Touse of commons on .    . Thursday, July 30th;    but thatif the announcement in the Dail was delayed until Friday, July 31st, theannouncement in the House of commons should be on the same date.
NATIONAL 12. The Cabinet had before them a Joint MemorandumSOCIALISTAND FASCIST by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forPARTY ORGAN-IS AT IONS IN Foreign Affairs (CP.-205 (35)), proposing, forTHE UNITEDKINGDOM. reasons given in the memorandum  urn, that informal and proposed friendly suggestions should be made to the GermanRequest to german and and Italian Governments, through their Embassies inItalianGovernments London, that they should, take steps to secure theto liquidateclosing down of branches of the National Socialistand Fascist party organisations established in theUnited Kingdom, the presence of which was considered,unusual and. undesirable here.      It was not proposed,that detailed reasons for this request should, becommunicated to the Embassies, but they would, begiven to understand, that, should, it not be acted,upon, we should probably be obliged to require theleading organisers and. party officials to leave thecountry.In the course of a short discussion onthis proposal there was general agreement thatthe present moment, when His Majesty^ Governmentwas trying to promote contacts between the British,Belgian, French, German and Italian Governments,was inopportune for taking the action proposed.The Prime Minister suggested that it wasthe kind of point that might he raised towards the endof successful conversations.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said he was only asking authority to deal with thequestion when the opportune moment arrived,,The Home Secretary developed the case infavour of the proposal and the First Lord of theAdmiralty reported that MaI* 5 took a serious view of- 17 -
the activities of these Nazi and Fascistorganisations.It was suggested that if the question were raised with reference to Nazis and Fasoists,there would certainly he a demand for a corresponding action towards the Communists, and much evidence wasproduced of the activity of the Communist movementin this country, not only among miners and in SouthWales, hut also in opposition to re-armament.The Cabinet were reminded that there wasa distinction between the action proposed by theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs against Nazi and Fascistorganisations which were definitely foreignorganisations in this country and the Communists, who,though supported by Soviet Russia, were largelycomposed of natives.     Nevertheless, it wassuggested that in the public mind the raising ofthe one issue would bring up the other.The Lord President of the Councilsuggested that the Home Office should make a closestudy of the Communist situation.The Home Secretary said that the HomeOffice had already received a great deal ofinformation about the Communists and he was apprehensive of trouble in South Wales within thenext few months stimulated by Communists.The Prime Minister asked the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to bring the question up oh some lateroccasion when the moment was more opportune for taking action.
DEFENCE RE-luiEEMENTS.pogress inIreviousReference:Ifabinet 43(36)Conclusion 7)I13.      The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defenceidsaid he received the approval of the/^S&amp;bin&amp;t to makea short verbal report rather than to circulate a written report in view of the large amount of documents in circulation at the present time.     be referred first to the shortage of building labourrammeF. R &amp;2,^5^/3 as &quot;threatening to hold up the reconditioning progof the Services*     Later he might have to askfor   sanction to obtain a priority for service requirements.     He had arranged to secure a comprehensive review of the Services&apos; buildingrequirements which, after discussion with theDepartments concerned, would be considered with thebuilding trade.       Contrary to anticipation, house-building was not diminishing but increasing and therequirements of the Services coming on top of thiscreated a difficult situation.      He thought it possible that after the conference with the building-industry it might be necessary to adopt some system ofa priority.The Minister of Health stressed theimportance of an inter-departmental consultationbefore consulting the building industry.     He andhis Department would do everything possible toprevent a rise of prices even if it was necessary to slow up house-building.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that labour was the main difficulty.     At theend of June, for example, Messrs. Vickers hadadvertised for 200 fitters and, with some  difficulty,had obtained them.     Soon they would be needing 1,000and would encounter the utmost difficulty.      Thequestion would then arise as to whether the Governmentwould have to abandon the position of not interfering- 19 -
with trade and industry.      That illustrated thelabour position so far as the reconditioningprogramme was concerned^     Coming to the details ofthe Services, he said that the Admiralty programmeoccasioned no special anxiety at the present.Progress with the Air Ministry&apos;s programme had resulted in drawing labour away from other parts ofthe Services * programmes     Deliveries were not upto 100 per cent, on promises;    perhaps they were rather less than four-fifths..      Some of the contractors attributed their difficulties to thefailure of sub-contractors.      Generally, however,the Air Force programme was going on well when thedifficulties of obtaining labour were considered.The only way to speed up the programme appeared tobe to ear-mark certain firms who should do    nothingexcept produce air frames and air engines, and itmight be necessary before long for him to consult theCabinet on this subject.     So far as the Armyprogramme was concerned, the main difficulty bothin regard to tanks and anti-aircraft guns wasincomplete designs.     The completion of the designsfor heavy tanks was still some way off.The Secretary of State for War said he hoped that production would start in the Autumn of1957,The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said there was a similar position as regards anti-aircraft gunsa     For tanks and guns, firms had beeninspected and allotted to the War Office for these orders but they could not get ahead until the designswere completed.     As regards Bren machine guns,production would begin in April, 1937,     On the- 20 -
previous day, Mr. Winston Churchill had suggested thatthe guns might he &quot;bought from Gzecho-Slovakia and hewould look into that.      In the matter of ammunition,the prospects were better and large orders had beenplacedo     His major anxiety was in respect of labour,building, and production in some vital weaponsincluding aircraft^/and guns.The Secretary of State for War addedArmy recruiting and asked that any Ministers whowould be making speeches in the near future shoulddwell on the subject of recruiting.The Prime Minister referring to adeputation that he had received the previous afternoon mentioned Sir Edward Grigg&apos;s suggestionthat much harm had been done by recent war books,referring probably to Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s autobiographyand his attacks on Generals.In reply to a question, the Secretary ofState for War said that if we were confronted with war within the next 12 months, it would be necessaryto order many more light tanks instead of mediumtanks, of which the design was not ready.The Secretary of State for Air made astatement in regard to the development of the AirForce programme.Considerable discussion took place as to thepossibilities of extending the Service programmes soas to give employment in the worst areas ofunemployment, particularly South Wales and WesternScotland.The Minister for Co-Ordihation of defence was asked by the Secretary of State for Scotland to- 21 -
look into the possibilities of placing further orders and developing manufacture of war material in Western Scotland.The Minister for Go-Ordination ofDefence undertook to do his best, but gave a warning that the information at present at his disposal did not encourage the idea that therewas any surplus labour in and about Glasgow, wherevery large shipbuilding orders had been placed.
