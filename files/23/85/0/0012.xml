THE LATESECRETARYOP STATE FORSCOTLAND.(previous as reference:Cabinet 58(36), Con-clasion 13 .)1.   Tne Prime Minister read to tne Cabinet aletter from Mrs. Collins, trie mother of the lateSecretary of State for Scotland, thanking the cabinet for tneir sympathy and expressing her pride at tnemany high tributes which had been paid to her son&apos;work.
9 92.. The main object of the Meeting of the Cabinet was todiscuss tne following documents relating to a request by the Argentine Delegation, as a condition of the new agreement now under discussion, for a guarantee tnatimports of mutton and lamb from Argentina into tneUnited Kingdom would not be furtner reduced during tnecurrency of tne Agreement, viz., during tne years 1937,193b and 1939:-A Memorandum by the Minister of Agricultureand Pisneries (CP.-280 (35) J  circulating a Statement prepared by the agricultural departments, in consultation with theDominions Office, wnich in its final paragraph said that tne question for decision was whether tne proposed guarantee should be given to Argentina in tne knowledge(i) that it will lead to serious opposition from the agricultural industry and from the Govern-ment&apos;s supporters in parliament and will gravely embarrass usin negotiations with Australiaand New Zealand on future arrange-ments for regulating mutton and lamb supplies:(ii) that the supply situation in 1939will probably be such tnat theGovernment will be faced withthe alternatives of imposing a cut on Dominion imports wnichmight well be equal to or greaterthan the additional cut now pro-vided for on foreign imports, orof allowing a supply and pricesituation to develop, for wnichthe only other remedy availablewill be an Exchequer subsidy to united Kingdom sheep producers:A Memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (CP.-281 (35)) stating thatArgentina was entitled to some guarantee,and suggesting that a 10$ further cut onall foreign sullies (following tne pastcut of 55%) would provide good ground onwhich to discuss Dominion exports, ifnecessary&quot;,    that the concession to Argentinawas small;    and that it was necessary rf anAgreement was to be concluded whose advan-tages to our investors and exporters(especially in South Wales and Lancashire)outweighed all the concessions we had given.
The Prime Minister emphasised the great importanceof the question under discussion, and hoped that themembers of the Cabinet principally  concerned wouldstate fully their respective points of view.The President of the Board of Trade said that itwas necessaryto bring before the Cabinet a questionwhich, as indicated in tne concluding paragraph ofC.P.-281 (36), raised issues of the greatest possibleimportance.   Negotiations had been taxing place withthe Argentine for a new Trade Agreement for some months and mucn progress had been made.    In 1933 an agreement had been made with tne Argentine which in almost every respect was more satisfactory to us tnan could havebeen anticipated when the negotiations for tnat Agree-ment had opened.   The Argentine Government had faith-fully  carried out the Agreement, with very great benefit to British trade and industry,   tfe had hopedunder the Agreement substantially to increase our .cotton exports to the Argentine.   This hope had beenfully realised.   The increase in our exports of woollengoods had also exceeded expectations .   The coal exportshad not been so satisfactory, but this was due not toany failure of the Agreement, but to extraneous cir cam-stances, such as tne&apos; substitution of oil for coal.Our exports to the Argentine of iron, steel and otnermetal goods and of electrical machinery had also greatlyincreased.   The position under tne 1933 Agreement aigntbe summarised as follows:-   Reductions of Argentineduties were secured for 30% of our exports to thatcountry, tne free entry was conventionalised for 28%,and existing duties were stabilised for about 13$.The value of the exports of United Kingdom goods totne Argentine, wnich fell from  14,8 millions in 1931to  10.7 millions in 1932, had risen to  15.3 millions-3-
 in 1935. Our frozen debts in the Argentine, which amounted to many millions of pounds in 1932, had been partly paid off in cash, and the balance of £131/2 millions had been funded in sterling bonds. Subject to an agreed reduction of a sum not exceeding £3 millions annually to meet the service of the Argentine Public Debt in third countries, the sterling arising from our purchases of Argentine products had been made available for United Kingdom requirements, and so far as we were aware no new frozen debts, either trade or financial, had accumulated.

Encouraged by these considerations, negotiations for a new agreement had been opened, the representatives of the Argentine being Dr le Breton and Dr. Malbran. The various provisions of the 1933 Agreement were exhaustively examined, and in practically every case we had managed to obtain improved terms. This was remarkable when it was remembered that we had secured the agreement of the Argentine to a levy 3/4d. a 1b. on their chilled beef exports to this country (with corresponding duties on the other beef and beef products) as against their present right of free entry. This figurer of 3/4d. had only been secured after long and troublesome discussions and many references to Buenos Aires. Ultimately, however, the Argentine negotiators had accepted the ?d. as unalterable. In the case of minor points, the issues had been dealt with by Officials, but he himself and intervened in all the more important questions, and he was satisfied that in the result a very hard bargain indeed had been driven with Argentina. Throughout the negotiations there had been present in his mind a matter of first-class importance. For some considerable time the United States had been showing an increased interest

   
 in the Argentine. The Secretary of State, Mr Cordell Hull, had paid a visit to the Pan-American Congress and on that occasion had made promises which, on his return to the United States, he found himself unable to perform. Mr Cordell Hull was going to attend another Pan-American Congress at Buenos Aires after the Presidential Election, probably early in December next, and on this occasion it was probable that he would make an offer to Argentine which was likely to take the form of facilitating her meat exports to the United States, which was faced with a prospective Meat shortage. At present the United States imposed a duty of 3d.a 1b. on imported meat, but this in itself was no serious handicap to the Argentine exporters. The real protection which the American cattle raiser had hitherto enjoyed came from the restrictions on the entry of Argentine meat based on sanitary precautions to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease. Mr Cordell Hull was expected to maintain that there was now little danger on this score and that the embargo could safely be removed. It was possible that he might succeed in arranging a satisfactory Trade Agreement with the Argentine on this basis, and if he could persuade the Argentine that the United States was as good a market for her beef as the United Kingdom, our export trade must inevitably suffer.

The Cabinet should realize that, whereas the United Kingdom used to be the sole market for Argentine meat, we now had a competitor in the United States, which might be able to make offers as good as, if not better than, we could. The matter was therefore urgent, as it was very important that, if possible, we should conclude the new Agreement with the Argentine before 
 Mr Cordell Hull&apos;s mission to South America in December.

There was no reason to suppose that the Argentine negotiators would go back on the terms to which they had already agreed, but they themselves no doubt had in mind the possibility of negotiations with the United States, and from every point of view it was desirable that our Agreement with them should be concluded before the American negotiations opened.

Agreement had been reached on all outstanding matters with the one exception of the question of mutton and lamb exports, and it was this issue that the minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and himself had agreed to submit to the Cabinet for decision. Full details of the different points of view were contained in the Memoranda which had been circulated. But he wished to draw attention to the following considerations. The new Agreement contemplated a levy of 3/4d. a 1b. on chilled beef, and a further possible out of 5% over and above the reductions which had resulted from the existing Agreement. We had already out Argentine mutton and lamb exports by 35% or 484,000 ?wts. per annum out of a total cut in foreign mutton and lamb imports of 655,000 owts?. The concession which he now asked the Cabinet to approve was a small one, but in his view it was necessary to make it if the Agreement was to be concluded and if our manufacturers, investors and importers were to benefit by the concessions which had been obtained for them. He knew of no other alternative which the Argentine would be likely to accept, and it was necessary for a decision to be reached with the least possible delay.

 
326The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries tnoughtthat the President of the Board of Trade had made avery fair statement.    It was necessary for him tosubmit to tne Cabinet tne somewhat different pointof view of tne Agricultural Departments.There could be no difference of opinion as to the beneficial character of the new Agreement from thepoint of view of British trade and industry .   Thedanger of the United States becoming a competitor forArgentine meat did not appear to those concerned witn agriculture as great as itappeared to the British exporter .to tne Argentine.In view, however, of tne lavish promises whicn bothDemocrats and Republicans were making in the election to tne American farming interests, it might be doubted whether Mr Cordell Hull would be able to carry out anypromises he might make to facilitate Argentine meatexports to tne United states .   Foot-and-mouth diseasewas rampant in Argentina,  and while wewere able to protect ourselves by  elaborate veterinaryhe believed,technique,     the United States,/could not do so to anything like the same extent .Tne Cabinet should, however, bear in mind the enormous importance to tne Argentine of tne UnitedKingdom market, and in this  connection the Ministerquoted the following comparative figures:-1. World Trade *Average of 1954.1925/50 .World&apos;s wheat exports       U.K. took 30$ U.K. took 41$&quot;       maize n &quot;        &quot;   20$ &quot;        &quot;    35%&quot;       beef &quot; &quot;        &quot;    59$ &quot;       &quot;    74$&quot; mutton &amp; lamb &quot; &quot;        &quot;nearly all       &quot;        &quot;nearly all&quot;   bacon &amp; ham &quot; &quot; &quot;       &quot; &quot;       &quot;      &quot;       &quot;&quot;       butter       &quot; &quot;        &quot;    66$ &quot;        &quot;    83$2 . Argentine Trade in 1954 .2/5ths of world wheat exports, of which over l/3rd came to U.K.2/3rds    &quot;      &quot;     maize         &quot;         &quot;        &quot;     half &quot;      &quot;    &quot;15$   ..     &quot;      &quot; mutton &amp; iamb &quot;      &quot;        &quot;       all &quot;      &quot;    &quot;Over t    &quot;      &quot;     beef              &quot;      &quot;       &quot; nearly all &quot;     &quot;    &quot;
Of the total imports into the United Kingdom of mutton and lamb from overseas, 90% came from the Empire andlC/o from foreign countries.    While, no doubt,  it was true that the conceseion which the President of theBoard of Trade favoured was a small one so far as theArgentine was concerned,  it was a large and important one so far as the United Kingdom and the Dominions were concerned.agreement had been reached with Argentina in regardto beef, pork and other similar commodities.    The tradein mutton and lamb, while of great importance to theUnited Kingdom and the Empire, was of relatively littleconsequence to Argentina.    In value the total empire trade was  35 millions,  and the Argentine  2 millions.Movements up and down of the price of other primaryco iiflodities produced in the Argentine would, of course,have far greater consequences than anything which could result from a cut of 10l 1 or over in mutton and lamb.For example, the maize exports from the Argentine wouldbe worth  3 millions more to the Argentine this year which was secured to them by reason of free entry, andwe had had to give up all idea of a levy on importedmaize with which to subsidise British oats.    It wasvery important further to remember that the home pro-duct ion of mutton and lamb was not being expanded to new and unprecedented levels.    What we were aiming atwas a return to the levels of production reached in1908-10 and again in 1932.    If this Agreement was madeon the terms suggested by the President of the Board ofTrade it would have to be defended in the House ofCommons and the Government would have to say either that they did not believe that home production wouldexpand or that,  if it tried to do so, it would be auto-matically checked by the fall in prices due to over-supply.      It would be very difficult indeed to-8- -
argue tne case successfully.   He nad made everyeffort to meet tne views of tne President of tneon other commodities.Board of Trade in agreeing to free entry /  Wo-one could pretend that tne 20% tariff on chilled beefwas excessive .   He hoped that the Cabinet would accept tne view of tne Agricultural Departments thatwe should retain complete freedom of action to manesuch cuts in Argentine imports of mutton and lamb in1933 and 1939 as might be found necessary to protect the none and Dominion producers.Tne Under-Secretary of State for Scotland saidtnat he wished to emphasise two points;    one ofspecial interest to Scotland, and the otner of more general application.    The Argentine Agreement was certain to be unpopular in Scotland because it provided for free entry of maize, Whereas if a duty on imported maize could have been imposed tais wouldhave enabled a subsidy to nave been paid   on home produced oats .    This feature of tne Agreement wouldbe severely criticised in Scotland, and the  criticismwould be intensified if we guaranteed tnat imports of mutton and lamb from the Argentine snould in no circumstances be cut beyond the 10% in 1938 and 1939.Secondly, if mutton and lamb prices fell, therewould be a very  strong, demand for a deficiencypayment.    It would be very much more difficult tofind ways and means of satisfying this demand if our hands were tied in the manner desired by thePresident of the Board of Trade.
The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs agreed with the President of the Board of Trade on the great value of the old Anglo-Argentine Agreement, and on theimportance of reaching a new agreement.      Indeed, he wouldhave teen ready to press theDominions to make further concessions to help the ArgentineAgreement If he thought that there was the least chance ofan approach to the Dominions being successful.The particular issue under discussion raised,vis avis, the Dominions very great difficulties indeed.      TheArgentine&apos;s exports of mutton and lamb were not of much importance when compared with her total exports, but inthe case of New Zealand, exports of mutton and lamb were of very great importance indeed and were of considerable importance to Australia.      For some time there had beenin operation a very satisfactory scheme uncler which theDominions had voluntarily regulated their supplies of mutton and lamb to the United Kingdom market.     We hadno cause to complain of the way in which the Dominionscarried out their undertakings under this scheme.    Therewas reason to suppose that we should shortly receiverequests from Australia and New Zealand for some expan-sion of their mutton and lamb exports to the UnitedKi ngdom.The Prime Minister inquired whether there had, infact, been expansion of these exports since Ottawa.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs saidthat this was true as regards Australia, but that NewZealand&apos;s exports had not expanded.    It was probable thatthe two Dominions would ask for some expansion over and above the 1936 figure.    This proposal we were resisting.He (the Secretary of State) had informed Dr. Earle Pageand he would inform Mr. Nash that in view of the
expansion of the home production of mutton and lamb theprospects of the home market being able to absorbincreased imports from Australia and New Zealand were very small indeed, and that the probability was thatthere would-have to be some cut on the present figure.It was certain that any such cut would be strongly resisted by the Dominions.    As would be seen from the concluding paragraph on page 4 of CP. 280 (36), incertain events it was envisaged that a larger cut mighthave to he imposed on Australian and New Zealand exportsof mutton and lamb than on those from the Argentine.He (the Secretary of State) understood that forthe next three years the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries wished to maintain the total supplies of mutton and lamb in the United Kingdom market at about their present level of 11,600,000 cwts.      It was estimated that by 1939 United Kingdom production wouldhave expanded by 500,000 to 700,000 cwts.      In orderto make room for this expansion it would only he opento us under the President of the Board of Tradefsproposal to cut imports from the Argentine by amaximum of 10 per cent, in 1938 and 1939.      This wouldmean cuts on imports from Australia and New Zealandof the order of 8 per cent,  or 11^ per cent., accordingto the United Kingdom expansion figure,,    If the cut .-was 11-g- per cent, it would be more severe than the 10per cent, cut on the Argentine.      It was out of thequestion to think that Australia and New Zealand wouldvoluntarily agree to any such arrangement, and weshould be driven to impose this cut upon them in the face of very bitter opposition which would he re-inforced by acute criticism of the home agricultural interests.
After prolonged and difficult negotiations we were very near agreement with the Dominions on the question of beef, but if this most contentious issue regardingmutton and lamb was now to be raised, we should not only make no progress with the Dominions whatever with regardto it, but there was a very ecrsious clanger that theywould go baclc on what they had already agreed to inregard to beef.The Chancellor of the Exchequer invited the attentionof the Cabinet to the table on page 3 of CP. 280 (36).It would be seen from the first and last columns of thattable bow the position in regard to mutton and lambsupplies had altered since the Ottawa year.      The total supplies had fallen from 12,032,000 cwts. to 11,670,000cwts.      The United Kingdom production had risen slightlyfrom 4,700,000 cwts. to 4,750,000 cwts.     Australia had increased her exports from l,489y000 cwts. to 1,750,000cwts.     New Zealand had slightly reduced hers from,908,000 cwts.  to 3,900*000 cwts., while foreigncountries hed reduced their exports from 1,935,000 to1,270,000, a very striking reduction of 665*000 cwts.There could be no question that all concerned had bene-fitted by the reduction in the supplies, and the figuresclearly showed that if any country was to blame for trying to increase production beyond the consumptive capacity ofthe market, that country was Australia, while the Argentinecould be commended for its very big reduction.    It shouldalso be remembered that that reduction had alreadyamounted to 35 per cent,  of the Ottawa year figure.The question was what was likely to happen in thenext few years?      It was estimated that home production would expand from about 500,000 to 700.000 cwts.    Therewas no question of any interference with such expansion.It was the duty of the Government to enable home
producers to expend on the lines contemplated by-restricting imports from overseas, especially havingregard to the fact that our expansion did not representa new high level, but merely the recovery of levelswhich we had enjoyed in the past.The question was, at whose expense should theUnited Kingdom expansion be obtained?The President of the Board of Trade suggested thatthe Argentine contribution should be limited to a 10per cent. cut.      On the other hand, the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had made it clear that ifhome expansion reached the higher figure of 700,000cwts. end supplies were to be maintained at the present level and there was no increase in the home consumption,it would be necessary to impose a higher cut on imports from Australia and New Zealand than on those from the Argentine, and that this would he most violent-ly resisted by the Dominions concerned.It seemed an unnecessarily strong assumption thathome consumption of mutton end lamb would remain at Itspresent figure.    He (the Chancellor) would have thoughtthat the home market during the next few years wascapable of absorbing a substantial increase of thesupplies without prices being prejudicially affected.If home consumption could absorb, say half the estimatedexpansion in home production,  the cut that would haveto be made on imports from the Dominions would be ofthe order of 3 or 5-g- per cent.    This could not beregarded as an extravagant cut.He would regard as disastrous a failure to makea new agreement with the Argentine, having regardboth to our large investments in that country and tothe value of our important export trade to Argentina.It was clear that if our prosperity was to continue,
we must look more and more to the expansion of our export trade, and it was very difficult to see how wecould increase our exports to countries, like theArgentine, if we cut their exports to us.At the same time he felt that the last paragraphof the President of the Board of Trade&apos;s Memorandum(CP. 282 (36)) somewhat overstated the position.     He(the Chancellor of the Exchequer) could not agree that because we found it impossible to reach agreement on one item with a particular foreign country that our trade agreement policy must be abandoned.In his opinion the case of the President of theBoard of Trade was, on pure merits, overwhelming, butthere was a political aspect which gave him muchanxiety.      Critics would say, no doubt very unfairly,that the Government were sacrificing British and Domin-ion agricultural interests to the interests of investorsand financiers.     At the same time the Government wouldhave to answer the question on whom the cuts would haveto fall, and the answer must be on the Dominions, andthis would raise a political storm.He hoped, therefore, that it might be found possibleto reach some agreement on this question with theArgentine which avoided raising this political difficulty.A possible suggestion was that the Argentine should be told that they would not be asked to submit to largercuts than the 10 per cent, in 1928 and 1929 unless cutsunspecified in amount were also imposed on imports of mutton and lamb from Australia and New Zealand.      he understood th; t the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs would not regard a suggestion of this kind asunreasonable.     It was true, of course, that this proposal was very similar       character to our undertaking regard-ing chilled beef which we had been unable to carry out,
and it might well turn out that the Argentine would decline to entertain it.      His hope was that thePresident of the Board of Trade would he able to find some way of escaping from the present dilemma whichwould at the same time secure an agreement with theArgentine without raising the serious political difficulties which had been mentioned.    In view of thefact that her exports of mutton and lamb did not constitute a very important item in the Argentine&apos;total exports, it might well be worth while to seekfor some solution of the difficulty.The Lord Privy Seal said thrt no-one could beinsensible to the strength of the case which had been presented by the President of the Board of Trade.What weighed with him was the great difficulty ofbeing sure that any assumptions made now would prove to be correct in two or three years&apos; time.      Forexample, at the time of the Ottawa Conference those interested in agriculture would have said that in theimmediate future the position of beef was tolerablysecure, while that of mutton and lamb was highly dangerous.      In point of fact the exact reverse had proved to be the case.      He had come to the same con-clusion as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and thoughtthat some compromise should be sought.      Would it bepossible to have an agreement with the Argentine inregard to the 10 per cent, cut on the lines proposedby the President of the Board of Trade, on the under-standing that if our present assumptions proved in-correct and the market became flooded with supplieswith detrimental consequences to prices, we should have,in default of further quantitative restriction, to fallback on some form of levy subsidy?    He did not thinkthat it was politically possible for the Government toleave themselves defenceless in this matter so far as1938 and 1939 were concerned.-15-
The First Commissioner of Works said that as a resultof his experience of the negotiations with the argentine and trie Dominions ne felt hound to agree with the Presidentof the Board of Trade that the Argentine was fully justifiedin asking for a guarantee.      It should he remembered that every time we had made an agreement with Australia andNew Zealand about the amount of the supplies of beef to besent to the United Kingdom within a definite period, tnosesupplies had invariably been exceeded.      The main reason whyAustralia had not expanded her exports of mutton and lambto a greater extent than she had in fact done, was the adverse climatic conditions of the last few years, but we might have to face a very lurge increase indeed of suppliesof mutton and lamb from Australia and then we should be inexactly the same position as we had been in the case of beef.      He thought that the tine had come when we shouldpoint out to the Dominions that our population was stationaryand was likely in future to oecline, that we could not possibly afford to lose our export market to the Argentine,and that it would be essential in order to protect the home producer and the home market that any cut over a certainfigure imposed on imports from foreign countries shouldbe extended to imports from the Dominions.Australia, of course, maintained that she was a much better customer than trie Argentine.      She pointed out thatin 1935 she took nearly 30 millions of United Kingdom goodsas against about  15 millions taken by the Argentine, while our imports from the Argentine were very nearly the same in value as those from Australia.      This argument would have tobe faced and met.The Secretary of State for Air was satisfied that on merits the President of the Board of Trade had made a very good bargain indeed, but the political difficulty remained.
He fully accented tne president&apos;s view that it was impossibleto persuade the Argentine negotiators to accept a greatercut, and it would he very disagreeable if we had to imposecuts ourselves in face of bitter Dominion opposition.      at ottawa the conception had been that a producers&apos; pool shouldbe set up which would so regulate supplies in the market asto give producers satisfactory prices.      He thought thatour policy should be to get away from quantitative regulationin favour of import duty arrangements which would indifficult times provide ways and means by which a subsidycould be paid to our home producers,     Would it not bepossible to say to the Argentine that we would agree to the10 per cent, cut, but that they must recognise thot it would pay nobody to flood the market?     We must, therefore, warnthem that if prices fall to an unreasonable level it willbe necessary to impose a duty on imports so as to providethe necessary funds with which to pay a subsidy to the home producer.      It might then very well happen that the foreign and Dominion interests concerned would get together and endeavour to agree on a scheme for regulating supplies tothe United Kingdom market.It was pointed out, however, that at present our policy was based on free entry for Dominion supplies, thatthe foreign supplies only constituted a small fraction ofthe total supplies from overseas, and that accordingly the produce of a levy subsidy on foreign supplies alone would,even if the Argentine would accept such an arrangement whichthey would not, provide no real solution of the difficulty.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thathe did not dissent from what had been said by the first commissioner of Works relative to the tendency in the pastof the Dominions to break their bargains.     This no doubt was a very relevant consideration.     At the same time he
hoped that any discussion of the matter would not hecoloured   by the idea that the Dominions were unlikely toplay the game in future.      It must be remembered that atthe time to which Lord Stanhope had referred, the arrange-ments were on a very tentative and experimental basis.This had now been corrected in the light of experience,/effective machinery had^/been set up in Australia, andthere was every reason to believe that in future theAustralian authorities would scrupulously observe anybargains they made, and that we could count on them carryingout any agreement they entered into.     He agreed inprinciple with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s suggestion,but his difficulty was that the Dominions would only comeinto an agreement of the kind contemplated after months ofexhaustive discussion and negotiation.      It was quite outof the question to suppose tnat an agreement could bereached with them within the short space of the week whichwas available.     Would it not be possible to persuade theArgentine to postpone wh^t was to happen in 1938 and 1939so as to give time to go into the whole question and endeavour to reach agreement with the Dominions?The president of the Board of Education wondered,whether it would not be possible to get a compromisecovering the first and second years of the new agreement.The great political difficulty was that the home agricultural interests had always been told that the Government could not help them in regard to beef because their hands were tiedby the 1933 Agreement.      It would be deplorable if it now had to be said that we could not help in regard to mutton and lamb because oar hands were tied by the new agreement.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that theArgentine negotiators had insisted that there should bano further cut during the whole of the three ye^rs period.
They had been told in reply that the only guarantee wecould give in regard to quantities in the second and thirdyears would be a guarantee that tney would not be cut bymore than a percentage, which would be considerable.Greatly to his surprise tne Argentine negotiators had thenoffered tne guarantee that Argentine exports of mutton andlanb should not be reduced by more than another 5 per cent,of the Ottawa year quantities.     He (the president) had stated as his last word that the most he would consider wasa guarantee of not more than a 10 per cent, cut in presentquantit ies.He doubted whether any of the suggestions which hadbeen made in the course of tne discussion would meet thecase, and he should very much like to know what in fact- the Dominions would be prepared to agree to.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said thatit would be very difficult indeed to persuade the dominions to agree to any cut, but they would never in any circum-stances agree to a cut larger than that imposed on theforeigner..     In accordance with the general principleAustralia and New Zealand would have to be treated alike.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries observedthat it would be pointed out that our hands are now free,both as regards the Dominions and foreign countries,/and tne Government would be asked why they had failed totake effective measures to protect the home producer.The President of the Board of Trade observed that ifhe had to take the line that the Dominions could not be subjected to as drastic a cut as the Argentine, he could see no possibility whatever of concluding an agreement withthe Argentine.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs said that hecould confirm what the President of the Board of Trade had said regarding the proposed Pan American Congress in
Buenos Aires in December next. If,by the time Mr. Gordellhull reacned Buenos Aires we had not concluded an agreementwitn the Argentine, it might be anticipated that theattitude of Mr. Cordell Hull towards any Anglo-ArgentineAgreement would not be at all helpful.      The time factorwas, therefore, of great importance.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs explainedthat he had not meant to suggest that the whole Anglo-Argentine Agreement should be postponed.     Would it not bepossible to sign an agreement which included a mutton and lamb provision that there should be no cut in the first year,but which contained no reference to what was to happen inthe second and third year?The President of the Board of Tra6.e saw no likelihood of such an arrangement being acceptable to the Argentine.The Prime Minister thought that it would be disastrousif the new Anglo-Argentine Agreement was not made.      Lvery-thing pointed to our becoming more and more dependant onour export trade for continued prosperity at home.      Therewas great danger that we might find, when the inevitableslump returned, that we had &quot;been squeezed out of valuableforeign markets.      So far as he was concerned, he would muchrather face the possibility of having to pay a subsidy in three years time to the home producer of mutton and lambthan to involve districts like Lancashire and South wales in the loss of valuable trade with the Argentine.      He had much sympathy with the view of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, but he felt that the Dominions would always be in their present difficulties until their populations hadmaterially increased.      The   Dominions either could not, or would not, recognise our trade difficulties.      It was noexaggeration to say that the Trade Agreements, which thePresident of the Board of Trade had made, had done much to
save Durham and Scotland.     It mutt he home in mind thatthere would he     very widespread disappointment andapprehension, particularly among the very large number of people whose money was invested in the Argentine or whowere cependant on our export trade, if we had to throw overa most advantageous commercial bargain in order to satisfyagricultural claims and apprehensions.The Home Secretary enquired whether the president ofthe Board of Trade thought that it was impossible to get a modified arrangement for two years, and something lessrigid in the third year.The President of the Board of Trade thought that itwas difficult to say, but from his experience of Dr. leBreton he thought that the latter had said his last word.In reply to an enquiry as to the possibility of persuading the Dominions to agree to the imposition of asmall import duty on their mutton and lamb exports,  it waspointed out that this would in fact mean ruin to the NewthatZealand and Australian producers, and/bhey would not look at it for a moment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was apprehensive at the lack of flexibility in the arrangements proposed by the President of the Board of Trade in regardto the guarantee.      He would like our hands to be freer,particularly in the third year.The Lord Privy Seal enquired whether it would bepossible to give the Argentine the guarantee as suggestedby the President of the Board of Trade,;    the guarantee to operate so long as prices did not for a certain period fall below a certain level.      If, however, this condition wasnot fulfilled, there should be consultation between theparties and no further cut should be made in theabsence of agreementj    in default, however, of any agreement
341our hands to he free to impose a levy subsidy, and itwould then have to be considered whether the dominions should be brought into tne levy or not.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs said itwas very doubtful indeed whether the Dominions would everagree to such a proposal, hut in any case it would beimpossible for them to agree to it within a few days.The Chancellor of the Exchequer did not think that itwould be necessary to obtain        Dominion agreement at thepresent stage.      Only the first part of the Lord privy seal&apos;s proposal would actually be incorporated in the angle-Argentine Agreement.     His great objection to thepresident of the Board of Trade&apos;s proposal was that byreason of itb rigidity it united in opposition the homeand the Dominion producer.The President of the Board of education -pointed out thatthe Lord Privy Seal&apos;s suggestion meant re-opening the wholequestion of a levy subsidy.The Prime Minister thought that the opinion of theCabinet was strongly in favour of the new agreement on merits and on general grounds, but it was open to definitepolitical disadvantagesj if these disadvantages couldbe removed by modifying the mutton and lamb provision on lines such as the Lord Privy Seal had suggested, the cabinet would cordially welcome such a solution.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries observedthat the difficulty of the Lord Privy Seal?o proposal wasthat it involved depriving the Argentine in certain events of the free entry which they had been promised.      This would undoubtedly give rise to very great difficulties.The Lord Privy Seal observed that at the outset of thediscussion the President of the Board of Trade had indicated the very large number of important concessions to which the
Argentine had agreed.    It seemed clear,  therefore,that the Argentine must attach immense importanceto getting the new agreement, and he should have thought that they would not create insuperable difficulties over this question of the third year if by doing so meant that the whole agreement would be lost.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence askedwhether if the mutton and lamb clause was in factlimited to two years this would not mean that theagreement itself would be for two years,It was pointed out that in any case an agree-ment for three years was on the short side, andthat there would be very serious objection to anagreement for a shorter period.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he had hoped that the guarantee would only extend for the first year.    If some arrange-ment had to be made to cover the second and thirdyears, he hoped that it would be in a form which would not commit us to any particular actionvis &amp; vis the Dominions.      In any case he wouldlike to reserve his position in regard to thematter.-23-
The Cabinet agreed :(l) Thst the proposed new Anglo-ArgentineAgreement wss on general grounds avery desirable agreement, and that itshould be approved subject to furtherconsideration of the question of theproposed guarantee that Argentineexports of mutton and lamb should notbe reduced by more than another 10 per   .c.ent.  of the Ottawa Standard Yearquantities.(2) That this question should be examinedgenerally in the light of the discussion,and in particular of the suggestions madeby the Lord Privy Seal at the Meeting,by :The L rd Privy seal the Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsThe President of the 3oard of .TradeandThe Minister of Agriculture and Fisherieswith a view to agreement being reached as tothe line to be taken in the matter with theArgentine negotiators.(3) To take note of the reservation of theSecretary of State for Dominion affairs mentioned above.
PRODUCTION OPAERO-ENGINES.Policy of HisMajesty&apos;sGovernmentsWhite Paper.(previous reference:Cabinet 39(36), Con-clusion 14),3.    The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-287 (36)) covering the draft of a White Paper on the Policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in relation to the Productionof Aero-Engines.    The preparation of this White paper had arisen out of the withdrawal of Lord Nuffieldfrom any work in connection with the scheme for a&quot;shadow&quot; aero-engine industry.The Cabinet were informed by the Secretaryof State for Air that the Minister for Co-ordinationof Defence was satisfied that the White Paper provided a full answer to Lord Nuffield1s contentions.    Whilecompletely traversing those contentions, it had been so drawn up as to stress the larger issues of policy involved.    It was proposed to incorporate certain amendments, the most important being a letter addressed by Lord Austin to the Secretary of State for Airre-affirming on behalf of the firms in the &quot;shadow&quot;scheme their complete agreement with and   confidence in the policy of the Government.The Cabinet were also informed that LordNuffield, to whom the draft White Paper had been shown by the Minister for Co-Ordination of Defence,had agreed to a statement being made in both houses of Parliament on Thursday next to the effect thathe regarded the White Paper as a fair statement ofthe Government&apos;s case and that he did not proposeto make any reply to it.A draft of the proposed Statement inParliament (the text of which had been seen and accepted by Lord Nuffield) was read to and approvedby the Cabinet.    A copy is attached to these conclusions (see Appendix I).
After some discussion the Cabinet agreed -(l)   That on Thursday, October 29th, the statement(appendix I) should be made in the House ofLords by the Secretary of State for Air, and simultaneously in the House of Commons a replyin the same terms should be made to Mr. Attlee&apos;private Notice Question.(2)   To approve the draft White Paper (CP. 237 (36)),subject to any amendments and additions thatthe Secretary of State for Air and the Ministerfor Co-Ordina.tion of Defence may think: necessary or desirable.    Por the final text of the v/hitePaper see Appendix II.(3)    That copies of the White Paper should be in the vote Office on the evening of Wednesday,October 28th 1936, so that they might be inthe hands of Members of Parliament on the morning of Thursday, October 29th.(4)    That as the White Paper would appear in the morning Papers on Thursday,  October 29th,arrangements should be made for the Press tobe informed unofficially from 10, downing street, on Wednesday, October 28th, to theeffect that all difficulties had been overcomeand that no debate on the subject need thereforebe anticipated.    The Press should not of course be informed in advance of the contents of theParliamentary Statement, the publication ofwhich could not be ee.rlier than in the eveningPapers on October 29th, after it had been madein both Houses.(5)    To take note that the Prime Minister had arranged to see Lord Nuffield at 3 p.m.  onWednesday, October 28th.)
aircraft production.I Enquiriesregardingpurchase of aircraft inthe United Statesof America.4. The Cabinet were informed by the Secretaryof State for Air that at their meeting on October1st (D.F.R.25th Minutes,  page 12), the Sub-Committeeon Defence Policy and Requirements had authorised him -&quot;To prosecur^ enquiries as to whethercertain aircraft, complete withequipment, could be purchased inAmerica, but that - in view of thepolitical and economic considerations&apos; j.:.r. olvel - he should not placedefinite orders for such aircraftwithout further reference to theCommittee.&quot;It was believed that a type of machineused by the United States Air Force was suitablefor our own use and the British Air Attache in washington had been instructed to enquire whetherthe United States authorities had any objectionto our purchase of some of this type.      The&quot;UnitedStates authorities were considering the matter.In the meantime, rumours had appeared in the press to the effect that the British Air Ministry had ordered 1,000 American machines.    Mr. Simmonds, M.P.had informed the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of ,State for Air that he was putting down a private notice Question for answer.on Thursday, October 29th.,to the following effect :&quot;To ask whether the Air Ministry are considering the purchase of aircraft from aircraft manufacturers outsideGreat Britain, and whether they have in fact placed any orders, except for single experimental airdraft, with anysuch manufacturers.&quot;It was proposed to reply to the following effect  :
&quot;The Government have from time to timemade enruiry as to possible overseassources of supply of munitions ofvarious kinds, so that the necessary information should be at their dis-posal if purchases from such sourcesappeared at any time to be necessary or desirable.      The answer to thesecond part of the question is in the negative.&quot;The Cabinet approved an answer tothis effect being given to Mr.Simmonds&apos;  question.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.28th October, 1936.
APPENDIX I.Statement to be made in both Houses ofParliament on Thursday, 29th October,1936.34I am obliged to the Noble Lord for theopportunity of making a short further statement onthis matter.    The White Paper which has been issued sets out very fully the facts both as to the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and also as to the discussions which have taken place with my Noble Priend, LordNuffield,  and his representatives.    It will be seen from the White Paper that His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided to adopt a policy with which my Noble Eriendis unfortunately not in agreement and   I regret verymuch that that should be the case.    His   Majesty&apos;sGovernment have, however, made their decision upon the considered advice of the experienced firms which areundertaking the work of constructing the engines thatare required and we believe it will Drove successful.I have nothing to add to the White Pacer except thatI regret sincerely that my Noble Eriend should feelI treated him with any lack of consideration.    I   was greatly pressed at the time he asked to see me andI hope he will believe that the last thing in theworld I intended was to be discourteous.    I haveLord Nuffield&apos;s authority for saying that while he cannot agree with some of the opinions expressed, heaccepts the White Paper as a fair statement of theGovernment&apos;s point of view of what has passed between himself and the Air Ministry and he does not proposeto make any further statement on the subject of his part in the discussions.    Although he is not able toco-operate in the air engine plan, he holds himselfready to place his services at the disposal of theGovernment for other important work.
APPENDIX IIConfidential Final Revise.Note on the Policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in relation to theProduction of Aero-EnginesPresented by tie Secretary of State for air to Parliament by Command of His majesty october, 1936
NOTE ON THE POLICY OF HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERN-MENT IN RELATION TO THE PRODUCTION OFAERO-ENGINES.It is desirable to begin by outlining the factors which governedthe policy of the Air Ministry in regard to the supply of aero-engines for Service purposes prior to the formulation of the shadow Aero-Engine Scheme in April, 1936. These factors arefundamental to a correct understanding of the position.First, the determination of a particular make of aero-engine to beused in a Service type of aircraft is primarily a matter for theaircraft company who design and produce the aeroplane. Thedecision is made in the light of the Royal Air Force requirements which the aircraft must fulfil, and the aeroplane designer will naturally select a suitable type already in production, or a new orimproved type so far developed as to have a reasonable prospect ofbeing available for production in time for his purpose. It is onlyin special and somewhat rare cases that the Air Ministry decide onthe make of aero-engine to be used in a particular type of aircraft.Secondly, it requires a great deal of unremitting research, experi-mentation and development to bring to the quantity productionstage a new or basically improved type of engine satisfactory for service use.Thirdly, owing to the higher horse power required for Servicepurposes, firms producing aero-engines for Service use are, apartfrom occasional orders for civil aircraft which fall within that highrange of horse power, almost entirely dependent on government orders for their existence. Any order obtained for foreign govern-ments would normally follow on orders obtained for the. BritishGovernment.During the period of retrenchment which followed the war, themajority of firms which had catered for the war needs of the RoyalAir Force returned to their peace tivae business, having onlyfew aeroplane and engine firms to supply the- ^ery limited require -ments of the Service. It was, however, the policy of the Govern-ment to interest and retain the services of sufficient ufc aeroplane and..&apos;iigine firms, not only to meet their requirements in the various types, but also to promote a measure of competition, and to provide an incentive to new ideas and to the ndvancemen- of design. the firms supplying the requirements of the Air Ministry in high-powered aero-engines were four in number Armstrong SiddeleyMotors, Ltd., The Bristol Aeroplane Company, Ltd., D. Napierand Son. Ltd., and Pvolls Royce, Ltd. and by their continuouswork on research, assisted by the Air Ministry policy of encourage-ment, they produced a succession of engines of outstanding per-formance and reliability.
These four firms more than sufficed to supply Air Ministryrequirements, and at the same time provided a sufficient measureof competition; and for these reasons other firms who desired to design and produce aero-engines for the Air Ministry wereinvariably informed of the facts of the situation and of their neces-sary effect on Government policy. It was, however, no part ofthe Departments policy to withhold from firms which embarked on the design of aero-engines such technical advice as could begiven when requested, and indeed advice was and is freely givenin all cases.These were the conditions obtaining in 1929 when Lord Nuffieldbegan to engage in aero-engine construction. During the yearsthat followed, the Directorate of Technical Development at theAir Ministry, with full Ministerial approval, were in touch withthe works which Lord Nuffield had established and any advice and technical assistance which were asked for were readily given.The 1935 Expansion Programme.In July, 1935, the Government presented to Parliament a Supple-mentary Estimate covering the initial expenditure in connectionwith the expansion of the Royal Air Force which had been decided upon. In presenting the Estimate, the Secretary of State for Airexplained to the House of Commons the general scope of that programme, both in materiel and personnel. The programme con-sisted of a large number of aeroplanes of various types. It was designed to embody delivery of the most suitable types of aero-planes which could be produced within the period. Multiplicityof types was avoided as far as possible a very important considera-tion in the interests of production and the types of engine requiredfor that programme were determined by the types of aeroplanesselected. As in aeroplanes, so in engines, it has been and is thecor considered policy bi -lie Government to avoid as far as possiblemultiplicity of types. The engines selected for the programmewc-c all .iginas * i h?&apos;gh quality and performance, fully approvedby th-.- technical staff of the Air Ministry, and selected by theaert. Ian - ropkers as those most suitable for the aircraft whichthey wer-3 ripply. The provision of the necessary engines forcbis programme was well within the capacity of the engine-makingfirms who wer? sheir designers and producers, and in fact the delivery of engines is being made at a very satisfactory rate.The engine firr- are employing a large number of sub-con-fcru&amp;cors, a bras -ics ,/hich the Government fully approve, as itassists proa action and spreads work throughout the country.On the- 25th July, 1935, Lord Nuffield wrote to the Secretaryof State as-dng -.t an interview on the 31st July, to which the secret, ry of State   j. plied as fellows on 29th July : 3893E A 2
&quot; I have just seen your letter of the 25th, and am sorry tosay that it will be quite impossible for me to see you onWednesday. I have two Cabinet Committees as well as aCabinet, and two deputations, and I have to be in the house and to attend a public dinner, so that literally every minute ofmy day is taken up.You will, I am sure, appreciate that at the end of the Sessionthere is a most tremendous rush.&quot;On the 19th November, 1935, the Secretary of State wrote toLord Nuffield as follows : &apos;&apos; You will remember suggesting to me in July that we should discuss the question of aero-engines, and I was very sorry thatat the time I was so pre-occupied with the new work here thatI was unable to arrange to meet you on the day which you sug-gested. After I first took over, my urgent work was to arrangefor the execution of the new programme, which necessarilydepended on certain specified types of machines and engines.In all this, as you know, I have had the constant help ofLord Weir. This programme has occupied us both to the full,but we are now able to look further ahead, and we shouldvery much like to have a full talk with you at this stage.Would it be convenient for you to meet us on Wednesday,the 27th of November? I have provisionally arranged withWeir to keep the time from three o&apos;clock onwards that dayfree.&quot;The Secretary of State and Lord Weir, with Air Marshal SirHugh Dowding, the Air Member for Research and Development,saw Lord Nuffield and Mr. Cannell on the 27th November.At this meeting Lord Nuffield began by expressing his anxiety about the unpreparedness of the supply arrangements for theproduction of aero-engines.The Secretary of State and Lord Weir outlined the situation as regards the Air Ministry expansion programme, and the par-ticular needs and structure of the aero-engine industry. They ex-plained that the programme was within the capacity of the existingindustry, and the production of reserves on the scale then antici-pated, after this programme was complete, was probably alsowithin its capacity. Both the Secretary of State and Lord Weir,however, gave it as their personal opinion that the introductionof a fifth engine firm, if that firm was a large motor manufacturingconcern., would be welcome on the ground of the production ex-perience which it could contribute. At the same time they made itclear to Lord Nuffield that the real customer for the military aero-engine was the aeroplane manufacturer, and that an engine marketcould not be guaranteed by the Air Ministry, although in certain
circumstances the Air Ministry had intervened to encourage aero-plane manufacturers to adopt a certain type of engine.In the course of discussion Lord Nuffield raised the questionwhether he would be justified in continuing his development of theWolseley series of aero-engines in view of the lack of support whichhe felt he had received from the Air Ministry.On this aspect of the question Sir Hugh Dowding pointed outthat when he was first approached two or three years before bythe Wolseley Company he had told them that a military aero-engine must find its own market amongst aeroplane, manufacturers.The Wolseley firm had, however, specialised in engines of a horse-power lower than that which was required by the Air ministry for military purposes, in the hope of securing a civil market.They had now under development a 600 h.p. engine (the Gemini)which just came within the lower end of the military range andthe Air Ministry had promised, in spite of certain difficulties, toprovide an aircraft in which it could be tested for endurance purposes in the ah-. Lord Nuffield and Mr. Cannell both acknowledged theassistance which the Air Ministry was giving in this respect, butLord Nuffield went on to say that he could not see any advantage in going on with the development of his aero-engines, although he and Mr. Cannell would think over the points that had beengiven them on the general situation by the Secretary of State andLord Weir.Lord Nuffield mentioned that he was in a position to manufacturean American engine under licence, and asked whether that wouldbe of interest to the Air Ministry. The Secretary of State andLord Weir pointed out that this would not be an attractive pro-posal for the Iioyal Air Force. It was most desirable to keep toBritish types, which were proved and wholly satisfactory, and whatwould be required in any further expansion would be a larger pro-duction of British types, which would fit in with the aeroplaneprogramme. Lord NuffielcFs recollection is that he also suggestedmaking complete Bristol engines. The recollection of the Secretaryof State and Lord Weir is that the question of manufacture ofBristol engines was not raised at this interview and did not infact arise until the further expansion programme was decided upon in the following year.Prior to the meeting between the Secretary of State andLord Nuffield, Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd. had written tothe Air Ministry on the loth October, 1935, bringing totheir notice the activities of the Company and describing the engines which were then on a production basis or were inthe course of development. The letter stated that the company had been requested by several aircraft firms from time to time tofurnish particulars of their engine development and suitability formilitary aircraft. They asked therefore to be given information about new specifications for which their engines might be suitable,
so that the firm might co-operate more fully with aircraft con-instructors. A reply to this letter was held up in view of the Secre-tary of State&apos;s impending interview with Lord Nuffield, but a reply was sent on the 6th December, giving as much information as couldbe released regarding specifications, but pointing out that only themost powerful of the engines so far projected by the firm (i.e., theGemini) could be considered for use in Service aircraft, although there was a possibility that one or more types of civil aircraftemploying some of the lower powered range of Wolseley engineswould be chosen for training purposes. In acknowledging thereceipt of this letter Wolseley Aero Engines stated that the informa-tion supplied would be of great assistance to them in enabling themto put forward to aircraft constructors the range of Wolseley aero-engines to meet the various specifications.Placing of order for Scorpio engines in August, 1936.It was decided during the summer of 1936 to adopt for training purposes a twin-engined aircraft developed by the Airspeed Com-pany from their civil &quot; Envoy &quot; type. It was originally the inten-tion to use another engine for this aircraft, but in the course of negotiations it was seen that the Scorpio engine presented certain advantages and a decision to adopt this engine was taken on the 5th August. Mr. Richardson of Wolseley Aero EnginesLtd. had already attended a meeting at the Air Ministry heldon the 20th July, when he gave details of the engine, and a letterfrom the Company followed on the 25th July, giving particulars of the quantities which they were in a position to produce. Follow-ing the decision taken on the 5th August, Mr. Richardson was seen by the Assistant Director of Contracts (Engines) on the11th, when the Air Ministry procedure for the placing of con-tracts was fully explained to him. Mr. Richardson stated thatthere would be no difficulty in the acceptance by his company of an Instruction to Proceed on the lines which had been indicated to him.On the 19th August, the Chief Inspector of Engines in the Aero-nautical Inspection Directorate visited the Wolseley works and discussed the problem of output with Mr. Cannell, the managing director. The Chief Inspector was informed that parts were in production for the first batch of 50 engines and that materialsupplies were available for the second batch of engines. A letterconfirming the arrangements made was sent to the firm on the21st August, and was acknowledged by the firm on the 24th. Onthe same date two members of the staff of the AeronauticalInspection Directorate were temporarily attached to the works.On the 26th /August Mr. Boden, who had been appointedManaging Director of Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd. in place of
Mr. Cannell, telephoned to the Assistant Director of Contracts(Engines) and after saying that he understood that Mr. Richardsonhad discussed the issue of a contract with Wolseley Aero Engines,asked how the matter stood. He was informed that an instruction to Proceed for 300 Scorpio engines was either in the post or about to be posted. (It was subsequently confirmed that the formalInstruction to Proceed had in fact been despatched before Mr.Boden telephoned.) He then stated that in view of changes that had taken place in the organisation of his company it had beendecided to discontinue the manufacture of aero-engines.Arrangements were consequently put in hand for the supply of alternative engines.The scheme for a shadow aero-engine industry.Early in 1936 the Government decided that it would benecessary to substitute for the programme previously approved a far larger programme of expansion for the Eoyai Air Force.This decision was announced in the Statement relating to defence (Cmd. 5107) of the 3rd March, 1936, and envisaged notonly a further increase in the first-line strength of the Boyal AirForce, but the building up of further large reserves of aircraft and engines.The programme was so large that it was clear that it exceeded the capacity of the existing aeroplane and aero-engine firms as thenconstituted. Two courses were open to the Government, either to afford assistance to existing aircraft firms to make further very largeextensions of their buildings and plant or to bring in firms outsidethe aircraft industry who would, in the event of war, be required to turn to aircraft production.As i-egards engines, the type of engine required was determinedby the decision with regard to the aeroplanes. Briefly, the gapwhich was required to be filled by production outside the existingindustry was the production of a large number of engines of Bristoltype. If these engines had been urgently required for first line aircraft under the programme, the simplest and quickest coursewould have been to prrange with the Bristol Aeroplane company for them to build and equip a new factory which would deliverthe requisite number of engines. As, however, a large part ofthe extra engines were required for reserve, the Government felt able to adopt the alternative of bringing&quot; in outside firms in themanner described below.A great deal of work had already been undertaken by the Com-,mittee of Imperial Defence in reviewing civil industry and in preparing&quot; plans by which the resources of a number of firms wouldin war be earmarked for particular types of war production, naval,military, air, and work common to all three Services. Under thatallocation various motor firms were allocated to aircraft work.
Morris Motors Ltd. were allocated not to the Air Ministry, but tothe War Office. This decision had been taken in view of the greatamount of War Office work which the firm normally undertook andof the large demands which the War Office would make upon thatfirm in the event of war. The associated firm of Wolseley MotorsLtd. was, however, allocated to aircraft work.The Government decided that it would serve the combinedpurposes of securing the additional airframes and engines whichwere required by the programme, of increasing the war potential,and of affording valuable experience to the firms allocated to air-craft if these firms would undertake jibe erection, equipment and management of a series of &quot; shadow &quot; factories on behalf of theGovernment. Action was accordingly taken in regard to bothaeroplanes and engines.It was an essential part of the shadow plan for engines thatthe shadow factory should be established in the closest possibleassociation with the works of the managing firm, which would inthe event of war turn their main factories over to war production.The shadow factory so established would thus in the most con-venient manner carry out the work required during the presentexpansion, and would be best placed to be utilised by the firmimmediately in the event of war.An invitation to co-operate in the shadow scheme which took the form of a letter, reproduced as Appendix I, was accordinglysent to the following motor manufacturing firms which had been allocated to the Air Ministry for war production : The AustinMotor Company Ltd., the Daimler Company Ltd., Eootes Securi-ties Ltd., the Hover Company Ltd., Singer and Company Ltd.,the Standard Motor Company Ltd., and Wolseiey Motors Ltd.On the 7th April, 1936, the secretar- of State and Lord Weir,with Sir Arthur Eobinson, Chairman of the Supply Board, and members of the Air Ministry met representatives of these sevenfirms and explained the position to them in detail. They were askedto assist in securing the production of a given number of engines ofBristol type required for the needs of the expansion programme,and to utilise this opportunity to the best advantage as an educa-tion for the role which they might be called upon to play in timeof war. The firms were asked to consider, in consultation with the bristol Company, what was in their opinion the most practicalway of carrying out the scheme, bearing in mind, first, the import-ance of obtaining delivery of the engines within a stipulatedtime, and, secondly, the desirability of giving the firms theexperience which they would require for production of aero-enginesin the event of war.The firms concerned agreed to co-operate with the AirMinistry as a team through a committee which they formed at themeeting on the 7th April under the chairmanship of Sir HerbertAustin.
In Lord Nuffield&apos;s absence abroad, the invitation to attend themeeting on the 7th April had been sent to Mr. Cannell, who, it was assumed, would represent Wolseley Motors Ltd. Somequestion arose as to whether Mr. Cannell was representing WolseleyMotors Ltd. or Wolseley Aero Engines Ltd., and at a later dateMr. Lord of Wolseley Motors Ltd., joined the committee.On the 21st April the Secretary of the Committee reported to theAir Ministry that the Committee had now discussed among them-selves and with the Bristol Aeroplane Company the best means ofcarrying out the programme envisaged, and that they were of theopinion that each of the shadow factories set up should undertake the manufacture of a different group of parts of aero-engines, andthat the assembly and test of the complete units should be under-taken by two factories only.The Air Ministry would have preferred that each engine shouldnot have been sub-divided among as many as seven firms. A meet-ing was in consequence arranged with Sir Herbert Austin as chairman of the Committee on the 30th April, who undertook thatthe matter should be further considered by the Committee.The matter was duly considered by the Committee, and the AirMinistry were informed on the 7th May that the Committee was definitely and unanimously of opinion that the only safe and practi-cal scheme was for each firm to manufacture one section only.In arriving at this conclusion the firms were greatly impressed by the difficulty and delay which would arise under any schemewhich involved the duplication or multiplication of orders for jigs,fixtures, gauges, tools and other plant. They also took into con-sideration the increased strain of supervision which would beplaced upon the Bristol Company if the making of the same sectionswere undertaken by a number of firms.On the 6th May, Mr. Cannell had written to Lord Weir suggest-ing that his company should undertake the construction of 2,000Bristol engines, as in Lord Nuffield&apos;s opinion this proposal would beof greater value to the Air Ministry than the co-operation of theWolseley Company in the shadow scheme. This letter was acknow-ledged by Lord Weir and referred to the Air Council, and as aresult Mr. Cannell was informed that the proposal was inconsistent with the policy proposed by the Committee which the Air ministry had agreed to adopt.On the 16th June, Lord Nuffield had an interview with LordWeir in which he expressed concern at the fact that he did not know how best the production facilities of his company could be utilised. He asked that representatives of the Ministry should meet mr. Lord and examine the general facilities of the Morris andWolseley Companies arid discuss the best way of using these facilities in peace or war. The Director of Aeronautical Production accord-ingly visited the Wolseley works.   In the course of conversation
with Mr. Lord, he gathered that while Wolseley Motors would beprepared to participate in the scheme worked out by the Aero-Engine Committee, they would greatly prefer to make wholeengines instead of components only.Partly as a result of this report by the Director of AeronauticalProduction, representatives of the seven firms were asked to meetthe Secretary of State and Lord Weir again on the 29th June priorto a meeting which they were proposing to hold with the bristol aeroplane Company on the 30th June, at which decisions wouldbe taken as to the sections to be manufactured b3&apos; each firm. Atthis meeting the Secretary of State reminded the firms of the objects which the shadow scheme had in view, and said he wishedto confirm finally that the advice of the firms was that these results could best be secured by dividing the work on each engine intoseven sections. The success of the scheme was, be said, a matterof such paramount importance that he had considered it desirable tomeet the firms&apos; representatives to be quite sure that he had under-stood their views correctly, and that the plan that it was proposedto adopt was indeed the most effective plan for the purposes in view.In reply, Sir Herbert Austin, as Chairman of the Committee,assured the Secretary of State that the whole matter had been most carefully considered. The Committee were still of the opinionthat the only safe and practical scheme was for each firm to mami-facture one section only. The Secretary of State mentioned thathe had been led to re-open the question with the firms sincesuggestions had reached him that some of them had agreed to adoptthe seven-unit scheme only because they thought it was the schemefavoured by the Air Ministry. It would be a most serious matterif a mistake were made and an unsuitable plan adopted. SirHerbert Austin replied that naturally there was room for differ-ences of opinion amongst seven firms. Some of them, includinghis own company, would, so far as their own interests were con-cerned, have preferred to make complete engines, but such a coursewould not have secured the objects in view. Sir Herbert Austin&apos;view was confirmed by the representatives of the other firms. Mr.Lord stated that he thought that the output required was most likely to be secured by adopting the seven-unit scheme. specialisations-tion was the simplest and most direct method, but he was notconfident, that the scheme would succeed, and suggested that theAir Ministry should cover itself by obtaining engines from someother source as well. He added that though he had little doubtthat Wolseley Motors would join the scheme, their participationmust for the moment be regarded as provisional, as he would need to consult Lora Nufneld.On the following morning Mr. Lord telephoned to the Secretaryof State saying that Lord Nuffield had now decided that WolseleyMotors would not co-operate in the shadow scheme.  The secretary state accordingly sent a message to the other members of the
Committee who were meeting at Bristol, asking them to proceedwith the scheme on the basis that Wolseley Motors would not co-operate.Subsequently, at Sir Herbert Austin&apos;s request, Lord Weir sawMr. Lord on the 7th July and discussed the possibility of WolseleyMotors Ltd. coming back into the shadow scheme. A proposal1 had been made that the Air Ministry should purchase for use asa shadow factory a building at Coventry belonging to the Momsorganisation. The proposal was carefully considered, but the AirMinistry were for various reasons unable to accept the Coventryfactory as suitable for the purpose. The whole position was further discussed by Lord Weir with Lord Nuffield and Mr. Lord on thefollowing day. Lord Weir again explained why the proposedfactory was unsuitable, and no mutually agreeable scheme could befound.Shortly afterwards the Aero Engine Committee approachedWolseley Motors with a proposition that they should take overthe manufacture of certain sections, together with the erecting andtesting of part of the engines.On the 7th August Mr. Lord telephoned to the Director ofAeronautical Production saying that Wolseley Motors Ltd.were definitely coming into the scheme, and after again suggesting that the Air Ministry should take over the factory referred topreviously, agreed to establish a factory in Birmingham. An officerof the Directorate of Aeronautical Production accordingly visitedBirmingham to make detailed arrangements with the firm, and in aletter dated the 14th August Mr. Lord submitted full proposals forthe erection and equipment of the factory.Mr. Lord subsequently resigned from his post of Managing-Director of Wolseley Motors, and Mr. Boden was appointed in his place. On the 26th August a letter was sent by Mr. Boden to anofficer on the staff of the Director of Aeronautical Production, sayingthat owing to the change in management his company wished towithdraw the proposals contained in Mr. Lord&apos;s letter of the 14thAugust. Immediately on receipt of this letter the Director of Aero-nautical Production rang up Mr. Boden and suggested that he should come to the Ah- Ministry and explain to the Air Member for Supplyand Organisation what the position was. At this interview Mr.Boden stated that when he had taken up the post of managing director he had taken stock of the situation and had come to theconclusion that in view of the amount of reorganisation which was taking place in Morris Motors Ltd. he could not in fairness tothe Air Ministry continue to carry on with the shadow scheme and do justice to it.Arrangements were immediately made to get in touch with the bristol Aeroplane Company, and a representative of the company was interviewed the same afternoon.   The Company have agreed
to participate in the scheme and to undertake the assembly andtesting in place of Wolseley Motors.It will be seen from the above statement that the plan which hasbeen adopted is that advocated by the experienced firms who aremaking themselves responsible for its execution as the plan whichin their considered opinion is the most practical in all the circum-stances. A report by Lord Austin, the Chairman of the Committee, &amp;made at the request of all the firms, expressing their confidence inthe scheme, is reproduced in Appendix II.APPENDIX I.24th March, 1936.Deau -,You will be aware of the general policy which the Government intends to pursue in order to ensure that civilian industry may be able to play a prompt and effective part in war production should that be required and also to obtain under the present Defence programmes certain supplies which are in excess of the capacity of the normal munitions industries.Broadly the plan contemplates that a number of firms normally engaged on civil work shall have allotted to the:n the particular kind of work theywill be called upon to undertake in war, that the necessary steps shall betaken to enable such firms to turn over rapidly to war work in case of need; and that particular firms should be asked during a limited period to produce certain munitions to supplement the output of the regularmunition firms.It is an essential part of the plan that the ordinary civil work of thesefirms should not be interfered with, and that the facilities created and putin use in the present emergency shall remain in existence as a &quot; war potential &quot; when no longer required for current production.At the Air Ministry I have under consideration the measures to betaken under the above scheme with regard to aero-engines. Some actualproduction of particular types will be required, and plans must also bemade for large-scale production in time of war. It is important that theaction which is taken to meet temporary requirements should be in accord with the right method to be adopted on a much larger scale in the eventof war.Certain firms have been allocated for the production of aircraft and/oraero-engines in case of war.   Your firm is one of these.Before taking decisions as to the detailed planning of the war potentialor the placing of orders for aeroplane engines outside the regular aircraftfirms, I am anxious to discuss with firms who will be most directly con-cerred the best way of achieving the objects set out in paragraph 4. Inparticular I would like to have the considered opinion of firms as towhether production of engines on a large scale in war would be best obtained by each firm manufacturing complete engines, or by an arrangement underwhich selected component parts would be allotted to particular firms,with one or more central places of assembly. It will be appreciated that what is required in case of war is rapid production on a large scale of definite approved types. The governing factor is how to get quick large-scale production in such an emergency.
I would be grateful if you could arrange for a representative of yourrrm to attend a meeting with Lord Weir and myself at tho Air Ministry,Adastral House, on 7th April next at 3.15 p.m. to discuss these matters.A similar invitation is being addressed to certain other firms who are particularly concerned.You will appreciate that the subject-matter of this letter should for thepresent be treated as strictly confidential.It may be convenient for you to have before you the Government &quot;white paper on the Defence Policy and Programmes and the speech in the Houseof Lords in which I dealt particularly with the industrial side of thisquestion.   Copies are enclosed.Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)      Swinton.APPENDIX II.October 20th, 1936.Dear Lord Swinton,We held a Meeting of the Aero Engine Committee at Coventry to-day,at which all the Firms were represented, and they unanimously wished meto tell you that they believe in the Shadow Scheme, that they are confidentit can be made a success and that they are going to &quot; see it through.&quot;As your Department has no doubt been advised, the buildings for thevarious Factories^are rapidly &quot; taking snaps,&quot; and upon enquiry I could find no holdup or^-iggpage in the work connected with the purchase ofmachinery and the jig$? tools and fixtures. By the end of the year itshould be possible to form a definite opinion as to the date when manufac-ture might commence.I am,Yours sincerely,(Sgd.)      Atjstin.(38935-18)  Wt.     -3500    10/36 P.
