1.

parliamentary business.(RreviousReference:Cabinet 48(36), Con-clusion 2.)2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet.that both Nouses of Parliament would adjourn on Friday,July 31st, the usual Resolution being passed toenable them to be summoned in case of emergency .&apos; The adjournment would be until Thursday, OctoberF.R.5SC^V    22nd .By July 31st the. whole of the business ofParliament would have been completed, and it wouldhave been possible to prorogue.   Adjournment, however,was preferable on the present occasion because theprocedure ^or re-assembling Parliament, in case of necessity would thereby be easier.    On re-assembly on October 22nd. the only business would be toprorogue.    It was pro posed.-that the next Session ofParliament should, open on Tuesday, October 27th.mhe Lord. Privy Seal raised, the question ofprocedure if it should, be necessary to re-assemblethe Rouse of Lords in the absence of the LordChancellor.   At the request of the Prime minister he undertook to consult the Permanent Secretary tothe Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office on the subject.
GERMANY AMD 3 .   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsTT-T&quot;S LOCARNOTREAmY. reported that he had reached agreement with theThe forth- French and Belgian Governments to hold a Meeting incoming LondonMeeting. London on the following day, Thursday, July 23rd.The general lines of the Conraunique to be issued(previous reference: after the Conference had been agreed, though thereCabinet 53(35), Con- were one or two points outstanding.   Re proposedelusion 1.)f:r. 55 ($L)that before discussing anything else the form ofthe final Communique should, be settled.    Re then read the present form of the proposed Communique,which is attached in the Appendix.    The FrenchGovernment had. at first wished to make some referenceto the German action of March 7th. a^d-t-o .t-ho factt-jaarfa-thore-had boe-n-&quot;nQ-.^&amp;ply to.-..our . q-ueot-ie-inquu^lyQ^-^heQ-ormMl-(3e^gyraBcmte .   He himself had. pointed, out that nothing would, be gained by referring to the events of March 7th.    The Conference was to be attended, bythe French and. Belgian Prime Ministers and foreign ministers, and. it was hoped to conclude the business in the course of the day, though this&quot;was notfacilitated, by F. Blum&apos;s proposal to arrive byaeroplane only at Noon and the formal luncheonwhich, in accordance with custom, had to be offered.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs recalled that at the Cabinet. Committee when aquestion had been raised, of some reference being included, in the draft Communique to the Germanneglect to answer the british  Questionnaire, he had replied, in the negative.    On re-consideration,however, he would, like to have some latitude inthis matter,    this might enable him, by a discreetand tactful reference to the Questionnaire, to avoid the inclusion of some more objectionable passage.
The Secretary of State for Foreign &quot;Affairs was asked, to avoid the inclusion of any reference to the questionnaire, to which Germany was likely to takeoffence, since the object of the Meeting was to bringGermany into contact.    It was suggested that if somepublicy reference ought to be made to the matter a parliamentary debate might provide a. more convenient opportunity.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should, have somelatitude in regard to a possibletactful reference to the Germanfailure to reply to the BritishQuestionnaire, whether in theproposed. Communique or elsewhere .
T^E MEDITERRANEANGuarantees tocertain Powers .(previous reference e:Cabinet 53(36), Con-clusion 3,)4.   The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that on the previous day he had. receivedfrom the Italian Charge&quot; d&apos;Affaires the text of an aide-memoire,dated July 17th, containing particulars of quite satisfactory assurances that had. beengiven to the Governments of Turkey, Yugo-Slavia and greece that Italy was not contemplating       aggressive action against any of them in retaliation for theirpast sanctionist policy.    In the circumstances he hoped to be able to make an announcement which would show that we regarded the episode at an end and. ourown guarantees to have lapsed .   He would do thiseither as an answer to a Question in Parliament, orin the course of debate.    It would be possible for him to say that the Italian assurances were a consequence of our own action.   He proposed, alsoto clear up the somewhat extravagant interpretationthat the Turks had. given to our guarantee .The Cabinet agreed.  That the Secretary o*&quot; State forForeign Affairs should have authority to make the proposed announcement on a convenient opportunity.
5. mhe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that the information receivedby the Foreign Office as to the rising in Spain was somewhat fragmentary.   At his request, however, theAdmiralty had moved ships bo all the more importantports in Spain for the protection of Britishresidents and visitors, and incidentally it was hopedthereby to obtain further information of what washappening .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs theninformed the Cabinet that the Spanish Ambassador had told him of the desire of the Spanish Government topurchase oil at Gibraltar for the Spanish.Fleet  inTangier.    The Spanish Government were, of course,entitled to purchase the oil from commercial sources.Consequently, after consulting the Admiralty andobtaining their concurrence, he had so informed the ambassador.   He added, that it was desirable that theSpanish Fleet should lea^-e mangier as soon aspossible as it was liable to be bombed there byrebel aircraft .A short discussion then took place as to thepossible effects of a Spanish purchase of oil at gibraltar.    there was no reason to believe, and itwas not thought probable, that the Spanish government proposed to send the ships into Gibraltar harbour tobe fuelled by commercial firms there.    Such a development, however, would be very undesirable, asconceivably the ships might then be bombed in gibraltar Bay.    If the oil was to be sent to &quot;angierin a tanker it was realised that the tanker would, be exposed, to bombing, and from this point of view thehope was expressed that a British tanker would notbe employed.
The Cabinet were informed that the Spanish fleet was anchored in &quot;&quot;angler unable to move until itcould get oil.    Dissident Officers were understood to have been imprisoned by the^crews, ^vnich wereloyal to the Spanish Government.The Cabinet were reminded that the commercialcompanies were unlikely to supply the oil from gibraltar unless assured of payment.^he Cabinet agreed  That no further immediate action was necessary, but that the&apos;situation should be carefully watched .
danzig.f previous reference:Cabinet ^0(36), Con-clusion 2 .)6. mhe Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that an unpleasant situation had developedat Danzig.   He was encountering difficulty inobtaining information as the Polish Foreign Minister,who was in a difficult situation, had left Warsawfor the seaside.   He gathered, from the Press thatsome trouble was being worked up by the militaryauthorities and. others in Poland.    The position ofthe League T-Tigh Commissioner at Danzig was particu-larly difficult  .    there appeared to be three possible alternative courses:..-(l) That the Polish and German governments should reach agreement   but this was likely to be at the expense of the minorities:(2)  That the League should disinterestitself and withdraw the T-Tigh Commis-sioner, on the groun^ that theagreement was not being observed:(3)  That the League should exercisepressure, possibly by sending aninternational force.The objection to the third course was that the Leaguethewould be going against/established Government inDanzig,    If taken, its object would, be to get a new arrangement instead, o^ the present very unsatisfactoryone .In the course       a short discussion it was pointedout that an international force sent to&quot;Danzig mighthave to remain there for an indefinite period of timeoccupied  unlike the case of the Saar, which had been/for alimited period. . Such a course was not likely to be popular in this country.The Cabinet were reminded that an international force could not be sent without the agreement of theparties concerned, and the suggestion was made thatit might be worth while to consider the possibilityof obtaining German agreement to that course, thoughit was not thought that Germany would consent.
THE ANGLO- 7.   The Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsEGYPTIAN Anglo-TREATY NEGO- reported that the Cabinet Committee on the/EgyptianT TAT IONS. 7Treaty negotiations had met on the previous evening(Previous and as a result instructions had been telegraphed to reference-Cabinet 68 Sir Miles Larnpson which should help him to clear(36), Con-elusion 4.) up outstanding questions on the military clauses.PR. 55^4)6,
8.      The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsregretted that he had not heen present when the .question of Export Credits for Russian Orders hadbeen discussed by the Cabinet at the meeting referredto in the margin,  as he had wanted to try and obtain the use of the Baring Balances for theRussian creditors.     Admittedly the sum of 6,000,000 was a small one, but some of the creditors were    in   a    very bad way and it would bebetter to obtain this than nothing at all.     He wassorry to let go what might he the last chance ofobtaining these Balances.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said hehad always hoped that ultimately the Russian debtswould he settled as part of some large trade agreement.      The Baring Balances were still in thiscountry and he felt it would he humiliating to announce that, in fulfilment of a debt of  250,000,000,we had accepted  6,000,000.      He had had a conversation on the subject with Mr. Victor Cazalet, M.P.,who had taken up the matter on behalf of the smallerRussian creditors, and who appeared to be impressed withthis explanation of the Government&apos;s attitude.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs expressed doubt as to when any large trade agreement which would include the debts could be negotiated.The PresioLent of the Board of Trade said he had not been able to open up the question of    alarge commercial treaty, but during the present weekagreements had been reached^which would result in the placing of orders by Russia in this country to thevalue of  10,000,000 within the next we-^pfiaaas.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that he had felt it necessary to enter his plea.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he hoped that it was generally understood that we hadnot abandoned the idea of an ultimate settlement.
LlBSTINB. 9t      The Secretary of State for the CoLoniesItuation in reported that with one exception the Royalb?previous Commission was now complete, as follows:-fabinet 52 (36) The Right Hon. The Earl Peel, G.C.S.I., C.B.E.,Conclusions 5 (Chairman),gnd 6) The Right Hon. Sir Horace Rumhold, G.C.B., G.C.M.G..M.V.O.,  (Vice-Chairman)Sir Laurie Hammond, K.C.S.I.fhe Royal Sir Morris Carter, C.B.E.Commission. Professor Coupland, C.I.E.The Chairman was unable to leave Englandbefore 1st October but there was no question of this.The only outstanding member was the proposed K.C.He had approached Mr. Cyril Asquith, K.&apos;C, who wouldlike to accept but had accepted some briefs in the privy Council Court for the Autumn that might be important to his future career at the Bar.      this made it difficult for him to accept withoutindemnification.In the course of a short discussion, therewas general agreement that indemnification of a royal Commissioner for loss was undesirable, both asa precedent and, in this particular case, as liableto arouse the suspicions of the Arabs.The Secretary of State for the Coloniespointed out that both the Arabs and the Jews werebriefing Counsel for the Inquiry in Palestine and itwas essential that the Royal Commission should include a first rate barrister.The Cabinet agreed:That the Home Secretary and the Ministerfor Co-Ordination of Defence should try and find a suitable candidatefrom the Bar for membership of theRoyal Commission within the next43 hours and should notify theSecretary of State for the Colonies,
cabinet procedure.the of post-Var cabinet papers in Auto-biographies .(previous reference:Cabinet ^1(35),  Con-clusion 10.)PR. 5-5^4;/.10,The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Secretary ( CP.-198 (35))  submitting, by direction&quot;of the Prime Minister, for their consider-ation a request recently received from Mr J.H.Thomasthat certain Cabinet Papers should be sent to hisSussex home for use in connection with the writing of his autobiography.   As this was the first case...in which the use of post-war Cabinet documents inan autobiography was involved, a precedent would be constituted, and instructions applicable to thepresent case and to other cases were requested.In the Memorandum it was suggested that the secretary might be authorised to reply to Mr Thomas referring to the distinction which had. always been drawn between War and post-War records, and saying that,while there was no objection to his seeing the documents in question at the Cabinet Office for the  ... . ......--- --............purpose of refreshing his memory, it would not beopen to him to refer in his autobiography to proceedings in Cabinet, still less to quote fromCabinet Minutes or other post-War Cabinet documents,and that it would be very desirable if he couldavoid giving the impression that the information contained, in his book had been derived in any way from secret official documents.    It was also proposed that Mr Thomas should be asked to let theSecretary see the proofs of what he proposed to publish in connection with the matters mentioned inhis letter, with a view to applying for any consentsthat might be necessary.
The Prime Minister told the Cabinet thathe was informed by the Secretary that the Lord Presidentof the Council, absent indisposed, did not dissent from the procedure proposed, but would like to see theletter in which the Secretary&apos;s reply to Mr. Thomaswas communicated.      In view of the previous decisions,to which Mr. Thomas had been a party, he saw no alternative to the course now proposed.The Cabinet approved the proposals inparagraphs 5 and 9 of the Secretary&apos;smemorandum CP. 198 (36) summarised above.
THE SPECIALAREAS.Final Reportof Sir ArthurRose as Corn-miss practitioner forthe SpecialAreas inScotland..(previous reference:Cabinet 6(36), Con-clusion 11.)11.    The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP,-197 (36))circulating for the information of his colleaguesproof copies of the Final Report of Sir Arthur Roseas Commissioner for the Special Areas in Scotland.A summary of the Report and of the comments and.recommendations which it contained was attached tothe Memorandum.   An examination of these   some ofwhich raised questions of general policy   was being undertaken, but no immediate action -on them was contemplated.    The Secretary of State proposed thatthe Report should be published shortly before theHouse adjourned for the Summer Recess.The Cabinet agreed:That the Secretary of State for scotland should be authorised to arrange forthe publication of the report just before the adjournment of parliament for the Summer Recess^
TNTERNATTONALLABOTTR ORGAN-ISA T TON .MaritimeConference,October, 193 5(previous reference:Cabinet 17(3 5), Con-clusion 10.)12. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of &quot;Labour f CP.-199 (36)) stating thata Special Session of the International Labour Organ-is at ion was due to open at Geneva, on October 6th inorder to consider various maritime questions, themost important of which would be the proposal for aConvention dealing with hours of work and manning in ships at sea.    The broad question was whether theUnited kingdom delegates should or should not engage in discussions upon the preparation of a Convention.This raised important issues, and the attitude adoptedby the representatives of T-Tis Majesty&apos;s government at the Conference would, in effect demonstrate either that the Government was prepared to consider&apos; Conven-tions requiring hours legislation in suitable circum-stances, or that they were opposed on principle toany and. all attempts to deal with the subject of hours apart from other conditions of employment, suchas wages, by means of international regulations.The Minister of Labour therefore proposed, in agreementwith the President of the Board of Trade, that theUnited kingdom delegates, should be instructed to take part in the drafting of a Convention on conditions set forth in his Memorandum.The Cabinet approved the proposals of theMinister of Labour as set forth in cp. 199 (36) and summarised above.,2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.122nd July, 1936.
appendix draft OP FINAL COMMUNIQUE(See Conclusion 3)The Representatives of France, Belgiiim, and theUnited Kingdom, having met in &apos;      onMindful of the arrangement of the 19th March ofthe proposals of the German Chancellor of the 31st March,and of those of the French Government of the 8th April,have arrived at the following conclusions(l)    The main purpose to which the efforts of all european nations must be directed is to consolidate peace by means of a general settlement.(2)    Such a settlement can only be achieved by thefree co-operation of all the Powers concerned,  and nothing would be more fatal to the hopes of such a settlement thanthe division, apparent or real, of Europe into opposingblocs.(3)    The three Powers,  France, Belgium,  and theUnited Kijigdom, accordingly consider that steps should betaken to arrange a meeting of the five Locarno Powers assoon as such a meeting can conveniently be held.    Thefirst business to be \mdertaken should,  in their opinion,be to negotiate a new agreement to take the place of the rhine Pact of Locarno,  and thus liquidate the situation created by the German initiative of the 7th March.If progress could be made under this head othermatters affecting E1rropean neace will,  in their opinion,naturally come under discussion.The Representatives of the three Powers would accordingly look forward to the widening of the area of
the discussion in such a manner as to facilitate the general settlement of those problems the solution of which theyconceive to be essential to the peace of Europe.The three Governments accordingly urouose te enterinto communication with the German and Italian governments with a view to obtaining their participation in the meetingthus proposed.
