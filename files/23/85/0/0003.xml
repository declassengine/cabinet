QUESTION OPCONSTJLrT,Arn IONWITH THEPARLIAMENTARYOPPOSIT TON/JjD INFLUENT TATM .P&apos;s .1.The Prime Minister said that the objectfor which he had summoned this Meeting was to hearfrom the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs an account of the proceedings at the Assembly andCouncil of the League at Geneva.There was,(previous reference:Cabinet 26(35), Con-however, a preliminary matter which he would ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise.elusion 10.)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that duringthe previous week his brother, Sir Austen Chamberlain,had visited him and told him how concerned he was with the situation of this country, &quot;of Europe andof the Government.   For the first time since thelate Marquess of Salisbury&apos;s Government he noticed that the House of Commons was divided on foreignpolicy.   Sir Austen was anxious to help, and had consulted friends, who agreed on his general line.Sir Austen had also made a similar communication to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury.T-?is idea, had been to present a Motion that the -House should go into Committee in order to discussthe state of the nation.   His idea was that thereshould be a Secret Session, at which the Governmentcould give information which could not be given inordinary debate, with a view to bringing thevarious Parties together and securing a united front,   ^he Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasure-had told. Sir Austen that he had misgivings as towhether the debate would in fact be kept secret,and had thrown out as a possible alternative that perhaps the Government might receive certaininfluential Members of the House of Commons,Opposition. This proposal Sir Austen Chamberlainwas prepared to consider.    The Chancellor of theincluding, of course, the Leader of the Labour
Exchequer himself had shared the view expressed bythe Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury as tothe proposed Secret Session and regarded it as a dangerous experiment.   Rumours would probably get out as to what had. happened, and there would bedenials and counter-denials.    This might easilycreate panic in the nation, with a demand for publication of particulars.As to the alternative of a meeting between theGovernment and. influential Members of Parliament,he doubted if the Labour Opposition would beprepared to attend. It would make their positionrather awkward with their supporters, since, informing a united front, they would be sharing theresponsibility of the Government.Sir Austen Chamberlain had then suggested thatan attitude of that kind would put the Leader ofthe Labour Opposition in an awkward position, asthe Leader of the Opposition Liberals would probablyaccept the offer.   The Chancellor himself did notshare this view.    Sir Austen Chamberlain had saidthat his object was not any attack on the Governmentand. that he would reserve his position and take no action until Monday.   The Chancellor said he wouldprobably see his brother some time that afternoon.He had discussed the matter with the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury, and on the previous evening had had an opportunity to talk it over withthe Prime Minister.   Assuming, as he felt justifiedin doing, that the idea of a Secret Session had.probably been dropped, he himself felt that thethe alternativeLeader of the Labour Opposition would probably refuse7.If other influential Members of Parliament attended a meeting of this kind it would, lead to a series of conferences at each of which mr Winston Churchill
would, probably adopt an increasingly aggressiveline.    Very likely he and Mr Lloyd. George would, work together and. would, accuse the Government of not taking Defence sufficiently seriously, and. eventuallythey might, insist on telling the country, or at anyrate Parliament, what they thought about it.   On theothpr hand it was rather difficult to give acategorical refusal.   The answer might be that theGovernment could not consider the proposal unless there was a reasonable prospect of reaching a united, front, including the Opposition Labour Party.If this line were adopted. Sir Austen Chamberlainmight be -asked, to sound the Leader of the OppositionLabour Party and ask if he would, be willing to collaborate.    Tf the Leader of the Labour Oppositionaccepted, then the meetings might take place:    butif he refuse^1 it would, at least show that theGovernment was not to blame for the failure of theproposal.   This view was shared by the PrimeMinister and the Parliamentary Secretary to theTreasury.The Prime Minister said he had spoken to theLord President of the Council on the subject.Mr Winston Churchill, he understood, was contemplat-ing the delivery of a speech four hours in length.As he could not get a platform for a sufficientlycomprehensive speech on any of the Estimates, he proposed, to make it on the Consolidated Fund Bill.^he Lord President of the Council was reluctant,to reject the proposal both for a Secret session and. a private meeting.   He asked, however, whetherthe Cabinet would welcome the prospect of having to face Mr Chur(&amp;hill&apos;s criticisms in Parliament .Tf not, one method that ha^ occurred to him for meeting the difficulty was by inviting influential
Members of Parliament to a Meeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence, for which there were numerousprecedents.   That course should not be adopted,however, if the Leader of the Labour opposition party refused.    The more he thought of it the lesshe liked the idea of a meeting attended, by Mr winston churchill, whether Major Attlee accepted or not.At the same time he did not like to reject bothproposals .    If asked, for a meeting by the leader of the Labour Opposition an^ other influentialM.P&apos;s he would not refuse.The Prime Minister agreed that a&apos;Secret Sessionwas out of the question.    It might easily throwthe country into a panic, and. there was no precedent for it except during war.    The position would be avery awkward one if the Government invited.Sir Austen Chamberlain and his friends to a meeting  .without any representatives of other Parties.    Itwas sure to leak out in the ^ouse of Commons andwould, create a bad. impression.The Home Secretary said that an invitation fromthe Government to such a meeting would put them inthe position of suggesting that they were not adequate to their task.    One objection to an invitation wasthat the M.P&apos;s attending would, demand papers.The Secretary of State for Air said, there was ahistory behind this question.   He recalled, that theLord President of the Council, when Prime Minister,had asked him to be Chairman of the Air defence research Sub-Committee.   The Prime Minister and theLord President had thought it wise to inviteSir Austen Chamberlain to be a member of that committee, but Sir Austen had refused, owing to hispreoccupation with the India Committee .   When the india Committee came to an end. another approach
had been made to Sir Austen Chamberlain, but he had again refused and had proposed that Mr winston churchill should become a member.   Mr churchill had accepted, but his attitude had throughout beenunhelpful.    Instead of confining himself to the research questions he had. raised, wider issues.As Chairman he himself had refused, to allow thework of the Committee to be extended, and he had also declined to receive any Papers privately fromMr Churchill on such subjects .    Such Papers as hehad received, from Mr Churchill had been madeavailable to the Mr Defence Research Sub-committee but had. been reproduced as documents for the wholeCommittee of Imperial Defence in the ordinary course.   Mr Churchill had. never really consideredthe Air Ministry&apos;s comments on his Papers on their merits, although they were probably fairly accurate,and. actually had turned out. to be within one percent . of the French estimates of German air strength.   Mr Churchill had also been working in&quot;close alliance with Professor Lindemann, who wasa member of the Expert Committee on Air defence research.   The latter had put forward two proposals, one of which was so fantastic that ithad. been rejected by all his  scientific colleagues,including Sir Frank Smith;    and the other had also not commended, itself at all strongly.   At the last-meeting of the Air Defence Research Sub-committee mr Churchill&apos;s attitude had been very intransigeant;he had adopted, an attitude of pique and seemedto be about to resign from the Committee.   Hethought that the present proposal was notunconnected, with Mr Churchill&apos;s attitude.Personally he had no objection to a Committee of
Imperial Defence Meeting at which influentialM .P* s like Major Attlee and Mr Lloyd George werepresent.   At such a Meeting things could be said which could not be spoken of outside but whichwould convince any unprejudiced mind.    It would,however, involve a whole series of Meetings.   He had some doubt as to whether Mr Lloyd George saw eyeto eye with Mr Churchill in these matters .   Asregards Papers, those attending the Meeting wouldbe Privy Counsellors and would be given access toall necessary documents.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairsreca.called the precedent of the three-Party Meetingsprior to the opening of the Disarmament Conferencein 19-32, at which all necessary Papers had been produced.    It might be possible, on that analogy,if thought desirable, to arrive at a. common policybefore the Meetings of the Assembly in September.The Minister for Co-ordination of Defencedescribed how, during the previous week, mr churchill, at a late hour in the Library of theHouse of Commons, had unfolded his plan, after explaining that he now rejected the idea of aSecret Session.    In reply to his own question asto what would happen if Mr Churchill and his friends found the Government&apos;s attitude unsatis-factory, he had       said that they would then haveto tell the country or the House of Commons .Mr Churchill&apos;s ultimate idea appeared to be tocreate a great Office supervised by business men with a total staff of a thousand, an^ at a givenmoment, so to speak, to pull the lever and. switchthe whole of the munitions supply over to this new department.
The Lord Chancellor supported the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;s proposal.    For the Governmentto appeal to others for help would give their opponents a weapon of which they would not heslow to avail themselves, and would involveabdicating their responsibilities .    There was nohope of getting a united front for re-armament, andit would be deplorable to let the country thinkthat the Government, were not, prepared to face their responsibilities.After some further discussion  The Cabinet agreed to the Chancellorof the Exchequer&apos;? proposal that heshould inform those who had approachedhim that the Government would notrefuse to meet representatives ofall Parties in both Houses, or togive them information if a meeting was to be arranged with a view toforming a united front.    Sir austen chamberlain, therefore, if he decidedto follow up his proposal, should be encouraged to approach the leader of the Labour Opposition in thefirst instance in order to ascer-tain whether he would be willingto join in an approach to theGovernment on this understanding.
j GERMANY ANDTHE locarno treaty .[ (previous reference:jjk Cabinet 48&quot; (36), Con-clusion 6.)DANZIG.(previous reference:Cabinet 1(3 6), Con-1.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the recent Meetings of the Counciland. Assembly at Geneva had been the most exactingand. the most depressing which he had attended.The agenda had been t\vo-fold.   First, the liquidation-tion of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, which had beenaccomplished.    The task of the United Kingdom Delega-tion had not been made any ea.sier owing to the speech of the South African Representative, whichelusion  FK. SA-(3t)k. had been rather too strong for the occasion, andTHE FUTURE OFTHE COVENANT.(previous reference:Cabinet 34(36), Con-clusiori 4.)stronger than had appeared in the Eritish Press .M. Van Zeeland had proved to be a particularly goodPresident of the Assembly, and his last speech had done something to restore confidence.   The second question had been the Danzig incident, which had created much pessimism at Geneva.He himself felt that the international situation was so serious that from day to day there was the.risk of some dangerous incident arising, and even.an outbreak of war could not be excluded.   Thereasons for this view were as follows:-(l) The weakness of the League ofNations.(2) The weakness of Prance, which was generally recognised at Geneva.As examples of this he gave astatement made t^hiixi by a^well-&quot;gy^i inf ormed^Portugues e/Ctlopr o o ontat ive,IHw*wtw&quot; I      that everyone knew that France didnot count for much in Europe now:and the apprehensions of His Majesty&apos;sKji-ir(hi))L.   Ambassador in Paris as to the future in France.(3) The fact that armaments were growing/  .     stronger every week in Germany, whichwas governed by unscrupulous people.Evidence of their attitude wasfurnished by the speech of Herr Greiser,thePresident of the Danzig Senate,whose remarks on the Danzig question had. been even more aggressive inmanner than in substance, and whohad given the impression of a bullywho felt stronger than he had been
on the last occasion and. expectedto be stronger still on the next.(4) The present ax&quot; poverty of poland was another factor.    Colonel Beck,the Polish Foreign Minister, had adopted a stronger attitude a&apos;rterTJerr Greiser&apos;s second speech andhad made clear that he would not give up Danzig and. that poland was prepared, if there were a movement against the League HighCommissioner, to support him by force.(5) The \veakness of some of the importantlesser Powers, especially Spain.(6) The weakness of our own armaments,and the doubts that existed on our foreign policy.(7) Our anxieties in the Far East.Tn view of the above he could, give no guarantee of the certainty of peace even during the presentyear.    It was not that anyone, even Herr Hitler,was, so far as he knew, projecting warlike opera-tions, but that the various nations were in such aferment that some episode might precipitate dangerThe position was so serious that he thought theCabinet ought to consider two proposals:-(l) That the Prime Minister should seethe heads of the Press and., tell themthat the next f ew months ^s4&amp;t be decisive, and impress on them their responsibility for taking no actionwhich might make matters worse(e.g.,. comparable to the attitude&apos;   of certain Press proprietors, whichhad contributed to the likelihood,of the Italian attack on Abyssinia).(2). That the Prime Minister should seethe Leaders of the Opposition andcommunicate to them the facts of thesituation.Coming to our own policy, the Secretary of Statfor Foreign Affairs promised to circulate a Memo-randum by the Foreign Office within the next, fewdays.   The alternatives were as follows(l) To work for a new Locarno Treaty,and at the same time to declare a situation in which Articles 10 and16 of the Covenant would disappear .
The advantage of this course was that by these means alone was it possible to achieve universalityfor the League of Nations *   As theresult of his talks at G-eneva,however, he was clear that this plan would not be accepted by theFrench, Belgians and Little Entente,and consequently that it would smashthe League.(2)  To go back to the policy of the geneva. Protocol.This policy had the support ofMr Winston Churchill, and probablyof the Labour Opposition Party, buthe himself did not  think that thecountry would back it .Consequently it appeared necessary to choose betweenthe first course, which involved smashing the League,and something on the lines of the French proposal infavour of a series of regional obligations combined with economic sanctions to be imposed on an aggressorby the States that were not members of that particularregional arrangement.As to the proposed Erussels meeting, the idea was that M. Van Zeeland and the United KingdomGovernment should press^Germany/^to be represented at a meeting to work out a new Locarno and to bringGermany back to the League.   The object was to getGermany into conference, relinquishing the Britishquestionnaire and asking them to come practicallywithout conditions .    If this was not done there wasthe risk that after the Olympic Games the powers would get further demands from Germany. By holdingthe meeting they would to some extent keep theinitiative.    There was some doubt as to whether, atthe Brussels meeting, the French Government would bein a position to agree to a meeting with the Germanswithout conditions.   They might be under a good dealof pressure from the Russian Soviet Government in acontrary sense .   ^e^^^&amp;^&amp;^^iivre-wses......a^ljurygajqas 
ftH^they might be induced to agree.   M. Blum hadnot been at Geneva for very long, and the onlyunderstanding he had reached with him and M. DelbosO was that they clearly understood that the object ofthe meeting was not to establish (constater)thatGermany had not. replied to the questionnaire/M. Van Zeeland thought that M. Blum would comesome way to meet us.In reply to a question as to what. Van Zeeland had meant by the phrase &quot;PlacingGermany on the defensive&quot; (Geneva Telegram No. 89),The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs explained that the Belgian Prime Minister&apos;s objecthad been to get the initiative into our own hands.The Former In the course of the discussion,german colonies. reference was made to the likelihood that, in theevent of a meeting taking place, Herr hitler would    raise the whole question of the Treaty ofVersailles, including German colonies.     In that event, it was suggested it would be no use trying to push the subject in the background.     Oneproposal was that the safest course would be fall backon the line of helping Germany in the matter of rawmaterials, but the comment was offered that thiswould not assist Germany to whom colonies were amatter of amour propret     Another suggestion wasthat we should make perfectly clear that we could notsurrender the colonies.     No information was available as to the attitude of France who was responsible for the greater part of the mandated territories not under the Dominions, but it was thought that in order to obtain a settlement, france might be willing to make some concession.     Yet- 11 -
another suggestion was that it would he best to forestall the German demands by making in advance astatement of our attitude on the question.     TheCabinet were informed that the feeling in EastAfrica was extremely strong on this subject.The view was expressed that, in antipation of apossible acceptance of an invitation to a conference by Herr Hitler, the Government ought to make itsmind up clearly on the following three questions:-(l)    The future of the League of Nations.(2)    Our Policy in Eastern Europe,(3)    The German Colonies.Any conference with Germany was certain to be facedwith demands on these three points.been present at some of the conversations at geneva and had been in touch with the situation, urged thatif we were to come to terms with Germany, action should be taken soon.

He urged that the sooner we came, to grips with Germany the better, as at themoment Germany did not appear completely to appreciate her own strength and the relative weakness of others.
The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs reported that he had seen His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Berlin that morning at the ForeignOffice.      Sir Eric Phipps thought that it might be possible to get Germany to enter into a newLocarno Treaty, but it would be at the expense. of eastern and South-Eastern Europe, as Herr hitler would never commit himself as regards eastern europe.     We should then be placed in the same kind of moral dilemma in which M. Laval had found himselfwhen confronted with his obligations under theCovenant/after he had done .a deal with Italy in^/wviu, dh-cuK. e&amp;ilfW ^ Cirmtn.il&apos; h^u^iJ to europe,     If wo tried to get/^a B^s^peaaa? settlement./feerr Hitler would be sure to refuse,The First Commissioner of Works reportedthat there were signs that France was rather moredoubtful about her alliances with Eastern european states and some people were sceptical as to whetherthey could rely on any help at all from Russia.The question was raised as to whattime-table M. Van Zeeland had in mind for hisprogramme.   Was it -the idea for the Locarno Powersother than Germany to meet during July and then tosend an invitation to Germany to join them at brussels or alternatively that the Powers other than Germany should first clear their minds on thelarger questions with a view to an agreed policybefore meeting Germany?     The arguments on either side were quite obvious.Some mistrust was expressed of the plan of getting the Locarno Powers other than Germany tomeet with a view to inviting Germany to a new
conference on the ground that Germany was certain to regard it as a bloc of the four Powers with aview to agreement not only in the West but also inthe East of Europe.      This would be regarded as there-creation of the policy of -the encirclement ofGermany.     In this connection, attention was drawn to Mr. Newton&apos;s Telegram No. 207 from Berlin of the4th July in which he expressed the view that &quot;Theprospects of useful German collaboration would, nodoubt, be greatly enhanced if it were possible toextend the invitation to attend the next LocarnoConference ab initio and not merely as a soquelto a preliminary conference without Germany&quot;.    this seemed to indicate that as likely as not germany would not accept under such conditions.The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs pointed out the difficulties of invitingGermany to the first conference after Herr hitler had torn up the Locarno Treaty and neglected to answer our questionnaire.     It would axso be verydifficult for the French with their commitments to states in Eastern Europe.      It was suggestedthat to make the attempt through diplomatic channelswould involve most difficult discussions with france and Belgium and lead to delay.As regards the dilemma in which we were placed in consequence of our possible commitments in Eastern Europe under   the Covenant? it waspointed out that our defensive arrangements were insuch a condition that we could not face war inEurope this year and that public opinion would neversupport the Government in such a policy.     In these
circumstances, the proper course appeared, to he to&apos;clear up first the Mediterranean situation and then the Western European situation.      If Prance wasgiven an assurance of support if attacked, it mightdeter her from a forward policy.      In other words,circumstances compelled us to abandon the completeLeague policy in order to secure half the policy.The question was raised as to whetherif forcible action was taken by Germany over theDanzig question, that would not bring the Poles and russians together in conditions where Russia would beable to use her powerful Air Force.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Poles might compromise with Germanyand ask for a withdrawal of the High Commissioner.Thi&amp; meant more humiliation for the League ofNations which might be driven from one humiliationto another with repercussions on the position of theGovernment here.
In the course of the discussion a distinctionwas drawn between a meeting at Brussels for the purposeof concerting policy and a meeting merely to agree onan invitation to Germany.      It was suggested that themeeting might be confined to the second purpose and might be quite short.     The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that Sir Eric Phipps was in favour of the proposals made but rather doubted if the French Government could agree to invite Germany unconditionally .     He thoughtit possible that Herr Hitler might accept hut     hisonly object would be to free his hands elsewhere thanin Western Europe.The view was expressed that to continuedrifting was to pl.ay Germany&apos;s game.    Herr Hitler would see France going to pieces and the United Kingdom talcingno definite line while Germany became stronger.     Thatwas urged as the reason for the Brussels Conference whichwould also have the effect of making   clear the sincerity of our endeavours to come to an agreement onthe future organisation of Europe and of removing, allambiguity as to Germany&apos;s intentions.     At presentGermany was sitting back,refusing to answer questionsput to her and not appointing an Ambassador in London,while events were drifting towards some possibleepisode at Danzig.    If an invitation was sent it wouldbe difficult for Herr Hitler to refuse.    The main questionof difficulty at the moment therefore, was as to whetherthe Locarno Powers, other   than Germany, should meetfirst or whether Germany should be asked straight away.Members of the Cabinet were impressed bythe gravity of the situation in Europe as depicted by the
Secretary of State for Foreign. Affairs which rendered itthatnecessary/the Government should make up its mind on theessential problems already enumerated.      The objects ofBritish policy, it was pointed out, were first to securepeace in the world if possible and second to keep thiscountry out of war.       If Germany was seeking ahegemony in Europe she would not want to fight thewhole of Europe at once.    If we had been strong enoughand public opinion had been better instructed it mighthave been possible for us to guarantee peace In Europeboth east and west.     At present, however, .our defensivearrangements were inadequate and public opinion wouldnot support a policy of this kind.      Consequently it wassuggested our policy ought to be framed on the basis thatwe could not help Eastern Europe.   We ought, however, to resist by force any attempt against our own Empire erFlanders.      If these wore our bas s, it was suggestedthat our policy towards the future of the League oughtto be somewhat on French lines:    that is to say of regional pacts.   We ought also, it was suggested, to try and warn Germany against ^ioleiioe and especially thekind of violence that would bring us into action.If we met the Locarno Powers the object of the meetingought, it was suggested, to be to discussa future Locarno Treaty and Germany&apos;s March proposals.We should not exclude the Colonial question from theagenda but if Germany raised it w^ should make it quite clear that we would give up nothing.    If Germany refusedto attend a meeting then we should form a WesternLocarno Treaty with France and Belgium on the lines thatif Germany attacked them we should come to their aid andif Germany attacked us theyshould do the same.(The Secretary of Stat^ foj? the Colonies leftat this point-2 7-
The comment on the above proposal was thatwhile the Government should make up its own mind to reduce its commitments in Eastern Europe weshould not announce that we were unwilling orunable to help in Eastern Europe.    nwo stageshad to be considered.   First, contingenciesfor which we would accept definite coiimitmentsand, second, contingencies for which we would not accept definite commitments, but which -would beleft sufficiently vague to enable us to keepour hands free.It was suggested that this meant getting ridn ^,        , providedof the automatic sanctioryby . .  Artxcle 16 ofthe Covenant.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that the difficulty of this course was that if an obligation to fight in supportof the Covenant was ruled out everyone would assume that we would not fight . Another view was that the general assumption might be justthe contrary.There was general agreement that a Meetingof the Locarno Powers (other than Germany) at brussels should be held solely for the purposeof sending an invitation to Germany and bringingGermany into the League of Nations .The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairswiththought it possible that/M. Van Zeeland&apos;s helpFrance might be convinced.The Prime Minister asked what kind ofcommunication there would be with Germanypending the Brussels Meeting?   He pointed outthat the main difficulty was in persuading thSFrench.to France5) One suggestion was that the approach/shouldbe through M. Van Zeeland, but an alternative
suggestion was that we should also try to persuade the French Government .The view was strongly emphasised that thePowers other than Germany must not discuss among themselves the line they were to take towards germany at the Brussels Conference.    Before theydid this the Gernians must he on the scene.The suggestion was made that the present policy of yielding to Germany on every occasionmerely encouraged Herr Hitler to pursue hisaggressive policy, and the question was raised asto whether Herr Hitler ought not to he told thatthere was a definite limit beyond which we couldnot allow him to go.   Otherwise every surrenderwould bring us nearer to war.
