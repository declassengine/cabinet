THE I^ratio- 1.    The Lord Privy Seal, acting for the ForeignABYSSINIANDISPUTE. Secretary, who was absent indisposed, reported thereceipt of telegrams from the British Diplomatic- (previous   Reference:       Representative in Addis Ababa to the effect that cabinet 43(36), Con-^     Marshal Graziani had ordered the cessation of the useelusion 4 .)of the wireless telegraph apparatus in the BritishLegation for fifteen days .   To provide for theimmediate situation, instructions had been given tothe British Diplomatic Representative to the effectthat he should not resist if the Italians insistedto the point of -force, and. in that, event to complywith their orders.    mhe technical position was that hewas not entitled to refuse provided that other meansof communication with his Government were made avail-able .   He should, therefore continue to use his wirelessas long as possible, but accept the closing down ifthe Italian authorities insisted..    In the mee.nwhilethe Lord Privy Seal proposed to concert with theFrench and United States Government, which also hadwireless apparatus in their Legations, an^ to put allpossible pressure on the Italian Government at Rome.His impression was that the Italians had. been upsetby the difficulties of the local situation, and. moreespecially the cutting of railway communication.He added, that the British Minister, now in this country,had given the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs a somewhat gloomy account both ofthe Italian position in Addis Ababa and of the state ofthe Italiaji army there.The Parliamentary Under-Secretory of State forForeign Affairs, in reply to a question, said that sir Sydney Ba.rton had. not. expressed any particularanxiety as to the risks to British people in abyssinia, but had. remarked on the very bad state ofthe  Italian army.
In the course of a short discussion it wassuggested that to surrender to force majeure was nota very dignified position and that it aright- be better to agree under protest for the period asked.The Lord Privy Seal agreed that the BritishDiplomatic Representative should be instructed, to goas slow as possible, and that the main effort, in concert with the other nations concerned, would haveto be made at Rome.It was suggested, that it was very important toavoid an incident in this matter.The Cabinet agreed  That the question should, be treatedas one affecting all the Legationsconcerned, and that the BritishDiplomatic Representative at addis ababa should be so informed, and told not to give up his rights withoutprotest, but: to avoid, an incident inwhich he would be isolated from theother Legations concerned .
GERMANY AND 2 . The Lord Privy Seal reported that no news hadTT-TE locarno treaty. been received a boat the proposed Brussels Conferencebeyond the telegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador ina&apos;previous reference:       Erussels No .52 of the 8th July (already circulated),Cabinet 50(36), Con-i      in which he stated that the first reaction of the elusion 2 .)Eelgian Prime Minister and Minister for ForeignTT-TE MEDITER-   Affairs to the message from the Secretary of StateRANEAN.for Foreign Affairs had been favourable and that the(previous reference:      former would, set to work to approach the FrenchCabinet 50(-36). Con-     Government forthwith,elusion 3.). In this connection the First Lord-o^ the Admiralty* ixlyC)^&apos;^0^ ^^ention to a telegram from Sir Eric Drummond(Rome Telegram &quot;To ,434 of the 7th July)  referring t-the possibility that it might be advisable for him tohave a frank talk with the Minister for ForeignAffairs with a view to modifying the unfavourableItalian attitude towards attending the proposedErussels Conference.    If that proposal were followed up he suggested, that some use might be made of thefact that all three Defence Services were returningmore or less to their normal distribution of forcesin the Mediterranean, which might be a useful element in any conversations on the subject.The Lord Privy Seal promised to make a note ofthat, suggestion.The Secretary of State for ;;/ar again referred,to the desire he had expressed, at. the last Meetingof the Cabinet to withdraw troops from Mersa Matruh.The*Lord Privy Seal was-under the impression that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs haddealt with the matter before he left London.    Hepromised, however, to make enquiry.
THE ANGLO-EGYPT IANTREATY NEGO-TIATIONS .The Sudan.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(3 6),  Con-clusion 9.)3 . The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Lord Privy Seal, acting for the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-192 (36)), callingthe attention of his colleagues to the third para-graph and foot-note of the dra^t Article relatingto the Sudan, printed as Annex A to CP.-176 (36).The Governor-General of the Sudan had represented that this Article as at present drafted, with theaddition of the proposed agreed initialled minute,restricted his power to employ persons of nationali-ties other than Sudanese, British and Egyptian to employment in &quot;minor technical posts&quot;   a phrasewhich.might give rise in practice to difficultiesof interpretation.   He had therefore suggested thatit would be preferable, from the point of view ofthe Sudan Government, either to insert the word&quot;usually&quot; or &quot;normally&quot; between &quot;will&quot; and &quot;select&quot;in paragraph 3, or to substitute in the agreedinitialled minute the phrase &quot;special posts&quot; forthe words &quot;minor technical posts&quot; .    The Lord privy seal was in agreement with this suggestion, andsought Cabinet authority to instruct ^is Majesty&apos;sHigh Commissioner to adopt, whichever of the abovesmall amendments he considered would be the more readily acceptable to the Egyptian Delegation.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Lord. Privy Seal in CP.-192(36) as summarised above ,
THE OLYMPIC 4. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet thatGAM.ES ,during the Olympic Games a decision would ^e takenF.R.53(3t)tc.   as to where the Games were to be held in 1940.   TheBritish Committee, who, he understood, had been in communication with the Lord Mayor, was contemplatingproposing London.   He was informed that the foreign secretary had originally taken the view that this wasnot a matter for the Government.    It now transpired,however, that the Japanese were anxious that the Gamesshould, be held in Japan, and it was thought that theywould, resent, a proposal that they should be held inthis country,   me Foreign Secretary- inclined to theview that for the British to withhold their proposal might be a useful gesture towards the Japanese  though their behaviour recently hardly perhapsentitled, the,., to such a gesture .   Nevertheless he offered a suggestion that, with a view to doingsomething to improve relations, it might be a goodplan to give a hint to the British Committee not topress the matter .   He understood that Finland also would suggest Helsingfors as the place for the nextGames .In the course of a short discussion it wassuggested, that to hold the Games in London was not altogether desirable, partly because awkwardincidents were apt to arise, and partly because theBritish people, whose attitude (unlike the Germans)was not under Government, control, might, make demonstra-tions against the athletes of certain nations.There was, perhaps, even an element of danger in theproposal.The Cabinet agree^  that the Lord. Privy Seal should beasked to take appropriate steps togive the British Committee a hint notto put forward the proposal for holdingthe Olympic Games in London.
LEAGUE OP NATIONS .     5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested.Future of the that a Cabinet Committee should consider the questionCovenant .of the future of the- Covenant, which had been raised(Previous at the last Meeting, as it was important to the reference:Cabinet 50 Cabinet to have all the material&apos; for a decision on(3 6), Con-clusion s.)       the subject before the Recess.F R ^JT (&quot;bb*) SL   y &apos;        The Lord Privy Seal said that a. Memorandum bythe Foreign Office, setting forth the various possi-bilities , would, be available before the end of theweek.The First Commissioner of /Vorks recalled thatthe Assembly wished to have written statements fromthe various Governments before the Assembly met.Time would also be required, for consultation with theDominions.   mhe matter ought, therefore, to beconsidered as soon as possible .The Prime Minister recalled that the date ofthe meeting o^ the Assembly of the League had been postponed, until September 21st .   TJre agreed that thesubject should be examined at once, as there was agood  deal of preliminary work to be done;    but, even so, he thought it would, be necessary for the Cabinetto hold one or two Meetings in the second week inSeptember.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That, the question of the future ofthe Covenant should be consideredby the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy: &apos;(b) That the Foreign Office memorandum should be circulated, to the committee as soon as possible.(NOTE.:    See also the following Conclusion,where the question of the Germandesire for colonies was referredto the same Committee.The Prime Minister instructed, theSecretary that, the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies, the President ofthe Board of Trade an^ the First Lord
of the Admiralty should, be added tothe Committee on Foreign Policy, .the composition of which, therefore,would, now he a? follows :-The Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Lord President       the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The .

THE FORMER 6 . The Lord Privy Seal said that he was informedGERMANCOLONIES. that the Report of the Sub-Committee on the. ex-german colonies was on the Agenda for the Committee of(Previous *Reference: Imperial Defence Meeting on the following day.    It had cabinet 50(36),  Con-        been suggested to him that consideration by someOlusion 2 .)smaller body in the first instance was desirable .F. R. 5o(3t) 4 rp-^g main difficulty was that if any formal considera-tion was to be given to the subject it would renderinvalid the answer that had been given by the PrimeMinister in Parliament on the : 27th April that -&quot;We have not considered, and&apos;are notconsidering, the transfer of anymandated territories to any otherPower&quot; . (Parliamentary Debates ,Von. 311. No.73, Col.553:    alsoWo . 81.  Col. 1873) .The Cabinet were reminded that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had. also made a statement fon April 6th)in which he had drawn a distinction between colonies and. Mandated, territories andjad made clear that ademand for the British Empire to give up any of itsColonies had never been formulated, and, if made,&quot;could not possibly be entertained for a moment.&quot;T-Te had pointed out some of the difficulties of transferring a Mandate, and in this part of his speechhad. said, that -&quot;I cannot conceive that, any Governmentwould even discuss the question of thetransfer of its own mandate quiteirrespective of what, will happen tothe mandates held, by other Governments&quot;\.(Parliament?---/ Debates. Vol. 310. No. 65.Col. 2563 .)The Secretary of State for the Colonies saidthat the subject- was going to be raised, in the Houseof Commons that afternoon and. that he would have to; make some statement.After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed  (a) That   the Secretary of State for theColonies, in any remarks he might make on the subject should adhere as closely
as possible to the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement referred to above(b) That the question should be consideredby the Cabinet Committee on ForeignPolicy:(c) That the subject should remain on theAgenda of the Committee of ImperialDefence on the morrow, in order togive an opportunity for any observa-tions that the Committee might desireto make on the strategical aspects.
AUSTRIA. 7.     The Parliamentary Tinder-Secretary of state proposed Visit       for Foreign Affairs, referring to a matter that had)f the Archduketto. been mentioned at the Meeting in the margin, saidthat the Organiser of the Imperial Policy Group in(previous reference: Parliament had informed him that he had invited theCabinet 50(36), Con- Archduke Otto to shoot in Scotland and had asked toelusion 4 ,)see him on the sub iect.   He had. replied to the effectthat in the present, position he did not think thatthis would be in the public interest .    The PermanentTJnder-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had suggested that, it might be advisable to go ratherfurther, so as to put the Government in the positionof being able to say, if difficulties arose, thatthey had. discouraged, the visit .After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed  That the line taken by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had met the situation sufficient-ently .
EXPORT CREDITS 8.        The Cabinet, had. before them a Memorandum byPGR RUSSIANORDERS. the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (.C.P.-191(36))  on the subject of Export Credits for Russian(Previous .    .Reference: Orders.   A previous Memorandum (CP.-11 (34)) had cabinet 6(36), Con-4 shown the very unsatisfactory situation arising fromclusion 7.)the failure of&quot; this Majesty&apos;s Government to utilisethe balances in British banks belonging to the former russian Government,  commonly known as the &quot;Baringbalances&quot;, and. the advantages of utilising thesebalances for necessitous British creditors ofRussia.    The mreasury, however, had been unwilling to press Messrs Baring to surrender the balanceswithout a definite renunciation of the SovietGovernment&apos;s claim on them.    The reasons given in cp.-32 (36) for thinking that an offer of credits would not induce the Soviet Government to renouncetheir claim were no longer so cogent, and it seemed desirable to make a serious effort, in accordancewith the spirit of the  Cabinet Conclusions mentioned;in the margin, to obtain their renunciation in returnfor the offer o^ really substantial credits.    TheSecretary of State therefore urged, that the cabinet should authorise the three Ministers most concernedwith the question   the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade and himself - to consider the best means of ascertaining from theSoviet Government whether they would renounce their claim to the Baring balances in return for commercialcredits, and, if so, for credits of what lengthand. what amount .
The President of the Board of Trade recalled thethree decisions taken by the Cabinet at the meeting referred to in the margin, which v.-ere as follows :-(a) that the President of the. Board ofTrade should have authority to informthe Export Credits Guarantee department that they were free to consider creditsfor Russia in the same way as for othercountries, subject to Treasury approval and that the eighteen months limit nolonger applied;(b) that the President of the Board of trade should look into the question of the BaringBalances and at the appropriate stagediscuss the matter with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.(c) to take note that the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs was prepared to postpone the discussion of a loan for russia and to agree to the above con-clusions.Acting on these decisions, in co-operation withthe Treasury he had considered the whole subjectincluding the Baring Balances.      He had ascertained that Barings were not very comfortable about thesubject and that if the whole Balances were used theywould only give about 4d.   in the pound to the Britishcreditors.        In the meanwhile negotiations with theSoviet Government(had continued and they were nooringnegotiators had been induced to&apos;&quot;dipoffl some very diffi-cult questions, but if the question of the BaringBalances was brought up now they would probably re-open these questions. He was particularly anxiousto conclude the -ag^smeat because large orders fromtherefore, that the Foreign Secretary would not press thequestion.The SovietRussia to this country were in sight.He hoped,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thaton the last occasion that this was considered therehad &quot;been two alternatives;      (i)    to give extendedcredits to Russia,  end (ii)   to give a loan,  some part of which was to be set aside for the Britishcreditors,      the Baring Balances being thrown inin order to obtain something for them.        The cabinet decision had been against a loan which would require legislation and which the Board of Trade had not thoughtwould^te-r4ng^t s-romrh^ The finalargument had been thst there would be much less certainty of recovery of a loan than export credits which werebacked by a reserve fund.      Although the decision hadbeen taken against the loan, he himself had stillhoped to get hold of the Baring Balances.    SovietRussia was now in rather a better financial position.They had become an important exporter of gold and were better equipped industrially so that they had not quite the same urgent need for credits.

The question he put to the Foreign Secretary was as to whether hewas proposing to accept the  6 million in the BaringBalances in final settlement of all Russians obliga-tions.        It wes clear from the Memorandum that thiswas his proposal.    Thst me fiat abandoning all hope,not only of our complete claim but of any further attempt at recovery.      The Government claims amountedto  1,000 million and the private claims to  250 million.Acceptance of  6 million on such a debt would bedifficult to defend in Parliament and he was notprepared to make the attempt.       Even if the Government
claim was put into the same category as our claims against other countries such as France, Belgium andItaly, to be dealt with at some possible future date,the  6 million would not go far in satisfaction ofthe private debt of  250 million.        His vie?/, therefore,was that unless the Cabinet were prepared to make thebest of a bad job and accept the  6 million in settle-ment of the Russian debts, he would prefer not to raisethe matter.The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs admitted that the Foreign Office proposal wasthat the  6 million should be treated as a final s ettle-ment.      Some of the creditors were in a very difficultcase and to them  6 million would be better than nothing.If no attempt was made to obtain these Balances,  theposition would be difficult to defend in Parliament.The Foreign Office did not agree that Russia was not pressed for credits as they could no   longer obtain creditsin France and might be glad to do the deal.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the Sovietwere going to get their credits anyhow.The Cabinet were informed also that the acceptanceof the Baring Balances as payment of the Russian debtswould not satisfy the Members of Parliament who hadtaken up the claims of the holders of small balances:also that the average M.P. supporting the Governmentwould not at all like the idea of a loan to Russia.The Cabinet agreed :-(a)    That, in view of the general trend of theCabinet&apos;s view, it was unnecessary forthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, thePresident of the Board of Trade andthe Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to meet to consider the best means of ascertaining from the SovietGovernment whether they would renouncetheir claim to the Baring balances in return for commercial credits,  etc.
That the President of the Board, of Trade,in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should he authorised/&quot;&quot;to proceed with theXtawwasoe-tlon of&apos; cm..(j -agaaooraoat with Soviet Russia on thelines he had indicated.
PALESTINE. 9*       The Cabinet had before them the followingrelating to the situation in Palestine:-A Note by- the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs &apos; CP.-178 (36))circulating to his colleagues aMemoranduin he had had prepared inthe Foreign Office to show thesituation in various Arab countriesin the Middle East whose relationswith the United Kingdom might beunfavourably affected by the presenttroubles in Palestine:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (C .P.-190(36))  containing a survey of thestate of affair? in Palestine inthe light of appreciations he hadrecelver&quot; from the T-Tigh commissioner and asking Cabinet approval for theaction outlined at the end of theMemorandum.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesmade a statement to the Cabinet in elaboration of his Memorandum (CP.  190(36)) at the outset of which he called attention to the Summary of conclusions in peragraph 38.    Since circulatingthis Paper he had received a telegram from theHigh Commissioner stating that he was forwardingby air mail a memorial emanating from all Arabofficials in the First Division of the Service.It would arrive in London on 14th July and if,in his covering despatch, the High Commissionermade further proposals the Secretary of Statemight have to come back for further decisions.Referring to the personnel of the Royal Commission,he now thought it advisable to add Sir WilliamMorris Carter,  an ex-Colonial judge who had dealtsuccessfully with difficult land questions in southern Rhod.esia and Kenya.      In addition he wasSit uat io n do q ume nt sin.(previous reference:Cabinet 48(36), Con-elusion 10.BK. 5Z66)5&quot;.......    (o.- 5 C^^)y.
anxious to have a K. C.   who would assist incross-examination of witnesses and in drafting the Report and, after consulting the LordChancellor, he proposed Mr.  Cyril Asquith.    as chairman, he proposed Sir Horace Rumbold whom he had already sounded.        The High Commissionerwas anxious that the Royal Commission should   -contain a Member of the House of Lords, and onthis he proposed to consult the Lord privy seal.      As soon as the personnel of the RoyalCommission was completed and the terms of *reference were approved, he proposed to make an announcement in Parliament.       He then wenton to describe his proposals as regards immi-gration as set forth in the Memorandum.In the course of the discussion, doubts were expressed as to the advisability of making apublic announcement of a policy of temporarilysuspending permanent immigration of all races into palestine from the date v/hen the Royal Commissionsailed until its report had been considered by theGovernment.      It was recalled that members of bothHouses of Parliament, who were by no means partisansof the Zionist movement, had supported the decision that order must first he restored.      It was suggestedthat the proposed announcement would be treated as another surrender to force:    and, as the RoyalCommission had to report within the terms of themandate,  they could,it was suggested,not recommendfurther cessation of immigration and the Arabs,encouraged by previous experience, would once moreresort to force.     Another reason in favour of
postponing an announcement was that it would hemuch more effective if announced on the Government1sown volition,after law and order had heenrestored, when the Royal Commission sailed.It was suggested that, the surrenderwould not really he concealed by the announcement that the Royal Commission would not be sent untilorder was restored.In this connection,   some doubts were expressed as to the precise attitude of the HighCommissioner towards this part of the proposals.The Secretary of State for Indiarecalled that he had already informed the Cabinetthat the Moslems in India were beginning to takenotice of events in Palestine.     Last month the moslems&apos; League had passed a resolution supporting the cause of the Arabs and warning the government against the pro-Jewish policy of the BritishGovernment.     He had received a fresh appreciationfrom the Viceroy which showed, that agitation was now being organised by Moslem leaders and that a&quot;Palestine Day&quot; had been observed by Moslemsthroughout India.      The situation was not yetreally serious but, as was apt to happen in India,might become so at any time.     He recalled, alsothat.some years ago the Moplah Rebellion had broken out in rather similar circumstances owingto sympathy with the Turks.     An unpleasantatmosphere was already growing up among theMoplahs on this question.     He, therefore,supported the Colonial Secretary&apos;s proposals, moreespecially as the Arab grievances were understandablemore particularly when Doctor Wei.?;manh!s proposals
for Jewish immigration at the rate of 50,000 ayear for 20 years were taken into account.The Lord Privy Seal said that theForeign Office supported the Colonial Secretary&apos;sproposals because they wished the question to be liquidated as soon as possible.Ibn Saud&apos;s offer to use his good offices in conjunction with the Yemen and iraq had been accepted.     He now offered to enlist Transjordania and Egypt,      The ForeignOffice welcomed the co-operation ofTransjordania but was more doubtful aboutEgypt, and the High Commissioner there had notyet replied to the telegram that had been sent.It was not improbable that these foreignpotentates would propose a cessation of immigration, and the Foreign Office would prefer that the announcement should be made in anticipation of such a proposal.Various suggestions were made as tothe composition of the Royal Commission, mostof which had already been considered by theSecretary of State for the Colonies.      Onesuggestion was that it was unnecessary to includetw,o university representatives and the F**ae4economist would now be unnecessary if Sir WilliamMorris Carter were added.The Cabinet were informed that information had been received from militarysources as to the criticism that is being madein the Near East of the weakness of our policy,which was one reason for not announcing the cessation of immigration,
The question was raised, as to why theHigh Commissioner had not recently mentioned the .question of martial law which, at one time, hehad appeared to favour if other methods failed.Martial law, it was pointed out, would solve thedifficulties   arising out of the attitude of theChief Justice.      It was suggested that this particular difficulty might also he surmounted by the HighCommissioner passing an Ordinance withdrawing thedecisions of the Special Courts from appeal to theChief Justice. .   ^ a   .The F4^^&apos;b^QmmrB^4!&amp;^B^^ -JMj3^!&amp; said he hadreceived a letter sent to him direct by the chief justice of Palestine and had replied suggesting thathe should either resign or accept transfer to anothercolony.The Cabinet were informed that the WarOffice could not make available all the reinforcementsasked for, but could find three battalions from malta, one armoured car unit from Egypt and a FieldCompany of the Royal Engineers from home.A number of points were mentioned on whichit was suggested that the Secretary of State for theColonies should consult the High Commissioner, e0g.(l)    That the available forces should be unifiedby placing the police under the orders ofthe Air Officer commanding who, of course,was under the orders of the HighCommissioner.(2)    That Senior Police Officers should beattached to general and local headquarters.(5)    That enquiry should be made as to thecontrol of funds arriving for support ofthe rebellion and as to whether this hadbeen made illegal.
That the High Commissioner should institutevery frequent broadcasts to counter theeffect of the Italian broadcasts fromBari which were still continuing.That authority should&quot;be given by the HighCommissioner for immediate action beingtaken by the Military Officer on the spot in such matters as demolition ofhouses.The Cabinet agreed:(a) To approve the despatch of suchreinforcements as the War office could make available to palestine.(b) To approve acceptance of the HighCommissioner&apos;s views as to non-adoption of furtherrepressive measures (CP. 190 (36),paragraphs 10 and ll).(c) To approve the earliest practicableannouncement of the terms ofreference for the RoyalCommission and the personnel.(d) To re-affirm the decision that theRoyal Commission will not proceed to Palestine until lawand order have been restored.(e) To reserve the decision as to theannouncement of a temporary suspension of permanentimmigration into Palestine duringthe Inquiry of the RoyalCommission, pending the receiptof further information which theSecretary of State for theColonies undertook to obtain as tothe High Commissioner^ view.(f) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should considerconsulting the High Commissioner onthe various proposals that havebeen submitted to the cabinet and are included in the abovesummary.- SI -
^HE KING&apos; SHOLIDAYABROAD.(previous reference cabinet 14(25), Con-clusion 2*)10. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe TJome Secretary (CP.-193  (36))  stating thatthe King proposed to take a holiday on the Continentfor a month from July 25th and would like to be relieved as far as possible of the daily burden ofsigning his name to large    numbers of documentswhile he is away, and raising the question whether any arrangements for this purpose, were possible.The precedents were not in favour of appointingCounsellors of State for this purpose, and a, furtherreason making the delegation of power to signundesirable was that it could not be done in thecase of Dominion documents, which would be sent tothe King to be dealt with by him personally inurgent cases.
