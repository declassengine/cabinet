JTES THREATENEDIDISPUTE IN THEISOUTH WALES^ALFIELD.1. The Secretary for Mines informed theCabinet as to the situation in South Wales whichhad arisen out of a dispute between the South WalesMiners&apos; Federation and the Miners&apos;  Industrial Unionat the Bed.was Colliery.    At this colliery it was oneof the conditions of employment that the workmenshould allow weekly deductions to be made from theirwages to be paid over to the Industrial Union.This practice was strongly opposed by the SouthWales Miners&apos; Federation, and on the 12th July amass Meeting of the Bedwas workmen had. passed aResolution to sign forms revoking the arrangement.On the 23rd July the Colliery Company informed theirworkmen that they would take no notice of the revocation forms in question, and on the 27th july Cone Llatidn Board Meeting was arranged, but in the interval the Colliery Company had resigned from the colliery Owners&apos; Association.-About August 10th. the revocation forms were distributed,  and on the 12th August a special conference of the South Wales Miners&apos; Federationdecided (l) to present the revocation forms (at themost favourable opportunity);    and (2) to hand innotices throughout the Coalfield on the 24th August,on which date the notices were duly handed in.On the 24th August a Deputation from the SouthWales Miners&apos; Federation was received by the UnderSecretary for Mines, when emphasis was laid on the substantial improvement which had recently takenplace in South Vales in the relations between employers and workpeople and the danger that this improvement might be seriously affected by the
Bedwas dispute.    On the 25th August, the Secretaryfor Mines had seen Sir S.  Instone, the Chairman of theBedwas Colliery Company, who had stated his disbeliefin the South Wales Miners&apos; Federation&apos;s claim that theyhad secured nearly 1,000 revocation forms, but had emphasised that in any case the &quot;employment of anyworkman who refused to allow the deduction to be made from his wages would he-automatically determined, asthe 33rstem of deduction was an express condition ofemployment.On the 27th August the Secretary for Mines had seen the leaders of the South Wales Miners&apos; FederationExecutive who had suggested to him that a secretballot under some impartial control should be takenin order to ascertain the facts.    The Secretary for mines had undertaken to transmit this suggestion toSir S.  Instone, but at the same time had indicated that the Federation should postpone their noticesif it were accepted,&apos;    the Federation had agreed tothe latter suggestion.    Sir S.  Iristone had receivedthe letter in question on the 31st August but up tothe present had sent no reply.    It seemed probablethat the Colliery Company would reject the suggestedballot.In reply to questions, the Secretary for Minesstated that the question on which the ballot would betaken would be whether the Bedwas workmen wished to berepresented by the South Wales Miners&apos;  Federation orby the Industrial Union.    Some of the men employed inthe Colliery lived on the spot, but numbers of themcame from a distance,  some from as far as 20 miles away.It was difficult to find a solution but he had formed the impression that the South Wales Miners&apos; Federationwere anxious,  if possible,  to avoid a stoppage.
The Secretary for Mines stated that no decision was required at the moment, but that ifany important development occurred in the course ofthe day he would at once communicate again withthe Cabinet.During the afternoon the Secretary of Minesreceived a re-oly from the Colliery Companyinforming him that they could not agree tothe suggestion of a ballot, and in a subsequent interview with their representativeshe was unable to -oersuade them to change their minds.

2.     With reference to the conclhsjon mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before them (i)  aMemorandum (Paper CP. 228 (36)) by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs containing the draftof the basis for a speech by the United kingdom delegate at the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly.Txiis draft had been revised in the light of thediscussion at the meeting of the Foreign PolicyCommittee on August 26ths    (ii) a Note by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs (paper cp. 256 (3o)) explaining the circumstances in whichthe New Zealand Government had, without any consulta-tion with the rest of the Empire;, communicated to geneva their proposals for the reform of the league in the direction of the strengthening of theCovenant, and the action which he (the Secretary ofState) proposed to take in the matter:    and (iii)the following Memoranda which had been considered bythe Foreign  Policy  Committee at their Meeting onthe 25th August last,-Uote by the Lord Privy Seal covering a Memorandum prepared in the ForeignOffice (CP.  210 (36)).Memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP. 219 (36)).Memoranda by the First Lord of theAdmiralty (CP. 213 (36)  and CP. 214(36)).Note by the Acting Secretary to theCabinet  (CP.  217 (36)).Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs covering the proposalsof the French Government (CP. 221 (36)).Memorandum by the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs (CP. 222 (36)).Memorandum by the Minister for Co-ordina-tion of Defence (CP. 223 (36)).Memorandum by the First Commissioner ofWorks (CP. 224 (36) ) .
The Cabinet were informed that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs had submitted a preliminary draft of the statement of policy to bemade at the Meeting of the Assembly to the ForeignPolicy Committee (see Paper CP.  219 (36)).      TheCommittee had thought that this draft was too definite and precise and it had accordingly been revised onthe lines suggested at the Meeting and was now inthe form set out in Paper CP. 228 (36).In the course of their examination of cp. 228 (36) the following suggestions were madefor the consideration cf the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs :Page 2, paragraph 4.    The view was expressed that as drafted the middle portion of thisparagraph might be interpreted as meaning thatthe British Government were in favour of the strengthening of Article 16.      While no doubtthere ,as no justification for such an inter-pretation it was very important that the languageused should be incapable of any misunderstanding.It was accordingly suggested that the middle partof the paragraph should be redrafted on thefollowing lines : -(l) The sentence &quot;Discussion,  indeed, might notbe confined.......... subsequently endunder Article 16&quot; to be deleted.&quot;(2) Insert in this Paragraph a. sentence indicating analternative result of League discussion underArticle 11, namely, that Members might proveunwilling to intervene effectively in a dispute.(3) In lines 11 and 12 for the words &quot;of the determination and ability of the principalStates to enforce it&quot; substitute &quot;of the extentto which the Member States are prepared toenforce it&quot;.(4) The addition of a sentence to the following effect &quot;In any case the best way of servingpeace is that people should know where they stand&quot;. - &quot;
Page 2, paragraph 6, lines 3 and 4C    For thewords &quot;contemplates the possibility of changes&quot;substitute the words &quot;recognises that the staticposition of &quot;boundaries is impracticable&quot;.Page 2,  paragraph 6.    It was agreed that the sentence &quot;It is not practicable to propose any alteration of its terms or of its scope&quot; should be deleted and it was suggested thrt words to theeffect &quot;It is the view of the British Governmentthat discussion but not decision is permissibleunder Article 19&quot; should be inserted.Page 3, line 2.    It was suggested that the words&quot;and checking tendentious propaganda&quot; should be deleted.Page 3, paragraph 5, line 8.    For the words &quot;thefirst step&quot; substitute the word &quot;steps&quot;, or alternatively after the words &quot;Sir S. Hoare&quot; insert&quot;.&quot; and end sentence as follows &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be prepared to support the taking of steps in this direction by the Assembly&quot;.Page 3, paragraph 5. lines 3,4 and .5.     It wassuggested that the sentence &quot;In their view&quot; to&quot;intact&quot; should be deleted.Page 3, paragraph 5.    It was suggested that a sentence should be incorporated in this paragraphon the lines of the phrase used by the Lord privy seal in the House of Lords on or about 28th Julylast to the effect that any attempt to put the world in a straight jacket would be &amp; mistake.
Page 3, paragraph S.    It was suggested thatthere should he inserted at the beginning ofthis paragraph the following sentence :-&quot;If His Majesty&apos;s Government have framed their observations in the form of suggestions ratherthan of definite pronouncements of policy it is because they believe that it is essential for world peace (?) that any changes, whether of formor substance, should carry the convinced assent of(?) the whold world&quot;.The Cabinet were informed that at the Meeting onAugust 25th of the Foreign Policy Committee, theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs had undertaken to examine the question of making an approach to germany in regard to the reform of the League apart from theFive-Power Conference.In this connection it was stated that Sir E.Phipps had been consulted as to the advisability of sending the German Government a possible invitation tobe represented in some way at Geneva for the discussionof League reform.Sir Eric doubted whether Germany would accept an invitation or send an observer to Geneva, but he saw no reason why she should resent such a suggestion.Attention was drawn to the action which had beentaken by the New Zealand Government in communicatingtheir proposals for the reform of the League to Genevawithout prior consultation with the rest of the Empire.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs didnot think that eny notice should be taken in anypublished statement of the action taken by the NewZealand Government in this matter.
The Cabinet agreed :  (l) To approve, ss the basis for the speech on the Reform of the Leagueof Nations of the United kingdom delegate at the forthcoming Meetingof the Assembly, the draft containedin CP. 228 (36),  subject to theconsideration of the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs of the various suggestions for alterations and modifications set out above.(2) To take note thrt the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was prepared toadopt the suggestion that an approach should be made to Germany in regard toLeague reform, and apart from the Five-Power Conference, in order to ascertainin advance, if possible, Germany&apos;sdesiderata in regard to the reform ofthe League as suggested by the Chancellorof the Exchequer at the Meeting of theForeign Policy Committee on 25th August,1936,  (see F.P.(36) 5th Conclusions,page 4).
 TING OP 3.     With reference to the conclusion mentioned inVL LOCARNO)V.L,RS. the margin, the Cabinet had before them;-(1) A Memorandum (paper CP. 220 (3b))by the Secretary of State for ForeignPluvious Affairs entitled &quot;Preparations for references the Pro,, osed Five-Power Conference&apos;latinet 55 wnich had been considered by the36), Con- Foreign  Policy  Committee at their:conclusion 2). Meeting on August 25th,  1936$    ande-R 57/^)7. (2) A Report (paper CP.  213 (36)) by&quot;   &apos; &apos;        &apos; the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committeeprepared at the request of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs on those questions containedin the above mentioned ForeignOffice Memorandum which had beenspecifically referred to theCommittee of Imperial Defence or which, in the opinion of the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee, had military implications.The Minister frr Co-ordination of Defenceinformed the Cabinet that the Report of the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Ccmmittee (C.P.218 (36)) was inagreement with the Foreign Office Memorandum(CP.  220 (36)),  except in one respect, namelyStaff Conversations.    The Chiefs of Staff had alwaysbeen opposed to such Conversations for the reasonsset Qut  in paragraphs 60 and 61 of their Report.Throughout their discussions the Chiefs of Staff had laid the greatest emphasis on the desirability fromthe military point of view of reducing our commit-ments to the minimum and of keeping our hands asfree as&apos; possible.&quot;The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that in their Paner the Foreign Office had indicated that this matter must be considered in the lightof the comments of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.&quot;
Some discussion took place in regard to question 8:&quot;Are Non-Aggression Provisions to be so framed (as Locarno was) as to reserve theright of any Party to come to theassistance of a non-Party which has been attacked by another Party?&quot;The question was what would be the effect of thenew Locarno in   such a case as the following.Assuming that the relations of Germany and theSoviet reached a point when War becomes imminentthere might be circumstances in   which as a resultof the Franco-Soviet Pact France thought that she should assist Soviet Russia.    In   such an event,if French troops were to march into Germany or ifGerman troops were, as a defensive measure, to march into France,  should we be under any obligation to take action?    It was pointed out thatin paragraph 49 of the Report of the Chiefs ofStaff Sub-Committee it was stated:&quot;In any future treaty we consider that weshould, reserve complete freedom to decide for ours elves whether we should, intervene in any conflict arising out of G-erraanaspirations or French commitments in eastern Europe.&quot;It was also pointed, out that at the Meeting onAugust 25th of the Foreign Policy Committeegeneral agreement had been expressed with the viewthat at some stage we should make it clear toFrance that we had no intention of being drawn into any troubles arising out of her Easterncommitments and that we must reserve full liberty of action in su.ch an event.The Minister for Co-Ordination of Defencethought that our commitments ought not to beincreased by reason of the Franco-Soviet Treaty.
However difficult it might be to secure this in thenew Locarno it ought to be kept in view as the guiding star throughout all the negotiations.The Cabinet adopted the views expressed by theMinister for Co-Ordination of Defence in regardto this matter.Attention was drawn to the very interestingarguments against Holland being invited to accede to the new agreement set out in -paragraphs 64to 70 of the Report of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee.In regard to Question 5:E I?. 4l^34j / ^       &quot;Should the Irish Free State participate inthe new agreement?&quot;.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs said that he agreed generally   with the Conclusionscontained in the Report of the Chiefs of StaffSub-Committee both in regard to the position if theIrish Free State remained within the BritishCommonwealth and also if she ceased to be a memberof the Commonwealth and we succeeded in negotiatinga separate treaty with her on the general lines recommended in C.I.D.  Paper No.  1161-B.There was, however, a third possibility,namely, that the Irish Free State might cease tobe a member of the British Commonwealth and thatwe failed to make a satisfactory treaty with her.-11-
In such an event he suggested that there might be considerable advantage in having the Irish FreeState as a guarantor.    He was,  therefore, on thewhole in favour of the Irish Free State participating in the new agreement and if she took the initiativehe suggested that we should do nothing to discourage her.    In the course of discussion it waspointed out that all the Irish Free State could askfor if she participated in the agreement would be toreceive in this matter the same treatment as theUnited Kingdom as set out in paragraph 18 of cp. 218 (36), namely, that she should receiveguarantees from France against Germany and fromGermany against France.    The Cabinet agreed;(l)    To annrove the Memorandum by theSecretar:/ of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.  220 (36)) and the Report ofthe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee(CP.  218 (36)) as the general line ofpolicy to be followed in the preparations for the proposed.Five Power Conference andto take note that the Report of the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee does not involve any modifications in the recommendations setview of the fact that the Foreign office have accepted the views of the Chiefs ofStaff in regard to the    question of staff conversations.(2)    That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to proceed accordingly and also to approach theGovernments concerned with a view to arrangements being made for a Meetingof the Five Power Conference at thelatter end of October next.out on pages 20
jpAIN.italian Foreignlolicy in theIpanish Civilar.IjpreviousReference cabinet 55(36),  Con-clusion 7).4.      With reference to the conclusion mentioned inthe margin, the Cabinet had before thera.-(1) A Note by the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs (paper CP. 233 (36))covering a Memorandum drawn up in theForeign Office on the question of italian foreign policy in the Spanishcivil war, which was considered by theForeign policy Committee at their meeting on 2oth August,  1936.      ThisMemorandum set out the political implications of the present situation,and suggested that some Member of theGovernment in a x^holic speech shouldutter a warning a&amp; to the kind of developments in the Weetern Mediterraneanwhich would not be tolerated by us;    the warning in question might be in some suchvague and simple language as;-&quot;Any alteration of the status quoin the Western Mediterranean mustbe a matter of the closest concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government.&quot;(2) A Note by the Acting Secretary to. theCabinet covering a Report by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee on the extent townich British interests would be affected and what action His Majesty&apos;s government might take in the event of Italy takingsome action which might upset the existingbalance in the Western Mediterranean.,(The summary/ oi  the Conclusions andptecommendations contained in the Reportof the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee isattached as Appendix I).The attention of the Cabinet was directed to thefollowing telegram dated 31st August, which had beenreceived by the Admiralty- from the First Lord.-(u As) I have at present no means of checking reliability of these reports andrisk of Italian negotiations for BalearicIslands may be remote I nevertheless thinkthat we must take it into account.      I would therefore be glad if you would inform foreign secretary that I consider it would be advantageous to adopt  suggestion made inForeign Office Memo, and make statement onthe lines that were discussed by ForeignPolicy Committee on Tuesday, namely that we(? regard) maintenance of status quo in western Mediterranean as of direct concern to us (?  .)      Foreign Secretary would of coursedecide whether such statement should be made in public in Great Britain (v or to) Mussoliniprivately in Rome (? but) if Foreign Secretarywishes to know my (? general) view it would bein favour of making a demarche in Rome ratherthan a public statement in (? Great Britain).&quot;
The Under Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reminded the cabinet that at an interview betweenkr. Ingram and Count Ciano on the loth Au  ist last(Telegram No, 558 of 17th August,  1936), count ciano had informed Mr. Ingram &quot;that he could give me most formal and categorical assurance which hebegged me to transmit to my Government that neitherItalian Government nor any Italian had had anydealings whatsoever with General Franco nor was there any truth whatsoever in suspicions that italy had done a deal or was contemplating dealing withWhites for the cession of Ceuta,  Spanish Morocco orBalearic Islands.      I told His excellency that I was grateful    for these assurances and would communicate them to you.      At the same time I would beg himseriously to consider the point that ItalianGovernment&apos;s delay was undoubtedly increasingsuspicions in the world, regarding Italy&apos;s motives.&quot;It would be possible without unduly emphasising thematter to take advantage of this communication,  andsend a reply thanking Count Ciano for his assurancesand adding the warning in the language suggested in paper CP.  233 ( 36) .After some discussion, the Cabinet agreed thatif the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs thoughtthat the present was an appropriate moment in which to convey the warning in question to the ItalianGovernment, he should be at liberty to adopt theabove suggestion, namely, that Mr. Ingram should be instructed to convey the thanks of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to Count Ciano for the assurances whichhe had given him on August 17th last, at the sametime adding tnat any alteration of the status quoin the Lesteru Mediterranean must be a matter of the closest concern to His Majesty&apos;s Government.-14-
IPAIN. 5.      The Under Secretary of State for foreign    -Affairs gave tne Cabinet a &quot;brief appreciation[he Generalxtuation. of the present situation in the Spanish civil war.Attention was also drawn to the report in theFK. 5/ (^C)^.      morning newspapers of trouble having broken outin Horocco and of the steps which General Francohad had to take to ease the situation.
6.      The Cabinet were informed of the steps whichhad been taken on the initiative of the Frenchntervention.Government to secure international agreement on non-intervention in the Spanish civil war.      MostEuropean countries had now agreed in-principle to observe non-intervention,  and also that the detailed arrangements for securing observance      of thearrangements should be centred in London.      Of thecountries which had so far failed to agree to the&quot;clearing house&apos;&apos; arrangements Germany was the mostimportant.      She had suggested that there should beno international clearing house system, but thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should alone act as a clearing house in the matter.      Germany had beeninformed that we could not entertain this suggestion,and had been pressed to come into line with the otherprincipal European Powers in regard to this matter.

As a result of the events of the last fewdays, the whole Jewish world, was in a turmoil.     Mr.Lloyd George and others were showing increased anxiety,and Mr. Attlee wished Parliament to be speciallysummoned  if any change of policy was in contemplation.When recently he had returned to LoncLon, theSecretary of State had heard that Nuri pasha had arrived in Jerusalem, where after discussion with theprincipal members of the Supreme Arab Committee hewas hopeful&apos;of being able to persuade the Committeeto call off the strike and disorders on the basis ofa memorandum to be addressed by him to the Committee,the text of which was contained in CP. 227 (36)  (4)and reads as followss-
&quot;The Government of Iraq, actuated by racialties which bind them with the Arabs of-Palestine on one hand and moved by ties of friendship and alliances which bind themwith the British Government on the other,deems it incumbent upon them to mediatewith a view to ending the presentdisturbances in Palestine, and realisingat the same time the importance of responsibilities thus cast upon them through such mediation trusts (1) to induce the supreme Arab Committee to takea resolution ending strike and all presentdisorders %    (2) to use their good of iceswith the British Government for the grantof all legitimate demands of the Arabs ofPalestine, whether such demands arise outof the present disturbances or are connectedwith the basis of general policy inPalestine.&quot;The serious part of this document was the&apos; concludingsentence, and if the document was published it wouldcertainly be regarded both by Jews and others as a directchallenge to the Mandate.The Secretary of State also drew the attention ofthe cabinet to Telegram (5)  of CP. 227 (36) from theHigh Commissioner for Palestinej-&quot;Nuri Pasha told me this morning that at full meeting of the Arab Supreme committee held yesterday afternoon all members agreedto accept his proposal of mediation for thetermination of the strike and disordersunconditionally,  and undertook within thenext two or three days to take all possible steps to ensure its acceptance by the localcommittees.I am not in a position to guarantee the accuracy of this statement, but I would urge that I be given authority at theearliest possible moment to inform NuriPasha that His Majesty&apos;s Government welcomehis mediation on the lines proposed in my telegram No, 637.&quot;It had since turned out that the statement in question was wholly inaccurate, and that the true position was as setout in Telegram (8) of CP. 235 (36), which so far from being an unconditional acceptance contained in its last paragraph the complete desiderata of the Supreme ArabCommittee whose &quot;alms&quot; might be translated as Parliamentaryself-government $    the complete prohibition of Jewish
immigration5    and the stoppage of all sale of lands toJews.As would he seen in Telegrams (6),  (3) and (9) of cp. 227 (36), the Secretary of State had at once entereda very strong caveat against the terms of Nuri pasha&apos;ssuggested memorandum, and hac  agreed that if Nuri Pashawas willing to adopt the modified draft of the memorandumindicated in Telegram (9) of CP. 227 (36)$-&quot;The Government of Iraq, actuated by racialties which bind them with the Arabs ofPalestine on one hand and moved by ties of friendship and alliance which bind them withGreat Britain on the other, deem it incumbenton them to offer informal mediation with aview to ending the present disturbances inPalestine,  and realising at the same timethe importance of responsibilities thus castupon them through such informal mediationtrust (1)  to induce the Supreme ArabCommittee to take a resolution ending strike and all present disorders^    (2) to use their good offices with the British Government inregard to such measures as the Royal commission may recommend for meeting the legitimatedemands of the Arabs of Palestine, arisingout of the underlying causes of the recent disturbances.&quot;he (the Secretary of State)  would authorise the HighCommissioner to tell him that he would welcome mediationstrictly limited within its framework.      It was true that so far as was known up to the present Nuri Pasna hadpublished nothing on the subject.The Secretary of State then drew the attention ofthe Cabinet to his telegram to the High Commissioner forPalestine (No. CO. 706 (36)) recorchng his interview with Dr. weizmann, and also the High Commissionerstelegram in reply, dated September 1st (Appendix III).
The Secretary of State for the Colonies&apos;only other recent information was not official hutit came from Doctor Weizmann and he (the Secretary ofState) had no reason to suppose that it was not true.It consisted of the following statement which had appeared on the 1st September in the &quot;Palestine Post&quot;-a .rrnoaiAjeaSy paper published in Jerusalem, and,according to this report, the terms of a provisional agreement between Nuri Pasha and the Arab leaders were as follows:-At the same time it was stated that theArab Higher Committee was not disposed to instruct the ending of the strike or the stopping of terrorism until it was fully satisfied that Nuri Pasha was authorised by the Arab Governments in his negotiations and until he had definitelysecured the British Government&apos;acceptance of these terms -(l)   A general amnesty to be granted in successive stages to all Araboffenders during the presentdisturbances.(2)   Suspension of Jewish immigrationduring the inquiry of the RoyalCommission.(3)   An undertaking by the palestine government that the RoyalCommission will recommend suchrestriction of jewish immigration as will preclude Arabapprehensions in regard to their future position in the country.(4)   That a representative of the iraqi government is to have the rightto appear before the RoyalCommission with the view of supporting the claims of theArabs in Palestine.(5)   That after the Royal Commissioninquiry the Iraqi Government is tocontinue its efforts with theBritish Government with a view to ensuring the carrying out of therecommendations by the RoyalCommission favourable to theArabs and to annulling such recommendations as are notfavourable to them.This document no doubt represented thepresent position of the Arab Leaders in Palestine,-si-
The Secretary of State for the colonies had taken advantage of yesterday&apos;s air mail to sendhis views in full to Sir A. Wauchope in a private and personal letter, the text of which is given inAppendix II to these conclusions.   -He (the Secretary of State for theColonies) felt that the Government had been placedin a most difficult and dangerous position as aresult of Nuri Pasha&apos;s intervention, particularlyhaving regard to the very definite statements ofpolicy which had been made just before parliament had risen at the end of last July.     In his view, itwas imperative that the authority and prestige of theGovernment of Palestine should be re-asserted withoutany delay.     This meant that the British troopsin Palestine must be very substantially reinforcedand that Martial Law must be proclaimed possiblythroughout Palestine, but at any rate in certain parts of that country.The Secretary of State for the Coloniesthen   read to the Cabinet a letter which he hadreceived from Mr. Lloyd George expressing great anxiety at the rumoured character of Nuri Pasha&apos;smediation and the reversal of policy involved in thePasha&apos;s proposals:    a policy which had hithertoreceived Mr. Lloyd George&apos;s enthusiastic support.(At this point (approximately 1.0 p.m.) theCabinet adjourned and resumed their meetingat 1.45 p.m. when, with the exception of thePresident of the Board of Trade, the attendance was as at the meeting in the morning.)The Secretary of State for the Coloniesread to the Cabinet a letter which he had receivedfrom Sir A. Wauchope dealing with the question of the command of the forces in Palestine and of the nature
of the reinforcements which would &quot;be required in theevent of it being decided to adopt a policy designed tosubdue lawlessness in the shortest space of time.The Secretary of State observed that the questionsfraised in this letter would have to be examined by the secretaries of State for War and Air and the other ministers directly concerned.Lord Granborne read to the Cabinet the note of an interview between Mr. Rendeland the Representative in London if Ibn Saud.      (Forthe text of this note see Appendix IV.)The Secretary of State for India said thathe had examined this question from the point of viewof its repercussions on Moslem countries adjacent to palestine and on Moslem opinion in India and he had from time to time kept the Cabinet informed of theeffect of their Palestinian policy on India.     So farin thatthat effect had been satisfactory the Moslemsas a whole seriously       in spite ofin India/had not re-acted adversely to ii^.     fieee&amp;%Ay,attempts by agitators to foment trouble.    Recently,however, representatives of Moderate and Loyal MoslemIndian opinion were becoming increasingly disturbedand they had been pressing the Viceroy to receive adeputation in order to ascertain precisely what thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government was.     So far theViceroy had refused to receive a deputation, but he might have to alter this decision in view of theheavy pressure to which he was being subjected.It was because of the repercussions towhich he had referred that he had urged the Cabinetin July to come to some settlement with the Arabs,even if that settlement involved some kind of anIf embargo on Jewish immigration.     At that time, theSecretary of State for the Colonies had not dissentedfrom this suggestion,, but the Cabinet, as a whole, had
thought that any such-change of policy would, he regarded as a concession to Arab violence and had,at their meeting on the 9th July (Cabinet 51 (36)Conclusion 9(e), agreed&quot;To reserve the decision as to theannouncement of a temporary suspension of permanent immigration into palestine during the inquiry of theRoyal Commission, pending the receiptof further information which theSecretary of State for the Coloniesundertood to obtain as to the HighCommissioner&apos;s view.&quot;The High Commissioner had replied that atemporary cessation of immigration was in his opinionnecessary but had deprecated any announcement on thesubject being made at the moment when thearrangements relative to the appointment of theRoyal Commission were being published as this wouldbe regarded in Palestine as a surrender to the Arabterrorists.The Secretary of State for India reminded theCabinet that the iirabs were profoundly disturbed at theprospect of losing their lands and that they would not regard any settlement as satisfactory unless the rootcauses of the present trouble were thoroughly investi-gated and. remedied.     He agreed that the situation had deteriorated and pointed out that in his Memorandum(CP. 225 (56)) the Secretary of State for the colonies had suggested three possible courses :(l) The continuance of our present policy on itspresent lines and methods of action.He (Lord Zetland) d.id not differ from the view thatthis policy had no prospect of success.(2) The granting of concessions to the Arabsbut &quot;not........of such a nature as to givethe impression of yielding in face of violence and disorder which we have been unable otherwiseto end&quot;.
and (5) Ruthless action involving the &quot;bombing of villages and towns after due notice to the inhabitants, and the impositionof Martial Law over at least a largepert of the country.He (the Secretary of State for India) wished to say asdefinitely as he could that he hoped that the cabinet would not adopt Policy (3) which would have disastrous consequences in India and the other Moslem countriesadjacent to Palestine and could only result, as theHigh Commissioner had repeatedly warned the Cabinet, inimposing severe suffering on many innocent people andby so doing greatly intensifying the already bitterfeeling in town and country and leaving the problemquite unsolved as regards the future.With regard to (l) he (the Secretary of State)agreed with the High Commissioner that the continuance ofour present policy would not bring the trouble to anend and he therefore came back to (2) which in effect was very similar to the proposal which had been made inJuly 1;st.    Since that time much had happened, includingthe appearance of Nuri    Pasha, who had played a part inthis matter which was very disquieting in that he, theForeign Minister of a foreign country, was proposing to act as a mediator between His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the inhabitants of Palestine and to make represent-ations on whatever recommendations the Royal commission might propose and to support the Arab cause at Geneva.All this seemed to him (the Secretary of State) to placeHis Majesty&apos;s Government in a highly embarrassing position.    In the main, however,  the Secretary of state had rectified and clarified the position in histelegramsto the High Commissioner which had been quotedearlier in the Meeting.    Nevertheless, notwithstanding
this difficulty, Lord Zetland thought that Nuri    Pashahaving played his pert there were advantages in hiscontinuing to endeavour to reach some modus vivendl.Personally he would not object to such a course, buthe confessed to being puzzled about the statementattributed to the Arab Leaders which had appeared in the&quot;Palestine Post&quot;,  and he agreed that if that statementreally represented the position of responsible Arabopinion,  the terms were such that no Government could possibly entertain them, and he was in favour of this being mF.de clear at once to the Arabs.    In the verydifficult position in which the Government were placedhe favoured course (2) and the continuance of NuriPasha in his efforts at mediation.     At the same time it should be made plain to Nuri   Pasha precisely what were the limits within which he could usefully function.Unless this course was adopted he feared that theGovernment might have to face the most disastrous consequences, both in India and in the Middle East.The Secretary of State for Air thought that thiswas possibly the most difficult question which theCabinet had so far had to face, but Nuri    Pasha&apos;sintervention, the declaration of the. Supreme ArabCouncil, and the publication of the alleged terms in the&quot;Palestine Post&quot;, together with the reaction on ibn saud of Nuri   Pasha&apos;s intervention had, in his opinion,made it quite impossible to continue negotiationsthrough Nuri   Pasha.It was very important to bear in mind that whendealing with the Arab Leaders we were not dealing withthose who could control the actualterrorists. So long as the lattersaw any chance of attaining their end the Arab Leaderscould not, on their behalf, accept an^y reasonable
terms and the opportunity for a settlement could, inhis opinion, only come either if we were to surrender or if the campaign was definitely to move in our favour.A surrender was politically impossible, both at homeand in Palestine and throughout the world,  and theGovernment were therefore driven back on an attempt tocarry out their present policy or en intensification ofthat policy so as to make it more effective.     He didnot believe that larger military forces or more inten-sive air action, or a combination of both, would,  in thelong run mean increased bitterness and bad blood.When in a very difficult situation auch as theGovernment were nov/ faced with, it might be better to employ sharp measures of short duration than mildermeasures spread over a long and uncertain period oftime.There was one other consideration, namely atpresent under the ordinary processes of law the sentenceson wrong doers were often inadequate and in many casesthe criminals escaped punishment altogether.    this state of affairs made the imposition of Martial Lawnecessary, and&apos; it was for consideration whether martial law should be applied in selective parts of the country,or over the country as a whole.      The same rules ofjustice would be applicable but proper sentences wouldbe imposed and the delays incidental to ordinary legal proceedings avoided.    In his opinion we should consider what rein orcements were necessary and how the troops could be most effectively used to attain the enddesired.-     As regards the supreme command of thetroops, the sole consideration should be what forces were going to be provided and how best they could beemployed.    If it was preferable that some seniorLieutenant-General should become the Commanding
Officer in Palestine he (the Secretary of State )would raise no objection, and he suggested that inregard to this matter the Secretary of State for War,the Secretary of State for the Colonies and himselfshould confer together.As regards air action, it was very important toavoid anything of the nature of &quot;frightfulness&quot;.There must be no bombing of innocent persons, but whenplaces, such as Nablus, had definitely been provedguilty of sheltering criminals,  orders for theirevacuation by the civil population should be given, and steps should then be taken to destroy selected houses.He would like it laid down that there must he noindiscriminate bombing of the civil population, butthat subject of this the military authorities on the spot should be given a wide discretion and if, in their view,  the best course would be to bomb the houses ofcriminals or their sympathisers, they should be at liberty to do so.On the main issue he believed that no other course than (3) was open to the Government, and he accordingly urged that we should reinforce the troopsin Palestine and endeavour by the use of militaryand air action to make the life of the criminals andtheir sympathisers intolerable.      He could not say how long intensive action would have to go on, but underthe present policy the action would have to continue indefinitely,and he thought therefore that we were faced either with surrender to violence or a fightto the finish.In reply to a suggestion that we might reinforce the troops in Palestine as proposed, ana at the sametime endeavour to reach some settlement with the Arab
Leaders, it was pointed out that this would involvethe calling off of the strike by the Arab leaderswhich was not practical politics.    The view was also expressed that it would be undesirable to transfer the ordinary administration of Palestine from theHigh Commissioner to the General in Command ofthe troops.The Secretary of State for War pointed outthat Sir A. Wauchope&apos;s policy, which had been imposed upon him by the Cabinet, had, in fact,failed.      We had been forced to send increasing numbers of troops to Palestine and the position had steadily deteriorated so thst we were now facedwith surrender to violence or with the adoption ofstronger measures.      Even if we were to surrenderwe should only gain a temporary peace.    It was certain that the Report of the Royal commission would not satisfy the Arabs, who would acceptnothing less than a complete cessation of jewish immigration.    When the Report of the Royal Commiss-ion was published, we should have to face all the trouble over again.      Every argument which had been advanced four months ago against the policy of a cessation of immigration to secure a settlement hadbeen much strengthened by events in the interval.    The negotiations with Egypt had beenhappily concluded, and this in itself was anadditional argument for resorting to strongermeasures.The fact must be faced that while it was outof the question to make terms with the Arabs whichwould be satisfactory to the Jews it was open to usto make terms with the Jews in.which in the.longrun the Arabs would acquiesce.      Sir A-Wauchope&apos;s-29-
theory that the two races could he made to livepeaceably side by side in approximately equal numberswas,  in his view, an impracticable dream.    He was ofopinion that the time had come for us to take a strongline and to send out from home a complete Division andto place the two Divisions which would then be inPalestine under an experienced Lieutenant-General.Martial Law should then be proclaimed and it was important that the G.O.C.  should be in supremecontrol and should not be subject in any way to theHigh Commissioner for Palestine.There should be no air bombing in Palestine.The inhabitants of the towns and villages had little or no control over the extremists who committed thecrimes,  and.to allow air bombing would merely mean the destruction of the homes of innocent people andthe driving of moderate opinion into the arms ofthe extremists and future great embitterment.He hoped that it would be possible for the Cabinet todecide that day to send out a Division and to proclaim Martial Law.
The Home Secretary thought that it was important to hear in mind that the prevailing impression amongthe Arabs was that the British Government were capableof being pushed back and would never resort to strongmeasures.      The effect of taking strong measures nowmight well be that in a very short tine the country would be pacified.The Minister of Labour said that he entirelyagreed with the views expressed by the Secretary ofState for War.The Lord Privy Seal took a somewhat differentview of the situation.     He agreed with the Secretaryof State for Air thct the position was one of verygreat difficulty, and he would h^ve founa it lessdifficult to acquiesce in the stronger action whichhad been proposed but for certain general considera-tions.      In the first place, he thought that it was extremely difficult to estimate the reactions on egypt and other adjoining Moslem countries and on india of intensified military and air action inPalestine.      We had seriously underestimated there actions and effects of the policy which we were nowpursuing, and the same might happen again under amore intensive policy.      He would, however, beprepared to accept, such consequences if he was satisfied that in the end successful reeults wouldbe attained, but he was not satisfied as to this.As he read the situation, we had not merely to dealwith bands of violent murderers, but with a sense of real injustice in the minds of the whole arab population.      This was a very formidable matter
which could not he suppressed by military or air action.     Even if temporary success was achieved,he could not see how this policy would contribute to a permanent settlement.      In regard to this wehad the very definite warnings of the HighCommissioner.      For years we had been engaged onthe very difficult,  if not impossible, task of getting these two races to live amicably side by side.      Nothing was more likely to defeat thispolicy than the intensive military action now suggested.If the Cabinet took a different view, and decided to endeavour to reach a settlement, heshould, have thought that such a policy could havebeen adequately defended on broad grounds such asthat, while we could no aoubt have imposed our willon the Arab population by intensive action, such acourse could not possibly have produced the permanent settlement which we had in view.Moreover, we had hitherto accepted the advice of Sir A..Wauchope,  and had relied on his greatexperience and local knowledge.      It was a veryserious thing for the Cabinet to adopt a policy towhich their adviser   on trie spot had raised the strongest possible objections.      In his view the text of Nuri Pasha&apos;s letter, as subsequently amendedsee Telegram (3)  of CP. 835 (36), appeared to beunobjectionable.      It might, of course, turn outthat the Arabs would reject a settlement on this basis, but if so the Government would then be in avery much stronger position.
The President of the Board of Educationsaid that he would agree with the Lord Privy Seal ifthe course he recommended would have resulted in afinal settlement.     He could not, however, ovelook the re-actions which a preliminary settlement on this basis must have on the final settlement.      It seemed clear that no terms, however favourable which wecould offer to the Arabs, would be accepted by themand he was driven to the view that the Arabs mustbe shown that their policy of violence and givingtrouble was not a paying one.   The position had beengravely complicated by the intervention of NuriPasha and, however strongly we might repudiate hisby criticsactivities, it would be represented^that he would never have gone so far had he not felt sure that theBritish Government would support him.     The policyof surrender to violence would leave the government without a friend in the world.      Those who werepro-Arabs were also imperialists and would regardsuch a policy as a disgraceful surrender.The Home Secretary thought that NuriPasha&apos;s intervention had done nothing but harm.It was a very remarkable thing that the foreign secretary of a Foreign State should have attempted to intervene between the British Government and those for whom they were responsible in Palestine.     He didnot see how we could possibly say that, in the presentcircumstances, we were prepared to consider the kindof terms which Nuri Pasha had in mind.The Minister for Co-Ordination of defence said that he agreed generally with the Secretary ofState for War, but he would like to go rather further.He believed that the imposition of Martial Law by itself would go a very long way towards solving the
problem.     Our experience in the Irish troubleshad shown that where violence and crime wererampant ordinary legal methods were inadequate .todeal with the situation.     In his opinion, theimposition of Martial Law might settle the problem in a few months.       He would like to see a greatdeal more done by way of propaganda.     Could notsome statement be made on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment setting out all that had been done bythem for the Moslem world in India, in the middle east, in Egypt and elsewhere?     This statement would clearly indicate our determination that the Arabsshould have a fair deal, but that if, by a certain date,  the strike had not been called off and violentmethods abandoned, Martial Law would then be imposed and Palestine would be placed undermilitary control and the troops there would be reinforced by another division.     If our policy could be announced on some such lines as these, hethought that there would be a very good prospectof an early solution.The Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that the Secretary of State! had instructed him to inform the Cabinet that he was ready to accept a decision that Jewish immigration into Palestine should cease, and had also asked him to stress the^yery grave re-actions on Moslemcountries of a stronger military action than was nowbeing employed.     At the same time, the Secretary ofState attached great importance to our notappearing to yield to disorder and to the repercussions of any such policy on Jews throughoutthe world.     In this connection, the american ambassador had recently informed the Foreign Office
tlv.it Mr. Cordoll Hull hi-d s^nt a warning.of tho very serious repercussions in the United States which wouldresult from any surrender to the Arab claims whichmight be prejudicial to the Palestinian Jews.Some discussion took place as to theprevious decisions of the Cabinet in regard to the suspension of immigration and the view was expressed that all that the Cabinet had done was to reserve their decision as to the announcement of a temporary suspension of permanent immigration into Palestineduring the inquiry of the Royal Commission, pendingthe receipt of further information from the HighCommissioner (See Cabinet 51 (36) Conclusion 9(e)).It was subsequently confirmed by reference to the records that this was the position.The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs thought that a more intensive military policy would undoubtedly have serious re-actionsin countries adjacent to Palestine,     On the otherhand, the adoption of the proposal of the Lord privy seal would be universally regarded as a surrenderand would unite the whole Jewish world against theBritish Government,     This latter consideration should be put in its proper place and he hoped thatin any declaration of policy we should make it quite clear that our action was in no way due to Jewishagitation and pressure.     He was very much attracted by the proposal of the Minister for Co-&quot;Ordination ofDefence that the Cabinet&apos;s decision should be announced as part of a general statement of policy.The Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposal would, in his view,in the long run be very bad for Palestine and would,in   effect, constitute an invitation to the violent
elements to repeat their practices on some futureoccasion.     There was no doubt that Mr. Lloyd Georgeand those who took the same view represented   world opinion in this matter and that opinion would behorrified if we were now to surrender to murderand other forms of violence..     He, therefore, agreedthat the decision should be to take the strongest possible measures to suppress criminal agitationand he hoped that it would be possible to pacifyPalestine with as little concession to the Arabpoint of view as possible.      The difficulty was how to deal with Nuri Pasha.     He might be toldplainly that we had never agreed to the suspension of Jewish immigration and that we should be-very grateful if he could persuade the ArabLeaders to call off the strike and condemn violentmethods.The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesthought that the situation had altered in the last few days and was reflected in the views which hadbeen expressed at the meeting in favour of a determined effort being now made to re-establishBritish authority in Palestine.     Such an effortneed not involve any frightfulness.       The militaryauthorities might undertake roadmaking on an extensive scale:    for example, a coastal road which is urgently required and would havevaluable military uses.     He had been greatly impressed by the offer of the Secretary of Statefor War to send a whole Division to Palestine.He favoured the proposal suggested by the Ministerfor Co-Ordination of Defence of stating our policy as a whole and,if this was done, he didnot believe that the situation in Palestine would-36-
be uncontrollable.     Every effort should be madeto get the Royal Commission out to Palestine as quickly as possible and to enduce them to report withthe least possible delay.     He thought that therewas some evidence that Sir A. Wauchope might be over-tired and the Government must be prepared togive him full support.
The First Commissioner of Works agreed with theproposal of the Minister for Co-ordination of defence that a general statement of policy should he issued,coupled with the announcement of the de&amp;x:atcn to Palestineof a Division.      It should he stated tru-.t Nuri pasha&apos;sintervention had failed, and that the Government   couldnot possibljr entertain the Arab terms.     Within a very limited time the Division should he despatched, and martial law proclaimed, and arrangements should then he made for internment camps and housing, which would he required duringthe coming winter months.     He was strongly opposed to the bombing of the civil population, and he hoped that steps would be taken by the Air Force to watch the desertfrontiers of Palestine and by the Navy to watch the seacoast, so as to prevent illicit imports of arms and ammunitionThe Home Secretary said that he had reluctantly beenled to the conclusions generally favoured at the Meeting.The policy of surrender might stop the strike temporarily,but could not lead to any permanent settlement.     Such apolicy wo&quot;uld, vitiate the proceedings of the RoyalCommission in advance, and would in fact mean that jewish immigration into Palestine would be permanently stopped.The Arabs would claim, and rightly claim, that t-.hey had won a complete victory.      If a policy of surrender wouldnot lead to a settlement, would the alternative policydo so?     On the whole, he thought that the chances ofsecuring a settlement by more vigorous military action were by no means hopeless, and he accordingly favouredthat course *The Cabinet agreed-(1) To re-affirm their previous decision...that law and order in Palestine mustbe restored, and British authorityre-established in that country.
(2) That no decision should he taken at presentregarding the temporary suspension ofpermanent immigration into Palestine.(3) That intensive measures, designed to crushArab resistance, should he taken, and thatfor this purpose the troops in palestine should he reinforced by a complete Divisionsent from home, and that at an appropriate moment martial law should be applied eitherto the whole of Palestine or to selectedparts thereof.the(4) That/details in regard to the reinforcements for Palestine, the command of the troops etc.,should be settled by the Secretary of Statefor \var,  the Secretary of State for Air andthe Secretary of State for the Colonies inconsultation.(b) That the measures comprised in (3) above should not include any bombing of the civilpopulation.(6) That the arrangements proposed should becomprised in a general statement of policy,the text of which should he settled at ameeting to be held at No. 10, Downing Streeton Thursday, September 3rd,  1936, at 11.30 a.m.of the following Ministers%-The Home Secretary (in the Chair),The Secretary of State for \var,The Secretary of State for Air,The Secretary of State for the Colonies,The Minister for Co-ordination of Defence,The Under Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs (Lord Cranborne).
THE SITUATION      9.     The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum byAT MEETHYRTYDVIL. the Minister of Health and the Minister of Labour(Paper No. CP. 229 (56)) on the position in MerthyrTydvil which could be distinguished from thr-t ofother special areas and which seemed in need ofadditional and immediate assistance.      Unemployment inthis area was abnormally high, and the physical andpsychological effects of the grave situation, forwhich bad local administration could not be held responsible, were becoming seriously disquieting.Legislation would be necessary to implement theproposal of the Royal Commission that the CountyBorough of Merthyr Tydvil should be merged in theCounty of Glamorgan, and this would involve a subsidytowards Public Assistance end some form of central control which should,  if possible, be avoided.      Itwas accordingly suggested in the Memorandum that immediate consideration should be given to theestablishment at Merthyr Tydvil of a Governmentfactory for work under the Rearmament Programme andadapted to the kind of labour which is available inthis district:    apart from the number of peopleemployed,  it would have a marked and immediate effect upon the moral of the population, of whom largenumbers are today giving up hope and &quot;becoming all themore bitter as they see themselves destitute in themidst of returning and increasing prosperity in thecountry generally.      Attention was also drawn to the wider problem:    a heavy obligation rested on theGovernment,,  in view of the new Unemployment AssistanceRegulations, to leave nothing undone to provide1 opportunities for work for the kind of labour available in all the hard hit areas.
The Cabinet were warned by the Minister forCo-ordination of Defence against encouraging anyfalse hopes in regard to this particular area which,for various reasons, was unsuitable for undertakingssuch as explosive cr filling factories.      It had beensuggested that a duplicate of Billingham might be located in the area and the Committee was nowexamining the possibilities.      The British OxygenCompany had refused to set up a factory at MerthyrTydvil on the ground that very cheap power was essential to them.     It was possible that the Companymight reconsider their decision if a subsidy was offered to them.The suggestion was made that in very heavilyrated areas, like Lierthyr Trdvil, some further de-rating concessions might be made, but it was pointedout that this would involve very contentiouslegislation.The Secretary of State for Tar informed theCabinet that he had received a Report from the WarOffice in regard to the possibilities of MerthyrTydvil as a locality for munitions and similarfactories and that this Report.was in all respectsvery discouraging.The Cabinet sympathetically received the suggest-ion of the Ministers of Health and Labour that immediate consideration should be given to theestablishment at lierthyr Tydvil of a Governmentfactory for work under the Rearmament Programme andadapted to the i-tind of labour which is availablein the district, and invited the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and the Service Ministers to look into the matter.

SECRET.APPENDIX.  I.Summa?&apos;y of Conclusions and Recommendations contained in the Report bythe Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (CP. 234 (36)).Summary of Conclusions.25. (i) Our interests in the present Spanish crisis are the maintenance (a) of the territorial integrity of Spain and her possessions, and(b) of such relations with any Spanish Government which may emerge fromthis conflict as will ensure benevolent neutrality in the event of our being engaged in a European war;(ii) Open intervention by Italy in support of the insurgents in Spain wouldprecipitate a major international crisis;(iii) The occupation by Italy of any territory in Spain itself would be detrimental to British interests:(iv) The Italian occupation of any part of Spanish Morocco, and particularly of Ceuta, would be a threat to vital British interests;(v) The Italian occupation of any of the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands,and/or Rio de Oro, is highly undesirable from the point of view of Britishinterests, but cannot be regarded as a vital menace;(vi) Any of the contingencies specified in (ii) to (v) above would be injuriousin greater or lesser degree to French interests;(vii) The conclusion of any Italo-Spanish alliance would constitute a threat,to vital British interests;(viii) The threat of effective action, other than action in a diplomatic sphere,to thwart Italian designs would involve a grave risk of war;(ix) Italy is the only Power whose forces are mobilised and ready forimmediate action. Her preparedness for the initial phase of hostilities, vis-a-visGreat Britain, is greater than it was nine months ago.Recommendations.26.   Our. recommendations may be summarised as follows : (i) The principle that should govern any action on the part of HisMajesty&apos;s Government should be that it is most important to avoid any measures which, while failing to achieve our object, merely tendfurther to alienate Italy;(ii) We should press for the earliest possible conclusion of a non-inter-ference pact in Spain, embracing France, Russia, Portugal, Germany,Italy and the United Kingdom;(iii) If no general agreement can be reached, we should impress on theFrench the desirability of giving no cause for intervention by Italy;(iv) We   should   maintain   sufficient   naval   forces   on   the   western mediterranean and Spanish Atlantic coasts to ensure that we have at least one ship at every port where the Italians have one, and thatat important ports the British S.N.O. is, if possible, senior to theItalian;(v) We should, if possible, get an agreement with the other Powers that anylanding or other action by armed forces to preserve order should benot only international in character, but also, wherever this is possible,preconcerted between the Powers affected;(vi) Failing such agreement, every endeavour should be made locally forconcerted action to be taken when occasion arises;(vii) We should make it known to Signor Mussolini that, in the words ofF.P. (36) 10, &quot; any alteration of the status quo in the western mediterranean must be a matter of the closest concern to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment &quot; in order that he may be under no misapprehension asto the consequences of any action that he may take to disturb theexisting balance.[13728a
01APPENDIX II.THE PALESTINE SITUATION.Letter dated 1st September,  1936, from the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to the HighCommissioner in Palestine.PRIVATE &amp; PERSONAL.Dear Wauchope ,Many thanks for your letter of the 29th.      I had a mostunpleasant interview with Weizmann and Ben Gurion yesterday and letters and. telegrams from General Smuts, Lloyd George, Americanleaders are pouring in accusing me of betraying the Jewishpeople, lowering still furtner British prestige, and surrenderingto murder and crime.      Jewish demonstrations start in differentplaces in this country this Sunday,  and our Ambassador in Warsawtelegraphs he is having a most difficult time there.      the mufti&apos;s proclamation arising out of the Nuri conversations hashad the worst effect everywhere here.      Quite frankly I fear that things have turned out in a way which makes it reallyimpossible for me to press my colleagues tomorrow to go as faras you would wish.      Also those fatal last eleven words of Nuri&apos;sletter already shown to the Arabs make the whole position false,as they;will be taken everywhere as challenging the actualmandate and as an admission if we give him any countenance thatthe &quot;general basis of our policy&quot; has been wrong.     be may haveadmitted too many Jews in 1935.      We may have been inadequate inprotectizig peasantry from losing their lands and homes.      We mayhave been slow to appreciate that some Arabs genuinely fear beingpolitically dominated by Jews in the future.     But that ourfundamental policy has been wrong I for one can never admit.eut lieutenant- Gene ralSir Arthur Wauchope,  GCMG. KGB. GIL. DSO.
I have a profound mistrust of the Mufti and all his works.I believe him to be not only bitterly Anti-Jewish but alsoAnti-British and a rascal.Now as to my present feelings.      I cannot recommend a date for the temporary suspension of immigration earlier than thedate on which the Royal Commission leaves England.      I cannot recommend that the Royal Commission should leave England until(1) the Arab Supreme Committee have publicly declared that thestrike is off as far as tney are concerned and (2)  a moredetermined military effort is made to round up the gunmen andmurderers and bring them to more effective sentence for theiroutrages.      I sincerely hope that men known to have committedcrimes of violence will not be amnestied.If we try and bring peace nere and now on the Nuri basiswe are bound to have the whole world of Jewry against useverywhere and their sympathisers in all parties here up against us.      Clearly the rate and form of immigration,  the land problem and the safeguarding of the Arab&apos;s political future are openquestions, on which concessions to Arab opinion will probably have to be made if the Mandatory policy is to go forward inpeace, but the authority of Britain in Palestine has not, in myoginion, been sufficiently re-established to enable peace to be negotiated - especially on terms that look like surrender - now.My colleagues may take a different view tomorrow, but inview of the way things have planned out in the last week and thetruculence of the Arab attitude and their failure to make anyeffort to diminish the crimes and outrages after Nuri&apos;s wellmeant effort I cannot -press an apparent surrender to violence.I have not hastily come to this view and all last week I hopedand encouraged you to try what seemed at all possible.I am sorry to have to write this.Weizmann would like to meet Nuri and indeed wants peace butnot on the terms proposed at present.      &quot;How&quot;, he says, &quot;can we
hope for any resumption of our work if the Government ofPalestine, hefore the Commission reports, concede in effethe major demands of the Arab extremists under threats oviolence and murder?&quot;He has gone off to Paris today to see LI. Blum hutreturns tomorrow.Yours sincerely,(Signed) W,  ORMSBY-GORE.)
APPENDIX III.CYPHER telegram from the High Commissioner for palestine to the Secretary of State for the Colonies.Dated 1st September, 1936.    Received 6.38 p.m.1st September, 1936.Most Immediate.Private and Personal.Your telegram private and personal of 31stAugust,    There are three alternatives open.1.      Round table conference. Arab leaders ofPalestine would almost certainly refuse to attend.    Thesuggestion would lead to False hopes.    It would beabortive because Arabs will insist on suspension of immigration and Jews will not yield on suspension.Fundamental questions of policy could not profitablybe discussed in anticipation of Royal Commission.It would therefore lead to further delay which is contrary to interests of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentand of Palestine.2.      To continue the negotiations with Nuri andthe Arab Leaders.    This will as you realise place usunder a moral obligation to suspend immigration now or a little later.3*      The policy outlined by Air Officer commanding in his appreciation accompanying my.secret despatch of22nd August.      This policy of cowing the countryinvolves to my mind:-     A.    The despatch of sixadditional battalions.    B.    Application of martial lawwith an army or air officer as Administrator.C.    A Ion.;-&apos;, and bloody campaign against Arabs ofPalestine supported by bands of armed men from SyriaIraq, and Trans Jordania.    D. Continued liability ofrevolts amongst Palestine Arabs backed by Arabs ofsurrounding countries.
It is true that Air Officer Commanding has suggested that bombing from the air vail soon cowthe country.    I see no reason to allow me to share thisview.    It is mainly based on results of air action inIraq..    The analogy is far from exact.The unweakened determination of the Arabs ofPalestine during the past four months of resistance toour troops despite loss of one thousand killed and wounded and economic distress is an earnest of what wemust expect if we start on ruthless measures whennecessarily the innocent cannot be separated from theguilty.    These measures will lead to attacks on Jewsentailing reprisals and counter reprisals.    Murders of jews already apnroach seventy.My views are therefore unchanged:    we should allowFuri to continue his negotiations, limiting his status as far as you think absolutely necessary,  and refusingany suggestions such as an Iraqi Bureaux in Palestine.This course will necessitate a suspension of immigrationwhich I believe to be right - in itself for reasons givenin your private and personal telegram of 25th August.The suspension of immigration cannot by any possibility have any lasting effect on Jewish national home.    The adoption of alternative 3 may well endangerits whole future development.Should Nuri be forbidden to continue his negotiations or should those negotiations lead to nothingthen only other course is for me to see Leaders as suggested on page 10 of my secret despatch of 22ndAugust but this will I fear inevitably lead to thirdalternative mentioned on page 7 of that despatch.    IfCabinet decide tomorrow to reject Nuri&apos;s mediation or
if his hands are so tied that there is little prospectof his succeeding then a reinforcement of threebattalions should be despatched at once.    The air officer Commanding agrees that this is needed.
APPENDIX IV



PALESTINE.



Attitude of King Ibn Saud.



The Saudi Arabian Charge d&apos;Affaires called on me this evening to say that he had received a long telegram from King Ibn Saud on this subject. The telegram recapitulated the various phases of Ibn Saud&apos;s own intervention, and went on to speak of Nuri&apos;s recent activities in Palestine. King Ibn Saud was evidently disturbed at these activities, the more so as his earlier proposal that Fuad Bey Hamza should visit Palestine had not been followed up. The telegram stated that Yasin Pasha (the Iraqi Prime Minister) had informed the Saudi Minister in Bagdad that the reason why Ibn Saud&apos;s intervention had not proved successful was that His Majesty&apos;s Government mistrusted Ibn Saud, but were ready to accept the intervention of the Iraqi Government.

2. I interrupted M. Zada at this point to protest most strongly against this entirely false and mischievous suggestion. The Saudi Government must be well aware from the course of our relations with them that we had every confidence in King Ibn Saud, and I wished to emphasise that we had from the first deeply appreciated the absolutely correct and indeed most helpful nature of his attitude towards the Palestinian question. I hoped that M. Zeda would make this point clear in his reply.

3. The Charge d&apos;Affaires then proceeded to summarise the remainder of the telegram, which was to the effect that the Iraqi Government had told Ibn Saud that a basis of agreement had now been found under which Jewish immigration should be immediately suspended, and an Arab delegation should be formed to carry on further negotiations on which the Iraqi Government should be represented. Yasin Pasha had asked King Ibn Saud whether in these circumstances he was willing to join the Iraqi Government in urging the Palestine Arabs to desist from further acts of violence. Ibn Saud had replied that he had himself originally


asked the Iraqi Government, as well as the Imam of the yemen, to join with him in such an appeal.     this initiative had led to no result, and he did not seewhy he should now follow the Iraqi Government&apos;slead in reviving his own proposal in a new form.It was clear from this part of the telegram that TbnSaud was puzzled and uneasy at the attitude of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards Nuri Pasha&apos;s recentactivities.4,     Mr. Sterndale Bennett and I explained thatYasin&apos;s account of the situation was entirelymisleading.     Nuri Pasha had gone to Jerusalem on hisown initiative and - at first at any rate - in a purely private capacity.     He had then put forward proposals in the name of the Iraqi Government which wereunacceptable to His Majesty1s Government.     discussions had been going on and were still proceeding, and a revised basis, on which His Majesty&apos;s Government mightbe prepared to proceed, had been communicated to NuriPasha, but no agreement had yet been reached, and certainly not on the lines suggested in Yasin Pasha&apos;sstatement to the King.     Yasin Pasha&apos;s message in fact was extremely misleading.5*     On M. Zada reverting to the subject of ibn saud&apos;s original proposal to send fuad Bey to Palestine,we explained that the circumstances had then beendifferent.     As regards Nuri&apos;s present activities, wehad not been sure how far they were not a sequel toIbn Saud&apos;s own earlier initiative.     We certainlynever contemplated the exclusion of Ibn Saud in favourof isolated action by Iraq, and this had been one of our main preoccupations in considering Huri Pasha&apos;s offer.
Nothing concrete had yet emerged from the presentconversations, hut as Sir L. Oliphant had recentlytold Mo Zada, we would certainly not fail to keepIbn Saud informed of any developments,(Signed)   G.W. RendelFOREIGN OFFICEo1st September, 1936*
