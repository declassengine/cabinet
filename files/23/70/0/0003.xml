l.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (H.A.-1 (32)) covering thedraft Children and Young Persons Bill.   This bill had been introduced in the House of Commons indummy before the Recess, and it had been provi-provisionally decided that its Second Reading should betaken on February 4th, 1932 (Cabinet 87 (31),Conclusion 1)   . The Bill was based mainly on therecommendations of. the Departmental Committee onthe Treatment of Young Offenders, but opportunityhad also been taken to embody in the Bill many ofthe recommendations contained in the Third Reportof the G cneral Adoption Committee.   The Bill hadbeen considered by the Committee of Home affairs at a meeting held on the previous afternoon(H.A.C. 1st Conclusions  (32), Para,l), which had agreed as follows:-(l) To reserve for determinationty, theCabinet the question of policy whetherprovisions relating to the   employmentof persons between 14 and 18 in&quot;unregulated&quot; occupations should,or should not, be included in the Bill.(2) To draw the attention of the Cabinetto the views of the Solicitor-general on the phraseology of Clause 8 (l)(i)of the Bill.(Summarised in the Finutesof the Committee of Home Affairs.)(3) To recommend the Cabinet(a) to approve the Children and young Persons Bill in the formof the draft annexed to H.A.-1(32), subject to -(i) any alterations resultingfrom the conclusion reached by the Cabinet in regard to(l) above:(ii) any amendments and alterationswhich may be agreed as a resultof the Committee&apos;s discussionof the Bill;(b) to authorise the Home Secretary toarrange for the publication of theBill in the form approved by theCabinet in anticipation of its second Reading being taken shortly after the reassembling of Parliament.
The Cabinet were informed that agreement had now been reached with the Solicitor-General as tothe matter raised in recommendation (8) above.The Cabinet agreed  (a) As regards (l) above, to omit fromthe Bill the controversial part ofthe provisions relating to the employ-ment o-f young persons between 14and 18 in &quot;unregulated&quot; oocupa-*tions, involving, they were informed, the omission of Clause 49Sub-section 3.(o)  Subject to the above and to any drafting or other minor amendments  in theBill that might be found necessary, to approve the recommendations of theCommittee of Home Affairs as setforth above.
2. The Cabinet had under consideration aMemorandum by the Minister of Health (E.A.-2 (32))covering the draft Town and Country Planning Bill,together with the following recommendations ofthe Committee of Home Affairs thereon (H.A.C. 1st.Conclusions (32) Para.2):-(1) To approve the Town and country planning Bill in the form of thedraft annexed to H,A,-2 (32),subject to any drafting or other minor alterations which may befound necessary or desirable:(2) To authorise its immediate publica-tion in the approved, form, with aview to its Second Reading beingtaken, as proposed, shortly afterthe re-assembling of Parliament.The Cabinet approved the recommenda-tions of the Committee of Home affairs as set forth above.
; DISAR14AMESTTPERENC B.eviousferine e:oinet 23) ? Con-iis ion 2 .)fx.3.    The Cabinet had before them the samedocuments as on the previous day, with the additionof the following Papers which had since been placedon the Agenda Paper:-The Resolutions of the Three-PartyCommittee (CP .-277 (31));The Report of an Inter-DepartmentalSub-Committee of the Committee ofImperial Defence on Preparations forthe Disarmament Conference (CP.-19(32)).In order to give an opportunity for raisingany points which might have been overlooked atthe preliminary discussion on the previous day.the examination of the above Reports was resumed,omitting any reference to the question of a&quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot; Treaty which had been referred to a Cabinet Committee and was thereforereserved for later consideration.GENERAL POLICY *after further consideration.The Prime Minister,/uid not share the view that had been expressed on the previous day that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s case at the Disarmament conference was ineffective.    It might be lacking in positivenew proposals, but the sentiment and the intentionbehind were excellent.   The Delegation ought toemphasise the fact that we had not waiited for theDisarmament Conference to begin disarming, and to describe the situation which had been reached asthe result of cur efforts.    In this respect wehad a magnificent case.   Whether other nationsbelieved us or not was not very material, providedthat the whole case were put and reached our own public.   That was the first point that should betaken up.   The difficulties raised in the Memorandaof the Ministers at the head of the Defence Services
would, he pointed out, be met to a large extentif we made clear that at the Geneva Conferencewe were not &quot;starting from scratch&quot; .   The Delega-tion might then emphasise that the real task ofthe Conference was to fill in the Draft convention which had been drawn up by the PreparatoryCommission.   They should press for the conference to get on with this work and for Committees to beestablished for the purpose.   While the sentimentunderlying the Three-Party Resolutions stoodunshaken, there might be points of detail in which some modification or readjustment was necessary.SUDDEN ATTACK.In this connection attention was drawn to thesuggestion in the Three-Party Resolutions (para .3)that the military forces of nations available onthe outbreak of war should be limited in such away as to make it unlikely for an aggressor to succeed with a knock-out blow.    Expert examinationhad revealed considerable difficulty in applyingthis suggestion.   The Cabinet were reminded,however, that in the case of air forces inparticular the menace was due in a large degree to their capacity for sudden and overwhelmingattack.   The principle involved had been Mr LloydGeorge&apos;s main point at the Three-Party Committee,and public opinion was likely to be sympathetic to his point of view.    It was urged, therefore,that the Delegation should be cautious in assuming that it was impossible to carry outthe Resolution of the Three-Party Committee.The Prime Minister summed up thatthe idea was a very valuable one.Only the Delegation could judge,in the light of developments at theConference, to what extent and in
what manner it could he applied.They would have their Expert-Advisers with them to give them the facts .   All that the cabinet could do was to commend the subjectto the Delegates and invite them to study the matter and to ask for aCabinet decision if they so desired.MILITARY AIRCPuAPT.In the above connection the question was raised as to whether the abolition of militaryaeroplanes ought not to be included in the listof recommendations of the Cabinet Committee   whichthe United Kingdom Delegation at Geneva would beauthorised to advocate (C.P.-5 (32), Para,5, and cabinet 2 (32), Conclusion 2 (i)).After some discixssion the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs drew attention to the recommend-ation of the Cabinet Committee on this subject inparagraph 74 of CP.-5 (32):-&quot;(a) That although the idea of abolishingmilitary aircraft is attractive, itwill not be properly effectiveunless some satisfactory method canbe found by which civil aircraft can be prevented from being usedfor offensive purposes:(b) That since proposals of this kind areat present extremely nebulous, theUnited Kingdom Delegation should beallowed to use their discretion indealing with these points as they arise, subject to the proviso thatif any matters of principle affectingthe defence of this country should arise the final decision must bereferred to the Cabinet&quot;.These recommendations were accepted as repre-senting the view of the Cabinet.suggested committee on the extent towhich Countries have disarmed.The question was raised as to whether theUnited Kingdom Delegation should not be instructed,when pressing for the establishment of committee as proposed by the Prime Minister, to include a
Committee to establish the extent of disarmamentaccomplished by ourselves and perhaps by other nations, in order to counter the propaganda incertain foreign countries that in fact we have notdisarmed.    In this connection the Cabinet were reminded of the difficulty of obtaining a reallyimpartial Committee, as its members must necessarily be representatives of some Government.The Prime Minister suggested that the objectmight perhaps be achieved more effectively ifapplication were made not to the DisarmamentConference but to the Council of the League ofNations, which could set up an independent expert committee on the subject..  He invited the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs to bear this suggestion in mind in case a favourable opportunity might arise to give effect to it.   He pointed out thatthe difficulty of assessing the extent of disarma-ment lay in making the proper allowance for the alteration in the value of currency.The Cabinet were reminded that there were twoforms of comparison:    one between one nation and-another, which gave rise to difficulty and eontro-versy;    the other between how a nation stood todayas compared with the past.    The latter was abetter test to apply.   Moreover, apart from Japan,it was doubtful if any great nation could comevery well out of such a test;    and this applied tothe United States of America more than to some other nations.The Prime Minister said that theonly course on this, as on othermatters, was to leave the delegation to take such steps as they thought fit in the light of the various documents and the Cabinet discussion.
SUPERVISION 0? DISARMAMENT.The attention of the Cabinet was called to thevery categorical recommendation of the CabinetCommittee (Paragraph 56 (b) of CP.-5 (38)) -&quot;That we should oppose any suggestion to apply any system of supervisionwhich might imply the right of inspection on the spot&quot;.It was suggested that the United Kingdom Delegationwould be in an awkward position if they had to oppose a general desire for some form of inspectionThe Cabinet were reminded of the failure of Alliedinspection of disarmament in Germany.   The cabinet were also reminded of the danger that inspectionwould reveal the extent of our weakness in mattersof defence.The Prime Minister suggested that therecommendations of the Committee mustnot be taken as hard-and-fast instruc-tions from which there could in no case be any departure.    If, owing to thedifficulties, strong language was usedin the Report of the Committee, itwould, of course, not be used at Geneva.He thought the right course was for theUnited Kingdom. Delegation to indicatethat it was in favour of some methodof checking disarmament if thetechnical objections could be overcome,and then to see how it could be worked out.    Possibly some acceptable arrange-ment would emerge.    The Delegation musthave a reasonably f?se hand in thesematters .The Cabinet agreedThat the United Kingdom delegation should have a free hand in carryingout^ in the light of the cabinet discussions, the recommendations ofthe Report of the Cabinet Committeeon Disarmament (CP.-5 (32)), on theunderstanding that they should ask fora Cabinet decision if any new question or principle or one affecting the safety of the Empire was involved.(NOTE: The Prime Minister invitedhis colleagues who were members of the United kingdom delegation at the DisarmamentConference to scrutinise theMinutes of the Cabinet withspecial care.)
4.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Model Treaty to strengthen the Means of Preventing War:-A Note by the Secretary to theCabinet (CP.-312 (31))  covering the following:-(1) An Extract from the draft minutes of the 254thMeeting of the Committeeof Imperial Defence heldon December 7, 1931:(2) A Memorandum by the Chiefsof Staff Sub-Committee(CI.D. Paper No. 1067-B) : /(3) A Letter from the Under-Secretary of State, MilitaryDepartment, India, Office,covering a telegram from theGovernment of India.A Memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-319 (31)) deprecatinga Cabinet decision at thepresent time against signingthis Convention.In addition to the above, which had been beforethem at the Meeting referred to in the margin, theCabinet had under consideration  A Memorandum by the secretary ofState for War (CP.-2 (32)) ;covering a Memorandum by the Chiefof the Imperial General Staffcontaining further reasons foropposing the signature of the model Treaty.A further Note by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-11 (32)) stating that,after consultation,in the lightof the Secretary of State for War&apos;sMemorandum and&apos; other Papers fromthe Admiralty and Air Ministry,with the Secretary of State for War,,the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs, the Deputy Chief of theNaval Staff and the Chief of theAir Staff, and after hearing theopinion of the Lord Chancellor,he and his colleagues did not feel able, in present circumstances, toadvise the Cabinet that the draftConvention should be signed by thiscountry,   ^hey thought that the proper course was to take no step in thisdirection before the outcome ox\ theDisarmament Conference was knowii.DISARMAMENT .The model treaty toStrengthenthe Means of preventing(previous reference:Cabinet 92(31), Con-conclusion 4.)
The Cabinet did. not dissent from the viewset forth by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in CP. &quot;1 &quot;1   (52).      They appreciated, however,  theawkwardness of the situation in which the Secretary ofState would find himself at Geneva in his inability to sign a Treaty of which the previous Government of theUnited Kingdom had been the main supporter.      Thediscussion was mainly directed to the question of how the change of attitude should be presented, if and whenthe necessity arose.The Cabinet were reminded that the form of theTreaty had recently been changed for the worse, andinstances were given of certain important respects inwhich its precise meaning was far from clear.      AGovernment could not be expected to sign or ratify aTreaty the meaning of which was open to doubt.Another suggestion was that, instead of leaving the matter until the Disarmament Conference, the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs might suggest at theCouncil of the League of Nations that the Treatyrequired re-drafting, and that a Committee should beset up for the purpose.      The main objection to thiscourse was the existence of the report by the ThirdCommittee to the recent Assembly of the League of Rations,a Committee on which the Government of the UnitedKingdom had been represented.The Cabinet were reminded that, as stated inthe Foreign Office Memorandum attached to CP. 319.  (51) ,&quot;Lord Cecil made it clear to the Committee in May thatit was not the intention of His Majestyrs Government toallow the Convention to enter into force so far as theywere concerned prior to the coming into force of ageneral Disarmament Convention&quot;,      In these circumstances
it was suggested that the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs .vould have a good case for pointing outthat, since in any event there was no question of ratification until after the Disarmament Conference,  thepresent Government would prefer to with-hoId itssignature, and that, as a matter of principle, they didnot care to sign the Treaty unless they intended to-ratify it.      (in this connection the Cabinet were remindedhowever that certain Treaties had been signed by thiscountry   on    the understanding that they would not be ratified until after the conclusion of the general disarment Convention).The Cabinet ?fere reminded that care must beexercised that the Government was not committed tosignature or ratification of the Treaty in its present form even after a successful issue to the DisarmamentConference,  since the Treaty was open to considerableobjections.      It was suggested, for example,  that thesmaller our forces the greater necessity for freedom of movement.Another suggestion was that the Treaty might bemade applicable to Europe but not to other parts of theworld.      The objection urged to this course was that theTreaty might conceivably be used to prevent the reinforcement of Gibraltar and Malta, which might thus beleft in an indefensible condition at a critical moment.The Cabinet agreed i (a) That the Draft Convention to Improve theMeans of Preventing War should notbe signed on behalf of this country before the result of the DisarmamentConference is known;(b) That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be given discretion asto the best means and the best time forexplaining the reasons.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs(CP.-331 (3D) covering a Memorandum prepared inthe Foreign Office on the subject of the amendments proposed to bring the Covenant of the League ofNations into conformity with the Kellogg Pact.The Secretary of State suggested that the cabinet should approve the amendments in the form in whichthey were drafted by the Sub-Committee of the EleventhAssembly in 1930.   He pointed out that the ImperialConference of October, 1930, had already recommendedthis course and that the Secretary-General was informed in February, 1931, of the previous Govern-menfs approval.    Several of the Dominions had expressed their assent.   But the amendments shouldnot be ratified prior to the entry into force ofa General Disarmament Convention.   The Delegationshouldof the United Kingdom, he suggested,/, be given a discretion to deal as seems best, but subject tothe general attitude authorised above, with anyfurther suggestions such as those referred to inparagraph 26 of the Foreign Office Memorandum.The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to paragraph.9 of the Memorandum attached to CP. 551  (J1),where it was pointed out that sanctions underarticle 16 of the Covenant apply to violations ofarticles 12,  13 and 15, and that as the scope ofthose articles would be broadened out by acceptanceof the present proposals,  there would result anincrease in the obligations of Members of the Leagueof Nations.The Cabinet took note of this point.The Cabinet were asked whether it was reallynecessary to reserve ratification of the proposed
amendments to the Covenant of the League of Ne   .ons until after the entry into force of a general disarmament convention.      They were informed that no other Nation,apart from some of the pominions, had taken this course.It was suggested, more particularly in view of the attitude that the Government had been forced to take on the subjectof the Model Treaty,  that it might be advisable to removethis reservation, which had been made by the labour government.The Cabinet were reminded, however, that this reservation,  though originally formulated by the lateSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Arthur Henderson),had been endorsed by       Imperial Conference.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs should be authorised to announce that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould adopt the same attitude towardsthe proposed amendments to the covenant of the League of Nations as had been announced by the recent labour government;    that they were willing to sign the proposed amendments, though ofcourse this could not be done until after the amendments had been finallyreviewed by the Committee, composed ofall the members of the League, whichis to meet during the DisarmamentConference. (CP. 351 page 9 (d)).
6.      The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to Unemployment InsuranceEconomies:-A Joint Memorandum by the ministers of Health and Labour (CP.-8 (38))prepared in accordance with theCabinet Conclusion referred to inthe margin, reporting on theworking of the transitional paymentsystem.   They reported that thedifficulties and complaints hadbeen less than might reasonably have been expected:A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C,P.-16 (32)) on UnemploymentBenefit, Anomalies Regulations, givingfull particulars of the working ofthe new methods.The Cabinet took note of theabove Memoranda.
