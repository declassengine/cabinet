1 INDIA.CabinetCommitteeon.(Previous&quot; Reference:Cabinet    54(31), Con-clusion 10.)1. In view of the present situation in india the Cabinet agreed  That the existing Cabinet Committee,which had been formed in connectionwith the Round-Table Conference,should be re-constituted as follows:-The Prime Minister,The Secretary of State for India,The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of Trade,in order to assist the Secretary ofState for India on such matters ashe might desire advice.(NOTE: The President, of the Boardof Trade warned the Cabinetthat he might find it difficultto attend the Committee, butit was suggested that on suchTrade questions as were likelyto arise it would often bepossible for him to be repre-sented by a substitute.)
3. The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the forthcoming League ofNations Conference on Disarmamentt-A Most Secret Note by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs(C.P.-4 (32)) covering a Memorandumon the British Position in Relationto European Policy, prepared bySir Robert Vansittart in response to a request by the Cabinet at theMeeting referred to in the margin:A Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs (CP .-5 (32))covering the Report of the CabinetCommittee on Disarmament:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Air (O.P.^10 (32)) on policy in regard to the Limitationof Air Armaments, covering a Memo-randum by the Chief of the AirStaff:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (C.P.-1S (33))covering a Memorandum by the ArmyCouncil on the Proposed Figures of limitation for Personnel andExpenditure:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (C.P.-14 (32)) on. Policy in regard to the Limitationof Naval Armaments&quot;.(The three latter Papers contained the proposalsof the Service Departments as to their respectivelimitation figures.)The Report of an Inter-DepartmentalCommittee on the subject of a&quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot;  (CP.-17(52)).The Cabinet were at a disadvantage in their discussion owing to the fact that/the abovePapers had been circulated only on the previous day and. hardly any member had had time to masterthe whole of their contents.    Consequently the deliberations of; the Cabinet were necessarilyof a preliminary nature.
The discussion took place under two principal&apos;,heads,  namely, the summary of the main features ofthe Report of the Cabinet Committee, set forth inparagraph 2 of the Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs covering that Report (CP.-5(32)), and the plan of a &quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot;,dealt with in paragraph 6 of the same Note.   Thequestion of a Mediterranean Locarno is dealt within Conclusion 3 of these Minutes.So far as the Report of the Cabinet Committeewas concerned, it was pointed out that the Reportdid not coincide at all points with the Report ofthe Three-Party Committee, whose recommendationswent rather further in some respects .While recognising that, in view of the short time that the Report of the Cabinet Committee(attached to CP.-5 (32)) had been in the hands ofmembers, there must be a further opportunity toconsider it, the Cabinet agreed  (i) As an instalment of its policy, to approve generally, and without pre-judice to any later decisions thatmight be taken, the recommendationsof&quot;the Committee under the following headings set forth in paragraph 2of the Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs covering(32)(a) The abolition of submarines(paragraph 64, page 15 of theReport);(b) The reduction in the size ofcapital ships and reductionof maximum gun calibre (paragraph63, page 14); - (c) The abolition of gas and chemicalf&quot;-R. warfare (paragraph 77, page 17),L-f-iSm i-e., we should support Article 39LSr7tp of the Draft Convention;(d) The abolition of conscription(paragraph 10, page 5);
(e) The principle of prohibitingland guns above a certaincalibre (paragraph 66, page 15) *,(f) Subject to discussion with theDominions, the principle of budgetary limitation, and,generally, of the methods of limitation contained in theDraft Convention (paragraph 18,page 6, etc .);(g) The establishment of a permanent disarmament Commission (paragraph56, page 13).The First Lord of the Admiraltyinformed the Cabinet that in additionto the above the Admiralty were pre-pared to announce their willingness to accept a decrease in the size of aircraft carriers after 1936.(MOTE: The above decisions were taken without prejudice to the foot-note at the end of paragraph 46of the Report, reserving therecommendations on budgetaryexpenditure (Article 29 ofthe Draft Convention) untilthe opinion of the Chancellorof the Exchequer had been sought.)(ii) That the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs, at the forthcoming meeting between the Cabinet Committeeand the representatives of theDominions in London, should be author-is ed to base his attitude on thedecision recorded in (i).-4-
3. The documents before the Cabinet dealingwith the idea of a &quot;Mediterranean Locarno&quot; werethe following:-&quot;the Note by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs on the Reportof the Cabinet Committee (CP.-5 (32)  ,Para .6) ;Sir Robert Vansittart&apos;s Memorandumattached to CP.-4 (32), paras. 34to 38);The Report of the Inter-DepartmentalCommittee (CP.-17 (32)).In connection with the proposal for the policyof a Mediterranean Locarno Agreement the cabinet were informed that there was very little prospectof a successful issue to the Disarmament Conferencewithout some further advance by this country.Such an advance was not to be found in the offer of a further percentage cut.   There was generalagreement that the strength of the three defence services had been reduced to a point where such an offer could not be made.   The recommendations ofthe Cabinet Committee as approved (see Conclusion(i) of the previous Minute:    i.e., abolition of submarines, reduction of capital ships, etc.,etc.)although acceptable to public opinion in the UnitedKingdom, would not produce any serious measure ofinternational disarmament, in some cases owing totheir unpopularity in certain countries, and in others for different reasons.   Consequently, unless some further inducement could be offered to other nations to disarm, there was every risk of (l) a failure of the Disarmament Conf erence; (2)the attri-bution of blame to the National Government, at homeand perhaps abroad; (3)a situation in which thiscountry would have to choose between the alterna-tives of (i) bringing its armaments up to date-5-
at great expense, or (ii) accepting a position ofinferiority to a Prance powerfully armed andexercising hegemony over Europe,    The proposalfor a Mediterranean Locarno had been suggested as the only means available for inducing france and  Italy to reduce their armaments..   The mistakemade in the case of a Locarno Agreement for which no price had been asked could not be repeated.The Mediterranean Locarno would not be acceptedunless Prance was willing to pay over price.    if she were unwilling to do so and the DisarmamentConference were to fail, we should at least havea good ease to present to the world.The Cabinet were reminded of one objection,although perhaps not insuperable, to agreements of this kind, namely, that the military events which would bring a military agreement into opera-tion invariably arose out of political events, andit was difficult to secure that we should be ableto control those political events.   As an example of such difficulties it was pointed out thatsupposing the German Chancellor&apos;s recent statement on reparations were referred by the FrenchGovernment to the Hague Court, and after a favours-able decision from that Court Prance invadedGermany, the Locarno Agreement might conceivably be invoked in political circumstances over whichwe had little control or even were opposed tothe whole series of events.The Cabinet were also informed that during thediscussions at the time of the London naval conference, 1930, the amount of disarmament whichFrench Ministers had been willing to offer
in return for a Mediterranean Locarno had beenineons iderable.An alternative suggestion was that, insteadof offering a Mediterranean Locarno, the british delegates at the Disarmament Conference should beauthorised to indicate that unless some satisfactorymeasure of disarmament were adopted the UnitedKingdom would cut aloof, so far as possible, fromEuropean affairs and concentrate rather on theImperial side of its external policy.   That threatmight be more effective, it was suggested, than thebribe of a Mediterranean Locarno.Two objections were raised to this proposalsfirst, that the Locarno Treaty made it verydifficult to cut aloof from Europe;    and, second,that certain of the Dominions were likely to resentthe latter part of the proposed policy.The policy of a Mediterranean Locarno was alsocriticised on the ground that it would involve anincrease in our&apos;military commitments, which were already greater than we v/ere able to fulfil, andwould therefore necessitate an increase rather thana reduction of armaments.The Cabinet were reminded that the UnitedKingdom had already given a pronounced lead inthe matter of disarmament by entering into theWashington and London Treaties .    It was essentialthat that great contribution should be credited tous .The Cabinet agreed  That the question of a &quot;MediterraneanLocarno&quot; should be referred to theCabinet Committee on Disarmament, towhich should be added the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of theExchequer.   mhe Committee would,for this purpose, thus consist ofthe following:-
The Prime Minister (in the Chair),The Chancellor of .the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,^he Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty .(NOTE:  It was arranged that thisCommittee should meet onTHURSDAY,  JANUARY 14,  19 32,at 4 p.m, in the cabinet room at 10, Downing Street,and that Sir Robert Vansittart,the Permanent Undersecretaryof State for Foreign affairs should be invited to attend,]-8-
MEET ING4.The Cabinet agreed  meet again on the following day,THURSDAY/JANUARY 14,  19S3,  at 11a-m., at No .10 Downing Street, tocontinue the discussion of theAgenda Paper.itehall Gardens, SJanuary 13, 1933.
