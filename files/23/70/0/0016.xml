CHINA AND 1.   The Secretary of State for India saidJAPAN.that he had been speaking on the telephone thatEvents at shangai. morning to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs, at Geneva.   The latter was&apos;naturally(previous reference: anxious about what would happen at the MeetingCabinet 15(32), Son- of the Assembly on the morrow, but consideredelusion 1.)f.R.that British prestige at Geneva was high at themoment.The Lord President of the Council said thatthe Secretary of State for Air was leaving forGeneva the same afternoon, and he feared both heand the Foreign Secretary would be absent untilMarch 19th.At a later stage in the Meeting the Secretaryof State for War gave some particulars of themilitary situation at Shanghai, which he hadreceived from the General Staff.   The greater partof the new Japanese forces were apparently beinglanded in the Yangtse, those disembarked in theSettlement consisting mainly of drafts.   he regretted that the information that reached theGeneral Staff was not too favourable to the outcome of the present negotiations for a truce at shangai.
DISARMAMENT .Air Disarma-ment and theAbolition ofBombingAircraft.previous reference:Cabinet 9(32), Con-clhsion 12,)2. The discussion of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air (CP.-82 (32))on Air Disarmament and the Abolition of bombing Aircraft was postponed, with the assent of the Secretary of State for Air,owing to the absence of the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs and the First Lordof the Admiralty.
Irish Free State resulting from the recent General(previous reference: Election.   The conclusions of the Memorandum areCabinet 15(52), Con- summed up in paragraph 21 as follows:-elusion 3.)Time is on our side.   The EucharisticCongress meets in Dublin in the summer, and it is likely that therewould be a general desire to avoid any serious political controversy inthe Free State, at any rate until the close of the Congress .    It looks as though Mr, de Valera will only beable to command a majority in the dail with the aid of the small party of Labour Members, who, while they maysupport him on the question of the oath, are, in general, committed toadherence to the Treaty,    In the senate, Mr Cos grave&apos;s supporterscommand an overwhelming majority andwill be able, if they wish, to holdup legislation on the Oath (thoughpossibly not on the annuities) for at any rate 18 months.    If legisla-tion on the Oath is eventually passed,its validity might be challenged inthe Free State courts.    Our tariff policy may also, as time goes on,have its effects on the minds of the farming community..(II) We must allow the first move to comefrom Mr. de Valera, and there shouldbe no provocative action on our part.But as soon as Mr. de Valera takesaction, we must define our attitude.(ill) On the question of the Oath,  our attitude should be that we regard it as an -integral part of the Treaty.(n) On the question of the annuities, weshould make it clear that we considerthat we have an entirely valid claimto payment, but we should examine whetherit would be desirable either to acceptor to offer arbitration before aBritish Commonwealth Tribunal.(V) We should also investigate further in the meantime the question of sanctions and their effects.(VI) Lastly, in our own interests and alsoin loyalty to others, namely, thosewho, like Mr Kevin 0&apos;Eiggins, havegiven their lives for the Treaty, andthose who, like Mr Cos grave, haverisked, and are still risking, their lives and political fortunes for it,. we should stand absolutely by thesanctity of the Treaty.   On this there can be no compromise:    our-3(I)rpjjB IRISH 3 . The Satinet had before them a Memorandum bymo STATE.- the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairspesults of theejection. (C.P.,-86 (32)) on the political situation in the
attitude should be olear and definite.The Secretary of State for Dominion affairs emphasised the importance of no provocative actionofon our part, and/allowing the first move to comefrom Mr. de Valera.He mentioned that one course which was open toMr. de Valera in dealing with the Oath was a dissolution, a fresh General Election, and theintroduction of a Bill for the Abolition of the oath, which the Senate would then be unable to reject.   He had no reason to believe that thiscourse was likely to be adopted,After a discussion, during which was raisedincidentally the question dealt with in conclusion 4,the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the policy proposed by the Secretary ofState&apos;s Memorandum (CP,-86 (38)):(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as fallows:-The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs (In the Chair),The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home Secretary,The Secretary of State for War,The President of the Board of Trade,The Lord Privy Seal -should be appointed to meet whenever the Secretary of State for DominionAffairs should deem advisable, toconsider whether it might be desirableto accept or to offer arbitration ofthe question of annuities before aBritish Commonwealth tribunal.
l IRISH FREEME-bumtion for,^eviousleference:cabinet 5 8%), Con-conclusion o.)if.    In. the course of the discussion referredto in the preceding Conclusion,  the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs informed his colleagues that the High Commissioner to the Irish FreeState had asked the War Office to supply 500,000rounds of revolver ammunition to the Irish FreeState Government.      The Irish Free State had hitherto been encouraged to obtain their suppliesof ammunition from the War Office, which .wasconvenient from several points of view mentioned by the Secretary of State;    and in ordinarycircumstances, the claim would have been met withoutany question being raised.      The amount, however, waslarge, and in present circumstances  the War office had thought it advisable to consult the dominions office.      One of the reasons for the demand was understood to be that the Irish Free StateGovernment had the money available and desired to clear up their accounts before March jjJTst.After the  question had been discussed in its political aspects,  the Cabinet agreed  That there was no ground for refusing the request.      Therewere no hostilities in progressin the Irish Free State, andthere was no doubt that the ammunition could be obtained-   elsewhere if not furnished fromhere.      The Irish Free StateGovernment was perfectly inde-pendent in this matter and free to place the order where it liked,and was,in addition, a friendlyGovernment.      It did not .appear tobe the concern of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United kingdom that the Government in the IrishFree State was likely to change inthe immediate future,  and there wasno ground for assuming that anyquarrel was imminent,      In thesecircumstances the War office should be authorised to treat theorder as a normal one.
THE IMPORTDUTIES BILL.ProposedPrefer enc eto Palestine(previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Con-clusion 5.)BR.5, The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that matters relating to thequestion referred to in the margin -were stillbefore the Law Officers and the Cabinet Committeewere not prepared to submit their views today.Although it had been necessary to hold up theissue of the Order affecting Mandated Territories,he understood the Customs Authorities had been instructed to clear goods from the various
the TANGANYIKAAND british honduras LOANS(GUARANTEE)BILL,&apos; previous reference:Cabinet 15f 52) , 0 on-clusion IS.)6.   The Cabinet were informed that it hadbeen found unnecessary to raise the question inthe margin, which had been placed on the agenda paper.
7.The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Health (CP.-85 (32)) pointing outthat before long he will have to deal with policyin relation to Maternity Services,   He described the circumstances in which the late Minister ofHealth drew up a scheme for a National MaternityService and presented it to the consultative council of the Approved Societies for their consideration, but assumed that under present financial conditions there could be no questionbut that the scheme (costing  1,500,000 from theExchequer) must be postponed, in accordance withthe opinion of the Committee on National Expenditure.He therefore proposed an alternative policy of concentrating on the extension and improvement ofthe Maternity Services already provided,   TheMinister of Health&apos;s suggestion, therefore, wason a suitable occasion to state that financial considerations have obliged the Government todecide that further progress with the NationalMaternity Service rmist be deferred, but thattheir policy is not to rest during the postponementbut to encourage the Local Authorities to expandand improve their existing Maternity Services .The Minister of Health informed the Cabinetthat the Prime Minister had minuted his memorandum as follows&quot;Something on these lines is,  i fear, inevitable.   The labour government was told that it wouldbe some years before the maximumcharge of  1,500,000 would bereached.    Could we go on layingfoundations at a much smallercost to Exchequer?    I know thatfeeling amongst women of allclasses and. parties is very strong.It is a natural instinct which willbe hard to come up against..   If wehave to face the worst I am willing,. but note that what we propose is
to add to local charges withoutbearing any (however slight)national obligation&quot;.The Minister of Health reported that unfortunatelyit was impossible to lay the foundations at a smaller cost to the Treasury,    Some time might-elapse while the scheme was being negotiated, but&apos;in the first year of its operation the cost tothe Exchequer would be  SQOyece, and there seemed no means of escape from this.Referring to the Prime Minister&apos;s suggestionthat it was proposed to add to local chargeswithout bearing any national obligation, he pointed out that the national obligation had actually been anticipated by the addition in 1929of a special sum of  5,000,000 to the block grants to Local Authorities, with the intention of encouraging the Maternity Service among others .The course which he now proposed, therefore,had the intention of stimulating backward LocalAuthorities to implement their share of thepolicy adopted in 1929.The Chancellor of the Exchequer confirmed theMinister of Health&apos;s information as to the 5,000,000 addition to the block grants.A suggestion was made that an experimentmight be carried out somewhat on the lines of thelarger scheme for a National Maternity service in two districts,  one in England and one inScotland.   The cost, it was suggested, would notexceed about  5,000 a year to the Exchequer ineach case, and the two experiments might differslightly in order to try out different methods.
The result would be to provide valuable data forthe larger scheme when finance was availablefor its adoption.The Minister of Health thought it doubtful,prima facie, whether such an experiment would be practicable, owing partly to the lack of legal powers, partly to jealousy that might arise betweenadjoining districts, and partly to difficultiesin arranging the finance with the approved societies.    He was willing, however, to discussthe question with the Secretary of State forScotland.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the proposalsof the Minister of Health in his memorandum C-P,-85 (32):(b) That the Minister of Healthshotxld discuss, with the Secretaryof State for Scotland the suggestion of an experiment, as summarised above,
UNBMPIiOYMENT 8.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum by insurance.the Minister of Labour (C.R.-84 (32)) on the subjectAdminis trationof Transitional    of the experience gained in the administration ofpayments ,transitional payments.   While the administration(Previous was settling down generally in the country as a reference:Cabinet 3 whole, a difficult situation, of which he gave(32), Con-clusion 6.) particulars, had developed in South Wales (particu-larly in the case of the Eridgend Guardians Committee,a Committee of the Glamorgan County Council) and in parts of one or two other Counties and county boroughs.    The Minister proposed to forward to theCounty Council, a&apos; copy of a report by the AssistantGeneral Inspector of the Ministry of Health uponthe work of the Bridgend Guardians Committee and.to tell them explicitly that unless they take steps at once to secure compliance with the law bythe Bridgend Guardians he would have no alternative but to appoint other persons to do the work inBridgend.    He would make it clear that this wouldnot be a supersession of a Local Authority in all its public assistance functions, as had been undertaken in West Ham, Chester-r-le-rStreet andBedwellty, but merely a removal from the Authorityof the functions imposed by the Order in Council,in regard to transitional payments in one district of the County.   The Minister therefore asked for cabinet approval r-(a) to write as proposed in the caseof Bridgend5(b) to a decision that similar action should be taken in other areas wherethe Authority declines to actreas onably .
The Minister of Labour read to the Cabinet thefollowing Minute to his Memorandum, which he had receivedfrom the Prime Minister:-&quot;I approve.    Consider, however, whether itwould be possible to do anything at thesame time to modify any other clearlyshown anomaly in administration.      Perhapsit is impossible.      If it could be done it would tend to give confidence in theimpartiality of the Government&quot;.In the course of the discussion a good dealof sympathy was expressed with the Prime Minister&apos;s&apos;point of view, but the Cabinet were reminded that,following consideration by the Ministers concerned, a circular (L.A.3)  had already been issued to LocalAuthorities, which anticipated the point./   Suggestions ofrather hard administration of the Transitional Paymentssystem, particularly in Lancashire, were made, but theMinisters of Health and Labour did not admit that LocalAuthorities were not carrying out their duties with reasonable discretion.It was suggested that any marked discrepancies oftreatment might perhaps be surmounted by arrangingConferences between adjacent Local Authorities.The Minister of Labour was strongly urged thatIf any Local Authority should prove recalcitrant, he mustbe prepared to take action on the lines suggested inhis memorandum.The Cabinet agreed  To authorise the Minister of Labour -(a) To write as proposed in the case ofBridgend;(b) To take similar action in other areas where the Authority declinesto act reasonably.(/   See CP. 289 (51).and Cabinet 81  (31) Conclusion 8).
BETTING, GAMING J. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum byAND LOTTERIES.- the Home Secretary (CP.-72 (32)) drawing attentionSweepstakes.to the consequences that have followed in Creat(Previous Britain from the legalisation of sweepstakes in reference:Cabinet 35 the Irish Free State,   The Memorandum eontained(31), Con-elusion 7.) particulars of these consequences and suggestedfit,. nine possible courses which might be taken to2o(&amp;)cj. deal with the situation.    Of these nine coursesthe Secretary of State was inclined to recommend to the Cabinet that the possibilities of the two following should be more closely examined:-(6) To approach the matter from the standpoint of the financial positionof the country, and to seek a meansof stopping the financial drain from great Britain to the Irish Free State,which may soon amount to  2,000,000a year.   This suggestion was made byLord Snowden, when Chancellor of theExchequer, and it has since been thesubject of discussions between theTreasury and the Home Office.    If any measures were taken in this direction,they would take the form of prohibitingunder heavy penalties participation inlotteries or sweepstakes organisedoutside this country, possibly withconfiscation of the prizes.   the justification would be that it isinexpedient    on account of the presentconditions relating to the balance ofpayments, to permit the continuanceof this drain.    I understand, however,that the Chancellor of the Exchequerdoes not favour this course.(7) To make an appeal to the public onpatriotic grounds not to spend this large sum outside Great Britain, for reasons similar to those which have led many people to forego taking theirholidays abroad.    The figures given at the beginning of this memorandum,if they were published, would probably have considerable influence.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that,  in January, he had informed theHome Secretary that the financial situation did not justify taking action to deal with the situation on financial grounds,  and this was still more thecase to-day,      In these circumstances the cabinet felt that the courses proposed above were inapplicable.jThe Home Secretary emphasised that the HomeOffice objected rather strongly to having to try and administer a law which could not be enforced.The Cabinet felt great sympathy with theHome Secretary, but at the moment could see no       \alternative but to allow the existing situation to continue.      They saw no objection to the HomeSecretary&apos;s announcing the figures mentioned inhis Memorandum as to the amount of the subscriptionsto the Irish Sweepstakes and the way the money wasallotted,  if, on reconsideration, he deemed this in the public interest.
ggg -10.    The Secretary of State for the ColoniesWICTION.informed the Cabinet that the negotiations on whichevious he had been working, with the approval of the Cabinet,ference:binet 92 for an agreement for rubber restriction,  appeared1), Oon-conclusion G) . to be about to fail.     All concerned agreed thatan\ effective control of native production was/essentialprecedent to success.      The Dutch interests, whohad originally negotiated the proposal, had been discussing the question with their own Government..His information was that the Netherlands East Indieswere not willing to come into the proposed scheme.The only scheme they could contemplate, if pressurewas put upon them by their Government, would benot a quota but an export tax.      All those who were concerned in the negotiations here agreed that thatmethod, would not prove effective.     Dutchrepresentatives had arranged to meet british representatives in London on Tuesday next, but unless some new factor arose in the interval all were agreed that the position was now hopelessand any restriction improbable. ^The Cabinet took note of the&quot;above statement.-1 5-
-11.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred tostatements that had appeared in the press to theeffect that various people,  including some of hiscolleagues, were at work on the preparation of theBudget,&apos;     He wished the Cabinet to know that the datafor the Budget were not yet available,  and he himself had not yet made up his mind on the subject.
