1.   The First Lord of the Admiralty saidthat he had no fresh news as yet beyond thatreported in the Press as to the Submarine M.2..The Submarine had been located on the previous evening and pontoons were being, sent fromPortsmouth with a view,  if possible, to liftingthe Submarine, which lay in 17 fathoms of water.Up to the present it had not been found possibleto get any signals from the Submarine.   this might be accounted for by some technical break-down, e.g., of the batteries.    If the vessel was not flooded there should be no danger for another 24 hours .
CHINA and japan.Events at shangai.(PrevicmsReference:Cabinet 87(31), Con-clusion 3.)2. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that a serious situation had arisen between the Chinese and the Japanese at Shanghai.He called attention to telegram No. 54 from theBritish Ambassador at Washington reporting thatthe American Secretary of State was earnestlyanxious to have the co-operation of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the following two proposed measures:-(l) A formal and categorical intimationto the Japanese Government that nothing in the present situation could justify the entry of any japanese armed forces into theInternational Settlement:(2) The despatch of material reinforce-ments of men-of-war to Shanghai *On the last point the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs reported that there were alreadyone large British Cruiser and two smaller ships at Shanghai.    At the moment his inclination wasto reply to the American Secretary of stated-e&apos;proposal in sympathetic terms and to indicatethat he was studying the events of 1927, whenBritish and American forces had been landed at shangai, on which he had called for a report.In any event it would be important to avoidslighting the American point of view, and possibly the solution might be for the two Governmentsjointly to call Japan7s attention to what was done in 1927.   He hoped, however, to clear up this particular episode before he left for theDisarmament Conference at Geneva.
THE DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.g^partmentalArrangementsof MinisterDelegates .(previous reference:Cabinet 8(33), Oon-clusion 1.)3.   The Prime Minister reminded the ministers who were Delegates at the Disarmament Conferenceat Geneva that arrangements roust be made for somecolleague to discharge formal duties ih their absence.    In the case of a Secretary of Statethis duty could only be performed by anotherSecretary of State.   This did not involve inter-conferenee with the policy of a Department, and agood deal of business could be sent to Geneva.It was necessary, however, to have some minister who could give his signature in urgent matters.He was anxious to know what had been settled by each Minister concerned, in order to report thearrangements to the King.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretaryof State for the Colonies would be acting for theSecretary of State for India and the Secretaryof State for War,- and that the Minister of Healthwould act for the First Lord of the Admiralty.The other Ministers concerned were asked to report their arrangements direct to the Prime Minister.
THE DISARMAMENTCpNFERENOE.Procedure at.(Pr evicmsReference:Cabinet 3(38), Con-clusion 3.)4. The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed the Cabinet that he had seen Mr arthur henderson, the President of the DisarmamentConference, and had learned from him some furtherparticuh- rs of the procedure which he proposed tofollow,   Mr.Henderson would make his PresidentialSpeech on Tuesday, February 2nd, at 3,30 p.m.,a convenient hour for broadcasting to the UnitedStates of America.   The speech would take aboutfifty minutes, after which the Conference wouldadjourn.    For the remainder of the week he didnot anticipate any general discussion.    Therewould be a Committee to examine petitions, inorder that the more important ones might be presented to the Conference in due form.Mr Henderson had not seemed to anticipate that much important business would happen in the first week after his own speech.   The general debatewas likely to begin on Monday, February 8th, andMr Henderson suggested that the Prime minister might be present to take part on that day.   Thegeneral debate would continue for some time, andthen the Conference might adjourn until May.
ISO5.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat in the near future he would be obliged, onmedioal advice, to give up all work for a minimum period of three v--eeks, during which he would beable to read practically nothing and would haveto be in the fresh air as much as possible.He hoped to be present in the House of commons during the following week, but after his visit to Geneva on February 8th his intention was tocomply with the requirements of his medicaladvisers .
agricultural policy.The HomeWheat Quota .&quot;previous reference ference:Cabinet 4(52),  Con-clusion 5.)aximumunit ofmillionuarters notbe exceeded6, &quot;The Cabinet had before them, besides theMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries (CP.-22 (32)) on the subject of theWheat Quota, that had been before them at theMeeting referred to in the margin, a Report of theCabinet Committee under the Chairmanship of theLord President of the Council (CP.-39 (32)),  theconclusions of which are summarised in the report as follows:-&quot;We accordingly recommend the Cabinet -(l) To adopt the proposals containedin CP .-22 (32) as the foundation of the proposed Home Wheat QuotaBill.(2) To authorise the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries toinclude in his draft Bill thefigure of 6 million quartersas the &apos;maximum quantity ofwheat&apos; and the figure of 45/-as the &apos;basic price&apos;, and alsoto include in the Bill (failinga voluntary undertaking by themilling industry) the requirement that a miller shall not add tothe- price to the flour consumerany amount in excess of theamount of the quota levy if, on consideration, such a course isfound to be practicable.(3) That no time limit for the duration of the scheme shouldbe inserted in.the Bill.(4) To authorise the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries to .release&apos; for public informationa summarised version of thehome wheat quota plan, in theform approved by the CabinetThe first point raised was the recommendation in paragraph 3 of the Report that the figure of6 million quarters of wheat should be inserted inthe Bill as fixing the maximum limit of the charge to be levied in any one year in respect of the quota.
Cost to theConsumer ,The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesinformed the Cabinet that if the&quot;6 millionmaximum&quot; was ^if) exceeded, the farmers would get pro rata lessthan the 45/- per quarter fixed as the basic price .The Cabinet were assured that the provisionof a maximum of 6 million quarters, in conjunctionwith the recommendation for the insertion in theBill of 45/- per quarter of 504 lbs. as the basic price, provided an adequate financial safeguard.It&apos;; was suggested that the farmers would count on receiving the full basic price of 45/- per quarter and that if, owing to larger total production, they received less   for example,38/- or 40/-  there would be resentment andthat this would lead to a demand for raising themaximum limit of 6 million quarters of wheat.There was general agreement, however, that anysuch demand would have to be firmly resisted bythe Government.The Cabinet was asked to note that the scheme would cost the consumer, at the worst, about ^d.on the 4-lb, loaf, or Jd. on the 2-lb. loaf, andthat this would have to be made clear in Parlia-ment .The Cabinet were informed that the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisherieshad been asked to work out what would have beenthe effect of the scheme if it had been inoperation during the last year , and it hadbeen found that in only one week in four would the price have been affected.    It was suggested
The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheriesinformed the Cabinet that if the&quot;6 millionmaximum&quot; was 0exceeded, the farmers would get pro rata? lessthan the 45/- per quarter fixed as the basic price.The Cabinet were assured that the provisionof a maximum of 6 million quarters, in conjunctionwith the recommendation for the insertion in theBill of 4:5/- per quarter of 504 lbs . as the basic price, provided an adequate financial safeguard.It; was suggested that the farmers would count on receiving the full basic price of 45/- per quarter and that if, owing to larger total production, they received less   for example,58/- or 40/-  there would be resentment andthat this would lead to a demand for raising themaximum limit of 6 million quarters of wheat.There was general agreement, however, that anysuch demand would have to be firmly resisted bythe Government.The Cabinet was asked to note that the scheme would cost the consumer, at the worst, about Jd.on the 4-lb. loaf, or Jd. on the S-lb. loaf, andthat this would have to be made clear in Parlia-ment.The Cabinet were informed that the officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisherieshad been asked to work out what would have beenthe effect of the scheme if it had been inoperation during the last year , and it hadbeen found that in -only one week in four would the price have been affected.    It was suggested
that in Parliament it ah cm Id be explained thatK there must be some cost to the consumer, whichcould not be estimated precisely as it depended on the variation in price between imported and home-grown wheat, and that this might be followedby quoting the calculation of the Officials of theMinistry of Agriculture and Fisheries referred toab ove .Probability or Some discussion took place as to whether theotherwise ofProduction 6 million quarters of wheat to be inserted inexceeding million the Bill as fixing the maximum limit of thequarters . *charge to be levied in any one year in respectof the quota was in fact likely to be exceededor not.    One view was that it would not be exceeded, for the reason that farmers would wishto avoid such excess in order to derive the fullbenefit of the 45/- basic price without reduction.It was pointed out, however, that the growersare not organised.   The adoption of the scheme might induce farmers to re-plant wheat on land onwhich that crop had formerly been grown butabandoned in present economic conditions.    Thiswas likely more particularly as the margin of profit and loss agai.nst the growing of wheat wasnot very large.    If this happened on a large scale and the 6 million quarters were exceeded,not only would farmers receive less than the 45/-but the effect of the Act would be to increase the acreage of wheat, which was rather contrary tothe policy of developing other and more profitableforms of agriculture.    It was pointed out alsothat another result of the Act might be to givea great impetus to new methods of farming andmechanisation which, while leading to a reduction
J. 6 &apos;i:The PresentQuota scheme the most satisfactory.VoluntaryUndertakingby the MillingIndustry not to add to thePrice of Flour.in costs,  also displaced labour.   The Cabinet were reminded, however, that the Government&apos;s policy was not confined to the encouragement of wheatproduction, and it was suggested that the aboveobjections would be offset to some extent by the encouragement given to other forms of agriculturaladtivity.On the whole, it was felt that the objectionsapplied in the main to any form of quota scheme,and that the present scheme was not only the most satisfactory but also the frankest method of lettingthe consumer know that the &quot;cost 6&quot;f the scheme mustfall on the loaf.The attention of the Cabinet was next drawn to paragraph 4 of the Committee&apos;s Report, where theimportance was emphasised of an undertaking being obtained from the milling -industry that the industry will not add to the price to the flour consumer any amount in excess of the amount of the quota levy,andthe question wa-s raised as to whether this should bedone by a voluntary undertaking or by compulsoryprovision in the Bill.The Cabinet were informed that the intention was that there should be a &quot;Gentleman&apos;s Agreement&quot;.It was suggested, that in obtaining the undertaking from the milling industry this should be emphasised,but that it should be indicated that if breaches ofthe agreement took place (which was not anticipated)public opinion would be strongly opposed to the millers and the Government would be compelled totake action.The Cabinet agreed that no provision should bemade in the Bill in respect of the undertaking,but that it should be sought voluntarily.
The Cabinet next considered the question of atime limit to the Bill.    It was suggested that many people who disliked the principle of a quotaneverthelesswould-be willing to adopt this scheme on the groundthat the wheat grower at the moment was in a particularly difficult position and required some temporary assistance before he could embark on new methods of farming which would render wheat-growingprofitable.    Those who held this view would objectto the scheme unless it was given some time limit,say 5 to 7 years .    It was&apos; urged that the Bill was an experimental one.    Its results could only bediscovered by experience.   All sorts of defectsmight reveal themselves, as had happened in theoperation of the Coal Mines Act.    Consequently itwas urged that the Bill ought to be subject to parliamentary review after a fixed term of years .In support of this view it was pointed out thatimproved methods of agriculture or other causesmight render advisable a lowering of the 45/-basic jprice.    It was suggested that even farmersmight prefer a time limit, as if the present government was succeeded.by a Government opposedto the measure they would, hesitate to sweep itaway if it had only three or four years to run.The farmers would therefore receive a. betterguarantee.The Cabinet were reminded, however,  that inany event Parliament would amend the scheme, whichwas admittedly experimental, if it did not provesatisfactory, and that that would apply whethera time limit were inserted or not.   The CabinetCommittee had thought it better not to try andtie the hands of Parliament in this respect by
a time limit.   They were reminded of the mis true&apos;oin all Agricultural legislation which had arisen in the minds of farmers owing to the repeal off the Corn Production Act notwithstanding that ithad included a time limit .oposed An alternative suggestion was that some bodypiodicalagination should be set up for considering the 45/- basicthe Basicice. price at intervals of a few years, so as to providefor its amendment not by legislation but byexecutive decision.    It was possible that the mainobjection to the operation of the Act might bethis basic price;    that there might be a strong demand for its reduction;    and that unless revisedthe Act might become unpopitlar and be repealed.The Cabinet were reminded also that the 45/-might become obsolete owing to variations in thevalue of Sterling, and this was another reasonfor providing some machinery for amending it.The conclusion of the Cabinet was that thereshould be no time limit, but that the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries should make a further report as to whether provision should be made inthe Bill for re-consideration of the basic pricefrom time to time.The Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve the recommendationsof the Cabinet Committee as statedat the head of this Minute, subjectto the following:-&apos;b) That any demand for a raising ofthe figure of 6 million quartersas the maximum quantity of wheatowing to production exceeding thatquantity, whether now or in thefuture, should be firmly resisted:(c) That an appropriate reference should be made in Parliament tothe cost of the scheme to thec onsumer:
(d) That a voluntary undertaking shouldbe obtained from the milling industrynot to add to the price to the flourconsumer any amount in excess of theamount of the quota levy.    In obtain-ing this undertaking it might be made clear that if a breach of the under-taking occurred (which was not, ofcourse, anticipated), public opinion was likely to be strongly moved and.the Government would be compelled totake action:(e) That no time limit should be inserted in the Bill, subject to the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries examiningand reporting to the Cabinet as towhether provision should, be made inthe Bill for appropriate re-considera-tipn and alteration by executivedecision of the basic price fromtime to time:(f) That the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries should not, as yet, release a summarised version of the Home-wheat quota Plan for pxiblication.    He should,however, be authorised to use it forthe confidential information ofpersons concerned who have to dealwith authoritative bodies interested.-12-
7. The Cabinet&apos; had under consideration paragraph49 of the Report of the Cabinet Committee on theBalance of Trade (CP.-25 (32)), which is as follows:-&quot;We cannot close this Reportwithout making a special refer-ence to Russian trade.    For manyyears Russian exports to thiscountry have greatly exceeded herimports from us, and the creditsobtained by Russian sales herehave been largely used to buy from america, thus&quot;constituting a steadydrain on the dollar exchange.    In1950 British exports to Russia were approximately  9-g millions, the bulkof which were sold on credit, whilethe imports from Russia to the UnitedKingdom were  34 millions, the wholeof which were paid for in cash.During the same period, the UnitedStates exported to Russia  28-gmillions, and imported from Russiaonly  5 millions.    We accordinglysuggest that the subject of tradewith Russia should be considered in the light of its bearing uponthe adverse balance of trade, andpossibly the Cabinet may decide torefer the question to a Committee.&quot; &apos;The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs reported that the negotiations which had been draggingon with Soviet Russia,  with a view to some settlementof Anglo-Russian claims, gave no prospect of a useful issue and had in fact reached a completedeadlock.      Mr. Henderson had derived the impressionthefrom/Soviet Ambassador last July that his Governmentwould put forward for consideration some definiteoffer in writing proposing that compensation forpre-war debts should be in some way combined with a loan or long term credits to Russia, and Lord Readinghad sent a message to the Ambassador, who had gone to moscow, asking that on his return he should produce the proposed scheme for consideration,      The soviet ambassador on his return had taken up the position that Mr. Henderson had been in error;    that no offer
of a definite proposal had ever been made;    and thatMr. Henderson should not have expected any reply fromthe Soviet Government.      The Ambassador had added thatthe only proposal made by the Soviet Government wasthat we should definitely accept the principle that adebt settlement must be associated with arrangementsfor a credit or loan before any concrete progress could be made in the negotiations.      This was a principle that His Majesty&apos;s Government must refuseto accept,  and while the protocol still binds both parties to settle by negotiation the question of anglo-Soviet debts and claims,  it had seemed to theSecretary of State, after consulting Lord Goschen,useless to continue the negotiations at the presenttime.      He had addressed a Note to the Soviet ambassador to this effect.A number of Questions were down to be asked asto i-the progress and result of these negotiations, assoon as Parliament meets.      In reply the Secretary ofState proposed to make public the terms of his note which would of necessity be disappointing.      TheGovernment might expect therefore a considerable showof feeling and demands to know what course they propose to take.The Cabinet took note of the statement of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and agreed -That a Cabinet Committee, composed asfollows -The Chancellor of the Exchequer(In the Chair),The Secretary of State forForeign Affairs,The Secretary&quot; of State forthe Colonies,The President of the Board of Trade,The Parliamentary Secretary to theDepartment of Overseas Trade,
should consider the subject of Trade withRussia in the light of its bearing onthe adverse balance of trade.NOTE;      The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs intimated that it might benecessary for him to invite theParliamentary Under-Secretary tothe Foreign Office to represent himon this Committee, owing to hisimminent departure for Geneva.
BALANCE. OPSuggestednegotiationswith ForeignCountries..(previous reference:Gabinet 6(32), Appendix.)8.    In the course of the discussion referred toin the preceding Minute,  the Home Secretary drew attention to the fact that the President of theBoard of Trade had, at a recent meeting of theCabinet (referred to in the margin),  expressed a willingness to enter into negotiations withother countries on the subject of tariffs.      he made a tentative suggestion that this subjectmight perhaps be referred to the same Committee as was to consider Trade with Russia.The Prime Minister thought that thesubject required further consideration by theCabinet, invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum, and instructed the Secretary toplace the subject on the Agenda Paper at the next meeting of the Gabinet,
9.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Lord Chancellor (CP .-38 (32)) urging thedesirability of filling the judicial vacancycreated in October, 1929, by the resignation ofMr Justice Shearman, which, from motives of economy, has since remained unfilled.    In supportof this plea details were given of the arrears ofwork in the King&apos;s Bench Division, as well as financial particulars .The Prime Minister reminded the Cabinetthat the proposal was likely to be strongly opposed in the House of Commons, and warned theLord Chancellor on the difficulty of finding thenecessary Parliamentary time.The Cabinet approved the proposal of the Lord Chancellor and agreedthat the necessary resolutionsshould be introduced as soon asit was possible to find the necessaryParliamentary time.
mHB NATIONALITY 10. The Cabinet had &quot;before them a Memorandum bynP MARRIED WOMEN.u    J the Home Secretary (CP.-43 (32)) on the subject(previous of the Nationality of Married Women.   The Memo-&quot;Cabinet 14 randum included a summary of the examination of(31)    Gon-clusion 8.) this subject by Imperial Conferences in 1923,1926 and 1929, and  quoted Articles 8, 9 and 10of a Convention on Nationality prepared in 1930by the International Conference at nhe Hague onthe Codification of International Law.   It furthergave details of the present attitude of the variousDominions, and mentioned in particular that theCanadian Parliament, in pursuance of the agreement reached at the Imperial Conference, 1930, hadalready passed legislation to give effect to theArticles of The Hague Convention.   This legislation was now being brought into operation,   The cabinet was asked to decide between, the following courses open to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom, all of which were admitted to be open to objection:-(i) ^o legislate, as Canada has done,on the lines of Articles 8 to 10of the Hague Convention, in anti-cipation that the rest of theDominions will do likewise.   TheBill would provide that the Actwould not come into force until they had so acted.(ii) To endeavour to persuade Canada,South A.frica and the Irish FreeState to agree to the proposalsof the women&apos;s organisations.(iii) To introduce a Bill giving effectto the women&apos;s proposals, butsuspending them until the dominions had legislated similarly:   meanwhileto enact the Hague Articles.(iv) To legislate in accordance withthose proposals, and to accept a breach in &quot;the principle of uniformity,with different laws on this pointin the United Kingdom and perhapsAustralia and New Zealand on theone hand, and in the remaining threeDominions on the other.
To do nothing, which would againinvolve acquiescence in a breach of uniformity.Theobjections to each of theabove courseswere set forth in the Memorandum.The home Secretary emphasised that his proposals were really a choice of evils and drew attention to the additional suggestion inparagraph 8 of his Memorandum that in the event of(i)  or (iii) being chosen it might be possible to legislate at the same time so as to remove thelegal disabilities - ineligibility for the franchise,liability to registration as an alien,  etc,, underwhich a British-born woman married to an alien isnow placed.After a short discussion,  the cabinet agreed  That the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum should form the subject of inter-Departmental exmination by thefollowing Departments:-Home Office,Foreign Office,Dominions Office,and that as the result of that con-sultation the Home Secretary should advise the Cabinet as to what course to recommend.

The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (CP.-44 (52))suggesting that sufficient importance had not-been attached to possible methods of preventinga &quot;knock-out blow&quot; in the early days of an aggressive attack.
