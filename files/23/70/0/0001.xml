REPARATIONSAND WAR DEBTS .(previous reference:Cabinet 92(31),  Con-clusion 1 and appendix.)a.1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat the policy to be adopted in the matter ofWar Debts and Reparations was still under consider-ation by the Cabinet Committee.    In the meanwhilehe invited the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to report as to the latest developments.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs informed, the Cabinet that the German ambassador had been summoned to Berlin in the middle of theprevious week.   He had undertaken to inform theBritish Ambassador in Berlin of anything ofinterest to His Majesty11 s Government that might occur there.    On January 6th Sir Horace Rumboldhad reported (telegram No.2) that at an interview,at which the German Ambassador in London was present, the German Chancellor had informed him that he would be obliged to declare at the reparations Conference that Germany could no longerpay reparations either now or in the future.Information of the Chancellor&apos;s policy had leakedout, and Dr. Brxming had then made a statement tothe Press on the same lines but of rather a mildercharacter.   This had elicited some public remarksfrom the French Minister of Finance, who had suggested that the German Chancellor&apos;s statement made it doubtful whether the Lausanne Conferenceought to be held.    So far there had been noreaction of a similar character from other foreign government, and in the newspapers of the same morning it appeared that the tendency was for theFrench Government to take a somewhat less graveviewr of the matter.    If the German Government were deliberately throwing over the Young Plan, the
Creditor Power or Powers which might regard them-selves as concerned would have the right, underAnnex I to The Hague Agreements of January, 1930,to submit the question to the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice for decision.    In the eventof an affirmative decision the Creditor Power orPowers could then resume their full liberty ofaction.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed theCabinet that he had just received a long communi-cation from Sir Frederick Leith Ross which he hadnot yet finished reading.   He gathered, however,that Sir Frederick Leith Ross did not contemplatepostponement of the Lausanne Conference.   Apparentlythe French were putting forward some new plan forthe solution of the present difficulties, in whichthe German Railways were concerned.   The situationappeared to have become more, rather than less,difficult.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that at a subsequent meeting the Cabinet would have beforethem a Report of the Cabinet Committee, with recommendations as to policy towards the questionsof reparations and war debts .   He irew attentionto a communication he had issued to the Press onthe previous evening for publication in connectionwith Dr. BruningTs statement, after consultationwi^h the Chancellor o^ the Exchequer and theI&apos;- - &apos; -7,:-&apos;&quot;.-.- -&apos;p-.&apos;v.:; .-::v:-:&apos;&quot;-&apos;&quot;:::&apos;-;,;&apos;---.&apos;.        -:::.Ji--- :-secretary of State for Foreign Affairs .

THE BURMA ROUND 2. The Cabinet had before them the followingTABLE CONFERENCE.documents relating to the Burma Round Table(Previous Conference:-Reference:Cabinet 79 A Note by the Secretary of State(31), Con- for India (CP.-3 (32)) coveringelusion 4.) a draft Statement of His Majesty&apos;spn government&apos;s Policy, to be made at&apos; - the close of the Conference:A Report of the Committee of thewhole of the Burma Round table conference (CP.-15 (32)).After hearing a statement from the Secretaryof State for India as to the course of the Burma.Round Table Conference, the Cabinet agreed  (a) To approve generally the draft statement of Kis MajestyTs Govern-menfs Policy, to be made at the close of the Burma Round table conference   as set forth in cp.-3 (32), subject to -(i) Paragraph 8, end of line 12,after the word &quot;Burma&quot;, theaddition of some such clarifyingwords as the following:-&quot;whether through the medium of branches or agencies orotherwise&quot;,unless the Secretary of Statefor India, after consultationwith his financial advisers,thought this inexpedient.In the latter event he would communicate with the Presidentof the Board of Trade.(ii) The addition of a paragraphas to a Railway Commission.(iii) Such verbal alterations,including suggestions madeby the Government of India,as the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Indiamight deem advisable.(b) That the Statement should be read bythe Prime Minister in the course ofhis speech at the conclusion of the burma Round Table Conference on thefollowing day.(c) To take note  (i) That the Burma settlement,although conceived on lines
similar to the Indian settlement,did not involve a Federal Gonsti-tution, and that consequently it was unnecessary, as in the ease of theIndian settlement, to send committees to Burma to work out outstandingdetails.(ii)  That there were certain outstanding questions, the more important ofwhich related to Minorities andFranchise, on which a government decision would &quot;be necessary later on.(iii) That His Majesty&apos;? Government in theUnited Kingdom are under an obligationto consult&quot;India before separation is effected, which the Secretary of Statethought might perhaps be accomplishedthrough the medium of the consultative committee set up as the result ofthe Indian Round. Table Conference.(iv) That at the General Election to beheld in Burma in the autumn, adecision was likely to be reached in favour of separation from Indiaand that this would, be followed bya demand for legislation in London.. ,&apos;:   .        ........ .....  ..;(v)  That the financial aspects of thesettlement as affecting Burma andIndia had. been discussed, and thatprobably at some stage an Arbitrationwould be required, and that an arbitration might also be requiredin regard to Trade.

Until then he could make no proposals to the Cabinet, but after the receipt of the Report he would circulate a Memorandum.The Cabinet took note of the statementof the Secretary of State for theColonies, and agreed to approve therecommendations of the Committee ofHome Affairs as set forth in theAppendix.-5-

The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinetthat a meeting of the Committee of Home affairs had been arranged to take place the same afternoon to consider the Children and Young Persons Bill,and the Town and Country Planning Bill.   Their,recommendations would be ready for consideration at the next Meeting of the Cabinet on Wednesday,January 13th.The Prime Minister urged his colleagues to read carefully the Memorandum by the Home Secretary(H-.A.-1 (33)), on the subject of the Children and young Persons Bill, and more particularly the last paragraph, in which the difficulties were set forth-7-
1  INDIA.Situation in-(previous reference:Cabinet 79(51), Con-^elusion 1 and appendix.)6. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Secretary of State for India (CP.-9 (32))transmitting for information a copy of a statement issued by ohe Government of India in explanation of the present situation in India.The Secretary of State for India gave theCabinet a full review of the present situationin India, at the end of which he informed themthat he had sent a telegram to the Viceroy askinga number of questions on such matters as thenumber of persons arrested each week;    the numberof those that were dangerous;    whether it would bepossible to insist on the vernacular press printingdenials of false statements.    He was anxious toavoid bringing the policy of keeping order into disrepute by keeping under arrest very largenumbers of unimportant people.    It was his intentionto keep his colleagues fully informed on thedevelopment of affairs in India.   A satisfactoryfeature in the situation was that Non-Congresspublic men were maintaining their association with the Committees that were being sent to india as the result of the Round Table Conference, theBritish members of which would leave this country on Wednesday next.     This would be a demonstrationto India and the world that, while maintainingorder, we were pressing forward with the RoundTable Conference policy.The Prime Minister said that no-one knew betterthan he how trying a time the Secretary, of Statefor India had had-   He associated himself with a tribute which the Secretary of State had paid toSir Malcolm Eailey, the Governor of the united provinces.
A short discussion took place as to thetreatment of Mr G-andhi, who is in prison under an Ordinance of 1818 &quot;for sufficient reasons&quot;.The Cabinet were reminded that on the occasion of previous incarceration a good deal of freedom hadbeen allowed to Mr Gandhi to see his friends andthus to carry on his campaign.    A suggestion wasmade that while Mr Gandhi should receive a laxtreatment, it should be made perfectly clear to him that he was cut off from the world and that if heabused his interviews with his friends thisprivilege would be withdrawn.The Secretary of State undertook to consider this proposal.
7. The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum      ^by the Minister of Transport (CP.-337 (31))stating that the physical condition of waterloo bridge is reported by the London County Councilto be. such as to necessitate an immediate decision as to its future.    In the minister&apos;s judgment theimportance of the bridge as a factor in Metropolitancommunications rendered it imperative that action should be taken.   The Memorandum contained a full account of the history of&quot;this question since theautumn of 1923, when steps had had to be taken tosecure the temporary safety of the existing bridge,down to the present time.   The London County Council,the Minister stated, are pressing him to indicatewhat the Governments attitude would be to a definiteproposal for them to reconstruct the bridge for six lines of traffic, and what rate of grant theywould be prepared to promise to such a scheme.Estimates were given of the cost alternatively of preserving the existing bridge ( 860,000) anderecting a new modern bridge ( 1,300,000)*    It waspointed out that formally the correct and simplecourse is to leave the unfettered decision, whether to reconstruct the existing bridge or to build anew bridge on modern lines, to the London CountyCouncil, which is the legally constituted Improve-ment Authority for London.   Technically the right course, when incurring so heavy an expenditure ofpublic money, must be to build a structure whichwill meet the needs of traffic for the next two orthree generations.   Financially, the London CountyCouncil, it was stated, are no doubt expectingthe old rate&apos; of grant of 75 per cent. from the-10-
Road Fund to be maintained.    Owing to the gravefinancial position of the Fund, however, theMinister felt he could not object to a more restrictedproposal to offer a rate of 60 per cent., which isthe normal rate for improvement of a Glass I bridge.Before pressing the considerations in his Memorandumtoo strongly upon the Cabinet, the Minister wishedthem to have an opportunity of discussing in itswider aspects a problem which is acutely eontro-versial^and has a long history behind it.The discussion revealed that the Cabinet were unanimously of opinion that in existing conditionsa rate of 60 per cent, should not be exceeded.The Cabinet were informed that in order to obtainthis grant from the Road Fund the London CountyCouncil would have to submit plans of the bridgeto the Ministry of Transport, which would examinethem both from.&apos; an engineering and an aestheticpoint of view.    It was suggested that if theGovernment were to give a grant of 60 per cent.they ought to have some say as to so important abridge in the Capital City of the Empire.   Asuggestion was made that the possibility should bediscussed with representatives of the LondonCounty Council of the retention of RennieTs bridgeas at present, as well as the erection of a newbridge from the South side of the River debouchingon the North side of the River opposite Aldwych.The plan of reconstructing the existing, bridge witha width sufficient to take four lines of trafficinstead of the present three by a process ofcorbelling out on the up-river side, met with no
support.   The Cabinet were informed that the reason why the London County Council desired to construct a bridge to carry six lines of traffic was toprovide for developments in a more or less distantfuture.   Admittedly the approaches to the bridgeon the North side c-ould not carry this traffic,and the cost of a large widening scheme would bevery heavy.    In course of time, however, the approach would probably be widened, and for thepresent it was not contemplated that the traffic would reach the maximum dimenaions provided forin the design of the bridge.The Cabinet were reminded that in the earlier stages of the controversy over Waterloo Bridgeit had been hoped to get rid of Hungerford Bridgeat Charing Cross, which at present ruined one ofthe,, finest,; ri^r prospects &quot;in the-world *, ^i    - ,;The -Minister of Transport warned the Cabinetthat the developments now under consideration were likely to postpone more or less indefinitely theproposal to get rid of Hungerford Bridge.   Adecision was urgent, as the present Waterloo Bridgewas liable to collapse within four years.A suggestion was made that the Pine ArtsCommission should be consulted on the aestheticaspects o^ the new bridge.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the rate of grant should notexceed the normal rate of 60 percent, for the improvement of a class I bridge:(b) That the Minister of Transport,with the co-operation of the first commissioner of Works, should discussthe question, in the light of the deliberations of the Cabinet summarised above, with representatives of theLondon County Council, ascertain theirviews, inform them of the decision ofthe Government as to the grant and oftheir desires generally as to theBridge, and report to the Cabinet.
FRENCHTARIFFS.New Stir tax.(Previous 1931, on the subject of the French Surtax of 15    ,CabinetC88 per cent. (C.P.-325 (31)).(31), Con-clusion 3.) In the course of a short discussion reference was also made to action taken by the Italian Govern-ment that was prejudicial to sea-borne coal tradeand therefore affected this country very closely.The Prime Minister asked the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs and the President of the Boardof Trade to keep in close touch on the matter ofour coal trade with France and Italy.8. The Cabinet took note of a Memorandumcommunicated to the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs by the French Ambassador on December 14,
9.   The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by xthe First Commissioner of Works (C.P.-7 (32)) onthe Government Building Programme.The Prime Minister asked that the memorandum should be communicated to the Unemployment PolicyCommittee..    He also asked the Minister of labour to examine the Memorandum carefully so far as itaffected his Department,   He invited the first commissioner of Works to do his best, so far as financial exigencies permitted, to carry out thebuilding works recommended by the Royal Commissionon National Museums.
