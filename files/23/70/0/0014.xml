CHINA and japan.Events at shangai.&apos; previous reference:Cabinet IS(32), Con-conclusion 1.)4z)l.1*    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs made to the Cabinet a full statement on the situationin the Far East, which may be summarised as follows.Last Thursday, while at Geneva, he had receiveda communication from Mr Stimson, the American Secretaryof State, saying that he had prepared a very secret and pressing document on the application of the Nine-Power Pact to the Far Eastern situation, with aview to publication.   He was most anxious that theUnited Kingdom should be associated with his Govern-ment in this statement, but he intended to make itpublic whether we joined him or not.   The document was too confidential to be dictated on the telephone.The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had repliedthat he was anxious to act in the closest co-operationwith the United States of America.   Mr Stimson had then telegraphed the text to Geneva, and it had reached Sir John Simon at the moment of his departurefor London last Saturday.   The British Ambassador&apos;sadvance description of the document as a &quot;strongindictment&quot; of Japan had not proved quite correct.It was rather a typical American draft, drawing attention at length to the fact that the Nine-PowerTreaty was still valid and that its signatories were still bound by it,   Nevertheless, it was a strongerprotest than had been made hitherto.   A meeting hadbeen held on Monday afternoon in the Nursing Homewhere the Prime Minister was convalescent, at which,besides the Prime Minister and the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, there had been present the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor War, the Secretary of State for Dominion affairs and the First Lord of the Admiralty.   The lord president of the Council had not been present ashe had to see the Judges.    It had been thought that,on the whole, the best course would be for theCouncil of the League to make some measured appealto Japan, on lines similar to&apos; those proposed byMr Stimson, and to make an effort to synchronisethe two.    In the meanwhile a demand had arisen atGeneva for something to be done at once.    the delegation had reported information from theSecretary-General of the League of Nations &quot;that several members of the Council attach greatest importance to addressing appeal without delay to japanese Government before development of hostilities-ties at Shanghai, which appears imminent&quot;.   As aresult of the meeting of Ministers referred toabove, a message had been sent to Geneva suggestinglines of anthe/ appeal to Japan by the Council of the League.The result was that on the previous evening the twelve members of the Council (excluding the repre-sentatives of China and Japan) had decided to address an appeal to Japan.    Of course that appeal would have to be sent to the Japanese before publication.   The Secretary of State, however, had insisted that it must be published as soon aspossible after presentation, as all sorts ofrumours would spring up the moment that its exist-ence&apos;was known.The Secretary of State continued that he hadreceived from Geneva (telegram No.68 L.N.) the text of the appeal to Japan as finally approvedon the previous evening.   He summarised the appeal,-2-
reading many passages in full (Appendix to these minutes).    The Secretary of State&apos;s commentary onthe document was that it was not quite in the formthat he would have wished, but it was an immenseimprovement on the first draft. - Later in the meeting he informed the Cabinet that,according to a messagejust received from Geneva, the appeal had had acomparatively favourable reception from the JapaneseChief Delegate.   During the Meeting he received a message that the appeal was to be published&apos; atGeneva at 6 p.m.   He proposed, however, to telegraphasking for earlier publication, for. the benefit ofthe evening newspapers in London.   Before leaving the subject of negotiations at Geneva he paid a tribute to the help rendered at Geneva by theSecretary of State for Air in circumstances ofconsiderable difficulty,,   The Secretary of Statementioned that the strongest clamour for actionagainst Japan came from quarters which could renderlittle or no assistance to the League in the eventof serious reactions in the Par East.   He had heard that morning that some of these people were goingabout at Geneva saying that they did not agree inthe Council&apos;s message.    He had even read in the&quot;newspapers of two members/ of the Council who had informed the japanese ambassador that they regretted their association in the appeal.On the previous day the United States Charge&apos;d&apos;Affaires had twice visited the Foreign Office.On the first occasion he had expressed satisfactionat what was being done, accompanied by regret thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government could not associate them-selves in Mr Stimson&apos;s draft.   On the second occasion,however, he had stated that Mr Stimson now felt- -3-        ,
some hesitation about America proceeding alone inaddressing a Note to Japan, and that in thesecircumstances there was likely to be a change of plans.    In fact, there might be no American Note.The Secretary of State mentioned the following two points for the consideration of the Cabinet.Firstly, since it was impossible for this countryalone to assume the burden of Japanese resentment,he had given instructions to the Press Departmentto promise the publication of the text of the communication as soon as possible and to impressin the meantimeon journalists^that the document was in the natureof an appeal from the League to Japan and was notminatory in intention, and that we had done allpresentwe could to secure that it should take they form.Secondly, he would have to make some answer inParliament to the following Question to be put tohim that afternoon by Mr Mander:-&quot;To ask the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, if. he will considerproposing that the Council of theLeague of Nations should put intoforce in the case of Japan theresolution concerning the applicationof Article 16 of the Covenant adoptedby the Assembly of the League on 4thOctober 1921 for the withdrawal of ambassadors and ministers and theestablishment of an effective blockade of the sea-board of the covenant-breaking state:    and whether thesematters have already been underconsideration by the Council of theLeague&quot;.In view of the possible misinterpretation in some quarters of the Council&apos;s appeal as a precursor of sanctions, he suggested that it might be expedient to give a hint in the answer that we had no intentionof resorting to sanctions.The Secretary of State then gave some particulars of the situation in the Far East.   There appearedevery prospect of a battle taking place at Shanghai.
Prom the point of view of the security of theSettlement, it appeared better that the Japaneseshould succeed than the Chinese.   He also mentionedone or two minor Incidents that were rather disturb-ing.   For example, while at Geneva he had receiveda visit from the Portuguese Ambassador, who, atthe end of a conversation on other matters, had told him that the Japanese Consul at Hong-Honghad enquired whether,in the event of the trouble in China spreadingfurther south, Japanese refugees from Hong-Kongcould be received at Macao.   He also mentioned thatthe Japanese Ambassador, M. Matsudaira, who, so faras he could judge, was a good friend to this country,had visited him at Geneva in order to convey hisown sense of concern at the excited atmosphere in tokyo.The Secretary of State then recalled that Chinawished for a Meeting of the Assembly for considera-tion of the Par Eastern question.   The suggestion had been made that before the Council accepted this claim there should be a second pronouncementcontaining a very strong expression of view    onthe Japanese proceedings.   The Secretary of state had felt jtistified in   using ^ the Government-&apos;s name inthe matter in the following extract from telegram No.138to Geneva, dated February 16th:-&quot;The Secretary of State and, indeed,the whole British Government are wholly opposed to the Councilpronouncing judgment in a matter which is not completely before themand which is being transferred fromtheir jurisdiction to another body.It is contrary to the first principlesof jurisprudence that judgment shouldbe pronounced before the case of theparties has been fully heard.   Japanhas not yet delivered a statement ofher ease to the Secretary-General,
and Sir John Simon oannot authorise,insofar as the British Government isconcerned, the extraordinary procedure suggested.    Since the jurisdiction isbeing taken away&quot; from the Council it isimpossible that the Council should claimto exercise it.    If there is any doubtfelt on this point or the position heretaken up is not plain, Sir John must ask that the Council does not deal withuntil he reaches Geneva.    In no circum-stances will the British Government bea party to pronouncing judgment in a cause which has not &quot;been fully        &apos; &apos; &quot;heard and in which the party to becondemned has not yet stated its ease.This is, according to British notions,elementary justice.&quot;He thought it unlikely that the Council would meetbefore Friday, as the Japanese were raising techniaalobjections to the case going to the Assembly.The first report of the local Commission of Consuls-General set up at Shanghai at the request of theSecretary-General to the League of Nations contained a very fair description of the origin of these events and made it clear that the Chinese authorities hadbeen behind the boycott, that the Japanese hadserious grievances and had been badly treated evenin the Chinese Courts of Justice.    The second report had not yet reached London, but from a Press summaryhe gathered that it was damaging to Japan.   He had promised the Leader of the Opposition that as soonas these reports were available he would print them as a Parliamentary Paper.At a later stage of the Meeting the Secretary ofState referred to a telegram received that morningfrom Tokyo to the effect that the United states ambassador had received instructions to present amemorandum protesting against the use of the ShanghaiSettlement as a base, if and when the british ambassador received similar instructions.   The UnitedStates Ambassador had sent a long telegram to his
Government explaining the reasons why such action would do more harm than good,- a telegram in whichHis MajestyTs Ambassador had entirely concurred.The latter had Informed the United States ambassador that he did not expect to receive instructions(Tokyo telegram No .107).   The Secretary of Stateadded that he understood that the American memorandumincluded demands for Japan to pay for every pennyof damage in Shanghai.In the course of the discussion that followed,the Cabinet were informed that an article in the&quot;New Statesman&quot; by the Editor of the &quot;Journal deGenevre&quot;had contained the statement that it waswell known that Great Britain had some understanding with Japan as a condition of the latter accepting the London Naval Treaty.    This had been denied.In Geneva, however, rumours were still being putabout that Great Britain did not want Japan checked,was blocking the Council&apos;s action, and was not infavour of the Assembly being summoned.    It was known that a private communication to this effect had beensent to the American Secretary of State by Americanjournalists.   There was evidently a definite move to place any responsibility for the failure of theLeague on our shoulders.Consideration was given to the answer to theParliamentary Question quoted above.The Secretary of State reported that the fall ofthe French Government had delayed matters atGeneva, and this would affect the date of his return.There was general agreement that the ministers who had been meeting informally to discuss questionsof emergency arising out of events at Geneva orShanghai, should continue to do so,
9Q7The Cabinet agreed -(a) To take note of the statement madeby the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs and summarised above, and to,approve his policy and actions:(b) That in regard to the parliamentary question quoted above,(i) the Rome Secretary should do his best to induce Mr Manderto withdraw the Question:(ii) if that appeal failed, the reply should not be limitedto a negative but should explain that the question had been referred to theAssembly;    that neither sidehad yet put in its ease;    andthat any action pre-judgingthe issue was to be deprecated:(e) To leave to the discretion of theSecretary of State for ForeignAffairs the date of his return toG-eneva:(d) That the following members, who hadalready been meeting informally toconsider emergency questions con-nected writh affairs in the far east, should now form a CabinetCommittee for the purpose:-The Prime Minister (in the Chair,,The Lord President of the Council,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,^he Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for Air,    sThe Secretary of State for India,The First Lord of the Admiralty:3*   Added under instructions from the Prime Minister.(e) That, in view of the critical stateof affairs both at Shanghai and Geneva,the Cabinet should hold themselves in readiness for a Meeting at short noticeif the necessity&apos;should arise.(NQ^E:    At the conclusion of the discussion summarised above, the First Lord of the Admiraltyinformed the Cabinet of casualties to twoseamen of the British Navy, at Shanghai.)
2.    The Cabinet had before them the following documents relating to the Malta Royal Commission,A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, circulating copies of theReport of the Royal Commission,  (Paper No.CP. 73 (32));A Memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Colonies (Paper No. CP. Jk- (52)),strongly recommending the adoption, forimmediate action, of the Commissionsmain recommendations, which may be summed up as follows:-(A) The services of Ministers shouldbe dispensed with;(3) The Constitution should be restored;(C) An Election should take plaoe.Some comments were made on minor points raised in the Report of the Royal Commission,but no decision was asked in regard to them.The Secretary of State for the colonies informed the Cabinet that he had received a telegramfrom the Governor of Malta in which it was made clearthat matters would be facilitated locally if theGovernment&apos;s announcement could be made on all therecommendations&apos;of the Royal Commission simultaneously.In xoarticular this would be helpful in securing the resignation of the Prime Minister of Malta.The Cabinet agreed -(a) That the question should be deferred until material was available for adecision on all the recommendationsof the Report of the Royal Commission;(b) That the Secretary of State for theColonies should discuss the matter withthe Parliamentary Under-Secretary and permanent Under-Secretary of State,.Foreign Office, with a view to the presentation of agreed recommendations to the Cabinet on the Royal Commission^Report;(c) That the question should be placed onthe Agenda for the next Meeting of theCabinet.
3.    The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet thathe was now hoping for a satisfactory settlement ofthe question of Judges&apos; Salaries..     The CabinetCommittee had met representatives of the judges and informed them that it was impossible tointroduce legislation,      The Lord President of theCouncil was to visit the Law Courts next Tuesday,and speak to the whole of the Judges.     He hopedthat the result of that meeting would be that the judges would consent to the cuts and the Governmentwould state that they did not desire to interfere in the independence or prestige of the Judges.The Lord President of the Council proposed to announce that he would make a statement on thesubject in parliament at the end of next week.The Secretary of State for Scotland asked that there might be sufficient interval betweenthe interview   between the Lord President of theCouncil and the Judges and the announcement inParliament to enable him to see the Judges of theScottish Court of Session.The Home Secretary was asked to ascertain whether any action was necessary as regards the judges of Northern Ireland.
yITINC 4.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Home Secretary,  (paper No.. CP. 71  (32)), on\ the subject of Sky Writing, which has been publiclycriticised, mainly from the point of view of the amenities of the general public.     After giving thepoint of view of the Home Office and of the defence departments,  the Home Secretary recommended theappointment of a Select Committee, of the House ofCommons, for the purpose of investigating both&quot;Sky Writing&quot; and &quot;Sky-Shouting&quot;.The Cabinet approved that the Houseof Commons should be asked to set upa Select Committee for the purpose ofinvestigating both &quot;Sky-Writing&quot; and&quot;Sky-Shouting&quot;.-11-
u r\ 1*/ -j 15.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by theSecretary,  (Paper No. CP. 75.(52)), covering aReport by the Oversea Defence Sub-Committee of theCommittee of Imperial Defence,  (Paper No. C.I.D. 5&amp;7-C),on the proposed reduction in strength of the King&apos;sAfrican Rifles.      It was explained in the Note thatthe subject was brought before the Cabinet as oneof urgency,  as it had not been found possible toarrange a meeting of the Committee of ImperialDefence.      The Oversea Defence Committee recommendedthat the recent recommendation of the Committee ofImperial Defence for the abolition of one of theReserve Battalions of the King&apos;s African Rifles shouldbe rescinded,  and that instead the proposed economyshould be spread throughout all the Battalions ofthe King&apos;s African Rifles in accordance with theproposals made by the Inspector-General of the King&apos;sAfrican Rifles.The Cabinet approved the proposal ofthe Oversea Defence Committee as setforth in CP.  75 (?2) ,  and summarised above.

8.    The Cabinet had before them Memoranda   by        .1Sir V. Wellesley and Sir J. Pratt on Anglo-Japanese    Irelations and the present crisis in China,  circulated if by direction of the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs  (paper No. CP. 65 (32)).Sir V. Wellesley&apos;s Memorandum includes thefollowing passage, which indicates to some extentits general trend:-&quot;The danger as I see it lies in adefinite Anglo-American anti-Japaneseattitude - especially if it wererealised that we were acting at thebidding of America in order to suitour interests elsewhere.      Such an attitude would be regarded by Japanas abandonment by her old ally;    itwould be attended by the consequences to be expected from such a conviction.&quot;Sir J. Pratfs Memorandum suggested onthe last page that if America .and Great Britainsevered diplomatic and economic relations with japan, she would settle accounts with China in her own way,  showing her contempt by riding rough-shodover British interests in the Far East;    withoutresorting to illegal means she could oust british control from the International Settlement at shangai;    she might turn the Settlement into anannexe to a new Japanese concession extorted from china;    she could force China to exclude british vessels     from the coasting trade and British interestsfrom the railways,  and make it impossible for Britishbanks,  insurance companies or merchants to carry on.Once embarked upon this course,  Japan would end byleaving the League.     Unless we were prepared towithdraw from the Far East it might be difficult to escape eventually being drawn into war.     By protesting
and doing nothing more the consequences may be much the same.      Japan would treat our protests with increasing contempt, and eventually we should be faced with the same alternatives.The Gabinet took note of theabove Memoranda.
IlMPORT 9.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies reportedfas BILL. .that the question of giving preference to Palestine.loSed would arise in connection with Clause 5 (2) of thelerence toIstine. Import Duties Bill, which gave power to extendpreference to Mandated Territories by Order in Council,fviouslerence: This had generally been read as including Palestine,linet 10, Con- and had given satisfaction.      There was, however,a legal doubt, not in respect to Class B and Csion 2).fit.IbQV^iif Mandates, but only Class A Mandates.      He himself,fortified by an Opinion given by Sir John Simon someyears ago, had submitted the question once more tothe Law Officers, who, however, had confirmed theOpinion of their predecessors that it was not opento this country to give preference to Palestine underthe terms of Article 22 of the Covenant read inconjunction with the most-favoured-nation clause in commercial treaties.      He had then enquired of theLaw Officers as to what the consequences of doing so would be.      The Law Officers had advised that thequestion was not one that can be brought up in the municipal Courts of any country,  and the only action that could be taken would be an appeal to The Hague court or to the League of Nations under certain articlesof the Covenant,Discussion revealed a strong desire on thepart of the Cabinet to give preference to Palestine,but the Opinion of the Law Officers was felt topresent an obstacle.      The Cabinet were reminded thatthe view expressed some years ago by Sir John Simonwas supported by other legal authorities,  includingthe Legal Advisers of the Colonial Office and thePalestine Government.      In these circumstances therewas a strong sentiment in favour of granting the
preference and taking the risk, possibly a remoteone, of some other nation challenging its legality.The Cabinet agreed  -(a) That a Cabinet Committee,  composed as follows:-The Lord Chancellor,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for theColonies,should examine whether,  in the eventof a preference being granted to palestine and being subsequentlychallenged, our case would be not unreasonable;(b) That if the above Committee reportedthat our case would be not unreasonable,  the Secretary ofState for the Colonies shouldhave authority to make clear that palestine would be included within the scope of Clause 5^2)of the Import Duties Bill.
THE IRISH 10.    The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsREE STATE.warned the Cabinet that if the General Electionlections in. in the Irish Free State should result In the returnf*R of Mr. de Valera, a difficult situation would beproduced, and he might have to consult his colleagues on questions of urgency.Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.1 7th February,  1932.
APPENDIX.Telegram (en clalr) frem H.M.&apos;s Consul (Geneva).R.    7.15 p*m., 16th February, 1932.No.  68 1.1.     (BY TELEPHONE,.)Following from Mr. Cadogan:I give below/ text of appeal t-9 Japan as finally approvedby the twelve this evenings....................................&quot;As President of the Council on &quot;behalf of his colleaguespointed out on 29th January in an appeal addressed to both parties &quot;good relations between States could only be secured&quot;by co-operation and mutual respect and that no permanent solution could be achieved by force whether military ormerely economic, and that the longer the present situationcontinued, the wider the breach between the two- peoples wouldbecome and the more difficult the solution would be, with allthe disasters that would mean not only to the. two nationsdirectly involved, but to the world in general&quot;..The twelve members of the Council other than the Chinese^and Japanese representatives feel constrained today to makea pressing appeal to Government of Japan to recognise very special responsibility for forbearance and restraint whichdevolved upon it in the present conflict, in virtue **f p-vsi-  -tion of Japan as a member *f the League of Nations and apermanent- member of its Council.The situation which has developed, in the Far East, during.- past mouths will be fully studied &quot;by the Commission appointed with consent of .both..parties-.    But since Commission .vas set.up there have occurred and are still occurring events at an^
near Shanghai which have intensified, public anxiety through-out the world which endanger lives and interests of nationals of numerous countries,  and. to the unexampled difficulties with which whole.world is faced in present crisis and. threaten to throw new and serious obstacles in the path of theDisarmament Conference.The twelve members of the Council are far from disregard-ing grievances advanced by Japan and throughout all thesemonths has given her full confidence which, they owed to anassociate of long standing who had ever been punctilious in fulfilment of all her obligations and duties as a member, ofthe Communitjr of Nations.They cannot but regret,  however,  that she has not found it possible to make full use of methods of peaceful settlementprovided in the Covenant;    and recall once again solemn under-taking of Pact of Paris that solution of international dis-putes shall never be sought by other than peaceful means.They cannot but recognise that, from beginning of conflictwhich is taking place on her territory,. China has put her casein the hands of the League and agreed to accept its proposalsfor a peaceful settlement.The twelve members of the Council recall the terms ofArticle 10 of the Covenant by which all members of the Leaguehave undertaken to respect anc&apos; preserve territorial integrity and existing political independence of all members of theLeague.      It is their friendly right to direct attention tothis provision,  particularly as it appears to them to follow that no invasion of territorial integrity and no change in thepolitical independence of any member- of the League, brought
about in disregard oi this article,  ought to&quot; be recognised asvalid and effectual by members oi the League of Nations.Japan have an incalculable responsibility before  publicopinion of the world to be just and restrained in her relationswith China.      She has already acknowledged this responsibility in most solemn terms by becoming one of signatories to the nine  Power Treaty of 1925 whereby contracting Powers expresslyagreed to respect sovereignty, the independence and territorial and administrative integrity of China.The twelve members of the Council appeal to Japan!s highsense of honour to recognise obligations of her special positionand of the confidence which the nations have placed in her as a partner in the organisation and maintenance ofpeac e. nAbove text is being embodied in a letter which will be delivered, to the Japanese delegate this evening,      It will beissued to Tress some time tomorrow.(Hi)
