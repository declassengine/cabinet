rppj BALANCEOP TRADE.(previous reference:Cabinet 5(33), Oon-clusion 2.)fx,The Cabinet resumed the discussion begun that morning on the Balance of Trade.    mhe whole dis-cussion is summarised below.There was general agreement that it was essentialto meet Parliament with definite proposals.   Thelong-term proposals contained in the memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal (CP .-31 (32)) and theHome Secretary (C.P.-32 (32.)), e.g., getting rid of war debts and reparations;    re-organisationof industry; international disarmament:     re-distribution of world stocks of gold; and thelowering of high tariff walls in all countries;were not contested.    It was pointed out, however,that they had all been included in the programmes of previous Governments and it had been foundvery difficult to make much progress in regard tothem..   There was general agreement that alone theydid not provide a sufficiently definite basis for a policy to be presented to Parliament.The discussion therefore focussed in the mainon the proposals for immediate action containedin the Report of the Cabinet Committee (CP.-25(32)) and the alternative suggestions of the HomeSecretary (C.P.-32 (32)), which were discussed at full length both, in their economic and political aspects .The main criticisms of the Report of the CabinetCommittee were that the estimated adverse balanceof trade ( 150,000,000) was founded on an incom-plete statistical basis;    that the dangers of the adverse balance were exaggerated;    that the costof living to the poorest sections of the community would be unduly increased by Duties on food;that the cost of manufacture would be increased
by the taxation of raw materials, and especiallysemi-manufactured raw materials;    that exports,which it was essential to increase, would decrease,partly owing to the enhanced cost due to taxation of raw materials and partly owing to the restric-tion of imports;    that the experience of foreigncountries showed that the tariff weapon had not proved successful in reducing tariffs of othercountries;    that the 10 per cent, flat ratetariff must inevitably become permanent owing tothe political difficulties that would arise inits removal;    that the proposals were not consist-ent with pledges given at the General Election;that they were not a compromise, but were&quot;thefirst steps towards/ a full Protectionist programme, including anall-round tariff (the wheat quota being substitutedfor a wheat Duty), a fighting tariff and highspecific Diities .To these points it was replied that the statistical basis of the Report had been preparedby a strong Committee of Officials, which did not admit the criticism;    that theproposals did not depend upon the precise accuracy of the statistical estimate of the amount of the adverse balance of trade, since it was sufficiently large to require action in any event;    that withoutaction to correct the balance of trade   there wasthe gravest risk of a deterioration of the     apoint developed in some detail;    that the effectof a heavy fall in the value of the   sterling would be far more serious than would the proposals contained In the Majority Report of the Committee,both on the cost of living and the cost of manufac-ture r
that according to independent estimates by theMinistry of Labour, the Board of Trade and theTreasury, the proposals of the Report wouldinvolve only a small rise in the cost of living and. not bring it within range of the danger point;that the relation between the imports and exportsclaimed by the critics of the Majority report could not be proved:    it was admitted that theestimated increase in exports might not, berealised in the first year, but this made it moreimportant from the point of view of the balanceof trade to restrict imports;    that efforts toreduce tariff walls without a fighting tariffhad proved useless;    that the tariffs proposedin the Majority Report were the only means ofpenetrating the tariff walls of other nations,as was proved by approaches already being madeby foreign nations;    that tariffs were also necessary as a lever for securing the re-organisa-tion of industry, for which other methods had failed; . that a large proportion of the House ofCommons had been elected on Tariff Policy and. thewhole country was expecting action on these lines;that the Majority Report was not inconsistent with the Prime Minister&apos;s pledges;    that theproposals had involved a large measure of compromise-mise by supporters of a tariff, who had abandonedtaxes on wheat and meat, and admitted thepossibility of some further exemptions of detail.The proposals of the Home Secretary&apos;s report were criticised as inadequate for presentation toParliament.    It was suggested that the cabinet could not survive with proposals less than those contained in the Majority Report.    Some members of
the Cabinet who accepted the proposals of theMajority Report with some difficulty^ and inview of the national crisis, pressed that whatever dangers it might involve were less thanthe dangers of a break-up of the national government.Agreement had not been reached when theCabinet adjourned at 5-30 p.m.(NOTE: A-t the request of certain membersof the Cabinet the Prime Ministerauthorised the Secretary toprepare a fuller summary of thediscussion, which will be circulated later.)Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,January 21, 1932.
