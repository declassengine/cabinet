THE DISARMAMENT 1. The Prime Minister informed the CabinetCONFERENCE. ,  that he had received information that a good dealDate of Depart-ure of Delegates.of the first week of the Disarmament Conference(Previous would be occupied in consideration of Rules ofReference: ^Cabinet 4 Procedure, which would probably be referred to a(32), Con-elusion 2.) Committee and then reported back to the fullF.R. Conference.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom would have to be represented onthat Committee, whose Report might have animportant bearing on the work of the Conference.It hardly seemed necessary, however, that thewhole of the Delegation of the United kingdom should be present for that stage, more especially as the simultaneous absence of all the cabinet ministers who were Delegates would weaken theCabinet during the first week of Parliament.The Prime Minister added that he himself couldnot visit Geneva before the week beginning SundayFebruary 7th, and possibly not at its outset.The Cabinet were informed that the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary ofState for Dominion Affairs had arranged to meetthe Delegations of the British Commonwealth atGeneva on Monday next, February 1st.    It wassuggested, that possibly this meeting might be postponed for a few days.The Cabinet agreed -That the following Ministers, whoare Delegates at the Conference, -The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The Secretary of State for DominionAffairs,The Secretary of State for War,The Secretary of State for Air,The First Lord of the Admiralty,The Secretary of State for India(Head of the Indian Delegation) -should meet the same afternoon at-1-
4 p.m. in the Room of theSecretary of State for india at the India Office, in orderto arrange among themselveswhich Delegates should be present during the first week of the Conference.

In order to provide machinery for dealingrapidly with messages received from the UnitedKingdom Delegation at Geneva during the Disarma-ment Conference, the Cabinet agreed  That the following arrangements should be made:-I. A Cabinet Committee shouldbe set up for the consider-ation of questions of Policy:-The Prime Minister,The Lord President of the Council,The Lord Privy Seal,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Home secretary and any Minister who is amember of the Delegationwho might happen to be athome at the time.II. An Inter-Departmental Committeeshould be set up to considerquestions of detail, withrepresentatives of -The Foreign Office       (In the Chair).The Treasury,The Admiralty,The War Office,The Air Ministry,The India Office,The Dominions Office,with authority to call in repre-sentatives of other Departmentswho may be concerned.
3. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurymade a statement to the Cabinet as to the programmeof business of the Rouse of Commons until the easter adjournment, particulars of which are contained in Appendix I.The Prime Minister explained that this programme was for the information of the Cabinet only andwould not be----annotinced.After disetission the Cabinet agreed - (a) That notwithstanding the decision taken on December 7, 1931 (Cabinet85 (31), Conclusion 3(b)),  it wouldbe unavoidable to take all private members&apos; time up to Easter:(b) That the provisional programme ofbusiness mentioned at the Meetingon December 10th (Cabinet 87 (31),Conclusion 1)) would have to berecast (as the Prime Minister had at the time indicated was not improbable), and that, subject tothe approval of the Speaker of theHouse of Commons, the new programme for the first week should be asfollows:-TUESDAY,  FEBRUARY 2nd. WAYS AND MEANSRESOLUTIONS in committee,  PRELIM-INARY TO THE INTRO-DUCT ION OF the adverse BALANCE OFTRADE BILL.WEDNESDAY,  FEBRUARY 3rd. MOTION TO TAKE THETIME OF private members:      MOT IONAPPROVING THE BOARDOF TRADE IMPORTORDER No.3.THURSDAY,  FEBRUARY 4th.COMPLETION OF ways and MEANS resolution passed IN COMMITTEE.FRIDAY.  FEBRUARY 5th.VOTE OF CENSURE,   IFPUT DOWN BY THEOPPOSITION, AND&apos; PROVIDED THEY are willing. TO ACCEPT AFRIDAY:    OR, AS ANALTERNATIVE,  MOTIONAPPROVING IMPORTORDERS BY THE MINISTRYOF AGRICULTURE ANDFISHERIES.(NOTE-: ^he Cabinet left the Prime Minister full authority to vary the above programmeif it was found impossible- to carry it out:
for example, if the Opposition was-unable to acceptof Censure.)a Friday for a VoteTown and country planning Bill.(Pr previous Re fer enc e:Cabinet 3 (32), Con-elusion 2.)The Children and young Persons Bill.(Pr previous Re fer enc e:Cabinet 3 (32) , Con-clusion 1.)(c) That a Private Notice question should be arranged in order togive the Prime Minister anopportunity of stating that theabove programme was designed,while giving every facility for debate, to avoid wasting the timeof the House:&apos;(d) That for the Adverse Balance ofTrade Bill a Guillotine motion should be prepared and broughtinto operation before the Billis being discussed:(e) That the introduction of the Townand Country Planning Bill and. theChildren and Young Persons bill would have to be postponed until later in the Session.    The decision as to the date when they should beintroduced, and whether in the Houseor Lords or the House of Commons,should be postponed for a week ortwo pending enquiries by the ministers concerned as to how far they were likely to be opposed, whether on merits or for the purpose ofdelaying other measures,  such asthe Adverse Balance of Trade Bill:(f) To take note of a forecast by theParliamentary Secretary to theTreasury of business in Parliamentafter Faster up to the end of July(Appendix II) showing that theprogramme is already over-loadedand that there is a risk of having to curtail the normal Easter andWhitsun Recesses and/or to sit intoAugust.
HZ4. In the course of the preceding discussionattention was drawn to the very serious leakage of information in the Press on the subject ofthe Report of the Cabinet Committee on the Balanceof Trade - (CP.-25 (32))..    This leakage had occurred in a considerable part of the Press, but in thecase of an article in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; itwas stated that the language used was almostidentical with that of the Cabinet Committee&apos;sReport.The Cabinet were reminded that this was a particularly serious case of leakage, since, apartfrom its political inconvenience, it was liableto prompt forestalling of Duties by forced imports.The Secretary was asked to make certain enquiries.
1-J35.    The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs gave the Cabinet full particulars of the lateststage of the negotiations with the French and german governments on the subject of Reparations and theproposed Lausanne Conference.     Last Friday (January22nd) M. Laval had announced in the French Chamberthat he was making arrangements to meet the PrimeMinister.     The French President of the council had no authority for making this statement.      Never-theless,  the Cabinet Committee had done their best to facilitate a meeting, whether in London or inParis, and there had been an exchange of formulaewith the French Government..     Late on the evening of Sunday, January 2kth,  the Cabinet Committee had met and drawn up the following formula:-&quot;Belgian, British, French, German, italian and Japanese Governments having taken note of the conclusions of the Baslereport have agreed that the lausanne conference shall take place in the monthof May or June for the purpose of finding a lasting settlement of thefinancial and economic questions referredto in the Report.2.    The Creditor Governments whilereserving their rights under the existing agreements and without at presentseeking to make precise proposals forthe treatment that should be applied tothe period after July 1st next are agreed that the conclusions of theBasle Committee would not justify Germanybeing called upon to make any effectivereparation payments during the yearbeginning July 1st.&quot;M. Laval had not been able to accept this formula, and had replied to it with a countersuggestion for a Franco-British proposal for aConference at Lausanne in June on the widest terms ofreference.     For the moment the gap between theBritish and French points of view was rather widening.The difference was analysed in the last message from
Lord Tyrrell, No. 25, despatched on the 25th January,at if.10 p.m., in which the Ambassador explained that&quot;France would not bind herself (1) to reopen theYoung Settlement, save in conjunction with a settlementof the financial and economic questions  (includingobviously debts though she does not require this tobe specifically stated),  (2) to grant a furthermoratorium to Germany so long as she herself isunprotected vis-a-vis America.     The reason for (2)is that France will not risk default to America unlessGermany has defaulted to her.&quot;The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs pointed out that even if no Conference took placeGermany, from her own point of view, would not be in abad position.      If she had to default on her paymentsshe could point to the Basle Report as a reason forher not paying now and not being able to say when she could pay.     From the French point of view alsothere appeared to be something to be said in favourof a technical default by Germany as it would strengthen the French case for avoiding paying her war debts tothis country and to the United States of America.Consequently Europe appeared to be heading for a situation in which there might be no agreed suspension.The main object in an agreement from our point, ofview was to improve the economic position of europe and to reassure the City of London.     Possibly, however,these objects had been achieved by the new Standstillagreement.     The one point that was clear was thatwe must not be drawn into associating ourselves with france .in representations to the United States ofAmerica on the subject of war debts.      information was accumulating against any such course.      If no meeting
of the Lausanne Conference could be arranged some statement would have to be made to Parliament.     Hewas therefore drafting a despatch to the british ambassador in Paris, in a form suitable for publication.The Prime Minister added to the Secretary ofState&apos;s statement that, notwithstanding M. Laval&apos;s unauthorisedannouncement on Friday, he himself had been prepared toproceed to Paris with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on theprevious day, provided that a formula which offered someprospects of agreement was accepted in advance, and itwas not until mid-day that they received M.. Laval&apos;sfinal formula, which rendered the visit impracticable.The Cabinet took note of theabove statements.
G.   The Cabinet had before them a Memorandumby the Home Secretary (C.P.-26 (32)) circulating a Memorandum, by Sir John Anderson on the steps which are now required to bring into a state of full preparedness the organisation which is main-tained for the purpose of carrying on essential services in the event of an emergency of the kindcontemplated by the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.It was stated that the Supply and transport committee at a recent meeting had reached the unanimous conclusion that the steps referred toin Sir John Anders&apos;on*s Memorandum must be taken if the whole organisation is not to lose its value for the purpose for which it was designed,namely, as an instrument capable of being put to immediate use in the event of an emergency.   Theopinion of the Ministers present was that theCabinet should be asked forthwith to authorisethe taking of all steps necessary to complete theSupply and Transport Organisation and that itwould be impossible to find a more appropriate time than the present for taking this action.The Cabinet was therefore asked to approve ingeneral the removal of the ban on action involvingrisk of publicity.   The Committee also recommended the Cabinet to authorise the Home Secretary, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour, to take such steps as might be necessary to inform thepublic of the action taken.    The nature of theaction to be taken, involving a large number ofappointments, was specified in Sir John AndersonsNote attached to the Memorandum,
The Cabinet agreed  (a) That the Supply and Transport organisation*.ould be brought into a state of fullpreparedness, as proposed by theCabinet Committee, and that the ban onaction involving risk of publicity should be removed;(b) That no press communique should bepublished on the subject, but that if and when any information should leakout it should be dealt with by question and Answer in the House of Commons,care being taken to emphasise thatthis was an organisation that had existed for many years past undersuccessive Governments, and that themeasures now adopted were little morethan a matter of routine;(c) To take note that the Home Secretary would look into a technical question raisedduring the discuss  on as to whetherarrangements had been made to ensurethat plans or other information wereavailable to enable a volunteer inthe Power Station to know the use of thevarious switches and the areas to whichthey referred.
/.    The Home Secretary gave the Cabinet allparticulars that were as yet available as tothe recent outbreak among convicts at DartmoorPrison.
HEXT MEETING 8.    The Cabinet agreed  OF CABINET.To meet on the following day,WEDNESDAY,  JANUARY 27th,  at11.0 a,m., in the PRIME MINISTER&apos;room,  at 10, DOWNING STREET.2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.1.26th January, 1932.
APPENDIX      I.BUSINESS OF THE HOUSE UNTIL THE EASTER ADJOURNMENT.The Government has at its disposal from Tuesday, 2ndFebruary to Thursday, 24th March (on which day it will be neces-sary to take the Motion for the Easter Adjournment), allowingPrivate Members&apos;  their Wednesdays and Fridays, -Whole days  .......... 23Fridays  ,............   123-^It is estimated that 12 sittings will be required forthe Business of Supply (9 Supplementary Estimates, 1931:Money on Account for all Services, 1932, and consolidate fund Bill).......................................................12There are 3 Import Prohibition Orders outstandingwhich will require certainly 1 day........................     1The Gold Standard Amendment Bill is required by March21st (2nd Reading 1; Committee and 3rd Reading 1) ..........     2Town Planning Bill: 2nd Reading (already announced) :..     1Children&apos;s Bill:    2nd Reading (already announced)  ....     1Merchant Shipping Bill:    2nd Reading ^already announced)   \All stages of the Wheat Quota Bill are said to berequired by Easter (2nd Reading 2; Committee 3;Report and 3rd Reading 2)   .............     7Motion for Faster Adjournment........................     125JThis totals 25^ sittings without allowing any time for contingencies of any kinde.g, Votes of Censure,Special Debates,Chairman of Ways and Means Bills, etc.etc.or for the Unemployment Insurance (transitional payments) Bill,or for a Bill-to deal with the Adverse Balance ofTrade.It is therefore obvious that if a Bill to deal with the trade balance has to be passed through all its stages before Easterthe Government has no alternative but to take the whole timeof the House, that is to say, the 8 Wednesdays and 6 Fridays,available to Private Members.    If this is done the Governmentwill then have -whole sittings.......... 31Fridays ____.....7 ..-   3%34^ whole sittings.

- iii-APPENDIX      II.BUSINESS AFTER EASTER UP TO END OP JULY.An analysis of the urgent and essential Bills asclassified in the H.A.C. Conclusions 15 (51) leaves onlya margin of li days up to the end of July without allowing for Bills in categories stated to he required in certainevents, and by postponing.the Unemployment Insurance(Transitional Payments)  Bill until after Faster this isturned into minus l-g days . &quot;&quot;he calculation assumes a normalBudget requiring 13f- sittings, allowing for annual business and 4 days for Contingencies ,    If the Budget requires extrri.time the position will be much worse.   The programme isalready overloaded and there is a distinct risk of having to curtail the normal Easter and Whitsun recesses allowed for (namely adjournment from the Thursday or Friday to theTuesday week following) and/or sitting into August.
