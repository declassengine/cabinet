CHINA and japan.f     Events at shangai.(previous reference .*Cabinet 11(32)    ConT-elusion 1.)ex1,   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs,who had just returned from Geneva, said that he had had a conversation by telephone that morning withthe Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs at Geneva.The position at the moment was difficult and delicate.The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs recalled that on the day of the meeting of the DisarmamentConference he had thought it advisable to ask for ameeting of the Council of the League of Nations inorder to dispose of the strong rumours current in geneva that the United Kingdom was settling mattersat Shanghai with the United States, of America behind the back of the League.    One of his difficulties hadbeen that Lord Cecil, who had been representingthe United Kingdom on the Council, was personally infavour of a more forceful policy by the League towardsJapan.    On the previous day the Chinese Delegate haddemanded a meeting of the Council.   He gathered that both the Chinese and the Japanese Delegates had madestatements .   The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs had been careful to maintain a strictlyneutral attitude.   The danger-spot at present wasthat the Chinese might demand a meeting of theAssembly of the League.    Every effort was being madeto avert that.    In private conversations with the      ^American Delegates it had become clear that theUnited States intended to keep out of the matter asfar as possible.   Mr Stimson had contemplated the       \\publication of a statement, prepared more especially for consumption in the United States of America, butin the course of a conversation by telephone had agreed to refrain for the moment.    The Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs was hoping for a reportby the Japanese that their troops at Shanghai would
be used not in purely Japanese interests but for thedefence of the Settlement as a whole.   He had concluded by saying that the position, thotigh &apos;difficult and delicate, was not, he thought,insoluble.   The object of his policy was to keephis hands free, so that he could do his utmost tobring about- a peaceful settlement  .
HE DISARMAMENTONPERENOB-previous reference:Cabinet 10(32), Con-clusion 3.)2.   The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairsadded a few words on the subject of the DisarmamentConference.   The advocacy by &apos;the United StatesDelegate of a line of policy very similar to our ownhad been satisfactory.   He had heard that morningfrom the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs that Signor Grandi, the chief Italian Delegate, had made a statement in favour of abolition of submarines,capital ships, heavy guns, tanks&quot;, aggressive aircraft,and of/revision of the laws of war. All these matters,however, would come up for consideration in detail in due course.The Lord President of the Council thanked theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs for his statement and for what he had done. at. Geneva.
GOAL MINES.InternationalConventionLimiting Honrsof Work.(previous reference:Cabinet SI(30),  Con-clusion 11.)3.The Cabinet had before them a Note by thePresident of the Board of Trade (CP.-51 (32))covering a Memorandum by the Secretary for Mineson the International Convention Limiting Hours ofWork in Coal Mines, together with an amendment thereto,proposed after discussion with the Minister of Labour(CP.-66 (32)).   After a full account of the difficul-ties which have arisen in connection with this Inter-national Convention it was stated that the only alternative policies were to announce either -(i) That Great Britain has decided, owingto numerous practical difficultieswhich have emerged on further con-sideration of the Convention, thatshe cannot ratify it at all in itspresent form. This means the endof the Convention.Or(ii)        (as amended by CP.-66 (32))That His Majesty&apos;s Government isfavourably disposed towards theConvention.   The detailed applica-tion of some of its provisions tothe coal mines of this countrypresents certain problems which are under consideration at the presenttime but which it is anticipated willnot prove insuperable.    As soon as these points have been disposed of,the Government will be prepared to ratify the Convention provided thatthe other six countries principally concerned will do so at the sametime.The second course was the one recommended by theSecretary for Mines .    If the Cabinet decided toauthorise the issue of an announcement on these general lines he explained that the exact wording would beagreed subsequently between the Ministry of Labourand the Mines Department.In the course of the discussion the Secretary for mines was asked to consider a suggestion that, after his Statement in Parliament, arrangements should bemade for a Question to be put to him in the House of
Commons, in reply to which he would, make clear thatthe Statement must not be interpreted as a unilateralundertaking to legislate in advance of the adoptionof the Convention by other Powers .The Secretary for Mines urged that, before theStatement is made, the President of the Board ofTrade should see representatives of the mining association and explain the position to them indetail.This was left for arrangement betweenthe President of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary for Mines.The Cabinet agreed that it would be advisable to omit the following words from the alternativedraft fii),  &quot;at the present time but which it is&quot;anticipated will not prove insuperable&quot;.     some members were rather impressed by the difficulties involved, in some of the outstanding problems, andthe Cabinet were anxious that the Statement shouldnot raise unjustifiable hopes or contain words whichmight afterwards be quoted as an undertaking by theGovernment.The Cabinet agreed  That the Secretary for Mines shouldbe authorised to make the followingStat ement :-&quot;That His Majesty&apos;s Governmentis favourably disposed, towardsthe Convention.   The detailed application of some of its pro-visions to the coal mines of thiscountry presents certain problems which are under consideration.As soon as these points have been disposed, of, the Government willbe prepared to ratify the Conven-tion provided that the other six countries principally concerned will do so at the same time&quot;.(The Secretary for Mines withdrew atthis point.)
THE GOAL 4.   The Cabinet, had a short discussion of a situation.preliminary nature as to the position in the Coal-(Previous mining Industry in July, as the result of which the reference:Cabinet 56       President of the Board of Trade was ashed to keep(31), Con-elusion 5.)      in closest touch with the Secretary for Mines onthe development of the situation and to advise theCabinet from, time to time as he thought fit.
5.The Cabinet took note of the following memoranda by the First Lord of the Admiralty:-A Memorandum on the Naval construction programme (C.P.-47 (32)  &quot;Secret&quot;)reporting that the Chancellor of theExchequer had not been able to providefor an increase in the Navy estimates in order to prevent the date of orderingthe ships of the 19 31 programme beingpostponed so late as October, 1932,and that he was therefore completinghis Estimates on the basis of the postponement of those orders untilthe latter date.CP.-64 (32)  (&quot;Most Secret&quot;) explaining the effect of the postponement of theNaval Programme on the Ordnance factory at Woolwich and calling attention tothe Navy&apos;s serious deficiency in almost every kind of material required toenable it to carry out its duties inany sort of emergency.    It was explainedthat this was the result of the defence services having been rigidly subjectedfor many years past to the principle of&quot;No great war for ten years from any given date&quot;.   The position wasillustrated by a reference to theexposed state of the Naval resources and facilities at Hong-Kong, singapore and Trincomali.    The First Lord con-eluded that,on the basis of theexpenditure to which he had been limited in preparing the NavyPstimates for 19 32, no improvements in the position would be possible inthe next twelve months .   He wished the Cabinet to realise that theresponsibility for this fact wouldbe theirs .After the First Lord of the Admiralty had made a brief statement of the position and had emphasised the words underlined above, the Secretary of Statefor War informed the Cabinet that since coming into office he himself had been shocked at the unprepared-ness of the Army for the fulfilment of its responsi-bilities, and he contemplated the circulation of aMemorandum on the subject at an early date.   while recognising the difficulties imposed by the financial stringency, he agreed with the First Lord of theAdmiralty that it was not fair that the service ministers should bear&quot; the sole responsibility for
that position without the knowledge of their colleagues, who should share it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled thatin the time of the late Government the question ofthe assumption of ten years of peace from any givendate had been raised by the First Lord of theAdmiralty.    The matter had not been pressed, however,for the reason that&apos;the risk of destroying our financial stability had been considered even greaterthan the risks of unpreparedness.    He himself couldnot say that the financial position had improvedsince that time, and he thought it was unavoidableto adopt the same attitude.   He agreed, however, thatthe Cabinet should take their share of the responsi-bi.li.ty and that when financial conditions improvedthe matter must, be taken up again. ,The Lord President of the Council, with extremereluctance, agreed with the Chancellor of theExchequer.    After enquiring from the Secretary as tothe position of these matters in the Committee ofImperial Defence he said he was given to understandthat the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had had thematter under consideration that very week and were preparing a Memorandum on the effects of the assump-tion of ten years of peace from any given date.The suggestion was made that the Chiefs of staff should be asked also to render a Report on theexposed state of the Naval resources and facilities at Hong-Kong, Singapore and Trincomali, as mentioned by the First Lord of the Admiralty.The Lord President of the Council said that theproper course would be for the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee to report to the Committee of ImperialDefence, who would then meet and make their own
comments,.     These would be reported by the PrimeMinister for consideration by the Cabinet,      In themeantime he instructed the Secretary to inform theChiefs of Staff of the general tenor of this discus-sion.     He agreed that the Cabinet must share withthe Ministers at the head of the Defence services the responsibility for deficiencies in the Servicesresulting from the assumption of ten years of peacefrom any given date.     At the moment the financialposition governed the whole situation, but clearly the efficiency of the Defence Services would have tobe considered as soon as the results of the Disarma-m&amp;nt Conference are know:.(NOTE:    Owing to the absence of theService Ministers and thepolitical engagements of theLord President of the Council,the Secretary was instructedto postpone the Meeting of theCommittee of Imperial Defencearranged for Friday, February12 th.)-9-

J.    The Lord President of the Council said thata number of his colleagues now had to leave theCabinet Meeting in order to attend a memorial service to the late Mr. William Graham.

APPENDIX,Proposed Statement on agricultural and Fisheries Policy.(Revised Draft. )1. At the present time practically the whole of agriculturelike the whole of industry is suffering from the effects of thegeneral fall of commodity prices which has been experienced withsuch severity since the autumn of 1939.2. The branch of agriculture which has suffered most fromthe fall in prices is&apos; wheat growing, and the Government proposeto assist growers of this crop by means of a quota scheme whichwill provide them with a guaranteed market and an enhanced price for wheat of mi Hals le  quality.      Full details of this scheme willbe available to the House shortly when the Bill dealing with thematter is introduced.3. The Government attach great importance to a long-rangepolicy, but immediate action is necessary, and accordingly,with the exception of wheat, wool and meat, all agricultural and horticultural produce has been included within the scope of theImport Duties Bill now before the House.4. Under that Bill as introduced all agricultural and horticultural products., with the exceptions I have referred toand of produce already chargeable with a Customs Duty, will besubject to the general tariff of 10 per cent, ad valorem, or its equivalent in specific duties.      An additional Customs Dutymay be Imposed on any particular product if recommended by theImport Duties Advisory Committee provided for in this 8111, andin this connection malting barley and certain horticulturalproducts will receive particular attention.5. The administrative feasibility of levying an additionalCustoms duty on malting barley is being examined with a view tothis question being referred to the Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee at the earliest possible date if a practicable scheme
for differentiating at the port between malting barley and feeding barley can be evolved.    The alternative method of a quota is also under consideration.6. The Import Duties Advisory Committee will also beasked to recommend what duties should be imposed on the commodities at present covered by the Horticultural Products(Emergency Customs Duties) Act, 1931, when duties under thatAct expire.7. The foregoing proposals refer to immediate action. TheGovernment&apos;s long-range policy is designed to facilitateeconomic development in those branches of the agricultural industry which are likely to be the most remunerative, andparticularly those which lend themselves to most rapid development.8. In regard to milk and milk products the Government aimparticularly at the improvement of marketing and have decidedto set up a Reorganisation Commission under the agricultural marketing Act, 1931, with a view to the formulation of a scheme.They will also investigate the means of securing a reductionof disease among dairy herds.    Imports of milk and milk pro-ducts are being dealt with under the Import Duties BI11-9. With regard to bacon the preparation of a scheme forthe organisation of the bacon industry will be undertakenforthwith, and, provided a satisfactory scheme is evolved,the Government is prepared to adopt some form of quantitative regulation of imports.10.        The Government also undertake to appoint a Re-organisa-tion Commission, if desired by potato growers, with instruc-tions to prepare a scheme for the organisation and marketing of the home potato crop and to consider such practicablecomplementary action as may appear to be necessary for the regulation of imports of main crop potatoes.
-x2 S3lie The Government also intend, as far as financial circumstances permit, to maintain and develop agricultural education and research and to continue the National Markmovement and the policy of land settlement,12, While the Government do not propose  to make any changein the present system of regulating agricultural wages theyare fully alive to the necessity of securing observance ofthe Orders made under the Agricultural Wages (Regulation)Act, and they wish to call the attention of agricultural workers to the facilities which exist for the investigation by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries of complaintsthut the requirements of these Orders are not being observed.Fisheries.13. Immediate help to the Fishing Industry will be afforded by the Customs Duties proposed in the Import Duties Bill,Further action which may be necessary in connection with the fishing Industry will be taken after full consideration hasbeen given to the Report of the Economic Advisory Councilon the Fishing Industry which has lust been presented toParliament.General.14. Obviously the future of any industry must depend largely on its own efforts,to adapt its methods of productionand marketing to modern conditions, and it Is believed that .the Government&apos;s policy will do much to restore confidence and stimulate endeavour    In the two great industries ofagriculture and fisheries, which play so important a part inthe economic life of the nation.
