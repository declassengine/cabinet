JUDGES&apos;tiALARISS.(previous reference:Cabinet If(^2), Con-conclusion ion 9) -1.    The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinetthat the question of Judges&apos; Salaries was nowsettled and that all the Judges were in agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer warned the Lord Chancellor that serious difficulties had arisen in connection with the income-taxprovisions of the settlement.
THE BALANCE.OP TRADE.Import DutiesBill.(previous reference:Cabinet 7(32)    Con-clusion 3.)n62.The Cabinet had before them the following papers relating to the Balance of Trade:-A Most Secret Note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP .-49 (32)),covering the draft of an ImportDuties Bill based on the Report ofthe Cabinet Committee on the Balanceof &apos;Trade, which had been prepared incon. ultation with the Departmentsconeerned:A Memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP.-48 (32)) circulating./in accordance with Cabinet 5 (32j^Conclusion 2,  a Memorandum preparedjointly by the Treasury and theBoard of Trade showing the separate and collective effects on the costof living of the following Reportsbefore the Cabinet:-(i) The Report on the Balance ofTrade (CP.-25 (32)), notoverlooking the 10 per cent,increase in the cost ofimports assumed at the endof paragraph 18 of the Report:(ii) A Report by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries onthe Wheat Quota (CP.-22 (32)):(iii) A Report of the agricultural policy Committee (CP.-21 (32)).Discrimination A Memorandum by the President of clause. the Board of Trade (CP.-50 (32))recommending the addition of a clause giving power to the Boardof Trade to issue Orders imposingCustoms restrictions on the goods of any foreign country whichexercised discrimination against our goods, whether by way of theimposition of Duties or by theprohibition or restriction of importation, or otherwise.The Cabinet examined the draft Bill Clauseby Clause, and the Chancellor of the Exchequergave explanations on each item.   The main points which arose in the course of these explanations,and the discussion thereon, were as follows.THE TITLE would require alteration on theintroduction of the Discrimination Clauseproposed by the President of the Board of Trade.
Olause 1 (2)(b) was inserted in order toavoid touching existing Duties, such as thoseimposed by the Abnormal Importations (CustomsDuties) Act, the Horticultural Products Act,the Budget Duties, the McKenna Duties, the safeguarding Duties, etc.Olause 8, dealing with the constitution ofthe Advisory Committee, provided in section (l)for not more than five members instead of three,as contemplated by the Cabinet Committee.   Itwas only     proposed  . to appoint three in thefirst instance, but, owing to the amount ofbusiness to be transacted by the Committee andthe possibility of complaints of delay, it hadbeen thought advisable to provide for a larger number, rendering possible the formation of sub-rCommittees TThe period of three years in Clause 2 (2)had been adopted in order to render possible theperiodic changes of personnel in cases where, forexample, a man was past his work, while avoiding any implication of arbitrary changes by theTreasury.    It was explained that the Committeewould include no Officials, but ex-Officialswould not be barred, and their experience mightbe valuable,   The members of the Committee wouldnot be definitely associated either with employers or employed, nor partisan in any respect.   Themembers would, have to give their whole time tothe work and would have to receive a substantialremuneration.The Chancellor - of the Exchequer was notprepared at the moment to discuss ,thequestion of remuneration, but informed the Cabinet that he would bring up aproposal later,
The Chancellor of the Exchequer under-took to look carefully into Clause 2 (6)which provides for power to the Committeeto make rules for regulating its procedure in order to make sure that the wordingwas sufficiently wide to enable it to&quot;set up Sub-Committees,Clause 2 (7).    It was admitted that the powerof demanding production of documents would be unpopular,    It was pointed out that those who wished to derive benefit from the imposition of duties must submit to this absolutely essentialprovision.Olause S (l).    The Chancellor of the Exchequerasked the Cabinet to make a drafting alteration in their copies by the omission of the words inlines 2 and 3 -&quot;to be constituted for thepurposes of this Act&quot;,He pointed out that the Treasury could lower theDuty recommended by the Committee, but could not increase it.Clause 5t (2) enabled the Committee to make a recommendation in regard to luxury articles, aswell as articles being produced or likely withina reasonable time to be produced in the UnitedKingdom.    No definition of a &quot;luxury article&quot;had been deemed necessary.    The Committee in thefirst instance would form its own view as towhether an article was one of luxury or not.The Treasury,  in considering the rate recommended,could reduce it if it considered the article wasnot one of luxury.    Finally, the House of Commons.could exercise its mind on the question of whetherthe article was one of luxury when the Ordercame before it.   There was no limitation as tothe rate of Duty on luxury articles.
The Rate of The Chancellor of the Exchequer expresslyDuties on articles pro- consulted the Cabinet as to the provision indueed or soon to be produced the second paragraph of Clause S (2) that articlestin the Unitedkingdom. produced or likely to be produced in the UnitedKingdom should be subject to a Duty not exceeding25 per cent, of the value of the goods, and considerable discussion took place.In favour of some lower figure it was repre-sented that this would range the United kingdom on the side of low tariff countries.   demands were already being, received from certain indus-tries, e,g. the heavy steel industry, insisting on the need of a high tariff.    The insertion ofa low figure would check this movement.    It waspointed out also that the policy embodied in theBill was a new departure, and it would be a great mistake for this country to jump right into the list of high tariff countries which had done usmuch harm.In favour of the higher figure of 25 percent, it was pointed out that the figure was intended as a maximum which need not necessarily be recommended by the Committee.   a lower figure would be rather far removed from the 33&quot;/^ Pe**cent. Duties already imposed as part of theMcKenna Duties.    It might be that negotiationswith Dominions and foreign countries would resultin a three-decker system of tariffs, with a low rate for the Dominions, a medium rate for lowtariff countries, and a high rate for hightariff countries.   a figure of less than 25 percent, would tend to telescope the range withinwhich such a tariff could, be constructed.
Strcng arguments were adduced in favour ofnot inserting any figure in the Bill and leaving the Committee a free hand as to the raterecommended, bearing in mind that the Treasurycould always reduce the rate.    In favour of thiscourse it was pointed out that if any figure wasinserted, whether 25 per cent, or less, it would immediately invite attention in Parliament to the discrepancy between that figure and the ratesimposed in connection with the McKenna duties and Safeguarding Duties .    If a particular figure,like 25 per cent,, was inserted, the industries concerned would feel they had a grievance ifthey were only allowed a lower rate of Duty.Prom the point of view of negotiations withforeign countries, also, it was thought thatthere would be advantages in not having a fixedmaximum.   The figure of 25 per cent, was certainly not likely to be exceeded in normal practice, butthere might be exceptional cases, connectedpossibly with arrangements concerning some largedumping operation, in which a high rate wastemporarily.desirable/    It was strongly urged also that theClause would be easier to deal with in Parliamentif no figure was inserted.   The experience withthe Horticultural Products Act, where in somecases temporary Duties much higher than 25 percent, had to be imposed, was quoted in favour ofnot inserting a maximum rate, more particularly as under Clause 5 (5) such articles might come within the scope of the Import Duties Act eventual-ally.The President of the Board of Trade, who had felt some doubts as to inserting so high a figureas 25 per cent., after hearing&apos;the discussion
said that if the choice lay between 85 per cent.and omission of a maximum figure he would prefer the latter course.There was general agreement that our policy should be to range ourselves with low-tariff rather than with high-tariff countries, but on the whole itwas thought better not to fetter theindependence of the strong Import duties advisory Committee to be set tip underthe Act.    Prom a Parliamentary point ofview, also, the Cabinet were unanimousthat there were advantages in not insert-ing a figure.    There was general agreement,however, that the Chancellor of theExchequer should explain that, while no limit to the Duties had been inserted,the policy of the Government did not aim at putting on high Duties, and that any interest demanding high Duties would notbe supporting its case with the Government.Clause 5 (5)...   The Chancellor of the Exchequer.asked members to make drafting alterations sothat lines 55 to 59 should read as follows:--&quot;In deciding what recommendation,if any, to make for the purposesof this section in respect of any.article, the Committee shall haveregard to the advisability in thenational interest of restrictingimports&quot;, etc.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained!thatthis Clause had been inserted in order to givethe Committee general guidance as to the grounds on which it should act.   At the request of amember of the Cabinet he undertook to considerwhether it would be desirable or not to includethe necessity for restoring the balance of tradeamong, the reasons.Clause 5 (4). line 16.   The Cabinet were askedto alter the words &quot;appropriate Department&quot; to&quot;Treasury&quot; .Clause 4 (1) .   Dominion Preference.     TheChancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinetthat he wished to give further consideration asto whether the words &quot;on the recommendation of
the Secretary of State&quot; were adequate, since the secretaries of State for the Dominions, for india the attention of the Cabinet was drawn to aprovision in the Finance Act, 1926, Section 7,providing for the continuance of certain Preferencesto the Dominions,  India and the Colonies, of 10per cent, on certain classes of goods, and it wassuggested that this raised a difficulty affectingthis Clause..The Chancellor of the exchequer undertook to look into this point..The Chancellor of the Exchequeralso undertook to look into the phrase &quot;consigned from&quot; a Dominion,to see if it covered goods consignedthrough a foreign port, such asBeira;    he added that he was alsolooking into the precise significance of the phrase &quot;manufactured in&quot;.Clause 4 (2).    For &quot;Northern Rhodesia&quot;put &quot;Southern Rhodesia&quot;.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he was also making further enquiry into the following words in square brackets:  &quot;and any territory inrespect of which a mandate of theLeague of Nations is being exercised by the Government of any Dominion&quot;.Clause 5 (l). Colonial Preference.       TheChancellor of the Exchequer was asked, in his statement, to emphasise the importance of thisClause.In the discussion it was pointed out that theColonies and Mandated Territories would be receiv-ing considerable advantages without necessarilygiving.anything in return, but the importance of colonial development was emphasised.exclude the possibility of a Preference being and for the Colonies were all concerned.of State for the Colonies said he would not as regards- Jfe*t4^e4 Territories,the Secretary
I ft    &amp;7Further Informa-tion required from Traders,.given in the East African Colonies^ thoughTanganyika, being a Mandated Territory, would   .have to be excluded. Sundew CM^dt^M^ offM-i^ 4rAttention was called to the difficult positionof Togoland, which is a Mandated Territory but is without a port of its own and is administeredas an integral part of the Gold Coast Colony.The suggestion was made that it might befound,  in the case of some Colony, that it was desirable to include it within the fiscal regimeof some adjacent Dominion, and that perhaps theClause was too rigid.On the whole, however, it was not considered necessary to alter the Clause.The Cabinet were reminded that in many Coloniesthere was in practice a very high Preference toBritish goods.    It was also pointed out that theeffect of this Clause was that large quantitiesof important raw materials, such as rubber, oils and nuts, would, come in free.The remaining Clauses, which deal with themachinery of the Bill and are mainly of a technical order, were discussed in less detail..The President of the Board of Trade informed the Cabinet that it would be very important thatthe Bill should give power to obtain from tradeand industry information similar to that provided under the Census of Production.    This, he was informed, was not covered by Clause 2 of the Bill.. The President of the Board of Tradeundertook to send particulars to theChancellor of the Exchequer, and thedecision was left to the two Ministers.Clause 9.    &quot;Drawbacks11 .   The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer informed the Cabinet that thisClause required some modification.   It was-9-
necessary to be very careful as to these &quot;Draw-backs&quot;, as, according to experience, they were difficult to work and might be costly.The drafting of the Olause was remitted to the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe President of the Board of Trade,with authority to decide the questionunless they wished further to consult the Cabinet.Clause 15.    Orders of Board,of Trade.The Gabinet were reminded that unless anumber of Orders could be included in a singleResolution of Parliament the procedure of thisClause would involve a great deal of parliamentary time.    It was suggested that the Orders would bemade in succession as they were received from theCommittee, which would rather aggravate this aspect.The Chancellor of the Exchequer was underthe impression that there was nothing to.prevent several Orders being dealt within one Resolution, and that this couldbe arranged.   He undertook to look intothe question.Clause. 14.    Interpretation.The Cabinet agreed that Clause 14 should bere-drafted to show that the Secretary of State forthe Home Department was only involved so far as concerns Northern Ireland, the Channel Islands, andany other territories in which the Home office is especially concerned.The Schedule.   The Chancellor of the Exchequerexplained that the Schedule had not yet been drafted and was only a hasty and incomplete list.Meat and tea, for example, had unaccountably been omitted, and cotton and wool required furtherdefinition,
The Cabinet agreed  (i) To leave the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President ofthe Board of Trade to complete the Schedule and add anything that had been accidentallyomitted *(ii) That malting barley should notbe included.The main reasons for the proposed Discrim-ination Clause are contained in the Presidentof the Board of Traders Memorandum C.P .-50 (32)).Attention was drawn to a recent telegram fromthe British Ambassador in Paris  (No.27) indicating that the prospects of getting the 15 per cent,surtax on British coal removed were receding;and to information in the newspapers that morning to the effect that the British quota, which hadbeen reduced from 80 per cent, to 72 per cent.,was now being further reduced to 64 per cent.,and that our competitors were being allowed to exceed the quotas allotted to them.   The question was raised, therefore, as to whether powers3hould not be taken to impose quotas on theamount of the goods which foreign countries could send to this country.Attention was also drawn to the importance attached by the French to the adverse effectof recent legislation, such as the AbnormalImportations Act and to the risk of a competition between the two countries in measures of retaliation-t ion.The suggestion was also made that it mightbe desirable, before taking any action of thiskind, first to settle what was to be the policy towards the most-favouredonation agreements,
but the Cabinet were informed that it was difficult to settle such a policy without knowingthe views of other nations.   The desirability ofspecial arrangements with the Argentine were also referred to.The Chancellor of the Exchequer expressedthe view that if some arrangement with theArgentine could be effected after the ottawa conference it might be better to provide for it by special legislation,    If this could not bedone under Clause 3 (.2) of the Imports DutiesBill.The Cabinet felt that the question should be discussed in the presenceof the Prime Minister, and the Presidentof the Board of Trade was invited to draft his Clause in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and to circulate it to the Cabinet before thenext Meeting.The Cabinet agreed  That the Imports Duties Bill shouldbe approved for introduction in theHouse of Commons, subject to thefollowing:-(a) A suitable amendment of the title of the Bill in case. - of the introductionof &apos; a   Discrimination Clause:(b) Further consideration by theChancellor of the exchequer of the question of the remuneration of members ofthe Import Duties AdvisoryCommittee^ on which he undertook tobring a proposal before the Cabinet:(c) The probable issue of a white paper to Parliament explaining the cost of the Bill, includingthe remuneration of members ofthe Committee referred to in(b):(d) Examination by the Chancellorof the Exchequer of Clause 2 (6)in order to ensure that its terms were wide enough toenable the Committee to setup Sub-Committees:
(e) Clange 5 (3) .No maximum rate of Duty to beinserted on articles of a kind which are produced, or arelikely within a reasonable timeto be produced, in the UnitedKingdom in quantities which are substantial in relation to UnitedKingdom consumption:     theChancellor of the Exchequer, in introducing the Bill, should explain the reasons for this,and. state that the policy of theGovernment did not aim at highDuties (For further details seeindented Conclusion on p,7);(f) Further consideration by theChancellor of the exchequer of the desirability of including in Clause 3 (3) some referenceto the balance of trade among the factors to be taken into account by the Committee;(g) Further consideration by theChancellor of the Exchequer ofthe words  &quot;Secretary of State&quot;in Clause 4 (l)  (p.4, line 22,of the Bill):(h) Further consideration by theChancellor of the Exchequer asto whether Clause 4 (l) was affected by the Finance Act,1926,  Section 7:(i) Further consideration by theChancellor of the Exchequer ofthe phrase &quot;consigned from andgrown, produced or manufactured in&quot;, in Clause 4 (1)  (Page 4,lines 24 and 25, of the Bill):(j)  Consideration by the Chancellorof the Exchequer of the words in square brackets at the end of clause 4 (2)  of the Bill:(k) The addition of a new Clauseconferring powers to obtain fromtrade and industry informationof.the kind included in the census of Production:    the matter to besettled between the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade:(l) A re-draft of Clause 9, which was left to the Chancellor of theExchequer-, in consultation withthe President of the Board ofTrade: - &apos;&apos;&apos; ^   &apos;     .; &apos;&quot;:(m) Examination by the Chancellor of-  the Exchequer of Clause 13 of theBill with the object of limiting
as much as possible the amount ofParliamentary time that would, haveto be devoted to the approval ofOrders made under the Act:(n) Clause 14 to be re-drafted soas to show that the.Home secretary is only involved so far as concerns. Northern Ireland, the channel islands and any other territories in which the Home Office isespecially concerned:(o) The re-drafting of the Scheduleby the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade; malting barleynot to be included therein:(p) The preparation by the Presidentof the Board of Trade,  in consult-ation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, of a DiscriminationClause or Clauses, which shouldbe submitted to the Cabinet attheir next Meeting, when it was hoped that the Prime minister would be present,The Home Secretary, the President of theBoard of Education and the Secretary ofState for Scotland asked that their dissent from the decision to introduce the ImportsDuties Bill should be recorded.$f The Secretary was asked to ascertain whether the Lord Privy Seal, who was unable to be present, would desire to associate himself with this note ofdis s ent.
3.    The Lord President of the Council said thathe had been asked by the Secretary to raise thequestion of whether Cabinet Minutes and Memorandawere to be sent to Ministers, who would be leavingvery shortly for the Disarmament Conference atGeneva, where they would remain for more or lessprolonged periods.      It was realised that it wouldbe extremely difficult for Ministers to keep intouch with events at home unless they received these documents.      On the other hand there was a certainelement of risk in sending them to Geneva, moreespecially as Cabinet keys would be left at home.Ministers who formed part of the delegation at the Disarmament Conference felt that it would be essential for thern to receive these documents.The Cabinet left it to each Minister tomake appropriate arrangements for ensuring the safety of Cabinet documents at Geneva,  and for their return as soon as they were no longer required.
If.    The Lord President of the Council read tothe Cabinet a note from the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, who was unfortunately unable toattend owing to indisposition.     Recent events at shangai were dealt with as follows:-&quot;Shanghai.    A representative of the JapaneseEmbassy called late yesterday afternoon to say&apos;some drastic action&apos; might be necessary,  inview of the anti-Japanese boycott and attacks on the Japanese.      I enquired what action was contemplated?     Reply - possiblesuppression of headquarters of anti-Japaneseorganisation in the International Settlement.I represented strongly that any action inside the Settlement should be taken if necessary by all Powers jointly and that we could not approve its invasion without consultation.I also referred to the use of the League ofNations.      I sent instructions to Tokio tomake strong representations in a similarsense to the Japanese Government there, andto inform representatives of other Powerswe were doing so.      I also told Lindsay in washington what we were doing so that Mr.Stirnson might know we were co-operating.The action of the Japanese reported into-day&apos;s papers does not involve the Inter-national Settlement;    but it is seriousenough, anyhow.The Cabinet may be surprised to read in&quot;The Times11 of alleged &apos;delay&apos; in communicating
with America..      The explanation is thatLindsay took upon himself not to-&apos;deliver my earlier message,   (it is among the telegrams),  thinking that the situation had so developed as to require a more absolutepromise of co-operation with the united statesof America.      That is a pity:    but we have put it right now..   We have to remember(what America is less concerned with) that japan is  the strongest Power in the far east.    And America always leaves us to dothe difficult work vis-a-vis Japan.      But wecannot afford to upset the United States ofAmerica over this,  and I do not mean to do so.&quot;The First Lord of the Admiralty raised thequestion as to whether naval reinforcements shouldbe sent to Shanghai.     At present there was onlyone large cruiser there.     There were three more .at.Hong-Kong, which could reach ,Shanghai withinabout A8&quot; hours of sailing.The Secretary of State for War reported thatthere were two battalions at Shanghai.     A reliefbattalion was just leaving.      The transport normallytook a week to turn round at Shanghai, andconsequently there would be three battalions in any event for the next week, and the battalion to be relieved could if necessary remain there for atime.The Lord President of the Council saidthat the Cabinet could not take a decision in the matter of   reinforcements in theabsence of the Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, and suggested that theAdmiralty and the War Office should keepin touch with the Foreign Office on thesubject.

The chancellor of the Uixchequer informed theCabinet that the Speaker had technical objectionsto the introduction of the financial resolution inconnection with the Import Duties Bill on Tuesdaynext.      Consequently the Town and Country planning bill would be taken as originally contemplated onTuesdayj February 2nd.     On Wednesday, Februarywould be taken the Motion to take the time of private members;    and if time permitted the Motion approving the Board of Trade Import Order No. 3.Notice had been received of the intentionof the Opposition to introduce a Vote of Censure onthe principle of Collective Responsibility of theCabinet.     The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurywas trying to arrange that this should take placeon Friday, February 5th,The Chancellor of the Exchequer added thathe thought that in the Time-Table too much time hadbeen allowed for the Committee Stage of theresolutions and too little for the Committee stage of the import Duties Bill.
6.    The First Lord of the Admiralty informed theCabinet with deep regret that there was now nohope of rescuing the crew of Submarine M.2.,  andthat The King had sent a message of sympathy toall concerned.The Cabinet expressed the most profoundregret.
