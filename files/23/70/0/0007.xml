CABINET PRO-GEDURE.n%e Principleof collective responsibility(previous reference:Cabinet 6(33) ) ,a.1. The Gabinet discussed the situation whichhad arisen as the result of failure to reach agreement on the Report of the Cabinet Committeeon the Balance of Trade.The Prime Minister impressed on his colleagues the gravity of the position.   Nearly all themembers of the Cabinet had a responsibility forthe appeal to the country, the General Election,and the present position inside and outside ofParliament.   All agreed that the work       theNational Government had been set up to accomplishwas not finished but had really only just begun.He emphasised the important negotiations inprogress with foreign countries; the difficultiesof the position with Prance&apos;and the relations withthe United States of America, which had attaineda friendliness unknown since 1813, He developed the deplorable effects at home and abroad of a collapse of the National Government at a moment when confidence was beginning to reappear, andthere was a recognition that the situation wasbeing gripped.A short discussion revealed the extreme difficulty of achieving- agreement on the basis ofthe Cabinet Committee&apos;s Report on the Balance ofTrade (C.P,-25 (.32)), but that both sides to the controversy shared the Prime Minister&apos;s views asto the deplorable consequences of a break.The Secretary of State for War, who statedthat he had. been much impressed by the large measure of agreement that had been reached by theNational Cabinet under the Prime Minister&apos;chairmanship, made the suggestion that in the
1X i* (Jexceptional circustances of the day some relaxation-tion might be made of the ordinary Cabinet rule of collective responsibility.   His proposal wasthat those who did not find it possible to reconcile their lifelong convictions with therecommendations contained in the Report of themajority of the Committee on the Balance of Trade,should be free to state that they did not agree in the policy of the Government- in this particularmatter and even to vote against it in Parliament.In this connection he recalled a ease during theWar when Lord Carson had been allowed to vote against, the Government&apos;s policy on a particularpoint.   He suggested that the Tariff issue didnot overlap other questions so much that disagree-ment on this one point must force some of themembers of the Cabinet to withdraw their help from the solution of the problems of the national government,   That Government having, by itsformation, provided one new precedent, need notbe afraid of creating a second.The Secretary of State for Foreign affairs read the following note, which he had preparedbefore the Meeting of the Cabinet:-&quot;1. I am deeply concerned aboutthe effects which would follow anywithdrawals from the Cabinet onour influence in Foreign affairs.Everywhere our Ambassadors have reported how greatly the prestige and influence, of Britain have been increased by the spectacle of a united, country and a national government.    It is this which has given us, more than anything else,a new status in American eyes.If the united front was broken, wecannot hope to exert the influence which we should on European problems,and the future of the world at this time depends on these international conferences far more than on anydomestic issue, however important.
3. Granted that the view is sodeeply held by the minority of mycolleagues that the fiscal methodsproposed are mistaken and dangerous,I venture to submit that the issuemust still be faced - what result would be secured by their withdrawal? -/ the result wotild not be to soourecJL    a p-esiea^e**t change in/policy. without/   their moderating influence the result might even be to emphasise it and carry it further.    Some of us who areprepared to acquiesce in methods wedo not like are just as much deter-mined as they are to resist this,but the withdrawal of others weakensrestraining forces.3, Is it not possible then, bypublicly avowing that the overwhelm-ing need for national unity in theworld crisis must be put before anyother consideration, and thatconvinced agreement on this schemeis not the basis upon which we standtogether - to continue to preserve the one overwhelming necessity ofthe time - a National Cabinet withouta break&quot;?After several members of the Cabinet hadappealed for favourable consideration ofthe Secretary of State for War&apos;proposal, a short adjournment took place at 11-30 a,m., during which the lord privy Seal, the Home Secretary, thePresident of the Board of education and. the Secretary of State for Scotlandwithdrew and conferred, together.On refassembling at 11-45 a,n. the PlomeSecretary indicated that the proposal might formthe basis of further co-operation by hiscolleagues and himself, but that he would like todiscuss its effects either in the Cabinet or withthe Prime Minister and Lord President of theCouncil,A discussion then took place on the details and. reactions of the proposal.   While no decisions were taken, the following points were raised, andthe trend of opinion on each is indicated:-
The Electoral position, it was generally understood, would hesomewhat similar to that at therecent General Election;    that isto say, so long as a candidateundertook to support the national government on questions of confidence,he would, be given a good deal of/-u^LxJt- DtJ&quot;u*        1    liberty of view on BolG.noe .of -TyodeIt was suggested that any difficulty that might arise for Cabinet ministers on the Electoral side might be surmounted by restoring the old rule that members of the Cabinet shouldnot speak at By-Elections,Members of the Government who disagreedon Balance of Trade questions would beat liberty to make it clear, inside and outside Parliament, that they did not agree with the proposals of theGovernment and could not take responsi-bility for them.   They would not, however,carry their opposition to the point of conducting a campaign against thepropps als .The Government Whips would not be with-drawn when this class of question came before the House of Commons, but it wassuggested that they should not put pressure on members who desired to go into the Opposition lobby.There is a marked distinction between a challenge to the Government on a vote of Censure and a Resolution opposing aparticular Bill.   When a Vote of Censurewas at issue, Cabinet Ministers wouldbe expected to vote with the Government.It would be a mistake to try and. define tieexact cases in which the new rule would operate.   The occasions would have tobe settled on their merits, and a fewrepresentative cases would soon providethe necessary precedents.w Impressed by the importance of maintaininawity in present world conditions, the cabinet a gr e e a - - N(a) To approve in principle theproposal that some modificationshould be made in the usual practice of collective responsi-bility, and that Ministers whofind themselves unable to supportthe conclusions arrived at by amajority of their colleagues on thesubject of Import Duties and cognatematters, should be at liberty toexpress their view by speech and vote:
(b) That a Cabinet Committee, composed as follows:-The Prime Minister (In the Chair),The Lord President of the Council,The Home Secretary,The Chancellor of the Exchequer,The Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs,The President of the Board ofEducation -should draft an announcement of theabove decision, with authority to publish it without further refer-ence to the Cabinet.(NOTE: The Drafting Committee met immediatelyafter the Cabinet Meeting and prepare the fo11owing Communique:-&quot;The Cabinet has had before it theReport of its Committee on the Balanceof Trade, and after prolonged discussion it has been found impossible to reach a unanimous conclusion on the Committeesrecommendations.   The Cabinet, however, isdeeply impressed with the paramount import-ance of maintaining national unity inpresence of the grave problems that nowconfront this country and the whole world.It has accordingly determined that some modification of usual ministerial practiceis required and has decided that ministers who find themselves unable to support theconclusions arrived at by the majority oftheir colleagties on the subject of ImportDuties and cognate matters are to be at liberty to express their view by speech and vote.    The Cabinet, being essentiallyunited on all other matters of policy,believes that by this special provision itis best interpreting the will of the nation and the needs of the time&quot;.1By decision of the Committee this was published forthwith) .
cabinet procedure.Notes ofDissent.(previous reference:Cabinet 81(31), Con-elusion 6.)2. In view of the decision recorded in thepreceding Minute, the Cabinet agreed  That in the case of discussionsrelating to Balance of Trade,Import Duties and cognate matters,,members of the Cabinet should beentitled to record their dissent from Conclusions of the Cabinet.
THE BALANCEOP TRADE -(previous reference:Cabinet 6(52) .)F.R.3. Following on the discussion   of thematters referred to above in Minutes 1 and 2, cabinet agreed  (a) To approve in principle theReport of the Gabinet Committeeon the Balance of Trade (CP.-25(32)) .The Lord Privy Seal, the HomeSecretary, the President ofthe Board of Education andthe Secretary of State forScotland recorded theirdissent from this decision.(b.) That the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the ministers concerned, should present his proposals, based on the aboveReport, to the Cabinet in a definiteform.
agricultural policy .(previous reference:Cabinet 87(31),  Con-clusion 6.)4. The Minister of Agriculture and. Fisheriesaccepted, a proposal by the Chancellor of theExchequer that the Report of the Cabinet Com-mittee on Agricultural Policy (CP.-SI (32))should be withdrawn from the Cabinet until theChancellor of the Exchequer, as recorded in thepreceding Minute, had submitted his proposals on the Balance of Trade to the Cabinet in adefinite form.   The Report of the agricultural policy Committee:, which overlapped to someextent with questions dealt with in theBalance of Trade Report, could then be re-castbefore being examined, by the Cabinet .
-i.      k)THE ROYAL ARMY 5. The Cabinet had before them a MemorandumCLOTHINGDEPARTMENT. by the Secretary of State for War (C.P.-33 (32))on the subject of the Future of the Royal ArmyClothing Department, proposing, for economic reasons, either to abolish the Factory altogether,or, alternatively, to reduce it to a small factoryof some 200 people for the manufacture of fulldress, the choice depending upon whether the Trade,who have not yet made full dress, could succeed in doing so.    None of the measures proposed in the&apos;Memorandum did more than to anticipate what wouldprobably happen in any event in 1937, and noneinvolved any decrease in national employment, exceptwhat would result from more economic production,^he whole case had been put to the Treasury, whohad approved.The Cabinet approved the above proposal and invited, the Secretaryof State for War to make every possible effort to find employment for labour displaced as theresult, and to communicate theresults of his enquiries tothe Minister of Labour.
