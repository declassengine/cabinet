o JjgP! DISARMAMENTCONFERENCE.(previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Con- -elusion 2.)bXCHINA&apos; AND JAPAN.Events at shangai.(previous reference:Cabinet 16(32), Con-clusion 1.)a1-The Cabinet took note of a Memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs  (CP,-89 (32))containing a short connected account of transactionsat Geneva since Wednesday, February 24th, under thetwo headings (l) The Disarmament Conference; and(2) The Situation in the Far East.The Lord President of the Council took theopportunity to inform the Cabinet that, following on various telephone conversations with the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs at Geneva, the GabinetCommittee on the Par East had met on the previous afternoon to review the situation.   While ho definite conclusions had been reached, the trend of theCommittee&apos;s opinion was summed up in the Minutes ofthe Meeting as follows:-(l) Complete approval of Sir John Simon&apos;sspeech at the Assembly on the previous day:(2) A general realisation that the &amp;e3r*^ianResolution would be embarrassing,though it was felt that the elimination of. the reference therein to Manchuriamight be secured on the ground that thequestion was sub iudice by the LyttonCommission:(3) That Sir John Simon&apos;s attention mightbe drawn to Lord Grey&apos;s speech on theprevious evening, and more particularly to the manner in which, he- had held the scales between China and Japan:(4) A realisation that the hopes of a four-Power Conference at Shanghai werediminishing owing to the new elementsbrought into the discussion by theJapanese, which must clearly be unacceptable to the Americans andprobably to others ,   This was likelyto create further trouble at Geneva:.(5) That it was desirable,  if possible,to limit any Resolution by the Leagueto a reaffirmstion of the principlesof the Covenant.    It was recognised,however, that the attitude of theJapanese might make this impossible,and that much stronger Resolutionswould probably be moved!
(6) That in this latter event it was desirable that Sir John Simon should do his best to avoid aggravation of japan and should not go beyond some such expression as &quot;strong regrets&quot;:(7) That sanctions against Japan were out of the question and would notbe supported in this country.This led to a short discussion by the Cabinet,in the course of which the following points werementioned:-The length of time that the serious situationin the Par East is drawing out, and the inability of the League to find a solution, are exposing theLeague of Nations to criticism, and tending to diminish its prestige., at any rate for the moment.On the other hand, it was generally recognised thatfor the League to threaten or to apply sanctionswhich it could not make effective would be a worsecourse.    In this connection reference was made to aReport prepared by a - Sub-Committee of the,Committeeof Imperial Defence on the effect of economic sanctions on Japan.   The Cabinet were informed that,so far the Report had only been circulated to theCommittee of Imperial Defence, but the Lord Presidentof the Council undertook that the Cabinet shouldreceive copies in the near future.   Reference wasalso made to a Report by the Chiefs of staff committee, the general effect of which was to show how serious the situation would become if theapplication of sanctions led to even graver develop-,ments in the Par East.   The Lord President said he understood it was the Prime Minister&apos;s intentipn to circulate this Report after it had been consideredby the Committee of Imperial Defence.
The suggestion was made that between theextremes of a mere reaffirmation by the League ofthe principles of the Covenant and threats or theapplication of sanctions, there was an intermediatemethod available, namely,  if the facts justifiedit, for the League to state in clear terms its viewthat the Japanese action was reprehensible.    the mobilisation of world opinion, it was suggested, wasthe strongest weapon which the League could bring tobear, and that was probably the motive underlying the strong speeches of the representatives of thesmaller Powers at Geneva.    The insistence of theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs on firstestablishing the facts was generally commended.In the course of the discussion it was suggestedthat there was danger in adopting an attitude ofcondemnation towards one of the parties unless anduntil the Government had made up its mind as to howfar it was prepared to go in following up such an attitude.   Undoubtedly condemnation would be followed,by a demand for some kind of sanctions, and once sucha course was entered on there was no knowing wherea. halt could be called.    In this connection it wassuggested that the sanctions provided for in Article.XVI* of the Covenant had proved throughout a handicapto the League, and more especially tothose nations who might be called upon to apply them.    It was onlythe small Powers, who would not be called upon tomake serious sacrifices, who wanted to employsanctions.^he Secretary of State for Dominion affairs informed the Cabinet that he had s.ent to theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs at Genevaan advance copy of a Memorandum on this subject,
which he hoped before long to circulate to hiscolleagues.The Cabinet were reminded that the weak point about the sanctions was the absence of the UnitedStates  of America from the League.    Article XVIhad been drawn up when it was supposed that theUnited States would become a member.   At presentthey could never be counted on for any form of active co-operation.Subject to the discussion summarised above, the views of the CabinetCommittee met with the general assent of the Cabinet.
$ K 96 Joh NEW HEBRIDES,        2. The Cabinet had before them a Joint Memorandum(previous by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and reference:Cabinet 44 the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP .-87 (32))(30), Oon-clusion 5.)       containing full particulars of the present positionof the New Hebrides Condominium, covering the Reportof an Inter-Departmental Committee, and inviting theCabinet to agree  (i) That, in view of the material change in circumstances sincethe Imperial Conference of 19 30,unless a particularly opportuneoccasion for reopening the matter should occur sooner, the questionof approaching the French Govern-ment for the purpose of terminating the British-French Condominium inthe New Hebrides be postponed untilearly in 1934, by which time it ishoped that the joint administrationmay again be self-supporting;    and(ii) ^hat the Commonwealth and New zealand governments be informed accordingly,and at the same time acquainted withthe substance of the Inter-DepartmentalReport annexed to the Memorandum.In the course of a short discussion thesuggestion was made that the question might bediscussed at the&quot; Ottawa Conference with representa-tires of Australia and New Zealand, but the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs was asked, if thiscourse was to be adopted,  to notify the Dominionsconcerned beforehand that the matter would beraised.The Cabinet approved the recommenda-tions of the Secretary of State forDominion Affairs and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies summarised above.

The Gabinet were informed that the Report ofthe Law Officers had not yet been received,  and thatthe question of the Proposed Preference to Palestinecould not be proceeded with at this meeting.      Itwas hoped that the Report would be ready before thenext meeting of the Cabinet.
INDIA .Situation in./previous reference:Cabinet 15(32), Con-elusion 14.)if.   The Cabinet took note of Reports by theLocal Governments on the Political Situation inIndia, eirculated by the Secretary of State(CP.-88 (32)) .The Secretary of State for India informed the Cabinet that he had received further reports from India, which he was about to circulate, andwhich were,  in some respects, not quite sosatisfactory as the one referred to above.     he gave full particulars.      He also informed theCabinet that active progress was being made onthe constitutional side of Indian affairs.      the consultative Committee had held a series of meetings at Delhi on questions left over from the RoundTable Conference, without making any seriousprogress.     No attempt had been made to reach decisions on controversial questions, and thetendency had been to refer them back to thiscountry.      The Parliamentary Under-Secretary, IndiaOffice, wrote hopefully about the work of his committee.      The Committee on the Indian states was divided up into Sub-Committees, which were examining the grievances of the various States,Lord Eustace Percy&apos;s Committee was hard at work at Delhi on the financial aspects referred to it.In the meantime the Lord Chancellor was gettingahead with the work of a Committee of Expertssitting in the India Office from day to day, andwhen the right point was reached it might benecessary to refer certain questions to theCabinet Committee and,  if necessary, with their comments, to the Cabinet,      The number of arrestsin India was tending towards reduction.      In any event the total number^ approximating 15,000,was only about a quarter of the number on the&apos; -7-    . &quot; \-&quot;-&apos;
last occasion of trouble in that country,      One of thetroublesome matters was a demand, from Moslems atDelhi for an immediate decision by the Prime minister on the communal question.      It was at present consideredpremature to contemplate such a decision until theMarquis of Lothian&apos;s Committee had completed its tour andthe collection of evidence, which would not.be before april or May,Among other matters mentioned by the Secretaryof State for India were the satisfactory budget speech in India,  and the arrest of a medical, missionary,in connection with which the Government of Madrasacknowledged that a mistake had been made.-   &apos;
ICOMMITTEEyaCURRENCY.QUESTIONS.(previous Reference:! Cabinet 3jCon-conclusion J).The Cabinet agreed -That the Secretary of State for india should be added to the CabinetCommittee on Currency Questions,
iousrence:met 79, Con-ion 17)6.    The Secretary of State for the Colonies informed the Cabinet that the Greek Admiral and politicianKonduriotis had sent a circular to every Member ofParliament on the question of Cyprus, in the course ofwhich he made a number of charges against the Army and navy, which the Secretary of State believed to bebaseless.      Hitherto &quot;Questions in the House of commons had been damped down, on the ground that His majesty&apos;s government could not be responsible for statements by a foreign national.      In some shape or form, however,the question was nearly sure to be raised in the Houseof Commons in the near future.      The Secretary ofState had already placed in the Library of the House ofCommons a Report on the recent troubles by theChief Justice of Cyprus,     He had now received a full report from the Governor, the publication of which hewas considering,      There was only one allegation which appeared to have any foundation.      The Governor had made a preliminary enquiry into this case, which affected a Forestry Officer, and had proposed totake no action.      The Secretary of State, however, had insisted on an enquiry under the Colonial Jie^iplino Aot.The report had not yet been received,, bu4-44-&quot;Weuidp^ao&amp;afei-y-^g-e^-^^ TThe Secretary of State reported that he wasin touch with the Foreign Office on the question of possible representations to the Greek Government onthe subject of Admiral Konduriotis&apos;s circular.     he paid a tribute to. the irreproachable attitude ofM. Venizelos.-1 0-
,jrB IRISH 7. The Secretary of State for Dominion AffairsigRF- STATE,informed the Cabinet that according to the latestPrevious information Mr de Valera had come to terms with the reference:Cabinet 16 Irish Free State Labour Party on the question of the(32), Con-elusion 3,) Oath.   At present Mr de ValeraTs own Party were takingp^, the Oath provided for in the Treaty, with the reserva-S%H&quot;i. tions he had mentioned in his Memorandum (C-P.-86(32)).    The question would be raised in the Dail thesame evening, and he understood that Mr Cosgrave wouldchallenge Mr de Valera on the question of the legisla-tion contemplated to abolish the Oath,as beingcontrary to the Treaty.   He undertook to keep theCabinet informed of the development of events.-11-
313 3GOVERNMENT 8.   The Lord President of the Council informedBUSINESS.the Cabinet that the Prime Minister was anxious  to(Previous end the Parliamentary Session rather earlier in the reference:Cabinet 10 summer than had hitherto been contemplated.   This was(52), Con-elusion 5.)       rendered desirable by the fact that Conferencesrequiring the attendance of Ministers might be takingplace simultaneously at Geneva, Lausanne and Ottawa.His idea was, if possible,,to get Parliament up by july 10th.    Prom many points of view a long Recesswas desirable, and more especially because there hadbeen only a very short Recess last year.   PossiblyParliament might meet again for a new Session inNovember.    In order that the matter might be further considered by the Cabinet before Easter he askedMinisters to examine carefully the Bills emanating from their respective Departments, with a view to establishing which were essential during the present session and which could be postponed until next session.2. whitehall Gardens.
