JUDGES&apos; 1.    At the request of the Lord President of the salaries-.Council, the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained(previous to the Cabinet the very difficult and embarrassingReference:Cabinet 10       position which had arisen in connection with the(32), Con-elusion 1.)      question of Judges&apos; Salaries.ft,On the recent occasion when a Deputation hadbeen received by the Prime Minister, the Judges had stated that they were not so much concerned with theactual reduction in their emoluments as with themaintenance of their Constitutional position;    theyquestioned the legality of the National Economy Act,19 31, so far as it applied to themselves;    it was represented that certain individtials were so seriously affected by the actual reductions as to be contemplat-ing retirement or possibly a return to the Bar.   Thiswould be deplorable from every point of view, andthe Deputation had urged that the Judges should be definitely freed from the Act and left to make suchvoluntary contributions as they might think fit inthe present emergency.   The Deputation had beeninformed (as was then thought to be the case) thatit was within the power of the Government to refrain from insisting on a reduction in their remuneration,and,as the result of discussions on this assumption,complete agreement had been reached on the basis that the Judges would make a voluntary surrender of20 per cent, of their remuneration for one year.The question of Income Tax and Super Tax had then been raised, and he (the Chancellor of the Exchequer)had assured the Deputation that any technicaltaxation difficulty arising from the fact that thereduction was a voluntary one would be got over, ifnecessary, by the insertion of specific provisions in the forthcoming Finance Bill.
On the eve of an announcement of the settlement which had been reached, he (Mr Chamberlain) had been advised that, the Government had no discretionwhatever in this matter, that the combined effect ofthe Economy Act and the Order in Council made there-under had been to reduce the salary of a Judge from 5,000 to  4,000 per annum, and that the comptroller and Auditor General, who is entirely independent ofHis Majesty/s Government, was bound to see that payment was made at the latter rate by reason of thestatutory requirement of Section 13 of the Exchequerand Audit Departments Act, 1866, under which hecould grant credits for services charged on the consolidated Fund only &quot;if satisfied of the correct-ness thereof&quot;.    In these circumstances the Lav;Officers had been asked to advise on the following,questions:-(I) Whether the National Economy Act,19 31, is framed in- sufficientlywide terms to enable an Order inCouncil made thereunder to vary the judges&apos;  salaries;    and(2)  If so, whether the National Economy(Statutory Salaries) Order madeunder that Act has effectively made such a variationThe Law Officers had given an Opinion answeringboth questions in the affirmative,    (For this opinion, which was subsequently read to the CabinAby the Solicitor-General, see Appendix I.). The Chancellor of the Exchequer added that theLord President of the Council and himself had explained this new development to the Master ofthe Rolls, who had expressed great concern at what he suggested would ,be regarded by the Judges as anattempt by the Government to go back on the recentagreement.   He (Mr Chamberlain) had, however, made it clear to Lord Hanworth that he had never
contemplated any special legislation other than apossible clause in the Finance Bill to deal withthe taxation difficulty.    It was clear that thepresent arrangement, as settled by the Economy Actand the Order in Council, could only be altered inthe way desired by the Judges by legislation.    such legislation must, however, inevitably raise thewhole  quiestion of all the cuts imposed last autumnon large categories of persons, including membersof the Fighting Services, Teachers, Police, andrecipients of Unemployment Benefit.    He (Mr Chamberlain)could not see how it was possible to contemplate anysuch solution.    On the other hand, he understood thatin the absence of legislation the Government mightbe faced with the resignation of a number of the judges, and. with difficulty in filling the vacancies.^he Lord Chancellor warned the Cabinet that theposition was a very grave and difficult one.    He wasfaced with the resignation of six, or possibly more,Judges .    If this happened it would be very difficultto find men suitably qualified who would be preparedto accept the vacant offices.   The Judges contended that an agreement had been reached which should be fully and honourably observed.    Their complaint wasnot that their salaries had been reduced, but thattheir status and prestige in the eyes of the publichad been lowered.    Two of the Judges were oontemplat-ing presenting a. Petition of Right, but it was very doubtful whether, in the circumstances, there was any tribunal which could try the Petition.   He was satisfied that no Judge would try the case, awA. theLew Lei1 tla. woro umrimnn0 in the view tbnt the nutsac applied       thr &quot;-*^-&quot;y &quot;rt1&quot;n -m^rra-l.    He had represented to the Judges as strongly as possible
that they should accept the situation, but they were convinced that by their action they were upholdinga great Constitutional principle and were determined to maintain their position, however unpopular theirattitude might be.    In the circumstances he (the LordChancellor) felt that the best course would be forthe Government to carry out their arrangement withthe Judges .The Lord President of the Council informed theCabinet that in his view, with which the parliamentary secretary to the Treasury was in full agreement, itwould be impossible to pass the necessary legislationthrough the House of Commons.   He doubted whetherthe Judges realised the extent to which they wouldalienate public opinion if they maintained theirpresent attitude.The Secretary of State for War thought that the judges had a very real grievance.   Their emolumentshad not been altered during a century, and, iftaxation were taken into account, they were receivingvery little for very valuable services rendered.The emphasis laid on the independence of the judiciary was a very real point.   The Judges honestlythought that the action which had been takeninflicted a deadly blow to their prestige.    It wouldbe an impossible position if a number of Judgesresigned and if it was found impracticable, owingto the absence of a tribunal,to determine the point raised on a Petition of Right.    It must be rememberedthat the great majority of the Judges had had no political experience and did not in the leastunderstand or appreciate the Parliamentary diffi-culties.   The return to active practice at the Barof a number of Judges would create a. situationunparalleled in recent history,   ^his action would-4-
undoubtedly inflict very great harm on individualJudges and on the great office that they held.   he agreed, in thinking that the Lord Chancellor wouldbe unable to find persons fully qualified to fill the vacancies who would be prepared to acceptJudicial office.   Unless the very best men could beobtained the whole judicial standard would belowered and a very severe blow struck at a vitally important part of the Constitutional machinery.Lord Hailsham fully agreed that the difficulties ofsecuring the passage of special legislation were probably insuperable.   He suggested, however, thatit might be possible to insert a provision in theFinance Bill for removing the doubts which certainlyexisted as to the applicability of the national economy Act to the Judges.    In all the circumstances he had come to the conclusion that it was not unreasonable that the doubts should be resolved inthe Judges&apos;  favour, on the understanding,  of course,4 that they would maintain their agreement to make a voluntary reduction for the year.The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the.Cabinet that he had made enquiries as to thepossibility of inserting a provision in the finance bill on the lines suggested by the Secretary ofState for War.    Parliamentary Counsel had consulted the authorities of the House of Commons, who had given a most emphatic reply in the negative. -&apos; The general view of the Cabinet was that itwould be quite out of the question to attempt todeal with this matter either by special legislation or by inserting a provision in the Finance Bill.The suggestion was made that Judges should be leftto bring their Petition of Right, and that,-5-
failing an ordinary tribunal, some special tribunal,such as a Committee of the Privy Council., should be offered.    It was stated, however, that it was most improbable that the Judges would consent to the petition being tried otherwise than in the-ordinary course.   Another suggestion, that legislatioh mightbe introduced and left to a free vote of the House,did not commend itself to the Cabinet.In the course of a full discussion emphasis was laid on the very serious reactions which action by the Judges of the kind in contemplation wouldhave on the Armed Forces, the Police, Teachers and inother directions.    If the Government accepted the contention of the Judges it would be politically impossible to maintain the present position inregard to other cuts.    In this connection special reference was made to the disastrous financial andpolitical effects of a concession on such matters as Unemployment Benefit and the maintenance of the&quot;means test&quot; in the case of Transitional Benefit.At the end of the discussion the Secretary ofState for Scotland informed the Cabinet that, atthe request of the Prime Minister, he had seen theLord President of the Court of Session and had informed him of the arrangement which had been reached withthe English Judges .    He had since been informedthat the Scottish Judges had unanimously,agreed toaccept the arrangement in question.    As thisarrangement had now broken down,  it would benecessary for the Secretary of State again tocommunicate with Lord Clyde.The Cabinet agreed  (a) That any proposal for dealing withthe difficulty which has arisen inconnection with Judges&apos;  Salaries,whether by way of special ad hoc
legislation or the insertion of aprovision in the Finance Bill,must be rejected:(b) To request the following ministers to confer with a Deputation of the judges in the Prime Minister&apos;s Room,Rouse of Commons,  on Monday, February15th, 1932, at 6.0 p.m.:-The Lord.

BRAWLING IN the moray FIRTH ANDFIRTH OF CLYDE.(previous reference:Cabinet 23(25), Con-elus ion 9 .)2. The Cabinet had before them the following documents on the subject of Trawling in the MorayFirth and Firth of Clyde:-A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (CP.-35 (32))summarising the history and thepresent position of the questionof trawling in the Moray Firthand Firth of Clyde, and containing the following recommendation:-&quot;To endeavour to conclude withthe Powers concerned a Conven-tion requiring, foreign fishermento observe the restrictions forthe time being applied by HisMajesty&apos;s Government to Britishfishermen in the Moray Firthand Firth of Clyde&quot;:A Memorandum by the First Lord ofthe. Admiralty (CP.-37 (32)) pointing out that the other countries con-cerned would not agree to this con-cession withotit demanding valuablecounter concessions, and suggesting that our representatives must be carefully instructed not only to resist proposals injurious to theinterests of the British trawlerindustry, which from a nationalpoint of view are more important than those of the Scottish inshorefishermen, but also proposals inany way compromising our nationalresistance to attempts to extend the limits of territorial waters:A Memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries (CP.-42(32)) pointing out a number ofobjections to the course proposedby the Secretary of State forScotland:A Memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (CP.-55(32)) suggesting that the time hascome when it is necessary, in the wide interests of this country, thatthe Moray Firth should be thrown opento all trawlers without restriction,within the limits laid down by theNorth Sea Convention:    that the invitation of the Netherlands Govern-ment to attend a Conference for the revision of the North Sea convention should be accepted;    and that, inter alia, arrangements should be made atthe Conference for the better protec-tion of nets, which would be ofconsiderable assistance to the MorayFirth fishermen:
A Note by the President of theBoard of Trade (CP.-59 (32))expressing agreement with the memoranda of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Ministerof Agriculture and Fisheries, andemphasising the impossibility of agreeing to any proposal whichwould support in any way theextension of the territorial waterslimit beyond three miles .THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND reminded the Cabinet of the vital importance to the local fishing industry of securing the exclusion of foreign trawlersfrom the Moray Firth,     While it was impossible for anySecretary of State for Scotland to give up the views onthe legal position set out in his Memorandum, he was prepared to accept the compromise set out in paragraph5 (c) of that document, which, in his opinion, avoidedthe objections which had been raised by the Minister ofAgriculture and Fisheries and the President of the Boardof Trade.In the course of discussion the Cabinet werewarned of the very serious consequences to the Britishtrawling industry which would result if foreign countriesclaimed to exclude their trawlers from fishing groundssuch as the White Sea for reasons comparable with thoseurged in the case of the Moray Firth.     Any attempt on our part to persuade foreign Governments to force theirfishermen to observe the restrictions imposed on Britishfishermen in the Moray Firth would undoubtedly raise foreigncounter claims, acceptance of which would be in the highestdegree detrimental to the British trawling industry^
The view was expressed, that the present position was undoubtedly indefensible in as much as fishing byBritish vessels was prohibited., while foreign vessels were allowed to fish in the waters in question.    In viewof its value as a breeding ground,  there should be no real difficulty in securing at the proposed InternationalFishery Conference that the Moray Firth area should betreated as a breeding ground from which all trawlers,British and foreign, must be excluded.While the Cabinet favoured United Kingdom partici-pation in the proposed Conference,  it was felt that thepolicy suggested by the Secretary of State should not bemade an essential condition of such participation, butthat the Secretary of State should be at liberty to ask that the subject should be placed on the Agenda for theConference.The Cabinet agreed  (l) that His Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the invitation to participate in the International Conference proposedby the Netherland Government:(S) that while the Secretary of State forScotland should be at liberty to suggest to the Netherland Government the additionto the Agenda for the Conference of thequestion of requiring foreign fishermento observe the restrictions for the timebeing applied by His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto British fishermen in the Moray Firthand the Firth of Clyde, British partici-pation in the proposed conference shouldnot be made conditional on the acceptancein principle of this policy:(5) that in view of the differences of opinionon this question, arrangements should bemade to provide for separate representation at the Conference of England and Wales and scotland respectively.
ADMISSION OPFOREIGNMUSICIANSAND OTHERS for employment INTHIS COUNTRY.(previous reference:Cabinet 17(29), Con-clusion 8.)3,       The Cabinet had before them a Memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (CP .-57 (32)), circulated in view of recent discussions in the Press, inorder to give the Cabinet information as to thepresent practice of the Ministry of Labour inissuing permits to employers in this country forthe engagement of foreigners in the entertainmentsindustry.It was explained in the Memorandum that apart from the restriction in the case of concertmusicians referred to therein, no change at all had been made in the policy of the late Governmentin regard to the admission of foreign artistesfor purposes of entertainment.   There had been no change in any other sphere, except in regardto foreign domestic servants.     In view of the much larger number of trained domestic servantsavailable in this country, employers who wish tobring in a foreigner are now? pressed much more strongly than before to show that they have madeserious attempts to meet their requirements from the home supply.The Memorandum also stated that since last September there has been a large increasein the number of foreign firms applying forpermits for foreign workmen to help in establishing factories in this country.   Thepractice of the Ministry of Labour is to treatsuch applications liberally, subject tofulfilment of conditions such as the trainingof British Labour.
The Cabinet were assured that the arrangements were working satisfactorily in all respects.The Cabinet took note of theMinister of Labour&apos;s Memorandum and approved the arrangements for the engagement of foreigners summarisedtherein.
THE IMPORTDUTIES BILL.Time Table forClosureResolution.(PreviousreferenceCabinet11 (52)Conclusion 2)4. THE CHANCELLOR OP THE EXCHEQUER read tothe Cabinet his proposals for the Time table for the Closure Resolution on the Import DutiesBill, under which 4-g- days would be given to theCommittee stage and 1 day to Report and third reading.The suggestion was made that in view ofthe importance of the Schedule of Exemptions, onewhole day (Wednesday, 24th February) of theCommittee stage should be given to the Schedules,new clauses being taken spfc 10.30 on Tuesday,February 23rd.The Cabinet agreed  To approve the Time Table for the closure Resolution en the ImportDuties Bill proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer,subject to the above amendment.Note.     For the Time Table as adoptedby the Cabinet see Appendix II.
INDIA..SITUATION IN9 9   +   9*5. The Cabinet took note flf a Memoran.dumby the Secretary of State for India (paper cp, 68 (32)) covering the latest weeklyreports from the Local Governments in India.(previous reference cabinet 12 (32)Conclusion 16).2, Whitehall Gardens,  S.W.1,February 11, 19 32,
APPENDIX I.ECONOMY ACT,  195IXJUDGES SALARIES.OPINIONOP THE LAW OFFICERS OF THE CROWN..In our opinion &quot;both these questions must be answered in the affirmative.The crucial points are whether the Judges are,in the words of the Act, &quot;persons in His Majesty&apos;s service&quot;,and whether, in the words of the Order, the salary of a judge is a &quot;salary to be paid in respect of any office inHis Majesty1s Service&quot;.It has been suggested, if we understand the argument aright, that the Act of Settlement which gave the judges security of tenure while of good behaviour made them&quot;independent guardians of a supreme law&quot;, and therefore not servants of the King (see Professor Sir WilliamHouldsworth, Law Quarterly Review, vol XLVIII, No. 189,page 29).We have difficulty in appreciating the nature ofthe position which it is suggested the Judges have in relationto the King.    If, as we are ef opinion, the Judges wereservants of the King before the Act of Settlement, when theywere dismlssable at the King*s pleasure, they are none theless so now &quot;because the Crown has &quot;been party to a statutorybargain that they are entitled to hold office so long as theyare of good behaviour &quot;subject to a power of removal by HisMajesty on an address presented to His Majesty by both houses of Parliament.&quot;    (Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation)
Act, 1925, Section 12.) ,A consideration of the Promissory OathsAct. 1868, In our opinion strongly supports thisview.    The Ministers and other officers of State inthe First Part, and the Judges in the Second Part ofthe Schedule are obliged, as a condition of acceptingtheir office, to take, in addition to the oath of allegiance, the official or the judicial oathrespectively.     Both sets of persons are described in the body of the statute as officers;   and bothoaths contain the material words &quot;well and truly toserve&quot; (the Grown) &quot;in the office of&quot; e.g. Master ofthe Horse or Master of the Rolls.This seems to us to show clearly that in amatter directly affecting their status Parliamentregarded Ministers and Judges alike as servants ofthe King,In our opinion the Judges are &quot;persons inHis Majesty&apos;s service&quot;, and their office is an&quot;office in His Majesty&apos;s service&quot;.T.W.H.
